The Halfway House—strange name for a building that isn’t halfway anything, and definitely not a house.

Maybe it *used* to be. A roadside lodge, perhaps, for those traveling between Nowhere and Somewhere. The kind of place you’d pull into when your radiator gave out on a two-lane highway and your map blew out the window.

There are still photographs in the lobby, curling in their frames, showing guests smiling stiffly in front of a clapboard house with a porch that wraps all the way around. Fields behind them, green and wide. All gone now, paved over to make way for the uncompromising expansion of human innovation. High-rises, strip malls, gas stations.

The old Victorian bones, the heart of the Halfway House, were torn apart to make room for the monstrosity that stands in its place today—a 70s-era brutalist affront, a slab of concrete and rusted pipes. Still, it clung to its old name like an aging drag queen clutching her tiara, pretending the lights on stage hadn’t dimmed decades ago.

The ‘house’ part was inaccurate. But *halfway*—that part, I’d come to understand, was dead on.

I showed up at the Halfway House on November 17th, 1996. My first real memory is of the lobby: thin brown carpet worn bald in patches, water-damaged ceiling tiles betrayed by the procession of blossoming mould, and a smell that lived between mildew and old soup.

The receptionist didn’t look up when I walked in, juggling two cardboard boxes and walking blind, entirely incapable of peering over the top. He made no move to assist, even as I crab-walked awkwardly towards him, bright red in the face. Just sat there behind the desk, reading a glossy magazine with a pair of smudged half-moon glasses perched on the end of his nose.

‘Hello,’ I panted, stooping to place the boxes carefully on the floor. ‘I’m Robin.’

The receptionist lowered the magazine *‘The Third Hour: All the time in the world’* and turned startling blue eyes towards me. He had the ageless face of someone you can’t place—could’ve been thirty, could’ve been seventy. There was no way of telling without asking, and that’s just not something you did.

‘Robin,’ he echoed.

‘Robin Toohey. My social worker, Hannah, she said she called ahead—’

‘Ah, yes,’ he replied and bent to rummage through a drawer for a moment, before emerging with a thin manila envelope. He flipped through its contents silently, until he gave a small, satisfied *‘aha’* and slid a single paper form and a brass key across the counter.

‘If you could just sign here to confirm you’ve picked up the key,’ he prompted.

I took the pen and scrawled my name in the messy block letters of someone who never finished school. I gave him a smile—felt weird, but I was determined to turn over a new leaf. He responded with a look—not unkind, but definitely not *kind*—and the corners of his mouth twitched into something that looked like sympathy.

‘So,’ he said, getting to his feet and stepping out from behind the counter. He was short, his black trousers and button-down heavily creased and slightly musty, as though he’d forgotten he was working that day and sourced them from the bottom of a laundry basket. ‘What’d you do to end up in this place?’

He didn’t wait for my reply, just bent down to pick up one of my boxes and set off in the direction of an elevator, a dingy flickering light reflecting off its battered chrome surface.

‘What do you mean?’ I asked, hurriedly bending over to scoop up the remaining box and trotting after him. ‘What did I *do?’*

‘Yeah,’ he said, lifting one leg and jabbing the elevator button with the worn toe of a scuffed loafer, his hands still full with my box. The button let out a reluctant ding, sharp and tinny, followed by the groan of ancient pulleys grinding somewhere in the guts of the building. ‘Nobody ends up here ‘cause they wanna be.’

I glanced around the lobby as we waited, and the longer I stood there, the more I understood where he was coming from. It wasn’t just the sagging ceiling tiles or the buzzing lights; it was something deeper, something baked into the concrete like a stain that wouldn’t come out. The Halfway House had the defeated air of a place that had given up trying.

‘I guess I messed around too much,’ I admitted. ‘Could never take anything seriously, so my parents kicked me out. I’m trying to get it together, booked in for some night classes. Accounting. This place is just temporary.’

‘Uh-huh,’ replied the receptionist in a tone that suggested he’d heard it all before. ‘Well, you’re in good company.’

‘This place full of degenerates, huh?’ I asked with a valiant attempt at a chuckle. The decent thing would’ve been to protest my self-flagellating quip, but instead he just turned to me and give a pointed raise of his eyebrows.

‘Well, that remains to be seen.’

The elevator opened with a reluctant *ding*. We stepped inside. The space was barely large enough for the two of us. The walls were metal, scuffed and streaked with rust. There was graffiti scratched into the surface in jagged loops: names, numbers, a few slurs, and a total of six floors you could choose from. At the bottom was a single buttonlabeled*B1*, the sticker half-peeled.

The fifth floor button lit up under his thumb.

‘Got a name?’ I asked awkwardly as we began our ascent.

‘No,’ he said. The silence was instant and airtight.

*Ding.* The elevator shuddered to a stop, and the doors began to creak open—only to hesitate, then slowly inch shut again.

‘This way,’ the receptionist muttered, jamming his foot between them and kicking the doors apart with a practiced sort of violence. He shouldered his way out without a glance back.

I followed, wedging myself through the narrow gap, the box in my arms bumping the frame. *He’s an asshole,* I decided.

The hallway beyond was just as cheerless as the lobby—maybe worse. A jaundiced row of ceiling bulbs cast everything in sickly yellow light, and the carpeting, a mottled weave of brown and mustard, smelled faintly of mildew.

We walked all the way to the end of the hall, stopping in front of a door the colour of dried blood, its patinaed brass plaque reading simply: **9**.

‘Here were are—oh, for gods sake,’ the receptionist muttered, looking down.

I was ahead of him in this, as I was already shifting from foot to foot, listening to the thick carpet squelch beneath my feet. It was wet.

The receptionist unceremoniously dumped my box on the ground, then took two side-steps across the narrow corridor and rapped sharply on the neighboring door, number 10. The numbers hung crooked on their plate, one screw missing, so the whole thing dangled.

After a few seconds, the door creaked open. A pale, mousey woman poked her head through the gap, her hair limp, her expression soft and automatically apologetic—as if she’d been born sorry.

‘The kids are asleep,’ she whispered, voice feather-light. Her eyes flicked to me, and a faint smile surfaced. ‘Oh—hello! Are you my new neighbour?’

‘Hi!’ I said, trying to peer past the receptionist. ‘I’m—’

‘Ms. Reid, the carpet is wet again,’ he interrupted, cutting a sharp look in her direction.

‘What? No—I fixed it! Just a few days ago, I swear!’ Her eyes darted down to the sodden carpet and her face fell. ‘I haven’t noticed any—’

‘Get this sorted, Ms. Reid,’ the receptionist snapped, cold and final. ‘I won’t have disorder in the Halfway House.’

The way he said it—*disorder*—like it was a slur, made my jaw tighten.

‘Shouldn’t that be… I mean, if it’s the plumbing, isn’t that the building’s responsibility?’ I asked, feeling my voice grow small even as I pushed forward. ‘That’s… like, tenant law, right?’

They both looked at me. The receptionist’s expression didn’t shift, but the temperature in the hall dropped.

‘This isn’t the sort of problem a plumber can fix,’ he said, eyes still locked on Ms. Reid. ‘The solution lies with *you*.’

Then he turned to me, his face suddenly sunny with false civility. ‘Ready to go inside?’

Before I could answer, he turned and walked back to door 9.

Ms. Reid lingered in her own doorway, her shoulders slumped, toes turned inward like a chastised schoolkid. I gave her a look that was meant to be sympathetic but probably came off more like a grimace. She returned it in kind, then gave a limp wave and closed the door softly behind her.

The receptionist waited while I fished the key out of my back pocket, my box balanced precariously on one knee. After a fumbling few seconds, the lock gave way with a sticky click and I pushed the door open.

The apartment was a one-bed, one-bath unit. Small. It might have been charming once, maybe even cozy—thirty or forty years ago. Now it just looked tired. The wallpaper was yellowing at the seams, curling outwards at parts and exposing grey stone beneath. The carpet was the same as the hallway, minus the wet squish, but heavy with the scent of dust and stale air.

‘Well,’ I said, trying and failing to muster some optimism. ‘It’s not too bad.’

‘Give it time,’ replied the receptionist with a little smile. ‘Now, you’ve met Ms. Reid, she lives opposite. She had two children, but I wouldn’t worry, they don’t make too much noise. Directly beside you is Dale Hewitt. Happy for a chat, that one. Been here for a while—most people come and go, cycle through—not Dale. A Halfway veteran, he likes to call himself. If you have any questions, he’s your guy.’

‘Aren’t I better off just heading down to the front desk?’ I asked, the idea of approaching a man I’d never met for basic and potentially unwelcome queries an uncomfortable thought.

‘Why would that be better?’

‘Well, so I could ask *you*.*’*

‘I’m a receptionist, Robin, not a building manager,’ he gave my kitchen bench an anticipatory *ratta-tat-tat*. ‘Now then,’ he said, ‘all sorted?’

‘Uh,’ I said, the litany of questions I had stored in my brain annoyingly absent now that I needed them. I supposed there was always tomorrow. ‘No, I’m good.’

The receptionist nodded and headed for the door.

‘Thank you,’ I added to his retreating back.

The receptionist lingered a moment too long in the doorway, his hand resting lightly on the frame. He didn’t look around the apartment. He didn’t offer a ‘not a problem’ or a ‘good luck.’ Just stood there, backlit by the dim hallway light, as if considering whether to say something else.

Then he nodded once, absently, like he’d settled a private thought, and left. I kicked the door shut behind him. The apartment swallowed the sound.

I set my box down on the cracked kitchen counter and stretched the ache from my arms. The light switch fought back with a reluctant *click*, and the kitchen light buzzed on.

Unpacking didn’t take long. Two boxes—my whole life whittled down to cardboard. A Bible, bound in old leather with a spine worn soft as fabric. Pots and bowls, forks and spoons. Some clothes, mostly thrifted. A chipped mug. A bar of luxury soap wrapped in wax paper I’d smuggled out of a gift shop.

And a picture frame I wrapped in a dish towel, careful not to let the glass crack. I sat it upright on the edge of the counter. Didn’t look at it. Just let it face the room, like a quiet witness.

The bedroom was empty but for the mattress, already in place, no sheets. I spent some time unpacking and refolding what little I had in the way of manchester, making the bed and putting the rest away in the cupboard. By the time I was finished the light outside was beginning to dim, the sun disappearing behind a neighbouring high rise that I figured would block the sun for the better part of the day. *Naturally*.

The bathroom mirror had warped around the edges, like water had gotten in behind the glass and tried to melt the reflection. I turned the tap on. Water gurgled and spat out in thick brown spurts. Then cleared.

I filled the sink and splashed my face. That’s when I smelled it.

Gasoline.

Not strong, not enough to panic—just enough to wrinkle my nose. I checked the stove. Electric coils. No pilot light, no gas line that I could see. I even opened the cabinets, half-expecting to find a leaking can. Nothing. I sniffed my sleeve. Nothing there, either. Just in the air.

*It happens,* I thought. Old building. Probably soaked into the walls.

Eventually, I decided I couldn’t go another day in the same clothes. I’d been sleeping in bus stops for the better part of a week, and even the half-mildewed apartment felt too clean for me.

I gathered my bundle. Shirt, jeans, socks rolled like stones in a grocery bag. I left my unit, taking care to lock the door behind me, and padded down the hall in my threadbare sneakers. A yellowing guide was tacked beside the elevator door, laminated once and warped by time.

BASEMENT LEVEL 1 – LAUNDRY / STORAGE

I pressed the call button. The elevator moaned, then clicked open like it had been waiting.

I stepped inside, alone. The mirror in the back wall was cracked, spider-webbed from an old impact. It gave my reflection a second face—mine, but jagged, stretched. Smiling when I wasn’t.

I looked away and jabbed the ‘B1’ button. The elevator groaned to life and I began to descend. Overhead, the fluorescent light gave a single, lazy flicker before settling back into a dim buzz.

I leaned towards the mirror and started picking at a small blemish that had been forming all week—probably from stress, or the cold, or both. Picking was a bad habit. I did it when I was nervous, when I felt eyes on me that weren’t there.

That’s when I felt it.

A heat at my back. Not the kind that comes from old wiring or a bad air vent—this was the kind you feel when someone’s standing just a little too close behind you on a crowded train. Except I was alone in an elevator.

And then I heard it. Faint and wet and coming from nowhere: a low, breathy sobbing.

My hand froze mid-pick. I stared hard at myself in the mirrored panel on the elevator wall, heart climbing its way up my throat. I didn’t want to look. Not really. But I did. Slowly.

And for one, blinking heartbeat, she was there.

A woman standing directly behind me.

Just the briefest, fleeting glimpse of her—pale, dark hair, and a face—a horrible face staring back at me from under an ebony curtain, her left eye bulging out of its socket, jaw hanging slack like someone had taken a crowbar to it, teeth and gums exposed in a rictus grin. When she sucked in breath, blood bubbled from a hole in her neck.

I screamed and spun, hand flying up like I could block whatever was about to happen.

But there was nothing.

Just the empty chrome of the elevator, the humming light, the cold.

I stood there panting, feeling stupid and shaken, telling myself it was just stress. Lack of sleep. My meds maybe wearing thin. Maybe I’d been off them longer than I realized.

I ran a hand down my face and gave a dry, humourless laugh.

‘Get a grip,’ I muttered.

The elevator shuddered to a stop. The doors groaned open, revealing a long, grey corridor and the damp-smelling dark of Basement One. I stepped out and watched the elevator doors close after me, making sure nothing followed.

‘Okay,’ I said with forced cheer, hoping delusion would dampen the residual adrenalin flooding my veins.

Basement One had the still air of forgotten places. Cement pillars cast long shadows under dim fluorescent lights, half of them blinking or dead.

Storage cages stretched out in narrow rows—chicken wire enclosures, padlocked, filled with mattresses, broken prams, cardboard boxes gone soft at the edges. I passed a crate full of broken dolls, their porcelain grins watching me as I walked, and told myself not to look twice.

The laundry room was tucked into the back corner, a metal door propped open with a brick. Inside, the space was narrow and tiled in old linoleum. Four washers, four dryers. Each coin-operated with instructions half worn off from a decade of fingernails scratching over the plastic.

I dumped my clothes into a washer and patted my pockets for change. Found a few coins. Not enough.

Muttering, I crouched to check under the machine for a stray quarter. That’s when I heard it: *ding*.

The elevator.

I straightened up, brushing off my knees. Probably someone else doing a late load. I stepped to the doorway and peeked around the frame, expecting to see a neighbour wheeling a basket.

The elevator doors stood open at the far end of the basement, but no one stepped out.

No footsteps. No voices. Just the slow mechanical exhale of the elevator doors beginning to close again. They sealed shut with a sound like teeth clicking together.

I retreated back into the laundry, definitely on edge, cursing creepy old elevators and damp, tiny apartments and bitchy receptionists and a life of hard knocks and evangelical parents and the stupidity of youth and wasted potential and forced myself to dig around for more coins, hating everything.

Once I’d found enough I shoved my clothes in the open mouth of the most reliable-looking washing machine I could find and fed in the coins.

Then I sat on the old wooden bench wedged against the wall and opened my book—something beaten and yellow, soft at the corners, the title half rubbed off the cover. *One Hundred Famous Poems*, I think. I’d pulled it from a giveaway crate outside a church shelter. I opened it up to a random page with a sense of pre-emptive surrender. I told myself I was trying to improve.

The words swam. I read the same stanza five, six, maybe seven times, but it didn’t stick. What the fuck did *‘…their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay’* mean? Why can’t they just write in plain English? My eyes were doing the work, but my brain was busy elsewhere, chewing on shadows.

When I looked up, there was a man standing in the doorway.

I hadn’t heard him come in. No jingle of loose change, no cough, no rustle of footsteps over concrete. Just there—still and silent, framed by the weak light and the darker corridor beyond.

It was apparent from the offset that this man was unwell. Not a tweaker, exactly, but not all there either—something half-fried behind the eyes. I knew the type. Had lived around them, with them, *been* them once or twice in another life. Broken minds tend to cluster.

He was twitchy, like his muscles didn’t trust his bones to hold them right. His skin glistened with sweat despite the chill, a sick kind of sheen that caught in the humming laundry light.

Then, without warning, he walked right over and plonked himself down beside me—*beside* me, despite the empty stretch of bench—and sat so close our shoulders almost touched. No hello. No glance. Just that thick, sticky presence.

‘The air is nice up here,’ he said suddenly, his voice jarringly loud in the small space.

I shifted away, subtle as I could, though subtlety meant nothing when the walls were this close.

‘Is it?’ I asked, careful not to sound dismissive. I knew how men like this could turn. One wrong tone and suddenly you’re starring in a cautionary tale.

‘Yeah,’ the man nodded and kept nodding, as though it were a tic of his, and wiped his running nose along the back of his sleeve. ‘It’s nice.’

‘A bit musty for my taste,’ I muttered.

‘Nah, I love mustiness,’ he replied, apparently oblivious to the absurdity of this conversation. ‘I’m tired of open fields and summer air.’

‘Fair enough.’

I chuckled weakly, just enough to appease him, then stared at the book in my lap without reading a word. His leg jiggled like a jackhammer beside mine. He had the look of someone who hadn’t slept in days, maybe weeks—eyes red around the rims, skin waxy, a sheen of sweat collecting in the hollows of his face despite the cold air of the basement.

We sat like that for a while. He twitched. I plotted.

Then he asked: ‘What’d you do to end up here?’

‘Sorry?’

‘What’d you do?’ he repeated, louder this time. The nodding had stopped. His eyes were locked on mine now, too hard and too bright. ‘Everyone’s done something.’

‘Huh? Oh—’ I recalled the receptionist asking the same question. *Damn, this place had to be really bad. Were there bed bugs? Black mould? Crack addicts littering the stairwell?* ‘Oh, you know, didn’t make much of my life—’

‘No,’ he cut me off, his voice suddenly sharp. ‘I mean, what did you *do?’*

‘I… I’m not sure what you mean.’

He picked up his incessant nodding, staring at me like one would a curious bug. Suddenly, he clicked his fingers as though experiencing a private *eureka!* moment. ‘New are you?’ he asked.

‘Yeah.’

‘What floor?’

‘Five.’

‘Ah,’ he replied. ‘That’s not so bad. Not like me. I’m floor two. Doesn’t get worse than that. Well, except floor one. But I’ve never met anyone that lives on floor one.’

‘So… two’s bad, huh?’ I asked, not knowing what else to say.

The nodding started again. Faster now. I could hear the clicking of his neck with every dip. ‘Oh yeah. Two’s real bad.’

A few more minutes trickled by, and my patience for entertaining the madman burnt through the last of its fuel. I climbed to my feet, deciding I’d pick up my load early in the morning, figured it wouldn’t smell too bad if I left it for a few hours.

‘Well,’ I said with a fleeting smile. ‘It was nice to meet you—’

His hand clamped around my wrist.

Not violent. Not painful. But firm. *Intimate,* almost. Like someone holding on not to *me*, but to the moment. His eyes searched mine with a wild kind of desperation. When he spoke again, his voice was soft. Quiet enough that I had to lean in.

‘What d’you reckon happens when you die?’

The question stopped me. Froze me like a sudden wind. It wasn’t the words—it was the *weight* in them. Like he’d asked that question so many times it had worn a hole in his brain.

‘I—I’m not sure,’ I said truthfully.

‘You don’t believe in anything?’

I hesitated. ‘My parents believed. Typical, old style Christian types. They believed that the good—good so long as they conformed to the *right* kind of love, and the *right* kind of hate—went to heaven. And they believed that the wicked went to hell.’

‘Catholics?’

‘Yeah.’

‘Yeah,’ the man echoed, with a little sigh as though I’d just confirmed mildly bad news. ‘What people don’t understand is that hell is already here.’

I understood him, in that moment. Perfectly. Had thought the same thing numerous times myself over the years.

‘I don’t want to go to hell.’

He said it so quietly, it took a moment for my brain to decipher the words. I looked at him, and he was no longer staring at me, but through me. The words had fallen flat, empty, as though it were an echo of an old hope, an old dream, and now he just said them by rote.

‘You can absolve yourself,’ I heard myself say. The words came too easily. Too familiar. My mother’s voice, shrieking behind a closed door. *You can purify this fetid flesh, Robin! You can scrub it clean!*

The man didn’t even blink. ‘Nah,’ he said. ‘I already tried that. I don’t think that’s an option for me.’

He stood, sudden and sharp. I jerked back, stumbled, landed hard on the bench again. He didn’t notice. Or maybe he didn’t care.

‘I think it’s time I go now,’ he said.

‘Okay,’ I replied, voice thin. ‘Good night.’

He turned halfway to the darkened garage, then looked over his shoulder, still nodding. ‘I hope you find what you’re looking for.’

And then he stepped into the shadows.

No footsteps. No creak of the elevator. Just silence. And then, after what felt like a full minute, his head popped around the corner again like a jack-in-the-box and I jumped, heart skipping like a needle on a record.

‘It’s getting late,’ he said. ‘I’d take the stairs, if I were you.’

Then he was gone.

*What the fuck?*

The washer dinged first. Then the dryer. I sat through both, curled up on the cracked plastic chair with my knees to my chest, the book of poems heavy in my lap and a welcome distraction. I made it through a few more before the words started running together—sweaty, fevered scrawls about death and love and loss. Some of them rhymed. There was one about a boy drowning in a bath, and it was written so beautifully I thought it was clever until it made me feel like puking.

Eventually, I gave up and closed my eyes. The hum of machines, the warm gusts of dryer air, and the ghost-quiet of the basement carried me into a shallow nap. When I blinked back awake, the laundry was done.

I gathered my things—warm shirts, stiff socks, underwear folded in on itself like petals—and made my way back toward the elevator, footsteps echoing. I hit the call button and waited. Watched the floor numbers slide slowly down.

3…

2…

1…

The doors didn’t open.

They just stopped. Stuck, like the thing had given up halfway. I pressed the button again. Nothing. Not even a whir. Not even a ding. And then I heard the man’s voice again, not out loud but deep in the space behind my ribs: *It’s getting late. I’d take the stairs, if I were you.*

I stared at the elevator. Then at the hallway behind me. Then back at the elevator. My hand hesitated over the call button once more, before dropping.

‘Don’t be a coward,’ I muttered to myself, but I was already turning away.

The stairwell door was rusted at the hinges but opened with a groan, cool air kissing the side of my face. I stepped in. Concrete steps, metal railings. It was empty, silent, save for the gentle drip of some unseen leak echoing down the stairwell’s throat.

I climbed slowly, balancing the laundry basket on my hip. One flight. Two.

When I reached the landing marked *Floor 2*, I hesitated.

This was his floor. Where the man from the laundry lived. *Floor two. Doesn’t get worse than that*, he’d said, like it was something only the damned would understand.

I should’ve kept walking. But curiosity, well, it’s like an itch behind your eyes. You know scratching it will make it worse, but you scratch anyway.

I reached for the door.

It opened without resistance, the hinges well-oiled. The hallway beyond looked completely ordinary. Identical to mine on Floor 5. Same yellowed wallpaper. Same threadbare carpet. Same sickly fluorescent buzzing overhead. No smell of sulphur. No screams from behind locked doors.

I stepped through anyway, walked the length of the hallway. Apartment numbers, most with the same worn-out ‘NO JUNK MAIL’ stickers. I paused outside one unit that had a plant outside its door—dead, all crisp brown leaves and bone-dry soil—but otherwise, nothing caught my eye. Maybe every tenant thinks their floor is the worst.

I turned back, and that’s when I noticed it.

A door was open at the end of the corridor. Just barely, just enough to see the slice of darkness behind it. The carpet outside the apartment was darker too. Wet. Spongy underfoot, like someone had spilled a bucket of water that hadn’t dried. I wondered if the pipe problem plaguing Ms. Reid on floor five was down here, too.

I looked up and down the corridor for a sign of life, some evidence that the tenant was nearby and just popped out to walk a scraggly Pomeranian up and down the hallway or something. But no—*nothing*.

Nobody in their right mind would leave their door unlocked in a place like this; the crumbling walls and yellow stains painted a vivid and undeniable picture of the kinds of people that lived in the Highway House, myself included. A sliver shy of homeless, probably hungry, probably angry, and definitely poor.

I gave the door a gentle knock and it creaked open further at my touch.

‘Hello?’ I called. No response.

I pushed it fully open, the hinges groaning with slow, arthritic complaint.

The apartment was wrecked.

Not messy—*wrecked.* Furniture flipped. Broken glass glittered in the carpet. A TV was lying face-down in a pile of clothes. There were bottles everywhere, some empty, some still weeping liquor onto the ground. The smell was a mixture of stale sweat, rot, and something sour. Like a fridge had died and no one noticed.

I should’ve turned around right then. But my feet moved on their own, carrying me in through the detritus.

I found the man from the laundry in the bathroom.

He’d used a belt—leather, worn thin at the holes—and looped it over the curtain rod, the kind that was barely screwed into the drywall to begin with. It had held, somehow. He hung there with his back to the tiled wall, feet just shy of the floor, toes pointed down like he might’ve changed his mind at the last second and tried to touch earth again.

His arms dangled at his sides, his head tilted to one shoulder. His face was slack. Eyes open, unfocused. It was a strangely peaceful expression. It didn’t look angry. It didn’t even look scared. It just looked tired. Like this had been a last, long decision.

The sound that came out of me wasn’t a scream. More like the breath caught sideways in my throat and tried to leave as a word, but found nothing worth saying. I turned too fast and caught my knee on the edge of a fallen laundry basket, pitching forward. I landed hard, palms scraping tile.

The basket had tipped, spilling its contents in a slow-motion avalanche across the floor.

Not laundry. Paper.

Loose sheets, some stained, some folded and refolded to softness. Legal documents, envelopes splotched with old water damage, carbon copies, receipts. The kind of documentation that follows a life lived off-grid and underfoot.

And then, a journal.

Leather. Deep red. The colour of dried rust or old wounds.

I sat there for a while, breathing. I knew I ought to get help. That I had no business rifling through the private belongings of the poor, unstable dead man I’d been talking to just an hour earlier.

Then, without really deciding to, I reached out, turned the journal over and opened to the first page. It read:

>*‘My name is Sheldon Riley Buchanan, and on February 2nd, 1978, I murdered sisters Mischa and Miriam Crockett, ages eight and eleven. What follows is a guide to reaching basement levels two through eighty-four of the Halfway House.’*
