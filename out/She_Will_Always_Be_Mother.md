Mother had always feared that this would happen. We were far from children anymore and that was the natural progression of life–for your kids to want to move on and start carving out a path of their own. But it was the way that Kor had left her, in the cold of the night like that, without so much of a word or kiss goodbye, that must have devastated her the most. 

  
I couldn’t blame her. There were far too many sacrifices to tally. Of course, she would ask nothing of us in return (that was the burden of being a mother), but surely this was not how she was to be repaid? After sheltering us from the cold, soothing us when we were hurt, feeding us when our bellies ached, and rocking us gently back to sleep. For years and years, all of us… 

  
I guess she had this problem of letting go. And, I guess, I did too…

  
Kor was one of the older siblings in our family, and as such, he was relied upon to shoulder the load. He could be stern at times and stubborn as all hell, but above everything else, he was fair. The burden of being a leader was not lost on him. He never shied away from a decision in Mother’s absence. He did not wield his influence with an iron fist like many of our brothers did. He didn’t have to. By hoisting Macy on his shoulders when her ankle had ballooned and treating Simon’s illness before the boy had even believed he was sick himself, these small, heroic acts solidified a certain status in our family.

  
We could always trust he was looking out for us, just like Mother would, and I think that’s why it hurt so much. We fled from the others who didn't understand, we had been fleeing all our life, and when he left— 

  
Sorry…Let me gather my composure. 

  
When he left, it was like our father had left. To many of us, that's who he was…

  
So many conflicted emotions churned within our stomachs with every passing day. We talked about it often, at night, when Mother was asleep.

  
Numbness morphed into hurt. Hurt morphed into pain.

  
Within all of us, there was loneliness. You sit with those feelings long enough and it breeds a certain kind of rage.  

  
Our family would never be the same without him. Mother knew it. We all knew it. That’s why there was such a fixation on bringing him back. She wasn’t as mobile as she used to be. A lot of her illnesses put up a fierce fight, wounds took an agonizingly long time to heal. Some never healed at all.

  
We used to move around a lot, but as her condition steadily worsened, we settled into a quiet home nestled into the hearty depths of the wilderness. It was just as Mother liked. We tried our best to provide her with as much comfort as possible. 

  
As time passed, reality began to dawn on me: she was really getting old. It seems obvious on the surface, but it’s not something you often think about until it is too late. As a child, you believe your mother is invincible. Then, if you're lucky, the bitter hands of time begin to whittle down your idol, slowly, and without notice. You begin to see the brittleness of their bones, the frailty in their soul. You feel the fear within them, the acceptance that the end is near. I felt that in her. Simple movements appeared strenuous. A whooping cough appeared at night, wheezing from her throat and shaking us from our slumber. I’d lie awake at night with the others, not knowing what to do.

  
When it was clear he wasn’t coming back, we divided amongst ourselves. Some of us chose to stay and nurse our mother, while others felt they would be better suited in the pursuit of Kor. I was part of the latter. I believed if we could find him it would relieve much of Mother’s stress, and by alleviating her stress, there was a chance her condition would improve. 



We formed a search party and mapped out our plans during the day. At night, after Mother had gone to bed, we would execute. Lyle kept track of the routes we had taken. Wendy helped gather the necessary supplies. We joked that Mother would have been proud of us–working together and playing nice, aiming towards a common goal that wasn’t bashing each other's heads in. 

  
But the bastard was clever. He avoided the honeypots, brushing away most of his tracks. At times it was as if his footprints had disappeared. We’d maybe find a single print near the river line. Sometimes impressions floated off the trail, seemingly in opposite directions. Ultimately, his early start and nimblest of feet carried him away. Days of futile tracking resulted in a gut-wrenching admission to Mother that we had failed. It was the hardest I’d seen her cry.  

  
It took months of consoling before the grief began to wash from her face. Things worked their way back to normal with many of us picking up the slack that Kor had left behind. But it was obvious there would always be a vacancy within her, a scar in her heart that would never quite heal. 

  
Until one afternoon, we found the girl, the last person seen with Kor. Iyla was always convinced he had been abducted. 

  
Trekking slowly up the trail, her creamsicle coat was as bright as a pylon. Long, curly locks draped down from her floppy beanie. She popped her hood over her head to shelter her from the drizzle.   
Three of us just happened to be in the area. Mylo was busy collecting firewood, while Iyla and I were “foraging”, which, in reality, meant we were wandering out of boredom. 

  
I stopped when I heard the rustling. Iyla chirped a strange bird-call from across the forest. She alerted us to a gathering spot with her hands. We stepped cautiously along the north side, taking cover behind a fallen Redwood. 

  
“It’s her,” she whispered hastily. 

  
“Are you certain?” I asked. Iyla was known to be rash at times, often jumping to conclusions. I grabbed her arm and shook it, “You have to be certain.”

  
Her head bobbed up and down, furiously. “It’s her, okay? You think I’m stupid?” Iyla poked her head out from behind the shelter. You could hear the leaves crunching beneath the soles of the woman's boots.

  
Quieter, Iyla whispered, “So what do we do?” 

   
We listened. 

  
Mylo raised his hand for silence. 

  
The footsteps had stopped. Shuffling a couple of steps outside of cover, I snaked my neck around the corner. Through a web of branches, the woman flashed into view. She was breathing heavily, her hands on her hips. 

  
Dashing back to the others, I cautioned them: “We have to hurry. Like, now.” 

  
Iyla bit her lip, her brow furrowed. We followed Mylo, maneuvering through the cover of the trees like a herd of deer. He remained silent, but his eyes roared, narrowing towards our target. His hand crept into the pocket of his shorts, producing a bowie knife. 

  
I imagined all the things we would do to her.

  
With careful footsteps, we spread out from behind the unsuspecting hunched-over woman. 

  
She was beautiful. No wonder. Kor had made a brash decision based on hormones, something I could acknowledge, but was too young to understand. She was older, maybe ten years his senior, but extremely well-kept. Soft, pale skin and long-toned legs that stretched out from her biker shorts, glistening with sweat. Leaning against a weathered rock, she stared blankly back at the trail. Her breaths were plumes of smoke vanishing into the wind. 

  
Mylo was first. Shaking a nearby evergreen, a sprinkle of needles fell from the sky. He brandished the blade, slicing wildly at the air.

  
We expected a scream, but instead, there was a whistle. The pink plastic piece trembled at her lips as her eyes darted back and forth, seeking an exit. 

  
There was none. We closed in, surrounding her. The whistle dangled back down into her shirt.

  
“Give us back our brother, bitch,” Iyla sneered, “and maybe we’ll make this quick.”

  
I lunged at her shoulder as she hollered an unfamiliar name. Mylo tried to wrap his arms around her neck, but the girl put up a valiant fight. She wriggled out of the chokehold and broke free. As she tried to scamper into the woods, I knocked her forward with a push that sent her stumbling into the boughs of a nearby tree.  A thud and the lights went out inside of her. 

  
Iyla froze for a moment, scanning the perimeter. The woman remained face-up just off the trail.

  
It happened too fast for us to react. A bang sent Mylo to the earth. His hands fanned out around the hole in his torso, trying to make sense of the impact. The blood kept streaming down his hips as his screams came out as gurgles.

  
A ringing flooded my eardrums with such intensity that the world began to spin. The yelling that followed was largely drowned out, half recognizable as Kor and Iyla’s, the other half I couldn’t place. 

  
A horde of people dressed as the forest rose from crouched positions. The crowd emerged in a steady march, weapons of war slung across their shoulders, gunpowder fresh in the air.

  
We stared at each other, panic wiping the color from our faces. 

   
*Had Mother heard them?* 

  
It was our turn to finally move. Gripping the woman by the sleeve, we dragged her through the thick foliage and gaps in the trees. She was much heavier than anticipated, and lacking Mylo’s strength, it was a struggle transporting her unconscious body through the underbrush. We pumped our legs as she slid behind us–snapping outstretched branches and bumping rocks. Up and down the uneven terrain, everything burning. 

  
In our haste, through staggered glances over my shoulder, I could see them pressing forward. There were frightened cries and shrieks ahead of us. Our family wasn't far now. 

  
I begged for them to run. Take up the positions. But it was hard to prepare for this kind of pressure, and in their voices and on their faces, it was clear as day. 

  
They were lost, frantic, disorganized. They were nothing without a leader.

  
That same look plagued Iyla’s face as well. She was more focused on what was behind her rather than ahead of her, sweat dripping from her ragged hair. We had watched our brother, Mylo, get slaughtered before we had even experienced the full effects of puberty. Now we were running for our lives, dragging a body through the wilderness of a woman we hardly knew.

  
I could feel her tugging getting weaker, her footsteps falling behind.

  
The others were closing in, their shouts of protest bellowed back at us. Louder. Clearer. 

  
*Stop!*

  
*Leave the girl!*

  
*We won’t hurt you!*

  
Finally, the sea of my brothers and sisters had caught up to us, clearing through the trees at a fiery pace. 

  
Branches shook. The ground vibrated. There was a deep chorus of moans that rattled through the forest. A shade of darkness consumed the sky from somewhere off in the distance, and the panic from the boys and girls shifted into squeals and whistles of excitement. 

  
Rocks, arrows, and knives whizzed past us, their sheer volume and impact startling. Bullets whistled back in response, solid thuds echoing all around us as they collided with the trunks of the trees, howls as they connected with flesh. This ominous drumfire caused us to quicken our pace. 

  
We continued, leaving the cries of war behind us. Both groups met in a tempered battle of blood and savagery. 

  
When the armies looked the size of ants, Iyla collapsed to the floor. Her chest heaved in and out rapidly. 

  
I placed the woman on a patch of unobstructed soil,  steadying my hand against a nearby tree for balance. Only then did I notice the stitch in my side and the stinging blisters that bubbled on the arches of my feet.  

  
She remained still, her eyes closed.

  
Iyla met my gaze, helpless for words through the crippling fatigue. 

  
Familiar cries of agony sailed back at us, my stomach turning. 

  
I knew we couldn’t sit here while our brothers and sisters fought. But what would we do with the woman? 

  
I noticed Iyla’s face had changed, her ears perked. Suddenly, she gasped in fear.

  
 I felt a hand grip my shoulder.

  
“Let her go,” the voice demanded.  

  
The hooded figure revealed himself.

  
“Iyla, Grace. No more people have to get hurt.” 

  
“Kor—” my voice trailed off. None of it felt real. Here he was –not butchered, not mutilated, seemingly unenslaved. His soft features were hidden beneath a mask of grizzled, scruffy hair. It spread wild in tiny loops from the top of his head to the bottom of his chin like moss. The camouflaged parka made him appear unnaturally bulky. 

  
“I came back for you all,” he said. “Help me. Help us… put an end to all of this.”

  
I didn’t know how much of his words I could trust. Not with the hellacious screaming in the background, our family's blood being spilled across the thickets and groves that we called our home.

  
 And him, like this–barely recognizable from the rest of them. His stare had become cold and distant. 

  
Iyla shed a tear, her face shriveled up with sadness. She knew too. They had not hurt him, but they had got to him.

  
He slid the strap off his shoulder and placed the gun resting upright against a tree. He kneeled, cradling his hand underneath the woman's head. 

  
“Don’t you get it?” his voice trembling, “Are you not sick of all of this?”

  
I spoke plainly. “You hurt her, Kor. You hurt us.” 

  
“Hurt *her*?” he gasped. “ How many has *she* hurt over the years? I bet you’ve lost count of how many we’ve claimed. Needlessly, carelessly.”

  
With an outstretched arm, he pointed, “Do you really think *we* are any different?” 

  
Iyla and I stared back at each other blankly.

  
He sighed, catching my gaze. “I knew you two wouldn't understand.” Still holding the woman, he shook his head, “ You all were too young when it happened.”

  
He felt her neck. Kissed her forehead. The roar of battle was intensifying. When he realized she wasn’t coming back, he laid her down gently into the dirt. He pulled the hood of her jacket back over her head and zipped it up to her neckline.

  
 Under his breath, he murmured:

  
“Goodbye, Auntie.”

  
His next words came out slow, as he fixed his gaze on Iyla, and then me.

  
“You have to understand, if nothing else–”

  
He paused, interrupted by the prevailing din that grew impossible to ignore. It forced him to break his tender embrace and scramble to his rifle, the barrel held unsteady and quivering. 

  
Two shots rang out from his gun into the darkness, fire blazing from the end of the metal barrel. There was a raucous wail coming from the distant shadows, rustling the nearby branches.

  
Two more shots were fired, Kor’s teeth gritted. 

  
She rose, towering over the treetops, erect for the first time in years. Trees were disregarded in her approach, toppled over, roots left airborne and exposed. She sank back into the cover of the forest, her back bent in a heavy hunch, clearly limping. 

  
Two more shots were fired, as he proclaimed, “She can’t protect you anymore.” He re-loaded the gun quickly. “She needs you. You don’t need her.”

  
Mother was upon us now. Blood dripped from her dirty, claw-like nails. Her hair was a soaked rats nest of twigs, dirt, and blood that hung low and straggly, covering her face. Her breathing was a series of agitated snorts as her shadow loomed before us. Night had fallen.

  
“Fuck you,” he hissed. 

  
An aggravated scream erupted from her lungs.

  
He ignored it, and took aim. 

  
“You are not Mother.”

  
Two more shots fired from his rifle. 

  
“You were never Mother.” 

  
She moaned with agony, taking the bullets point-blank. Her teeth gnashed together in a horrifying snarl before she reached down and swatted his body across the forest. Kor was launched ten feet, maybe more, his flight stopped by the base of a hearty redwood. Another wail rose from her lungs, this time more in sorrow than bloodlust.

  
A gathering of my brothers and sisters had now joined us, their clothes tattered and soiled with the markings of war. An eerie hush took over the woodland. 

  
“You know what to do,” Iyla said. 

  
I nodded, tears streaming from my eyes.

  
Mother retreated back to her lair carved from stone. Dug from the grunt work of all of us, shovels and tools captured from the townsman over the years, and both of her mammoth hands, the crumbling side of the mountain had become the safest version of home.

  
We gathered the bodies together, placing them in piles along the encampment. The supplies captured today would last years. 

  
Seated in small groups, we held each other, nursing the wounded. We collected bowls of water from the stream and rinsed Mother down. She was exhausted, wincing in pain as we plucked the bullets from her skin. The wounds never seemed to end.

  
All of us waited patiently.

  
There was a deep pit of sadness for my brother when she raised him into the air. She even winced in disdain before dropping him in.

  
But my stomach was growling. So were the others. I couldn’t remember our last proper sit-down with all of us together.

  
The crunching of bones, the tearing of flesh, the twisting of necks and limbs beneath the grinding of teeth. She shoveled one body after another into her menacing jaws like the claws of a crane. We lined up in eager anticipation, watching every chew. The goop drizzled down from her mouth in a careful stream, into my brothers' mouths, my sisters' mouths, and then finally mine.



When our bellies were full, we rested. Our eyes heavy, listless. 

  
Finally, at peace, with Mother.
