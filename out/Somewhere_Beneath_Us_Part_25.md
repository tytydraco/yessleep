The House stared at me for a moment, letting the tortured souls take the reins against the Curator before it morphed its form into Bea. "Well... this is very fascinating."

I looked down and noticed the head of the axe buried partially in the car hood where I had been lying. leaning over, I yanked it free before returning my gaze to the House. "What's the matter? Never seen a dead man walking before?"

That's when it dawned on me. It had. As a matter of fact, that's what the creature specialized in. keeping people alive in perpetual torment, even past death.

"Or maybe you have… You've just never seen anyone escape their room, huh?"

For once, the house had no retort. No venom to spit my way. It simply stared in awe, unable to process what it was seeing.

"I'm still connected to you, aren't I? To my room?"

The creature glared at me with realization.

"Now who's feeding off of who?"

It dropped into the sea of bodies and remerged in front of the car, rising to my level. It grabbed me by the throat and lifted me into the air, an expression of pure rage across Bea's false image. I grabbed its hands and lifted myself to try and speak.

"What are you going to do? Kill me again?" I croaked, "Judging by your confusion, I doubt you know how to stop this from happening. Am I right? You've finally lost control of something."

The sentence made the creature realize he had also lost his composure, and he strangled me for a moment longer before dropping me on the car hood with a thud. I gasped for air as The House began to circle around me.

"I haven't lost anything, Joel. Just because there's been a change in plans doesn't mean I can't still make you hurt."

"Pain doesn't scare me. Especially not now."

"You know that's not what I'm talking about. You're fully aware of what I can do to your friends."

My confidence choked for a moment, and the house caught it. It seized the opportunity to hurt me more.

"You know, Andi was just like Ethan? Innocent in all of this, I mean. That's why she made it so far on her own. I gave her a chance to leave too, but she squandered it like Ethan. I couldn't risk her helping you all escape, so I had to tie up that loose end. 'Point is, though, her death is on you, Joel. Even more than you thought. All your innocent friends were brought here masked by your stench of guilt. Of all of your group's guilt."

I tried not to let the words land on my conscience. If I thought too hard about Andi and Ethan being in this place just because they were in proxy when we got taken, it might break me. Instead, I leaned into the illusion of pain, letting the creature get full of itself once more. I needed it to be still and close to get a clear opening. Letting its pride build before provoking it into a burst of anger was the perfect way to do that.

"So what's the plan then? Stand here staring at one another till one of us drops dead for good? I think that might take a while."

The House chuckled in Bea's sweet laugh, "You confuse me, Joel. You all do. Why do you want to go home so bad? Weren't you running from all of that to begin with? I've seen your past. I know that there's nothing out there waiting for you. You made sure of that by burning every bridge you crossed."

"You're wrong."

"Am I? You have no friends left. No family that cares. All that's left would be what remains of your precious group, and they only stick with you through circumstance." Unfortunately, my eyes wavered for a moment, and the house noticed. "You know it's true, don't you? And what about Bea? Even if you two make it out of here, how long do you think you'd last? Till you can squeeze all of the excitement out of having someone new to hold before you move on to the next woman you can manipulate? How do you think she would feel about Sarah? Would you even tell her? How long did you wait after Andi left before you filled her spot with Bea, anyway? A month? Two months?"

"It wasn't like that…."

"Of course it was! You're all like that, don't you see?"

The house shifted its form, morphing into the spitting image of Daniel. It physically hurt to see him again. It hurt more to hear him speak.

"A man who put work before his own family so often that he'd let his daughter drown before he missed a phone call from them."

He shifted again, this time into Mark, "A tied down suburban dad who wanted excitement so bad he would break his marriage of thirteen years just to get it."

Larry's awful image appeared with an awful sentence to accompany it, "A Television executive that abused and mistreated his innocent little stars, then locked them into contracts that ate away their childhoods one year at a time."

Once again, Bea appeared before me. I felt sick from seeing the faces of so many ghosts. "A young girl who ran away from an abusive house, and not wanting to be slowed down, left her sister all alone to bear that weight by herself."

The house changed one more time, this time into someone I could hardly stand to look at. He looked pathetic, his hair long and unkempt from nonstop travel. His frame was skeletal from a diet of nothing but preserved foods and packaged goods, but his face was the worst. Eyes that looked tired and innocent but hid so much guilt behind them.

"A boy who drove his girlfriend to kill herself," The house started in my own dreary voice, "And unable to deal with the guilt, he slept with his best friend's girlfriend just so he could feel something again."

I didn't respond. I just let myself take in the truth.

"Do you see what I mean now, Joel? You all do these horrible things for selfish motives, unaware of the lives you ruin in the process. The world is better off without you. No one will miss you. No one will wonder where you went. They'll just be happy you're gone. Deep down, you know that this place is all there is for you."

I tried not to, but I failed to stop myself. I thought of Rose, no longer waiting for me somewhere beyond the exit. No longer able to be saved… I thought of Him and his anger toward me. His pure, justified hurt from my betrayal. 'I don't know if I can talk to you anymore.' He had told me. I thought of friends that were now long gone due to my own reclusiveness and the family who never cared in the first place. The House was right. I had nothing to return to from my life before. It was just a cold, lonely world of my own making; the cumulation of poor decisions and unchecked emotions. This place wasn't just a horrible fate I had lucked into; I was forgetting that this is where I belonged. The house hadn't picked fifteen people at random; most of us had done horrible things, and I was part of that role call. Even if I escaped, even if I made it back to my world, What could I do? Where could I go?

Two thoughts stopped my self-loathing in its tracks. The first was that I wasn't doing this for myself. I had other lives that depended on me. People I loved. People who, despite all of my filth, learned to love me …

The other reason was more selfish.

"You're still wrong," I said plainly. Confidently.

The house seemed taken back by the response. "Oh?"

"In all the time you've tormented me, all of the days you showed up to mock me, the one thing you always said was that I was running. And you were right. I was. I was terrified that if I ever looked back, I would have to face whatever might be chasing behind me."

"So you admit I'm right-"

"No, but you aren't. I may not have anyone to go home to. I may have burned every bridge on my path to this place, but you're wrong if you think I have nothing to get back to beyond that door." I said, pointing to the glowing green light far in the distance. "There's a future. One where I can be better. One where I can choose to kill the me that deserves to be here. I've spent too long wallowing in my own pity and mistakes already, and if I stay here, that's all I'll ever do. That's running. That's what really kept me trapped all these years." I stood up straight and glared down the beast before me, "So now, I'm leaving. Dead or alive. And as it seems I can't die, it looks like I really only have one other option."

The House stared at me, angrily analyzing my face, unable to process the human emotions I elicited with its Eldritch mind. I could tell that it was trying to intimidate me, but I no longer felt any fear. All that was left was anger for something that should have died long ago.

"This is your last chance to go peacefully, Joel."

"And this is your last chance too," I said sharply as I slid my hand casually behind my back. The pointed words were the exact ones I needed to elicit the burst of anger I was looking for.

In a blur, the house rushed forward and grabbed me again, but this time, I was ready. I glanced to the side, axe head in hand, and brought it hard against the creature. No luck, but that was to be expected. I may have felt confident for a fleeting moment, but there was no way I would be able to let go of years of regret so easily. That was okay, though. Right now, I just needed to convince the house that was my only plan.

The creature, angry I had even tried to harm it, twisted around and slammed into me, knocking me onto the car roof again. Slowly, it slid me toward the edge with a grin, ready to dump me into the writhing mass below.

"I may not be able to kill you, Joel, but I can certainly teach you a lesson with pain."

Behind, I could hear the Curator screaming as its bones snapped. It had finally succumbed to their advances. I had to hurry.

"L-Let me go…." I cried in frustration and fear, hoping it would buy the act. I focused hard on the things that terrified me most in case he was reading my thoughts. It seemed to work as he flashed a cocky grin and then spoke.

"No, Joel. I told you, this is where you belong." The house snickered as it held me suspended over the tortured souls, "Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to hurt you in ways unimaginable over and over until you're nothing but a broken shell of the pathetic creature you now are. Then I'm going to toss you back into your room where you can watch as member after member of your group stumbles blindly into their rooms. I'll drag you out *only* so you can see them slowly suffer and waste away. That way, you can be reminded for the rest of your miserable existence that-- you. Failed. Joel. All you did was lead your friends down here to die."

My torso crested the edge of the car, but I grabbed onto its arm tightly, "None of that is going to happen."

The house laughed, genuinely bewildered that I was still fighting, "Why not, Joel?"

"Because your pride makes you rash," I told the House, "And because I still have Bea's gun."

The creature barely had a moment to register the sentence before I buried the pistol's muzzle into its chest and pulled the trigger. The thundering gunshot rang out over the wailing souls as the bullet tore through its heart. Black ichor spilled down onto me as the House screamed so loud that my ears popped into silence for a moment. However, that was the least of my worries as the hole in his chest contracted from pain. The hole that my hand was still in.

I dropped off the edge of the car, slamming down hard against the asphalt. The figures that writhed in the darkness were still present, but they no longer reached for me or tried to crush me into the concrete. Their wails slowly dissipated as they receded into the ground, and I rolled over to sit up. My left hand came into view as I pushed myself away from the concrete, and a bloody, severed stump came in from the right to assist.

Shock froze me stiff as I stared at the spot where my hand had once been. Warm crimson poured from the mess like a fountain, and unlike when I had been in my room, the flow of blood felt dizzying.

Somehow the loss of only a single part of me was more dread-inducing than the loss of my life. I swallowed hard, urging myself not to vomit, and tried to ignore the warm, throbbing sensation at the end of the stump. Instead of screaming, I let panic take its course as I hastily fumbled to tear off my belt. Propping it against my leg, I lay my arm across it and then looped the buckle, pulling it as tight as possible. I breathed heavy and whimpered softly as the blood flow slowed and a burning pain began to set in. It was still dripping like a leaky faucet, but with luck, the tourniquet would give me enough time to grab Bea and get back to others. After that, I didn't care. Maybe if I died fast enough, I could see Ethan again before he left…

I shakily stood, trying to avoid looking at my latest injury, and walked around the side of the car. There on the ground, the House lay twitching and shaking, its black fluids mixing with the flow of my scarlet on the asphalt. It stared up at me as I approached.

"Y-You… How did you…."

Back on the catwalk before Bea had been taken, she had drawn the gun as I rushed forward with the flashlight. After seeing it smash uselessly against the creature's skull, she must have thought it wasn't worth wasting a bullet because she never fired a round. When she was impaled, she dropped the weapon to the catwalk before she fell, leaving it for me to find after the dust had settled. The house clearly hadn't noticed, however, and to keep it that way, I needed to keep the thought of it out of my head until I got the chance to use it.

I knelt down next to the house and stared at it. It was strange to see it so vulnerable. So scared. "How does it feel?" I asked, "To be afraid? To be tormented? To be helpless?"

The house looked like it was still trying to process what it was feeling, and using the last of its energy, it changed one last time back into Him. "He won't forgive you, you know. After what you did, nobody would."

"I know," I muttered softly as I stood again and began shuffling back toward the theater doors. At that, the body of the house stopped moving and melted into a pile of mold.

Moving toward the doors, I looked down at the wound again. I needed to hurry. I held my spurting arm at an angle to try and allow gravity to help, then tried not to pass out. The only reason I was so calm now was because the shock still hadn't worn off.

More focused on not thinking about my missing hand, I jumped as a colossal, mangled paw stretched in front of me. It weakly grabbed me around my waist and pulled me toward its body.

"Joel…" It gasped, barely audible. I stood caressed next to the tangled body of the Curator, its skin barely attached and limbs broken beyond repair. Its eyes looked at me with joy and excitement as they usually did, but they also looked pained and afraid. Of everything troubling my mind at that moment, I still found room to feel pity for the creature. It was genuinely sad to see such a mighty beast so weak. It was clear that it wouldn't last much longer; however, it still held me tight.

Swallowing some blood that had pooled in my mouth, I spoke, "Hey, friend." I looked down to its arm where the skin had torn away to find nothing but bone and strange, leathery tendons that held the sockets together. They leaked the same black liquid the house was. Slowly, I lay a hand on a clean spot.

"You did very well," I told it gently. "You saved me. You saved all of your pets." The fear in its piercing orbs wavered as it listened to me speak, and I felt its body begin to ease its tension. "You kept us fed, and you protected us from all those mean monsters…" My voice trailed off as I looked at the beast that had been with us all these years. The only reason I was still alive.

"Thank you. You were an excellent guardian."

Painfully, it dragged its opposite hand across the concrete to its throat and, raising its fingers, gently tapped.

*Tink, TINK!*

It stared for a moment longer before its grip fully loosened, and the Curator's head slouched against the floor. For whatever reason, I found that I had to wipe my eyes as I climbed over its arm and made my way toward the theater once again.

Shuffling down the hall and squeezing my strapped arm, I headed for Bea's room. I peered into the black void and called out, no longer afraid of alerting any presences. There was no response, but Bea's form was still a dot on the horizon. I looked down at the blood flow, ensuring I still had some to lose before entering in. I stepped across the nothingness until my trail of blood swirled into her own before crouching down next to her. I hoped she would be able to walk, as carrying her wasn't an option anymore.

"Bea?" I said, shaking her with my good hand. "Bea, are you okay?" With the house dead, it was safe to assume that we would no longer be able to survive our wounds, and Bea's was pretty severe.

"Joel? Is that you?" she asked, her head actually turning to face me this time. Her eyes were so full of desperation and joy to see me. They looked just like--

They... They looked like Bea's. And that was the only thing I ever wanted to see them as. Beautiful and perfect. Her own.

She looked around the area, and my heart sank as she spoke again.

"Where's Ethan?"

As I looked at her, I knew I should lie. I knew we didn't have much time, and telling her about Ethan would only slow us down. Still, I couldn't. It wasn't fair to her or Ethan.

"He, um… He didn't make it, Bea." I struggled out.

She said nothing and slowly looked away as tears filled her eyes. I squeezed her hand tightly as I did the same. After a long moment, she turned back to me.

"Are you okay?" She asked, trying to bury her emotions. Now that the House was dead, it seemed its grip on her had loosened, and she seemed more coherent. Still, her room clearly took a toll, as she looked absent and vacant…

"Yeah, I'm fine. C'mon, Bea, we need to move. You're hurt; can you walk?"

"Joel, I'm sorry, I can't leave." She muttered, looking away toward the dark endless abyss.

"No, you can now. The house is dead-- you're not trapped anymore."

She thought for a moment but ultimately shook her head, "It doesn't matter either way. This is where I belong, Joel."

"No, it's not, Bea. You belong with us, and you deserve to get out of here." I said, doing my best to slide a hand beneath her and help her up. This only resulted in her wincing in pain from the hole in her stomach. "Bea, come on! Work with me here!"

"Do you remember how I told you about my sister?" She started in a low mutter, "When Andi first left, I was so upset. I was so angry that she would do that to us. It seemed so selfish that with all the pain she knew we were in, she would add more to that by abandoning us. But then I remembered that that was exactly what I did to my sister, Joel… My stepdad, he- I knew what he was capable of, and still when the chance came to run, I-" Her voice broke with a sob as she struggled to continue. "I ran, Joel. I left her all alone to fend for herself. Since he had always liked her a bit more, I thought she would be okay. That's how I justified it to myself. But a lot of time passed, and I went back for her, and she was hardly the same person. She was quiet and had no joy anymore. She was like an empty husk, and I couldn't bear it. He took it from her, Joel. I left, and he took her joy. I left, and he ra-"

She broke again, unable to speak the word. I didn't blame her. It was a disgusting, vile word that didn't deserve to be spoken about anyone.

"This is where I belong, Joel." She continued in tears. "Alone and hurt, just like I left her."

I stared at her, and my heart broke at how much pain she was in, physically and mentally. I wanted to take her away from it; far, far away. But I knew I couldn't. Only she could do that herself. All I could do was offer her words.

"Bea… I can't even begin to imagine what you or your sister went through. I am so sorry that those things happened to you… No child should ever have to deal with that. But Bea, those things that he did to you and your sister; None of that is your fault. None of it." I guided her cheek to look at me, "None of it. That is all on him. You are not responsible for the evil things he chose to do, and if anything, he's the one who should be rotting in this place. Not you. So please, don't do this to yourself, Bea."

She looked at me and slowly raised her arm to grab my hand but shook her head, "You should go, Joel. You don't belong here."

"Bea-"

"Just leave me. Even if I make it out, what do I have on the other side?"

I looked to the open door in the darkness, then at my gushing arm. The house was dead, and so was the Curator. If I didn't come back and the rest of the group decided to leave, they would have no trouble getting out. They didn't need my help anymore...

"Okay," I told her as I lay down in the blood next to her.

"What are you doing?"

"If you're staying, then I'm staying too."

"What?"

"I have nothing else past that door either, Bea. At least not yet. There's more to see beyond what we've already experienced, But I don't want to see it unless you're there beside me. If you aren't coming, then I'm staying."

"Joel…"

"Bea."

She analyzed my face with almost no discernable expression before forcing herself up, grunting and coughing as she tried to sit. I immediately scurried to my feet and helped her with my good hand, and she stared at me.

"Okay..." She mustered from within. A sweeter word had never been spoken.

The two of us began to hobble our way toward Bea's door, and thankfully, she passed right through it with no trouble. She held her coat pressed to the hole in her stomach and leaned on me hard as the pain crippled her with every step. I, too, was beginning to stumble and trip over my feet as blood loss continued to overtake me. The elevator wasn't far now. Just a little bit more…

I kept my arm tucked to my side as we moved, not wanting Bea to notice. Luckily her attention was occupied already as we passed the body of the Curator and the House in the parking lot. I gave her arm a gentle tug as she focused in on the white sheet covering a body. We made our way across the garage to the glowing light above the elevator doors where I pressed the button on the wall to call the lift. My head spun as a pool of blood formed on the floor beneath me, and Bea looked sick and pale as she leaned against the wall and breathed heavily.

*Ding!*

The elevator slid open, and we shuffled inside, Bea slumping slowly to the floor as I went for the keypad.

"Hang on. Just a bit more, okay?"

"Yeah… Alright." She muttered with a swallow.

As I looked between the two of us, I realized that there was no chance we would make it back to the surface. Not in the conditions we were in. Alice had told me that the elevator only went to the floor below the basement of the saferooms. That meant we had a massive staircase we would need to climb on top of more rooms and another staircase to get to the yellow room. We could barely stand right now. That's when I had a thought, though. She said that was floor one. But what about…

I typed zero and pressed enter. The elevator doors slid shut, and it began to ascend with a rattle. I sighed with relief and made my way to the wall, where I slid down next to Bea. That's when she finally saw it.

"Oh my God, Joel, your arm." She cried with as much energy as her body would allow.

"It's okay. It'll be okay."

"Your hand it's-"

"Yeah, I know. Don't worry about it. I'm trying not to."

She swallowed hard and then looked at me before laying her head on my shoulder and lacing her fingers into my present hand.

"So you found the exit?"

"Yeah."

"And you… killed the House?"

"It's a long story."

She didn't say anything else, as I could tell the specifics didn't matter to her. All that mattered was that it was over. I felt her body relax more, and I gave her a nudge.

"Bea?"

"…Yeah?"

"Don't give out on me. We're so close."

I felt her nod before she lifted her head and looked at me.

"Hey, Joel?"

"Yeah?" I said, turning to her.

"In case I don't ever get the chance…."

"For what?"

She leaned forward and pressed her lips against my own.

The scene wasn't romantic by any definition. We were two kids sitting on the floor, creating red pools beneath us. I didn't have a hand free to hold her with, and she didn't have the strength to lean into the kiss. On top of that, the taste of blood hung on both of our dry, cracked mouths. Even still, it was the most honest affection I had ever taken part in.

I stared at her as she pulled away, and after a moment, I laughed softly, "I really hope we get more chances."

She chuckled as well, "Me too."

*Ding!*

The doors opened, and I stood, nearly collapsing as I helped Bea up. I shuffled into the room we had arrived at to find that it was only a tiny little strip, almost like a laundry room. We began to move through when Bea stumbled and began coughing violently. I stopped and slowly helped her to sit again.

"It's okay; just hang on, Bea," I told her, a little more panicked. "Just wait right here."

I turned to the end of the room where the only door sat. A metal door with a lever handle. The same door I had looked at for years, now from another side. I approached it and looked at the grip, where nothing but a tiny lock held it in place. I flicked off it with a smirk of irony. We had been only a few feet from a way out this whole time, and all that was stopping us was a piece of metal the size of a button. Before opening it, I raised my knuckles to the door.

*Knock, Knock, Knock… Knock!*

I heard bodies and voices begin to draw near, and I smiled again, this time out of joy. I slowly opened the door and peered inside. There everyone stood, looking from the bedroom doorway with fear. Their expressions changed, however, when they saw it was me. Grace placed her hands to her mouth, and Ben's eyes opened wide. Jan was holding her beautiful baby in her arms, but her eyes went watery when they met my own. Frank and Clair were in the very back trying to peer through, and behind them all, Alice looked at me with a smile.

There were so many things that I wanted to say to them at that moment. How happy I was to see them. How much I had missed them. That I loved them all, and I was so sorry that I never told them that enough. But I was so tired, dizzy, and relieved to see them again, that all that came out was...

"Hey, guys… I'm back."

"Joel!" Grace called as they all rushed forward toward me. They stopped abruptly when I swung the door open and they saw my condition, however.

"Oh my-!"

"It's okay…." I slurred. "I know, I'm bleeding, but it'll be okay. W-we need to go, though. I found the exit."

"Claire, quick grab some rags; the alcohol too. We need to apply pressure. He's already lost a lot, it looks like."

"Joel, sit down! It's going to be okay!"

"Don't close your eyes, alright? Just keep them open."

"Ben, round up whatever we might need, and let's get ready to go. Alice, you said there's an elevator?"

People screamed commands at one another like a staff of panicked doctors, but my head blurred their voices all into one. I couldn't help but think of Andi. I now knew what she felt. I was no longer immune to injury, and this time I would die for good. However, that thought wasn't disheartening. I got to see everyone again. I got to know they were all safe and that I had done what I had set out to do. They all looked so scared and panicked, but I couldn't help but smile. I loved them all so much. Still, it felt like something was missing.

"Oh goodness, grab more rags! Bea is in here too, and she's also hurt!"

"Are Ethan and Daniel there as well?"

"N-No... Just Bea. Hang on, sweetheart, it's going to be Okay. God, it's so good to see you."

That was it. Daniel was still down there somewhere. As Ben drew near with the gauze and alcohol, I grabbed his arm

"E-Ethan… didn't make… He…" It was all incoherent, but he understood what I was saying. He solemnly looked to the rags as he medicated them thoroughly but then smiled, trying not to make things worse.

"That's okay, Joel. You all did so well. Now bite down on this. It's going to hurt, okay?"

"Daniel… He's… He's-" Before my pounding head could force out the rest of the sentence, Claire placed a rag into my mouth.

"Alright, here we go. Hang on, Joel."

I tried to call out through the gag, but they touched the cloth to the end of my limb before I could, and blinding, searing pain forced me into numbness. It felt like I was melting as acid crept into arteries and tissue, and it took all of my energy not to pass out. I thought I even heard a tooth crack as I bit into the rag so hard I couldn't breathe.

As the pain resided, I found myself in the elevator being carried by Frank. My stump lay across my chest with rags still stuck to the end. Everyone else was packed inside, carrying a few meager belongings that meant something to them throughout our time here. Across from me, I saw Bea in Jan's arms, her eyes closed and breathing shallow. With a shake from Jan, she opened them again.

"Just a bit more, Bea. Almost there." She cooed

Next to me, I heard a slight cry and turned to see the innocent eyes of a baby staring back at me. Cozy in Grace's embrace, they looked at me with pure curiosity. Slowly and shakily, I reached my good arm out and offered a finger, which they happily latched onto.

Jan smiled with tear-filled eyes, "Joel, this is the newest member of our family. Her name is Andi."

I smiled as warmth filled my chest, "Andi… T-That's a good name."

The doors opened, and everyone filed out, Alice taking the lead.

"This way. We're almost there."

"W-Wait!" I said, squirming in Frank's grasp. "D-Dan, he's still trapped… I- I need to go save him."

Everyone nervously exchanged glances as they looked between Bea and me.

"They've lost a lot of blood." Ben said, "I don't know if they'll hold out much longer."

"Where is he, Joel?"

"I-I don't-"

"I think I know," Alice said. "I'll go check for him. You all head that way till you see the green exit sign. That's the way out."

Before I could object, a couple of people nodded, and we began to move again. As I passed Alice, I looked at her.

"Y-You better m-make it back, okay?" I told her.

She nodded with a smile and then took off back toward the elevator.

As we moved through the garage at a light sprint, my eyes were on Bea the whole time, making sure hers were still open. She was looking a lot worse than I was feeling.

"Oh my gosh…." I heard Claire gasp as we approached the bodies of the House and Curator. Everyone cautiously slowed.

"D-Don't worry. They're d-dead."

"Did you do this, Joel?"

"S-Sort of."

"Damn, kid," Frank whispered.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the beacon of green loomed above us. As we stood before the door, the group shuffled around.

"Bea first. We'll be right behind you." I heard Ben say.

As they swung it open and light danced across us, I could tell they all felt it. Warmth. Safety. Freedom.

Claire, Grace, and little Andi all stepped through the door with Jan, who threw one last concerned smile at me before passing through the opening with Bea in her arms. There was no grand sound as they stepped through, no fanfare or feeling of success. After all, it was just an exit, but that was all we needed it to be.

Ben stepped forward and held the door open for frank and me, then spoke. "You two go. I'm going to wait for that Alice girl in case she can't find Dan."

"Are you sure?" Frank asked him.

He nodded, "Get Joel to safety first thing, wherever you come out."

Frank began to walk through the doorway, and the light fully engulfed us both. The sheer relief it had brought just from its radiance was nothing compared to standing inside it. Frank continued to walk as the light faded into somewhere else, but I held on to it. I know they say not to go into the light when you're dying, but at that moment, I couldn't have been happier to embrace it.

As I drifted into unconsciousness, a heavy realization finally dawned on me, one that I hadn't let myself accept until I was certain we were walking through that door: It was finally over.

For four and a half years we had lived among decrepit walls and moldy carpets, surviving on food long expired and the company of people once strangers. But on that day, we finally left the house behind as a family, and a whole mess of pain and suffering along with it.
