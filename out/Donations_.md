I work at a thrift store. Like a lot of thrift stores, it's owned and run by a church. Unlike most (to my knowledge) we have a room dedicated to what most people would consider cursed or haunted objects.

A bit of background 
When I was 21, my life felt somewhat incomplete. I was still living in a small town in Pennsylvania and had just dropped out of college. I worked a shitty job at a warehouse and I made enough money to support myself comfortably.
I worked nights and just sat around the house playing video games when not sleeping. 
This routine, as expected led me to decline emotionally. I was lucky enough to be pulled out of the tedium by my local church pastor, and his thrift store.

I have never seen myself as a religious person, but Maurice still managed to become a big part of my life just because of the kind of person he was. 
He was young, short and stocky with an un-ironic curled moustache and goatee. He had a genuine smile for everyone he met, and took his role as a pastor very seriously. But had a fun side that made him that much more effective at his role .
Our first meeting was courtesy of my parents. Who had decided that their 16yo son needed a man of God to pull him out of his regrettable mall-satanist phase. 
Understanding that the bible would do jack shit for a rebellious teen, Maurice instead decided to just sit with me and talk about everything and anything. He would also bring his Xbox to the small church-owned demountable to play various video games with me. 
He was instrumental in helping my social confidence and pulling my hard earned pocket change from the clutches the local head shops.

So when Maurice heard about my slump, he was more than ready to come to my aid. He slyly suggested that I volunteer somewhere. 
The Church had recently converted a majority of it's basement rooms into a local community thrift store, so I immediately knew what he was suggesting I volunteer for.
After giving it little thought, I agreed to his proposal and started soon after. 

Most regular people tend to be quite careful with what they donate, and we only sometimes get weird items from living people. However with my town's aging population, people often pass away. Due to this, Their will or family commonly give unwanted things to the church to deal with.

Maurice had an extremely annoying habit of hoarding and never throwing out "undamaged" items, this usually wasn't a problem as we simply sent off excess items to other Churches. However Maurice's hoarding approach extended to items that most would consider weird or unnerving. To deal with this, Maurice created a room separate from the main floor dedicated to what he calls the "funky stuff".

Due to a few incidents, Access to the funky room is only permitted to customers who understand the risks, and request access ahead of time.
Most "funky stuff" is near-unsellable racist or sexist nick nacks from the houses of old assholes. But occasionally we get some truly problematic items. 

On one memorable occasion, a moving truck showed up and dumped a beautiful hardwood vanity next to the donation bins. This would have been all fine and dandy, if not for the extremely clear stain left from the slumped over body of who we presume was its previous owner.

I still remember the disgusted squeals and protests from the other workers as Maurice rolled it through the store and straight into the funky room.

For weeks afterwards, we would find faint stains in the shape of people around the store. Nothing could get them off and they usually disappeared on their own. They mostly never did anything other than just make the store look grimy. I'm pretty sure I saw one wave at me one time though. 

However, We had an especially persistent one on the back of the women's dressing stall door that caused some outrage after one woman claimed it licked her when she turned her back to it.

After this incident, enough was enough and we hounded Maurice to do something about it during a Friday closing shift. 

We don't know what he did, but the stains never showed up after that day, but the vanity still remains  in the funky room. 

Sometimes items destined for the funky room aren't so obviously messed up at first. We had a haggard looking family drop off a single item from what we assumed to be a grandparents estate and leave without saying a single word. It was a small, crusty box with circus style decoration, advertising a "Darling Monkey" doll. The monkey doll inside was dusty and kinda gross, but in overall great shape. We decided to just put it with the rest of the vintage dolls on a shelf near the kids stuff section. 

Not one hour after we put it on the shelf, a high pitched shriek echoed around the store. A girl of about 10 years old bolted past the counter, and through the doors that lead outside. 

Estelle, one of the other workers on shift, followed quickly behind to see what was wrong. Within a few seconds she began quickly shouting for my assistance and the first aid kit. 

The girl had a steady stream of blood coming from a wound on her arm. While dressing and cleaning the wound, I couldn't help but feel like it looked to have been a bite mark made by a mouth full of small needle-like teeth.

She claimed through sobs that "I only wanted to get the monkey down, but it told me it doesn't like me, and it bit me and it screamed at me and I don't want to see it anymore".

Luckily the wound wasn't too deep and her mother was certain she had just hit her arm on a broken glass and was making things up. I feel like this is a perfect example of people needing to have more faith in their kids. As upon walking back inside, I was greeted by the sight of a 12 inch tall plush monkey on the front counter, frozen in a mid masturbation pose. It's tiny erection clasped triumphantly in a felt hand, and Its bloody teeth exposed in a grin.

The monkey was quickly shoved back in it's box and taken to the funky room with a post-it note explaining the incident. The post-it note would periodically change what was written on it. Generally refering to the "dumb shit brown hair boy" (me) and what horrific sexual acts it would commit against my mother. 

The slur pillow has to be one of the most uniquely problematic but harmless items I’ve seen a kid run across. It’s a fairly average pillow, except for the cartoon kitten printed on the front. What we didn’t know was that we had a kitten-shaped time bomb sitting in the store.

I was behind the counter deflecting a reseller’s attempts to haggle over a $10 item when a kid decided to test the pillow’s softness by pressing their face into it. Upon contact, the child froze, then raised one arm stiffly in the air. Without moving their feet, they pivoted to face an older African-American shopper. The child then started screaming the N-word in a loud, helium-pitched voice, still clutching the pillow to their face. 

The horrified mother quickly grabbed the pillow and tossed it aside, apologizing profusely as she dragged the child out of the store. Other shoppers later reported seeing the kitten’s mouth move with every slur the child yelled.

For safety, the pillow was moved behind the counter until closing time.

I wish that this is how the story ended, and I debated just leaving this bit out just to keep up the cover story. However, I've decided I don't really care enough to cover up years-old town drama. 

This is where that reseller becomes relevant. His name’s Ray. He’s about my age, and he makes a habit of stopping by to buy cheap crap to resell on eBay or at local markets. Ray has absolutely no filter and barely a sliver of decency, but he’s the closest thing I have to an actual friend.

That night, I was shifting cash from the till into the safe when Ray slid up to the counter with an armful of grimy Beanie Babies. “Bit of whiskey in his Capri Sun?” he said sarcastically, gesturing toward the pillow. I gave him a dismissive chuckle and continued counting.

It was then that I realized my mistake: I hadn’t shoved the pillow into the funky room yet.

"Hey, who am I?" Ray said from behind me. I turned to see him holding the pillow to his face.

In an instant, Ray went stiff as a board, raised his arm in the same manner as the child earlier, and began gliding silently toward the front door.

His stiff body silently glided out of the store and up the path to the main road. I frantically chased after him but was unable to match his speed. Luckily, Maurice was pulling into the church driveway as Ray slid up the street. I barely got out a word before Maurice shouted for me to get into his car.

It wasn't long before we caught up to the speeding Ray. The body was strangely obeying traffic laws, even stopping briefly at the traffic light. And yielding when appropriate.

Eventually, Ray’s body took a sharp turn into a bakery. We heard him before we saw him: he was screaming a torrent of expletives and slurs at the bakery owner, who, unfortunately, turned out to be the same shopper from earlier.

After rushing inside and taking back the pillow, Maurice and I apologized profusely. Sadly, the apologies weren’t enough; we were banned from the bakery on the spot. Only Maurice was spared this treatment. 

Ray was rushed home, and the pillow was boxed up and taken to be forgotten in the funky room.
The local film school agreed to take the blame with a film shoot cover story after we agreed to bribe them with some old-school camera lenses from the shop.

I have a couple more stories to write out, but for now I feel like that's enough.
