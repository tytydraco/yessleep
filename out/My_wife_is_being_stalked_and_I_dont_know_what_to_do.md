It was a regular evening, and I had just made it home from work. It had been a rough day and traffic had been heavy too, but I forgot all that when Clara came up to me and kissed me. Her smile and her laugh are always enough to cheer me up when nothing else does. That day, I held onto her a little longer than normal before letting go.

Then she said, “Thanks for the flowers! They really work well with the kitchen decor.”

“Hm?” I wasn’t sure what she was talking about at first. Then I saw the glass vase, filled with purple orchids, sitting on our kitchen counter. I hadn’t even noticed them.

“I didn’t buy those,” I answered, confused.

She wrinkled her nose, the way she always did when she was racking her memory.

“What do you mean? They were on the windowsill this morning. I thought you’d gotten them.”

I shook my head. “Were they on the outside?”

“Yeah.”

“Weird.”

“Well, at least they look nice,” Clara smiled. And just like that, the conversation was over. Yeah, I was sort of unsettled about the flowers at first, because there was no explanation for how they got there. I should have thought about it way more. I am aware of that. But I didn’t, and the flowers stayed in our kitchen until they withered and died and I threw them away. After that we both forgot about them.

That was in January. The next weird thing happened on Valentine’s Day.

I was late coming home from work because I’d stopped to pick up a box of chocolates for Clara. It wasn’t the most effort I could have given, sure, but in my defense I’d completely forgotten it was Valentine’s Day until my manager mentioned something about it as I was clocking out. I ran into Kroger and bought the first of those heart boxes I saw, hoping I could make it home in time for it to not be obvious what I’d been doing.

When I made it home Clara was waiting for me like usual. She kissed me, I said something vague about traffic, and I handed her the box of chocolates.

“Wow, you really are spoiling me today,” she giggled. “You must want me to get fat.”

“Just eat one a day,” I replied. “Make it last.”

“Oh, I guess I already failed. I ate like ten this morning.”

“This morning?”

She laughed and pointed at the table, feigning shame. There was another box of chocolates on the counter. It had been opened and was missing some of its contents. 

“Where’d you get that one?” I asked.

“It was on the back patio. I thought you’d left it there for me? Did you not? Oh God, I hope it wasn’t poisoned.”

I definitely hadn’t left that box there that morning. I remembered the flowers from a month ago and felt a little uneasy. Either it really was me and my short-term memory was declining, or someone had been leaving gifts outside our house. 

“Well, you would’ve died by now,” I shrugged.

“Who would leave something like that outside our house? It’s like those flowers.” Clara mused.

“Someone nice? I don’t know.”

After that, Clara refused to eat the mystery chocolates, so I did. Honestly, we forgot about them too, after a few weeks. We were at a busy time in our lives, still newly married and just now living in our own house. I was working a lot of hours, and so was she. That doesn’t excuse me from not giving these things more thought. It’s just an explanation.

Then the first love letter came in.

After collecting the mail one day, I found a red envelope with no return address. It had Clara’s name on it. I handed it to her, and she opened it, and a pink sheet of paper fell out. She read it silently.

“This isn’t from you?” She asked without looking up.

“Nope.”

“Then this is really messed up.”

“What?”

I peeked over her shoulder at the paper, and she passed it to me. It was a note, written on pink stationary. Elegantly painted flowers lined the edges. It was the kind of thing my grandma would have used for the letters she sent to her geriatric friends. It was handwritten too, in the most obnoxious, John Hancock looking cursive I’d ever seen. For some reason I pictured it being written with a quill pen.

*Words cannot describe*

*That pull I feel on my heart*

*When I see you walking by*

*Everything in the world stops.*

*Love,*

*Your secret admirer.*

“Beautiful,” I whispered.

“Shut up,” she said. “This is really weird.”

“You’re right,” I agreed. I could tell we were both thinking about the flowers and the chocolates too. Valentine’s Day was long over at this point, though.

“Who do you think this is?” Clara said, flicking the note across the table.

“Might be a prank. Your brother, maybe?”

“You think he’d drive forty-five minutes for this?”

“Facts. You know anybody who’s madly in love with you?”

“Only you.”

She looked at me and narrowed her eyes.

“It’s not me, I promise!”

“Yeah right.”

“Your turn to shut up.”

She stuck her tongue out at me. I licked it and she jumped back, slamming her tailbone into the table.

“Ow, that really fucking hurt!”

“Okay, whatever.”

“Seriously though, what do we do about it? We could send it to a handwriting expert or something. Get them to analyze it.”

“I don’t think handwriting experts just know the handwriting of every person ever. Also, that definitely isn’t anyone’s actual handwriting.”

“True.”

We just kind of stood there for a minute, staring at the note, neither of us knowing what to do. After a while, I just figured there was nothing else to do, so I tore it straight down the middle and crumpled up the pieces. 

“Wait!” Clara screamed.

“What? We have no use for it.”

“You could have saved it as evidence! Just in case.”

“Oh.” She had a point, I realized. I felt a little embarrassed for doing something so dumb. Going to the police hadn’t really seemed like an option to me. I unwrinkled one of the pieces and smoothed it out, but it was barely legible. Clara didn’t protest as I tossed it into the trash.

“We’re just going to do nothing, I guess,” she said.

“If something else happens we will,” I answered. “But I don’t know what we can do right now.”

“What if someone’s been watching me? Or following me?”

“You’d know, right?”

“I think so…”

I slid the envelope with the note inside into a drawer. Leaning against the counter, I pondered what I could do to make things better.

“I’ll buy one of those doorbell cameras,” I said finally. “Then we can see who’s dropping by the house while we’re away.”

That made her feel a little better. We went to bed a little uneasy, but over the next few days, we started to convince each other that everything was alright. There could definitely be some explanation other than some lunatic stalker. I didn’t know what that explanation could be, but I felt somewhat confident that there was one.

Actually, there was one idea I had. I didn’t share it with Clara. I remember thinking about it as I installed the camera next to our front door.

*What if she was cheating on me?*

Sure, it didn’t look quite like cheating on the surface. But wouldn’t it be a real twist for her to accept all these little gifts from some lover, then pretend around me that she was being stalked? A pretty solid cover-up.

I shook my head hard and dropped my screwdriver. Why was I thinking like that? Clara wouldn’t cheat. But that left the door open for there to be some anonymous, obsessed lunatic who was in love with my wife. And I didn’t know what to do about that.

The camera didn’t pick up anybody creeping around. But the stalker didn’t stop. A few days later, Clara received three more love letters in the mail. The first two were sappy poetry similar to the first one that had come in. Generic greeting card love speak—whatever. The third one was a poem too, but it was much weirder.

*Darling,*

*Please understand, baby*

*If I were given my way*

*I'd break all your bones*

*And ejaculate on your helpless carcass.*

*Love,*

*Your secret admirer.*

I had found the letters while Clara was out of the house running an errand. Immediately I ran to my phone and checked the security footage. Obviously since those letters had come through the mail, there was technically no reason to think someone had come by the house. That didn’t keep me from feeling insanely uneasy, even after the camera turned up no signs of suspicious activity. I scrubbed through all of the saved footage—about two days worth—at least three times before I felt confident that I hadn’t missed anything.

While I was checking the footage, I made the mistake of leaving the letters open on the counter. Clara made it home and saw them lying there. When I returned to the kitchen she was sobbing, reading them and covering her mouth in disgust.

“Who is this? Who would say this?” Tears were streaming down her face.

Wrapping my arms around her, I said, “I don’t know. But they’re just letters. I won’t let anything happen to you.”

I wish I’d been telling the truth.

That night, as we were getting ready for bed, I realized I had forgotten to take the trash can out to the street. Clara didn’t want me going outside now that it was dark, but I told her I’d only be out there for like fifteen seconds. She relented, but set up a chair by our window to watch me. I thought it was overkill, but she was understandably paranoid. And I was grateful to know that she cared enough about me to be worried for my safety. 

It was cold, so I was dragging the garbage can out as fast as I could, and I wasn’t paying much attention to my surroundings. When I reached the street, though, I happened to look up. Down the street a little ways, and on the other side, was the silhouette of a person. They were standing in a neighbor’s yard staring at me. The person looked to be wearing a hood, but that was all I could tell. They didn’t move even as I stared.

“Hello?”

The person didn’t move. Feeling very unsettled, I headed back into my house, checking constantly over my shoulder. I half expected the person to start charging toward me with a knife or an axe, but that didn’t happen. Once inside, I dead bolted the front door.

“Who were you talking to?” Clara asked as soon as I made it into our bedroom.

I peeked through the blinds to look for the guy, and realized from this angle there was no way to see the front yard where he had been standing. Our bedroom is right next to the front door with the camera as well, so most likely the hooded figure wouldn’t be on camera either.

“Nothing,” I said. “I’m just being paranoid, I guess.”

Clara looked unhappy with that answer. We went to bed shortly thereafter, but I couldn’t sleep. I laid there trying for about an hour, but I couldn’t get my mind off everything that had been happening. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.* Someone knocking on the window.

I heard a male voice whisper: “Clara!”

Clara gasped. I sat up bolt upright in bed and she screamed.

“Did you hear that?” I asked.

“Yes!”

I ran to the window and looked out. Nothing. 

I wondered about going outside and looking around, but was too freaked out to do it.

“That’s not the first time that’s happened,” Clara whispered, voice shaking.

“What?”

“The knocking. I’ve heard it before. I’ve never heard him say anything before just now, but I’ve heard him knocking.”

I sat down on the bed. “There was someone knocking on the window and you didn’t say anything?”

“I didn’t know for sure.”

“But you were hiding this from me?”

“I didn’t want to stress you out or make you mad.”

“You think I would get mad at you?”

Clara started to cry. “I didn’t know! I was scared!”

“All I’ve tried to do so far is help you. I’ve never been closed off or anything, at all. I even bought that doorbell camera—”

“It’s a fucking *doorbell* camera. It doesn’t cover the whole house, you idiot!” Clara started sobbing with full force. Why was she acting like this? Of course it was a serious situation, but why didn’t she want to trust me?  Sighing heavily, I stepped out of the room because I had no idea how to comfort her. After drinking some water, I reentered our bedroom and found my wife lying silently in bed. I lay down next to her and mumbled, “I’m sorry.” I tried to fall asleep after that, but it was impossible. 

Judging by her breathing patterns, Clara couldn’t sleep either. I thought about saying something else, talking to her since we were both awake, but I didn’t. I just couldn’t think of the right words. It occurred to me then that she had to be terrified—some psycho was sending her flowers and perverted love letters and walking around our house, and she had no clue who it was. However scared I was probably didn’t even compare to the fear she had to be feeling.

Now I felt really guilty for suspecting her of cheating. How could I have been so stupid?

When I awoke the next day, Clara had already left for work. Immediately I grabbed my phone off the nightstand and called the police, telling them everything that had happened. It seemed like the best move. 

The lady on the other end agreed to file a report. 

“Is that all you can do? This person was on our property.”

“Without evidence of a crime being committed, we can’t do a whole lot.”

“I just don’t want things to get any worse.”

“Well, we can send an officer over in the next few days to check things out. He can see what the situation is and probably scare the guy off if he happens to be in the area.”

“Okay, thank you.”

Well, it was better than nothing. I’d have liked more in the way of protection, but a police officer coming over was a good sign. Maybe the lady was right and that would scare this creep away for good.

A few days came and went. The police officer did not show up.

The stalker was also silent. For those few days, there were no presents or visits from the person. Maybe this thing had worked itself out, I thought. 

Then the cake arrived.

Clara and I had gone on a walk. I know I locked the door because I distinctly remember fumbling with the key to unlock it again. When we pushed open the door, my wife gasped. I followed her gaze to a chocolate cake that was sitting on the kitchen counter. It had been set on one of our own plates. 

That had not been there when we left. It would have been impossible for one of us to have placed it there. Someone must have been in our house.

Immediately I searched the area. The house was clear though, as was our yard and the neighbors’ property. Whoever had left the cake was gone. 

Clara was crying when I returned, and she taken up a defensive position, arming herself with one of the kitchen knives. Her back was to the wall. I inspected the cake itself. It was covered in chocolate frosting and chocolate covered strawberries, with a plastic heart poking out of the center. 

Who would do this? And why did I feel so helpless about it?

I thought for sure calling the police would work this time. But as luck would have it, I didn’t need to. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a police cruiser pulling up to the curb and parking. We both ran out to meet it.

A older police officer stepped out of it. His face was weathered and sealed off, like he’d seen some shit in his life.

“You reported a stalking incident?”

Clara glanced at me, as if to say *Well, that was fast.*

“Yeah, I did,” I answered. “Come inside. He just struck again.”

I led the man into our home and shut the door. I motioned for Clara to grab the last batch of letters from our bedroom closet. 

“Tell me what all’s been going on here,” the officer breathed. I explained the events of the last month or so, to which he seemed relatively uninterested. Maybe he doesn’t show his thoughts like that on the outside, I thought. Or he really just doesn’t care. Either way, I finished telling him the story, and Clara handed him the love letters she’d received. He skimmed them, then glanced at the cake on the counter.

“So far he’s sent you letters and a cake, and stood across the street.”

“He didn’t send us the cake. When we got home it was sitting on the counter. He’s been *in the house.”*

“Are there any signs of a break-in?”

“Uh…you can look.”

Reluctantly the man stepped outside and walked the perimeter of our house, checking the doors and windows for evidence of forced entry. A few minutes later he was standing in our doorway.

“Nothing,” he said.

“No scratches or stray paper clips?”

“None that I can see.”

“Is there anything you can do?” Clara chimed in.

“I can file a report. That’s it.”

“That’s it?” I said. “Can’t you do an investigation? Or could you send a guy out here to watch the house for a night or something?”

The officer stepped back onto the porch. “Since there’s no evidence of illegal activity, we can’t launch an investigation. All I can do is file a report.”

“The fucking cake isn’t evidence?”	“I’m afraid it’s not.”

“Bullshit,” Clara mumbled.

“If anything else happens, call us.” He turned, walked back to his car, and drove off.

Clara watched the cruiser with seething anger in her eyes. I sighed and dropped onto the couch. 

“We might as well eat the cake now,” I groaned.

“No! What if it’s poisoned or drugged?”

“Fair enough.”

That night we went out for dinner. I triple checked all the locks before we left. Still felt like I was leaving the house wide open, though.

It was hard to focus on the burger and fries in front of me when all I could think about was how infuriating the conversation with the police officer had been. Clara felt the same way.

“What do we do now?” She asked, taking a half-hearted bite.

“Wait till there’s evidence, I guess,” I replied.

“That’s so stupid. There is 100% some kind of evidence that he could investigate. It’s just so…”

“I know.”	We ate in silence for a minute. Then she broke the silence.

“I think someone’s been following me home.”

“What?” I leaned forward instinctively.

“Wait, wait,” she sighed. “I don’t want to you to get all—like this.”

“Like this? Like what?”

“I don’t know for sure. I just feel like I’ve noticed a car tailing me the last few days. Maybe I’m crazy. I probably shouldn’t have mentioned it.”

“Crazy? You know some guy is creeping around the house.”

“You’re right. I just didn’t want to worry you.”

“Why are you so…scared of me? I don’t get it.”

“I’m not scared of you.”

“You keep hiding these things from me that are really worrying you. That’s not healthy, right?”

“You never really ask.”

“I never ask? Can’t you just tell me?”

“You should be able to tell on your own.”

“You’re saying I should just know?”

“You never notice the details and it really pisses me off sometimes,” she said, raising her voice slightly. Then she shook her head and lowered her volume again. “Actually, just…forget I said anything.”

“This is a serious situation, Clara. You’re being stalked! Can’t we talk about this like adults?”

“Are you saying I’m a child?”

“No, I’m not.”

“That’s what that sounds like.”

“Just forget it.” I wanted to crush my styrofoam cup in my hand.

“Whatever.”

We drove home in silence. Clara mumbled that we should go to a hotel instead, but by that time it was late and there were no hotels nearby where we could get a room. Besides, we probably couldn’t afford it. I said I’d keep awake for her, but that wasn’t much of a comfort.

Everything looked normal at the house, at least. Besides the cake that was still on the counter, nothing was out of place. We settled into bed, and I prepared to keep myself awake for the night. I figured it would make work the next day a challenge, but it was worth it just in case.

I remember playing Solitaire on my phone. Then the smoke detector went off. 

Clara jolted awake and screamed. I shook my head back and forth and tried to grab my phone, which was buried somewhere in the sheets. I realized I’d fallen asleep.

The shrill beeping sound hurt my ears. My heart was pounding like a kettle drum. Clara turned on the light in the room, and I decided to give up on finding my phone. Standing up, I charged into the house, ready for anything. Had someone set our house on fire? At this point, anything was on the table, I thought—but when I made it into the kitchen and flicked the light switch, I stopped cold.

There were hundreds of sheets of pink paper taped all around the kitchen. The walls, the counter, the door frame, the ceiling, even—every inch of it was covered in pink paper. Looking closer, I realized each of them were cut into the same shape. A heart.

So much time and effort had to go into this. And for what?

Clara came up behind me, shouting something over the still beeping smoke detector, but she stopped her sentence halfway through when she saw the state of the kitchen. I grabbed her, worried she was about to faint.

We didn’t say anything for a while, just listened to the constant beep coming from the ceiling.

Finally, I said, “Should we call the police again?”

“Just turn off that fucking beep sound!” She screamed.

She wrenched away from me and ran to the couch, where she promptly curled up and started crying. For a second I just stood there, torn between stopping the alarm and comforting her.  Finally I slid a chair up to the wall and climbed up to the smoke detector.

There was a little switch on it, with three options: off, auto, and test. It was on the test setting, and when I switched it to auto, the sound ceased. Whoever covered our kitchen in paper hearts had set off the smoke detector as well.

With the sound off and the house in total silence, I could finally breathe normally again. Sitting down on the chair, I tried to think of what to do next. The police weren’t much help earlier, but this was way more noticeable. Surely this would warrant some kind of investigation, right? Or should I just stay up and see if the stalker tries to come by again? I could take him out myself.

“Do you think he’s still here?” Clara whispered.

I hadn’t thought about that. 

Immediately I searched the house, but couldn’t find anyone. I checked under the bed and in the cabinets too, just in case, but no one was there. The intruder had disappeared into the night.

When I found Clara again she was sitting upright, texting on her phone. She looked up at me, eyes bloodshot and tears running down her face.

“I’m going to Sarah’s house,” she sniffled. Sarah is her sister.

I didn’t say anything, but followed silently as Clara stood and made her way to her car. She was making the right decision. She was clearly not happy with me, and as long as she was safe I figured a little space would help us a lot. Now we could both think about our next move without arguing with each other. 

Before she drove off, Clara made sure to search every inch of the car, just in case someone was hiding in there. Smart.

After that, she drove away.

After watching her leave, I was scared to go back inside. For a while, I just stood leaning against the door, trying to think of a solution to the problem. It was so cold that I could see my breath, but that didn’t matter to me. I just didn’t want to confront those sheets of pink paper. 

We couldn’t afford to just move away. We could stay with family members for little while like Clara was doing, but not for long since none of our relatives live near the places where we work. Options were limited since the police weren’t helping much.

I wanted to stop this for good. I wanted our lives to get back to normal.

Breathing in sharply, I pushed open the door and went inside. It was eerie, all alone in the dark, stepping over dozens of heart shaped papers. I expected someone to jump out of the shadows and attack me, but no one did.

In our bedroom, I found my phone lying on the floor. I checked the doorbell camera app, but there was no motion detected at any point. I scrubbed the footage, but found nothing.

It was 2 AM, and I had work on the morning. After what had just happened, I didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in my bed.

Exhausted and not willing to drive anywhere, I just crawled into our closet and shut the door. The floor wasn’t comfortable at all but I was so tired that I just fell asleep immediately.

When I woke up it was still dark outside. I spat out the fuzz from the carpet and tried to sit up. My back was insanely sore from the position I’d been curled up in. I fumbled around the closet, trying to find my phone. I found it and checked the time. The light was blinding, but I was able to read 5:30 AM. It felt like I hadn’t slept at all.

The light from the phone lit up the wall of the closet. Even though my eyes were still adjusting, I thought I noticed something weird on the wall. It was dark, and about the size of a credit card. I touched it and found empty space. It was a hole that I’d never noticed before.

For whatever reason I reached further in and started fumbling around in the gap. In a couple seconds there was a loud cracking sound and a huge piece of the wall fell inward.

I stood up so fast I slammed my head into the bar we hang clothes on. Once I’d turned on the light I shoved the clothes out of the way and crouched down to investigate further.

The part of the wall I pushed in looked like some kind of panel that was made of a slightly different material. We’d never noticed it before, probably because it was hidden behind our clothes. I poked my head inside and found a decent sized space on the other side of the wall. It wasn’t huge but it could easily fit a person standing up. Using my phone flashlight I got to my feet inside of the space.

All I noticed were the pieces of paper taped to the walls. At least a dozen of them, scattered around in a type of collage.

I plucked off one of the sheets of paper to look at it, and my heart dropped. 

It was a photo of Clara. Taken from outside our house, looking in through an open window.

There were more pictures, each of them more terrifying than the last as they grew closer and closer to her. Some showed her in her car, on the way to work. One of them was taken behind the bushes next to the front door of her office building, showing her unlocking the door. Another showed her on a walk by herself—this one was taken from inside a car.

But they got worse.

There was a photo of our bed, while we were both asleep. And another of Clara doing laundry. And another of Clara and me making out on the couch.

All of those were taken from inside the house.

*How did I never notice?*

I crouched back down again and stared through the open space in the closet wall. It offered a perfect view of our bed. I felt something on the floor and held it up to the light. It was a pair of my wife’s panties. I dropped it, my stomach churning.

I climbed back out and put the loose panel back where it was. Now the tiny gap in the wall I’d used to find the panel seemed so obviously out of place.

Without waiting a second I called the police. They promised to send an officer over immediately. I thanked the operator, then called Clara. She didn’t pick up, though.

I tried again a few times, but Clara still wouldn’t pick up. Was she still upset with me? Or was something else going on?

I called Sarah, Clara’s sister. She answered after only a few rings, in spite of the time.

“Hello?” 

“Hey, Sarah? Have you heard from Clara at all today?” I tried to keep my voice calm.

“No…I haven’t talked to her in a while.”

My mouth felt dry. “She was heading over to your house really early this morning. I wanted to make sure she’s okay.”

“Uh, she’s not here right now, and well…this is the first I’m hearing of her coming over.”

I nearly dropped my phone. I realized then how hard I was shaking.

“If you see her, will you call me?”

“Sure.”

The call [dropped.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Buy-1233/comments/o5u4t1/notify_me/)
