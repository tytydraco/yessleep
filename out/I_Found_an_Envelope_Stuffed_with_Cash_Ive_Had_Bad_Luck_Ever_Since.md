The trouble started on New Year’s Day. 
 
I was making a deposit at a local bank machine. The envelope was lying on the ground, amidst a pile of bank receipts, with a boot print stamped on it. Poking out of the envelope was a twenty-dollar bill. I hurried over and snatched it up. To my amazement, the envelope was stuffed with twenties. 

Since no one was around, I shoved the envelope into my coat pocket, and drove home. Once home, I plopped the bundle of bills onto the kitchen table and counted them. It came to exactly one thousand dollars. My mind exploded with possibilities. Concocting money-spending ideas would require caffeine, so I brewed a fresh pot of coffee. As I was spooning sugar into my mug, something caught my eye: a note.
 
The note was taped to the inside of the envelope, written in fancy red cursive: ENJOY YOUR NEWFOUND FORTUNE. BUT SPEND IT WISELY.
 
What does this mean exactly? Yes, the money was fantastic, don’t get me wrong, but it certainly wasn’t a fortune. I had no clue what the note meant. Nor did I care. Any thought of returning the money died right there. Things were finally going my way.  

Oh, how wrong I was. 
  
I spent the day watching Netflix, munching popcorn and sipping cokes (more caffeine, always more), while considering the cash.
 
One thousand dollars is an interesting amount of money: it’s not enough to save (or so I told myself); nor is it enough for any major purchases (a new car would be nice, so would a trip to the Bahamas). But it was enough to treat myself to something special. 
 
On my way to work the following morning, I stopped for coffee, and paid with a crisp, clean twenty. I left the change, which caused the barista to blush. Then, as I pulled out onto the road, feeling elated, a blue SUV cut me off. As a result, I spilled the scolding coffee onto my crotch. Pain was instantaneous. While panicking, I swerved onto the sidewalk and drove over a dog. 

I quickly pulled over and got out of the car, wet spot and all. The dog – a Dalmatian – was bleeding, its hind legs looked like pretzels. The poor thing was whimpering pathetically. My heart broke in two. The dog owner – a bulging bearded man – was going ballistic. The skulls on his knuckles caught my attention. So did the patch on his motorcycle jacket. 

Meanwhile, the blue SUV, which caused this mess, sped off into the sunrise. 

The biker charged. Spittle and phlegm flew furiously from his bearded face. His hands were claws, ready to strangle me. Clearly, this man meant me harm. 
 
Someone must’ve called the cops, because they arrived just in time, and the berating biker was subdued. We were interrogated. Ultimately, I was given a stern warning: Don’t drink coffee while driving. The cops said they would deal with the blue SUV later, but I had my doubts. 

Before I left, the biker said if he ever saw me again, he’d carve out my eyeballs and shove them up my wazoo (his exact words).
 
Dreadfully, I drove to work, where I got reprimanded for being late. Making matters worse, my boss took one look at my soiled crotch and told me I was fired. I wasn’t exactly in his good books to begin with, and this was the final straw.
 
Head down and unhappy, I collected my belongings and hunkered home. The envelope greeted me, missing a twenty, which I’d used for the crotchety coffee. I ordered a pizza. When the pizza arrived, I grabbed two twenties from the envelope and paid the pizza delivery guy, tipping him handsomely.
 
After scarfing down half the pizza, I settled in front of my laptop and went job hunting, feeling more miserable than ever. At some point, I fell asleep, and woke up feeling noxious. 
 
I groaned. Something was wrong. My stomach and bowels belched simultaneously. Cold sweat stung my eyes. I raced to the toilet, barely making it in time. Cheese and dough and meat spewed from my face. After an abominable bout of barfing, I prayed to the porcelain god: “Please oh please make this suffering stop.” 

It didn’t. 
 
The following day, I set out to deliver some resumes. My first stop was at a local gas station. Not only did I need to fill up, but this gas station was always hiring, so I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone. 

Big mistake.
 
The guy behind the counter snatched my resume. “It’s your lucky day, bro,” he said. “You can start right now.”
 
I agreed. In college I’d worked at a gas station, so I was certainly qualified. Besides, it’s not rocket science. Heck, I won’t even have to pump gas, only sell snacks and smokes and lottery tickets. Easy-peasy. After gathering my info, he showed me how to use the till, gave me some pointers, then left, saying he’d be back soon. He just needed to run some errands.
 
He never returned. But guess who did? 

The biker.
 
The biker stepped off the Harley and filled it. He looked larger than I’d remembered. And meaner. I started trembling. “Please,” I prayed, “don’t let the biker enter the store.”

The biker entered the store. He ambled through the selection of snacks, taking his sweet time. Then, after grabbing a bag of Pringles and a two-liter bottle of Pepsi, he approached the counter. Once he saw me, his jaw dropped.
 
“Well, well,” he sneered in his husky voice. “Lookie what we have here.” 

His murderous eyes were burning into mine. I looked away. My heart was pounding through my sweater. My bladder was about to burst. Why on green earth did I take this shift?
 
“I told you never to show your face again,” the biker snapped. “You killed my dog.” His face grew redder and redder. “Buster was my best friend.” 
 
“I…. well, you see….” I had no words. One look in his eyes told me everything I needed to know: He meant to kill me.
 
He ordered a carton of smokes, paid in cash, then to my amazement, he turned and left, cursing under his breath.
 
I sighed. That was a close call. A family had walked in, the boy wearing his hockey jersey, the father and mother squabbling over something stupid. I rang in their order, still reeling from my recent brush with death.
 
The day flew by. Then, at seven o'clock, someone named Asad took over. He looked at me with suspicion, then told me how to clock out. I couldn't leave soon enough.
 
Guess who was waiting for me?
 
The biker. 
 
I was beaten to a bloody pulp, suffering a busted nose, two black eyes and a concussion. My ribs hurt like hell. So did the rest of me. I don’t remember much after that. Only that I was whisked to the hospital and patched up. Sometime after midnight, an Uber took me home.
 
Two days later, still suffering from intense pain, I returned to the gas station to fetch my car. It wasn’t there. My car was stolen.
 
After an arduous week, my bruises and body began to mend. My mind, on the other hand, did not. I was a disaster, growing more and more paranoid. What next? I thought, sinking in self-pity. Then, out of the blue, Cindy Evans, a woman whom I’d known for years, reached out. She wanted to meet up at a pub. “Great,” I told her. “My treat.”
 
We met up later that night. She looked fabulous, as always. My face was slightly bruised, and she was quick to administer some affection. We racked up quite the bill, eating and drinking, reminiscing about old times. 

Then the bartender handed me the bill.

I went for my wallet, and panicked. “This must be a mistake.” I checked again and again. “My wallet should be in my back pocket.” 

Cindy rolled her eyes. 

“I swear I brought it!”
 
Frantically, I searched the dirty pub floor. Then I scoured the restroom. Nothing.
 
When I returned, Cindy was eyeballing me, nervously. “Is everything alright?” she asked, while twirling her long, red hair. 
 
I shrugged. There was a lump in my throat as big as a Texas porterhouse. My mind was going a million miles an hour. Where the hell is my damned wallet? Not only was my cash in it, but also my bank card, credit card, drivers’ license. You name it.
 
Cindy, growing anxious and annoyed, kept asking what the problem was. Her freckled face matched her fiery red hair. Her mouth tightened, like she’d swallowed a lemon. Not a good combo. 

“Um, I swear I had my wallet on me when I got here,” I managed to say. “With PLENTY of cash!”
  
Cindy’s arms folded. She called me a deadbeat, then she stormed out of the pub. I couldn’t blame her. All evening, I’d been telling her to indulge; to order as much as her pretty heart desired. Now this.

The bartender declared Last Call, regarding me with suspicion. When I told her my sticky situation, she made a huge fuss. A couple goons approached, asking if there was a problem. The bartender huffed and puffed, indicating that yes, there was a problem. The goons grabbed my collar and shoved me against the bar. These goons were drunk, and spoiling for a fight. Suddenly, I had two problems. (Three if you include Cindy.) 

I prepared for pain. Fortunately (if that word is even permissible in this situation), the bartender diffused the situation, telling us to take it outside. After she gets paid, of course. The goons grumbled as they plunked onto the bar stools, keeping a close eye on me.
 
Think! I told myself. Then it hit me: I could go home, grab some cash, and pay her. I’d have to order an Uber, both ways, but what the heck. I pleaded my case. The bartender was unimpressed, her hands crunched into tiny balls of rage. 
 
“Honest,” I pleaded. “I have the cash. At home.”
 
“Go.” The bartender pointed to the exit, shaking her head. 

I hurried home and grabbed enough cash to leave a generous tip. Then, as the driver approached the pub, we were blindsided by a black pickup truck. Both my legs were crushed.
 
I spent a painful month in the hospital. When I checked, my money was gone. The driver must’ve stolen it. Why was I NOT surprised? 
 
When I finally got home, I could barely walk. The following two weeks were hell. Not only was I injured, I was terrified to leave home. Bad luck had found me. 

Then it clicked: The money was jinxed. 
 
The envelope was on the table, mocking me. “Spend me,” it said. “Treat yourself.” 

“Stupid money,” I blurted. “This is all your fault!” In a frenzy, I threw the envelope across the kitchen, cursing and crying and carrying on. All rationality was gone. I was miserable and afraid, raging uncontrollably.
 
When my hissy fit finally ended, my floor was besieged with twenty-dollar bills. The note was peeking from the envelope. I examined it. That’s when I noticed something disturbing: The note wasn’t written in red ink. The note was written in blood.
 
I panicked. My heart about to burst. Oh, how I hated that money. One thought captured my crapulous cranium: Get Rid of the Damned Money. NOW!
 
So, I did.
 
Evening was fast approaching. A bitter chill settled over the city. The full moon hung overhead like an omen. Wrapped in warm clothing, I set off to the bank. Depositing the money into my saving account was the logical choice. Out of sight, out of mind. 

This time, I walked. Time to test out my battered legs. 
 
The walk was painful but I soldiered on. As I approached the bank, I had a change of heart. Across the street was a music store, selling low-end guitars and musical accessories. Surely, a brand-new guitar would bring happiness. I limped across the street. 
  
Just then, a group of motley-looking misfits rounded the corner. There wore face coverings and dark hoodies. One of them pointed at me. The others snickered. They were taking up the entire sidewalk, daring me to pass.
 
When I tried to pass, I was tripped. 
 
“Where d’ya think yer going?” 

My face crashed against the cold pavement. The motley gang advanced. I was forced to my feet, with a knife jammed against my throat. 

“Empty yer pockets.”
 
Although I couldn’t see their faces, their eyes were deranged. 
 
“Now, bitch!”
 
The gang of motleys cackled.
 
I scanned the vicinity, searching for rescue. The streets were barren. It was too cold for stragglers. I was helpless.
 
The knife tickled my throat. It’s long and slender blade glistened under the glow of the Snow Moon. I gulped. One wrong move and I’m dead. Shakily, I emptied my pockets. My keys spilled onto the slushy sidewalk. So did the cash.
 
“You rich, eh?” They counted the cash, walloping like hyenas. “This is our money, now!”

I shrugged. “Enjoy your newfound fortune,” I said. “But spend it [wisely.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
