A few years ago, an old high school friend reached out. Said he needed my help. He remembered my obsession with spy gear… movies, books, gadgets, the whole Cold War fantasy. He knew I had equipment, the kind that let you listen to people without them knowing. A tiny bug, small enough to vanish under a lapel, picking up every whisper.  
Truth was, I’d left all that behind. Grew up. Got married. Had two kids. My spy junk sat somewhere in the attic, buried under old Christmas decorations and broken toys. Dusty relics of a boy who thought he’d grow up to be James Bond. But my friend’s story? That was something else. It didn’t just make me want to dig out the equipment… it made me want in. It woke something up in me.  
Of course, I had my doubts. Always did. I liked watching people take risks in movies. Never wanted to be the guy taking them. My life was stable, predictable. Safe. But then he mentioned money. A thick stack of cash, just for helping him. That’s when I said yes.  
My friend, Jake, wasn’t married, but he was that guy. The one who knew everyone, volunteered for charities, helped the helpless. A real saint. One of his friends… also a do-gooder… had gone missing. A woman from an organization that checked in on lonely old folks, the ones society forgot. She’d gone to stay with some old man in a house deep in the woods. Just a few days, to make sure he was okay on his own. Then she stopped answering calls. The other volunteers went to check, and the old man told them she’d never been there. The cops found nothing. Dead end.  
So Jake decided to go himself. Undercover. Make the old man talk, one way or another. We planned it out… he’d pose as a tax inspector, shake the guy up, make him nervous. If the old man had something to hide, he’d slip up. Jake would be all smiles, reassuring, the kind of guy you’d want to bribe just to make your problems go away. Meanwhile, I’d be in a van nearby, listening… recording everything.  
It worked better than expected. The old man… Walter Price… warmed up to Jake. Invited him to dinner.  
That’s where it all went to hell.  
Rather than tell you, I’ll just play you the last part of the recording. You’ll understand.

\[Transcript Begins\]  
Walter: More white wine, Mr. Carter?

Jake: Sure… it’s great. Walter, you’ve lived alone for a while?

Walter: Years… my family’s all dead. They left me behind.

Jake: No visitors?

Walter: Just those charity people… always coming around, treating me like I can’t take care of myself. They think I need help. But I don’t.

Jake: So they come often?

Walter: There was one last week. A little fat one. Annoying as hell. More meat?

Jake: Yes, please. Annoying how? Did she try to make you leave your home?

Walter: No, no… it was how she talked. Kids these days, they don’t speak right. The way they talk on TV… it makes my blood boil. I could kill them for it.

Jake: Did she talk like that?

Walter: All the time. Every other word was “literally.” She was “literally” in tears watching the news. “Literally” dying of laughter at something not even funny. She said it so much, I couldn’t take it anymore. Two days of that nonsense…

Jake: And then she left?

Walter: Left? Oh no… I made sure she used the word correctly, at least once.

Jake: Meaning…?

Walter: Well… she said, “I’m LITERALLY cooking in this heat.”

Jake: …

Walter: So I put her in the oven.

Jake: No… no, no…

Walter: Eat up. It’s good meat. Tender. Like pork.

Jake: I…

Walter: Drink your wine. It’s special… Lethal, even. Literally.

That was the last time I saw Jake.  
People ask me why I didn’t save him. Because, like I said, I’m a coward. I probably could’ve helped. Maybe. But by the time I heard what was happening, he’d already swallowed the poison.  
So I ran.  
I handed the recording to the police. They raided Walter’s house. Found the woman… what was left of her… in the fridge. Found her bones buried out back.  
Jake? He was still being butchered when they kicked in the door.  
And that was the last time I ever played spy.
