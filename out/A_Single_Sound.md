Drip.

My music was transitioning between songs, allowing me to hear it.  I took my headphones off for a second, waiting for it again.

“Must have been hearing things.” I thought aloud, placing the music back on my ears.  

I took a deep breath, observing the drawing below me.  The graceful girl held the rose so elegantly in front of the glass wall.  Something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  That’s it!  Her finger looks off!

“Argh!” I shouted, aggressively snatching my eraser.  



After a few hours of re-drawing, specifically her fingers and the rose stem, due to it disappearing along with the fingers, I finally finished the sketch.

“What time is it?” I sighed, bringing my wrist to my tired eyes.  “Two thirty-six.  Wonderful.  I shouldn’t be complaining too much.  The amount I’m getting paid for this is astronomical.”

I got up from the floor and stretched.  The most pain was in my legs, due to the hours I spent crossed-legged.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, only then realizing how tired I was.

Drip.

There it was again.  “Did I leave a faucet running?” I asked the air, looking in the direction of my door.

Yawning, I made my way over there.  Silence was the only thing that greeted me along with the creaking of opening the small door.  Cracking my neck, I walked out and made my way to the bathroom.

I splashed some water on my face and turned the handles as tight as they go to make sure it wasn’t the cause of the sound.  After drying my face with a towel that desperately needed to be washed, I headed down the compact hallway to the kitchen.

“Creepy.” I muttered under my breath, walking to the sink, slightly holding my arms in fear.  The kitchen was always a creepy experience, there being too many shadows, and a slight glow from the window probably from streetlamps a few blocks down.  Not fun when you get some taquitos out of the fridge for dinner at one thirty and then turn around to see a pitch-black hallway, waiting for you to return.

I tightened the handles of the faucet and waited for the sound again.  After nothing transpired, I headed back to my room, through the pitch-black hallway.

Drip.

I froze in my place.  “Didn’t I just-” I thought to myself.  I took a deep breath and despite my annoyance, headed back to my room.

Doing my nightly ritual of four eye drops in each of mine, I snuggled up in my covers afterward.  My mind kept racing.  I still have to ink the drawing, color it, and do all the payment documentation for it.  Stupid video editor only gave me a three day limit.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to calm down a bit more.

Drip.

“Okay!” I shouted, springing up from my bed.  “I can not sleep with this damn noise!”

I sprinted to the bathroom and turned the handles off as much as I could.  Going to the kitchen, I desperately replicated my previous action.

Back at my room, I plopped face-down on the bed.  I flung my arm off and reached for my headphones on the floor, just in case the dripping sound persisted.

The recognizable sound of “Roundabout” acted as a lullaby.  Despite my imagination running wild due to the late time, I managed to almost fall into a complete slumber. 

Drip.

My eyes shot open.  “Where is it coming from?!” my mind seemed to scream.  “What could be causing it?!”

I ran into the hallway and stood in silence, hopelessly waiting for any clue to its whereabouts.

Drip.

“This can’t be possible.” I said to myself.  “The sound is coming from all around me.”

Sprinting to the bathroom, I burned a hole into the sink with my eyes, praying this was the cause.

Drip.

The sink stayed still, just as it had been before.

“The kitchen!” I screamed, propelling myself forward with the help of the door frame.  With my determination and speed, I tripped as soon as I met the mat in front of the sink.  I was sent forward, landing on the floor, the side of my face throbbing.

Regardless of the blood running from my nose I hastily got back up to stare at the faucet.

“Just drip!” I possibly exclaimed in my head.  I don’t even know where my voice was coming from by this point.

“Please just see the water flow down so this can all be over!  Drip, dammit!  Drip!”

Drip.

But it was only the sound, playing from no particular direction.

Drip.

I tried to cover my ears from the now piercing sound.

Drip.

Shut up.

Drip.

Shut up!

Drip.

I screamed, trying to drown out the sound.

Drip.  Drip.

I sprinted back to my room as quickly as I could, as fast as my feet would carry me.  My hands would not suffice to block out the sound.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

Stop!  Stop!  Stop!

I picked up my slightly blunt drawing pencil and aimed it at my ear canal.

Drip, drip, drip, drip.

In and out, in and out, in and out.

Drip, drip, drip, drip.

In and out, in and out, like a butter churn.  Like a pencil sharpener.  I wonder if my pencil will sharpen in my ear.

Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

Hahahaha.  Fucking video editor and their unrealistic deadlines.

Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

Oh no, the drawing has a strange crimson color dripped on it.

Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

Hahahahahahahah, drip, drip drip!  Shut up, shut up, shut up, stop sound.

Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

Ah!  I can still hear it!  Other ear time!  Yay!

In, out, in, out, in, out, stab, in, out, in, out, in, stab, stab, out, in, out, in, out, stab, stab, stabby, stab, in, out, in, out.

Drip, drip, drip, drip, stab, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, in, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, out, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, stab, drip, drip, drip, stab, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, stab, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, stab, drip, drip, drip, stab.



Suddenly I stopped.  I brought my hand away from my head.  What used to be a pencil looked like shattered glass, some pieces lodged in the crevices of my palm and fingers.  Most of my hand turned red, the same color now stained on my drawing.

“Ow.” I said aloud, attempting to move my hand.

I suddenly gasped.  I know I said it out loud but I didn’t hear anything!  That sound is gone now!  I’m free from the terrible noise!

I took a few deep breaths, ignoring the throbbing and pain located on the sides of my skull.  It didn’t matter though.  I was free from the sound.  Forever.



Drip.
