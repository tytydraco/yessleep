Thank you to everyone who replied to my original post. I didn’t expect so many responses, and I appreciate the advice, though some of it has made me even more paranoid. A lot of you said we should leave immediately, and trust me, I want to, but there’s a problem.

The snowstorm hit last night, and now we’re stuck. I can’t see more than a few feet outside the cabin, and the roads are completely buried. Our car’s snowed in, and there’s no way we can hike out in this weather. The storm wasn’t supposed to be this bad, but it came out of nowhere. We’re trapped here.

Sarah’s gotten worse. She barely speaks to me, and when she does, it’s in short, cryptic phrases. She keeps talking about “them” being closer. She says she can feel them just outside the cabin. I’ve caught her standing by the window again, staring into the whiteout. Sometimes she whispers to herself, but I can’t make out what she’s saying. It sounds…off, like she’s speaking in a language I’ve never heard.

I’ve tried asking her directly who “they” are, but she just shakes her head and says, “You can’t see them yet. They don’t want you.”

I’ve been hearing the voices again, too. Faint, just outside, but this time it’s different. Last night, while Sarah was asleep (or at least I think she was asleep), I heard them right at the edge of the cabin. It was like they were just beyond the walls, their whispers blending with the wind. But here’s the thing—I could swear I heard my own name.

That’s when I really started to panic. It wasn’t just random noises anymore. They were calling me.

I grabbed a flashlight and decided to check outside, thinking maybe it was just animals or something causing the noise, trying to convince myself it was all in my head. I don’t know why I thought it would help, but I had to do something. I bundled up, stepped out onto the porch, and shined the light into the trees.

The snow was coming down hard, and everything looked surreal, like the world was wrapped in a thick, white blanket. But then I saw something.

Footprints.

They were faint, half-covered by snow, but they were there. The same strange tracks I had seen around Sarah before—small, misshapen, too many toes. They led away from the cabin, disappearing into the storm. I didn’t follow them. I couldn’t. The dread in my stomach was too heavy, like something was telling me not to go any further.

When I went back inside, Sarah was awake. She was standing in the middle of the room, her face pale, her eyes wide. “They were calling you,” she whispered, almost in a trance. “They want you now.”

I haven’t slept since. I’ve tried to stay awake, but I’m exhausted, mentally and physically. The whispers haven’t stopped. They’re constant now, like they’re circling the cabin, closing in. I’ve blocked all the windows with whatever I could find, but I still feel like I’m being watched.

And Sarah… she’s different. There’s something in her eyes that wasn’t there before, something dark. She’s still talking about “them,” but now she’s smiling when she says it. Not a comforting smile—more like she knows something I don’t, like she’s waiting.

I don’t know how much longer we can stay here. The storm hasn’t let up, but I’m starting to think the storm is the least of our problems. I’ve been hearing things scratching at the door.

I’m scared to leave, but I’m even more scared of what might happen if we stay.

Has anyone else heard of something like this? People keep mentioning legends or folklore, but I don’t even know what to believe anymore. I just want to get out of here, but I don’t know how. What do I do?
