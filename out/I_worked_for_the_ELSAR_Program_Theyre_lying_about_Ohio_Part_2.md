If all goes well, this will be the last time you’ll hear from me.

I’ve been preparing for days now, planning routes with Sasha, stealing a few license plates from a local scrap yard, and pulling as much cash as I can without arousing suspicion. It’s a shame, really. Most of the $250,000 in my bank account will stay there, untouched, since there’s no way I can take it all and not alert ELSAR. They’ve been tailing me ever since I left the work site, and I know they’re monitoring my bank account. But I can siphon out enough to get us far from our apartment to a new home, a new life, and a fresh start.

Sasha is out cold, curled up under her favorite fuzzy blanket in bed, and I don’t want to wake her until I have to. I’ve been slowly moving our sleep schedule one hour at a time over the past few days, so that by the time I’m ready to put my plan into motion, it’ll happen when the people watching us least suspect it.

So, for now, I sit here at my desk, typing this out with the shades drawn and the door locked. Once this is over, it’s time for a few hours of shut eye, then drive-nap-eat-and-repeat. Until then, I’ll pour as much as I can remember into this dusty old laptop, with the hopes that someone out there can use this information for good.

After leaving the others, I followed Thirty-Six further and further into the dark interior of the ship. More long, tight passages snaked between thick steel bulkheads, some with painted warning signs, others with cheery navy posters or even the occasional pinup girl. Something about the way they watched us from the old paper unnerved me, the smiles strained, the irises dark and unfeeling. Silence permeated the air, only broken by our footsteps, and the footsteps of the other teams echoing through the metal hull from all over the ship. Every breath I took became an abomination, some horrible misdeed that would surely bring judgment raining down on my head like the massive shells from the battleship’s main guns.

*Relax. You’re just on edge because of that garbage Nine was saying. Talk to Thirty-Six, that always calms you down.*

“So,” I cleared my throat, and squinted into the dark with nervous caution. “You think it was aliens?”

Thirty-Six laughed, a booming, fatherly chuckle that rang down the empty halls of the Seraphim. “No. Nine and Fifteen have colorful imaginations, but I’m afraid they’re both mistaken.”

Reassured and curious by the confident way he spoke, I fell into step with Thirty-Six, and began to ignore the murky doorways we passed on either side. “So, what’s your theory?”

He paused at an intersection and met my inquisitive eyes with his gray ones. “Have you ever heard of the term *equilibrium*?”

I frowned behind my gas mask. “Isn’t that like balance?”

“Exactly that.” Thirty-Six went right, down a corridor lined with big pipes that ran horizontal to the floor. “Balance in all things. Take a ship, for example. It needs balance so it doesn’t roll over on the water. So, you add weights to make it sit lower in the water, but not so much that it actually sinks. Your objective is to float, but in order to float, you sometimes have to sink.”

Stepping over another bulkhead threshold, I blinked at a burst of lightheadedness, and trailed after him. “But how does that get a ship into the woods?”

My perception of sound started to fade, and I noticed that my headlamp had grown dimmer, though Thirty-Six’s flashlight had not. A familiar static crept up in my brain again, and I almost didn’t catch Thirty-Six making a left turn at a set of downward stairs.

“If an apple falls from a tree, does it go up, or down?”

“Down.” I grimaced at a slight hum in my ears but could only shake my head at it in irritation, since the suit hood blocked my fingers from checking my ear canals.

“Indeed.” Thirty-Six descended further into the bowels of the ship, my light flickering to a pitiful gasp, while his stayed bright as a shooting star. “Nature seeks balance, and when things are out of balance, it restores them in the only way it knows how. But what happens if the curtain of reality, the fabric that holds together what you know of as real, tears? Things slip through, fall out of this reality, and into another. An imbalance is created. And so, nature must do what it does best; restore balance.”

Hushed static turned to thunderous waves in my skull that demanded to be released, and my ears itched so bad that my head hurt. Still, I stumbled along after Thirty-Six, my headlamp going out, with only his soft voice and blinding white flashlight to guide me.

Thirty-Six ran an affectionate hand over the walls, as though exploring an old family home. “The crew of this vessel didn’t intend for this to happen any more than the soldiers outside intended for them to crash-land it here. But something equally massive must have fallen out of this world, in order for a ship this size to fall into it. However, it seems the crew stumbled through a different rift than the Seraphim, and for that, their world lies in peril.”

At the hall’s end, he ducked into a large steel door the size of a pick-up truck, and my eardrums rippled with roars of undulating static. My mind reeled, bombarded by eerie screams of strange, warbled fuzz, and ice clogged my veins in a belated form of confusion. Yet, in the midst of my mental fog, something pierced the chaotic storm, like a beacon in the night.

*Beep. Beep-beep. Beep, beep, beep.*

“The sounds . . . I hear the sounds again.” I leaned against the bulkhead for support. My legs fell asleep, and a numbness inched up my body with slow, but malicious progress. It took every ounce of strength I had to lift my feet, which seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, and drag myself into the room behind Thirty-Six. Cold air drained my body of heat, and every joint locked up with stiffness. My vision blurred, and I saw Sasha’s warm smile, her dancing blue eyes, tasted her sweet lips on mine.

*I’m so tired, Sasha. So cold. I’ll just rest for a bit . . .*

“Not yet, Greg.” Thirty-Six caught my arm, and kept me from falling on my face, his words soothing and kind. “Not today. You have work to do. Look.”

At his command, my headlamp flared to life, the static died in my head, and I sucked in a gasp of air through my mask.

In front of me, an array of complicated switchboards, dials, and controls waited, all the bulbs lit up like a Christmas tree. Newspaper clippings hung from a large cork board bolted to the cramped walls of the compartment, along with a few black and white photographs of smiling, voluptuous pinup girls. A clock built by little round dials into the console read 13:02. At the forefront of the array stood a single black metal chair, and on the desk, a set of antique black headphones.

Paralyzed by the silence of my brain clearing, I gaped at the room in awe.

*Beep.*

I recoiled from the headset in surprise.

*Beep-beep, beep.*

“A radio.” My whole body shook in perplexed fear, but a strange curiosity overrode any sense of flight. “A working radio. How is this possible?”

Thirty-Six picked up the headset, its long black rubber cable plugged into the control panel, and held it out to me. “Nature needs balance, Greg. Seven ran from it, and thus, lost himself in it. You have a choice; restore balance or plunge into the storm.”

Like a jackhammer, my heart thudded inside my chest, and I stared at the headset in his hand.

With an ominous click, the little dial clock in the panel rolled over to 13:04.

Deep inside my mind, like a flame lit in the dark, something shifted.

*Close the rift.*

As soft as a butterfly’s wingbeat, the whisper called to me, not a man or woman, but a cool, metallic voice, emotionless and yet unthreatening. It calmed my raging flood of anxiety, the ice left my veins, and the compartment seemed a little less foreign in that moment. This someone didn’t mean me any harm.

No, not someone, I realized. It was the voice of *something*.

Something enormous, cold, and made of steel.

*I hear you.*

Muscles operating on autopilot, I sat down at the desk, unzipped my protective hood, and focused all energy on my thoughts.

*I want to help.*

Without my bulky hood, the air felt cool and fresh, and dried the sweat on my neck in seconds.

*My name is Greg.*

The pulse in my temple slowed from its panicked race, and with a smile, I placed the headphones over my ears.

*What are your orders, Seraphim?*

“Twenty-Four?”

I opened my eyes and stared into the bright glare of no less than seven LED headlamps.

Eleven, Nine, Fifteen, Three, and two soldiers stared at me from the narrow doorway of the compartment, eyes wide with shock behind their mask visors. It took me a moment to realize how dark the compartment had become, the panel no longer alive with current, the bulbs and dials out. Around my ears, the black rubber headset barked forth no static, no more beeps, and the whisper in my head had vanished, along with Thirty-Six.

“Hey.” I croaked, confused and petrified, eyeing the leveled rifle barrels of the guards. “I . . . I was just . . .”

“Who were you talking to?” From behind the soldiers, the Colonel pushed into the room, and the others shrank back at his presence.

Seven’s anguished face flashed through my memories again, and I snapped my mouth shut, unable to formulate words.

He and I locked eyes, and the Colonel flexed his right hand’s grip on the service pistol he carried. “I asked you a question, Twenty-Four. Who were you trying to contact?”

*I don’t know, I don’t know, I wasn’t trying to radio anyone. Please don’t shoot me, please. I don’t want to die.*

Instead of bleating for mercy, I glanced back at the desk, clothed in shadow before me, and spotted an open logbook at my right elbow. “I . . . I came here with Thirty-Six. He and I went to investigate a sound we heard.”

Following my gaze, the Colonel saw the book, and his eyes narrowed to suspicious slits.

With the careful movements of a cat stalking a mouse, he edged around me, and picked up the logbook.

What little portion of his face I could see took on a stunned expression.

“Is this your handwriting?” The Colonel pushed the logbook at my face, and among a long series of entries, my own pencil marks lay on the paper, dashes and dots in thick, bunched patterns.

*What the . . . when did I write that? I just sat down. I didn’t even say anything over the radio.*

My face heated up, and I squirmed in my chair, too afraid and confused to think clearly. “I . . . I don’t . . . I don’t even know what that is.”

“It’s morse code.” The Colonel withdrew the book again to himself, and studied it, using the barrel of his pistol as a pointer on the pages. “R-Sixteen, look around for a code book. There should be a manual around here somewhere.”

R-Sixteen lowered his weapon with a reluctant sigh but snatched up a small blue book from the far side of the console after a few moments of searching. “Here sir.”

Tense silence followed while the Colonel worked with the logbook and pencil alongside Three far to my right. R-Sixteen and R-Twelve blocked the door behind me, their rifles still trained on my chest. Eleven, Nine, and Fifteen huddled to the left side of the compartment, watching me with half-terrified stares. It made me feel like a caged animal, and I only wished to pull my protective hood back up, run to the rainy outside world, and back home to Sasha’s waiting arms.

The pencil tumbled from the Colonel’s gloved hand.

He looked down at me, in the little metal chair, and for the first time, I caught a gleam of disbelief in his eyes. “Who did you say you were with?”

“Thirty-Six.” I coughed, my throat dry as a bone all at once. “One of the other workers in my team.”

At this, Three, Eleven, Nine, and Fifteen all shook their heads in unison.

“Twenty-Four, there is no Thirty-Six.” Three moved to rub his forehead, but couldn’t thanks to his suit, and had to cross his arms instead. “You are part of a team of four, just like everyone else. We only have thirty-two workers on our force, not thirty-six.”

Stunned, I almost fell out of my seat. “But he saved my life on the nets. I fell, and Thirty-Six helped catch me. Fifteen, tell them, you were there.”

Fifteen took an instinctive step back at the entire room now looking at him and dropped his gaze from mine to the floor. “Dude . . . *I* caught you. I was surprised I could do it too, with only one hand. There wasn’t anyone else.”

Like a thunderclap, it hit me. On the ladder, Fifteen had seemed confused at me thanking both him, and Thirty-Six, because to him, we were alone. The Colonel hadn’t been upset about the strange, retro candy bar Thirty-Six had given me for my birthday. He’d just been stunned to see candy from the 1940’s looking brand new. I was the only one who had ever spoken to Thirty-Six or included him in our team. Eleven never assigned him jobs. Nine never joked with him. Fifteen never asked him questions. Only me.

Because Thirty-Six hadn’t been there.

But before I could panic at the sheer insanity of that realization, my eyes caught a small blur of black letters stenciled on one of the Geiger counters held by the guards.

*Property of the Environmental Liminal Space Alleviation and Reduction Program.*

Just like the wording I had seen on the dosimeter on my first day.

The more I looked, the more I saw it, printed on an obscure label on the small rucksacks all of us workers had been given, stamped onto the receivers of the rifles in the guards’ hands, and etched into the handheld radio that was hooked to the Colonel’s belt. These weren’t hand-me-downs. This was company property. *We* were company property, and it occurred to me that in the entire time I’d worked here, I’d never once seen an emblem or label for the Black Crow Foundation. Only for ELSAR.

Because just like Thirty-Six, the Black Crow Foundation wasn’t real either.

*They’re not going to let me leave now. I’ll be shot, or worse. I’ll never see Sasha again.*

Tears welled up in my eyes, and I fought them in desperate panic. “Please, I’m fine, really. I’m not dangerous, really, I’m not. I’m not like Seven I . . . I don’t hear voices or anything. Please, Colonel sir, you don’t even have to pay me for today, I’ll just go.”

“Today?” The Colonel leaned down to meet my eye level, his harsh tone softened by shock. “Twenty-Four, you’ve been missing for *three* days.”

“*What?*” I pleaded, and my outstretched hands trembled with despair. “That’s not possible. It hasn’t even been an hour, I—”

“Calm down.” He placed the logbook in my lap, and the Colonel patted me on the shoulder, with an almost sympathetic touch. “Just stay calm, and no one will shoot you, alright? I need you to do something for me. Just this one thing, and you can go home, I promise. Read this.”

*Really?*

Hope and relief welled in my chest.

I snatched up the logbook, and sniffled back tears behind my gas mask. Home. I would be home by the end of the week, with Sasha, and I could put all this behind me. This entire idea had been one big lousy mistake, one I swore to myself I would never repeat.

But my eyes found the words on the translated page, and I fought to breathe.

12:19 Incoming: *BB136, come in BB136, this is CV24. We have lost visual of you in the northern quadrant of the AO, repeat, we have lost visual of you. Please confirm location, over.*

12:25 Incoming: *BB136, this is CV24, Seventh Fleet, what is your location?*

12:37 Incoming: *BB136, USS Seraphim, are you reading us, over?*

12:42 Incoming: *BB136, please confirm your location and status.*

12:46 Incoming: *BB136, be aware that multiple Soviet submarines have been reported in your vicinity. Are you under attack, over?*

13:00 Incoming: *BB136, this is Admiral Halsey, Seventh Fleet command on the USS Windham Bay. If you do not report within the next ten minutes, I will assume you have been attacked by the enemy and will engage all Soviet craft within the area of operations with our full arsenal, including our atomic systems. For the last time, USS Seraphim, please respond.*

My gaze traveled to the newspaper clippings on the wall, and a horrific dread filled my guts. Each of the headlines came from post-World War Two dates, but the events were all wrong.

*Truman vows to retake Poland from Soviets as atomic race intensifies.*

*Stalin sends warships around Midway to thwart rumored US nuclear capable warships.*

*Red Army tanks square off with Allied soldiers in deadly showdown outside Berlin.*

*Seventh Fleet sent to force Russian submarines from Pacific shipping lanes.*

The others watched my reaction with startled wonder, but for me, the truth rang like the long, screaming descent of a bomb.

“It never ended.” I whispered to myself behind the black rubber fortress of my mask. “Not for them. They just kept fighting, until . . .”

I forced myself to look down at the last message of the logbook and fought the urge to throw the little tablet.

Unlike the other entries, this line of morse code had been written in *my* handwriting.

13:04 Outgoing: *Mayday, mayday,* *Seventh Fleet, this is BB136, USS Seraphim. Do not launch your attack, I repeat, do NOT launch your attack. We are not engaged by the Soviets. Our vessel has been caught in a maelstrom at approximately 165 degrees east, and 30 degrees north. Electrical activity from the storm seems to be causing our radio to malfunction, and our lookouts report unusual waves of dangerous proportions. We are unable veer out of the path of the storm at this time and will try to ride it out. After it passes, we will rendezvous with you at Midway. This is BB136, USS Seraphim, signing off.*

I didn’t even feel the logbook slide through my fingers on its way to the cold steel floor.

Instead, I looked back at the little dial clock on the control panel and choked back a sob.

The clock had stopped on 13:04.
