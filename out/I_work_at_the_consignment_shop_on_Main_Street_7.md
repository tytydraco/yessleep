That rat bastard took my ring. That’s all he took! That silver ring with the fire emblem I got the other day, for a couple bucks. All that, for a cheap ring.

Ian installed a couple cameras around the building for me, and added one of those recording doorbells. He also replaced the lock and added a deadbolt since they didn’t seem to pick the lock or anything. They definitely didn’t force it open or I would have woken up before they came in.

Mr. Shriner called after Ian dropped me off to see how I was, which I appreciated, but sent me back to work Monday afternoon. Which was fair, and no one really came in.

Today however has been rather fun. I got a box of stuff at the shop door this morning with a note telling me to sell it, but left no name for collection. There was a handful of vintage dresses, a hat box with a lovely Jackie O style pillbox in need of a brush or something, a few pairs of pumps, and a wooden box of old jewelry. I left Shriner a message about it, and I also called the police station to let them know in case anyone reports it missing. I currently have the jewelry box up here, and I’m debating pawing through it.

I’m not gonna take anything, I just wanna see. I have gloves so I don’t leave fingerprints.

I sold one of Rooter’s wood burn plaques to this fisherman that blows through every few weeks. He was at the bait shop down the street, figured he’d stop in to find something for his wife. I don’t think she’ll be into a wood burned plaque of a trout jumping out of a pond but what do I know.

Can trout even jump?

We also had a new visitor. A squirrelly looking old man came in with a box of old tech he repaired and some tapes for them. There’s a handful of little cassette players with tapes, a VHS player and a weird one I'm not sure of. It uses a smaller, chunkier form of vhs. He asked to hold the money until it was all sold since he was going out of town but he’ll back soon. Cami seen him too but didn’t recognize him, so she thinks he’s moving to town and needs to get his things. A house in the Monroe suburb just sold, so we’re suspecting that’s where he’s going.

She’s doing alright by the way, got some of the stitches removed but she’s still rocking a bride of Frankenstein look on the rest of her arm,

I haven’t done any more looking into our research project, but I think I can butter Ian up enough to get some Shriner family history. We’ve actually become friends recently (after 3 years), and I’m glad for it. To no surprise I’m guessing, I’m not the most social of critters. I talk to my regulars, but I don’t exactly have anyone to call and say “hey, want to watch some movies tonight? Split a pizza?”  Who knew town wide pandamonium would be a friend maker?

My take out is here, so De and I are going to eat and tuck in. Have a good one.

It’s raining like piss out of a boot and no one has come in today, so we decided to check out that box of tapes that man brought in yesterday. We have an old fatback TV mounted to the corner of the room, so I think if I can find my step ladder I can hook up a VHS player. I want to sell these tapes for this guy, but they’re only labeled in a numerical sequence.

01-0001

01-0002

01-0006

01-0013

01-0020

01-0031

01-0039

You get the point. I don’t know how many tapes in total so I’ll make a list to keep track of what’s on each tape. If it’s a tv show I think I’ll be able to sell them but if they’re personal tapes, I’ll wipe them and call The Dinks up, maybe they’ll use them. You know what? I’m gonna give them a call and ask if they want any of this. It’s up their alley.

I got the VHS player hooked up and ran a head cleaner tape through it. How do those even work btw? Anyway… guess who tootled in as I was getting ready to put the first tape in?

Markus popped his head in! He had a card in his hand and a gift bag full of goodies for Cami. He came to collect my half of the gift money and sign her card. She’s due for surgery on her hand and he said she was a mess about it. After ripping that sheet metal off the ticket booth, she managed to cut a big tendon in her hand on the edge of the metal. They told her it might heal on its own, but there was always the possibility of surgery.

So I signed it, and we grabbed up Demeter and traced her paw on it too for fun. Before he left, he bought a couple bottles of Karen’s oils to use in his gym bag. He’s the only guy I know that uses those oils as good smelling things instead of their MaGiCaL powers. More power to him. You go smell good, Markus.

So, I load the first tape in the sequence (01-0001) into the player and plop down on the counter with the remote in my hand.

It’s definitely shot on a camcorder, one of those big shoulder units from the 80s that you can never find anymore.

The show itself was mundane, it’s a low budget puppet show about a scientist named Doctor Strangeheart and his lab assistant Mortimer.

The good Doctor looks exactly like you expect a child friendly mad scientist looks like, thick coke bottle glasses, white fuzzy hair that sticks up on end, the silver wheel headband thing, vaguely German accent the whole schtick. He doesn’t have strings or hand sticks (I don’t know my puppet anatomy so bare with me) to control him. Even his little fingers move individually. When he talks, his lips move and curve around the sound. His little plastic eyes blink and move, like they follow the camera as it pans around. If he wasn’t bright teal and obviously felt, I’d think he’s alive.

Mortimer is smaller, bald and wears a surgical gown. The top of his skull looks like a metal bowl with a kinked wire antenna bobbling around on top. The show itself is little experiments you can do at home and explain how they work. He however, is clunkier. His eyes are made out of a black felt pupil and a white felt…. Eye white, with a light green eyelid to match his skin. His hands are little mittens attached to sticks, with some stitching to give him little fingers. That one is definitely controlled in the traditional “hand up puppet ass” method, because when he gets frustrated with the Doctor, he does the angry Kermit face.

They also filmed a couple little segments with other characters like Lilly Loveglove, a green little plant person that talks like a hippy and talks about different plants.

There’s Secret Agent Freddy Faceless, who does a segment on making costumes for play. He, however, freaked me out a little bit. He wasn’t like the other puppets. Instead of the muppet like fleecy bodies, he’s a big anatomical drawing figure that sticks felt facial features to his round faceless noggin with a cartoonishly large bottle of white glue. He lives up to his name I guess.

There was the title card for another segment but the tape skipped out to the end scene before I could read it. Mortimer is strapped to a table by the doctor. Doctor Strangeheart has Mortimer’s chrome dome beside him, and he’s poking around in the poor little guy’s head as Mortimer screams and thrashes around in pain. The episode ends with a weird garbled sound, and credits with absolutely no names, just the positions people worked and a blank space for names.

Sincerely and from the bottom of my heart. What the fuck was that? It was fine until then. There’s no title card at the beginning to look up the show, but I have a feeling it never went on the air because of a muppet brain surgery. Maybe I can find something online but I think Strangeheart was the name of a character in Metal Gear Solid Peace walker so my search might be a little tricky sifting through that.

I learned a few things today.

Our town has its own tv station.

You can just have a show on our station. Like… you just rent one of the soundstages and buy a time slot and you have your own public access show.

The AI scientist in MGS: Peace Walker was Strangelove.

There’s a spare key for my cash drawer, under my cash register but you gotta heft that bitch to get it thanks to Demeter.

Our mystery puppet show was meant to be a public access children’s show called The Doctor Strangeheart Science Special and was going to air at 3 pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. They filmed 100 episodes before it even aired, and planned on working indefinitely.

That’s all I got and I’d take it with a grain of salt because what little info I have, is from a subreddit about lost kids media. If all these tapes are the show, I have 37 in my possession right now. I can ask around town, since I’m on this whole goose chase about Divicianna anyway, might as well add it to my list. Once my takeout is here, I’m gonna pop in another tape.

**Thursday, August 14th, 7:01 pm**

So, I watched 01-0002.

It opens with Mortimer’s metal skull on his head, wrapped in bandages. He’s talking, but it’s slow and slurred, like he got his brain scrambled. Today’s episode will be about electricity.

He waves his little hands around the laboratory, pointing to different things that run on electricity. Despite not airing the show, the second episode acts like they got a lot of money. Mortimer’s puppet looks better made. He looks more refined and he doesn’t have sticks to control his arms anymore. They look like they’re moving on their own in a clunky, exaggerated way. His eyes are different too. The puppets in the first episode all had felt eyes that didn’t move, but these ones look like they’re plastic or something. Even his mouth movements seem to be more in line with his words, like his lips are moving instead of a flapping jaw. Maybe a new puppeteer?

They pan over to the lab table where the Doctor is waiting to show the first experiment. The Doctor begins to rub various items on a piece of carpeting, trying to make enough static to stick items to himself. He ends up covered in balloons and socks, his voice muffled by a particularly thick wool sock dangling from his nose. The music changes as the Doctor looks at Mortimer.

“Now my young friend! Take your mark!!” He says as he grabs a teaspoon from the table. Mortimer toddles over to a big red X on the table. With the cackle of a madman, The Doctor taps the spoon to Mortimer’s antenna. Electricity arcs from the spoon and down the whole length of the antenna, making it straighten. Mortimer drops to the floor and begins to convulse, foaming at the mouth with his little plastic puppet eyes fluttering.

The screen fades to a soft blue with four terra cotta pots of varying sizes in the bottom. The pots sprout vines that crawl up the screen, forming the words in a lovely cursive font.

“*Lilly Loveglove’s book of botanicals”*

The screen fades again to a greenhouse scene, and Lilly tootles in. She looks the same as the first episode, except an outfit change. This time around she’s wearing a paisley shirt under jean overalls and a floppy sunhat tied on to keep her obnoxiously red ringlets in place.

She sets a wicker basket on her work bench and greets me and Demeter, then pulls out a bundle of white star-shaped blooms. Pointy, uneven leaves surround the flowers on thin stalks. The audio cuts out at this point, but she keeps talking, pointing out different parts of the flower. She holds up a large green fruit covered in spikes that she plucked from between some of the leaves.

As the segment starts to wind down, her eyes begin to change to a swirl like old fashion hypnotists would use. She becomes wobbly, grabbing her little table to stay upright. Somehow, she’s still talking but I’m willing to bet her voice is weak. The tape starts to skip out, but before the segment changes, that puppet’s little nose starts to bleed black soot.

The tape skips for a few more minutes, and jumps to the end. The Doctor is kicking Mortimer’s unconscious body out of frame before he looks at the camera and grins. Mortimer’s little leg twitches once, then the screen goes black and begins to roll the credits.

What the fuck? What the actual fuck? How was this going to be a kids’ show? Lilly’s nose bled. Just like ours did. I don’t understand any of this.

If anyone has ever heard of this godforsaken puppet show, let me know… someone has to know something about this.
