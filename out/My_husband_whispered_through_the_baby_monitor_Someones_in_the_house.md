My eyes snapped open. 

Darkness. Quiet.

Did I dream that? I reached for Michael. 

The sheets were cold. 

“*April,”* he whispered again, somewhere off to my right. “*Someone’s in the house. You need to leave.*”

Wait—

He was whispering through the baby monitor. From the baby’s room. 

Oh God. 

Someone was in the house. And I was alone. 

My panic spiked. 

I threw off the covers, ready to spring out of bed when the bedroom door squealed open behind me.

I pulled the covers back up. Pressed my head into the pillow. 

Heavy footsteps neared the bed. Then the covers lifted, and cool air brushed the bare skin on my legs. The mattress dipped under someone’s weight.

Then the intruder crawled under the blanket. A warm body pressed against my back, and hot breath tickled my neck. I trembled. An arm slid around my chest and locked me in, holding me from behind.

On the bedside table, the baby's crying crackled through the monitor.

Fingers slid through my hair, and the intruder’s lips brushed my neck. A deep voice whispered, “*Wake up, Alley. It's your turn.”*

I screamed and threw myself off the bed, slamming against the wall. The bedsheets crinkled as the intruder crawled across the bed toward me.

The bedside lamp clicked on. My husband’s face stared down from the edge of the bed. “April? Oh my God. Are you hurt?”

Unbelievable. He’d scared the hell out of me.

“Am I hurt?!” I said. “Yes, I’m hurt. How could you do that to me?”

“I was just saying it’s your turn to check on the baby. What are you talking ab—”

The baby monitor crackled. *“April,”* the voice said. “*I’m taking Holly out of the house. Get out safely.*”

We both stared at each other. Horrified. Michael swung his legs off the bed but I hit the floor first. I reached under the bed for the gun box. His feet scuffled around to my side of the bed. 

My hand struck solid wood. 

I scooped the box out, snatched the pistol and clicked the safety off.

“Give me the gun,” Michael said, reaching down.

I slapped his hand away and stood. “No time. I got it. Just go. Go.”

With a couple pushes, I got him running out of the bedroom. Michael slammed the nursery door open.

Behind the baby’s crib was an open window. The dark silhouette of a man stepped out of it with our baby in his arms.  

“I have a gun!” I shouted. 

The man froze—one leg in, one leg out. My husband caught the man by his shirt and yanked him back inside. 

I flipped on the light. 

And my heart dropped. 

This man was also my husband. Two identical men stood side by side, each staring at the other in equal confusion. Their mannerisms were identical.

“April,” the one holding the baby said. “Put the gun down.”

“No. You put my baby down.”

He blinked. Then nodded. 

Gently, he eased the baby back into the bassinet. She scrunched up her face and let out a little scream. 

“Now walk over there,” I said. “Both of you.” I nudged my gun at the wall. They walked over, watching me with fear in their eyes. 

“April,” the one who’d just laid down the baby said. “Look at me. We’ve spent our whole lives together. We made her,” he said, eyeing my baby girl. “Come on. You know I’m your husband.”

“No,” the other one said, taking a step closer. 

I aimed the gun at him, but he advanced and pushed his chest against my gun.

“If someone was in the house, I would never, *ever* leave without you. I would protect you, no matter what. It’s me. Now give me the gun.”

I shook my head, blinking away tears. 

“April,” he said. “If you really think I’m lying, go ahead. Shoot. Because if you really can’t tell the difference, if you really think I’d leave you? I’ve failed as your husband. So go on.”

I felt the rise and fall of his chest shift the gun with each breath.

I couldn’t do it. 

My heart told me it was him.   
  
He slid the gun from my fingers. “Thank you,” he said, then turned, aimed, and shot the other one dead. 

We dug a hole in the backyard. Once it was deep enough, we dragged the clone’s body in and covered it with dirt.

The next day, I was in shock. I spent the entire afternoon inside the nursery with the baby in my arms. I didn’t want to let her go. Not even for a minute.

Around dinnertime, Michael peeked his head in and said I needed to eat. 

I said I wasn’t hungry. 

He nodded, turning to leave, but hesitated. Then he approached us.

He was looking down at the baby. He brushed his fingers through her hair, then let out a chuckle. 

“What’s so funny?” I asked.

“It's just…our baby is the luckiest baby in the world.”

“Yeah? Why’s that?”

He lifted his eyes to meet mine. "Because Hailey has the best mom in the world.” He traced a finger along my cheek, then walked out and clicked the door shut. 

My breath caught in my throat. My chest tightened. I set the baby back on her mattress so I wouldn't drop her. A mixture of dread and panic flooded my mind all at once. 

Because our baby’s name isn’t Hailey.

It’s [Holly](https://www.reddit.com/user/ElliotPryce/).
