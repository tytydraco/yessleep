Every bizarre thing has its own terrible ending, every crime has its own punishment, even though they may not be listed in our mortal law book. I should know this. I should be aware that everything today is just the result of the past, that the future is born from the present. I should have perceived this.

As I type these words, the goddess of death is with me. She has always been here. What comes next is my judgment—not from police or courts, but in the name of revenge, justice, and a moral law that operates above our own. There is no time for regret. I should have thought of all this before my wife of fifteen years vanished, her remains still unknown. Please, Selene, please, just let me finish this. This record isn't for anyone else. It is my last, worthless remorse.

It began with the strange disappearance of my wife, Claire. She went for a walk with our dog, Fortune, and never returned. An hour passed. Three. A whole night. I told myself she was lost, but her car keys were still in the garage. Everyone knows the coyotes don't come within 50 kilometers of our peaceful town. I thought it was a kidnapping. I called the police. They searched for three days and found nothing. The town helped, but we found no trace. Not of my unfortunate, warm-hearted wife, nor of the dog.

My heart wasn't just broken; it was shattered. In that instant, I lost the will to live. I should have put a gun to my head then. It would have been a mercy. But fate is a playful, joyful thing. Instead, I visited my old school, the place I'd met my wife.

I was standing before the old gate I hadn't seen in twenty-five years, thinking of Claire, the woman who was supposed to be with me for life, when I heard footsteps behind me. *The guard? A teacher?* I turned. It was a woman. She wore a white dress and cheap, second-hand slippers.

Before I could speak, her voice stopped me—soft and seductive, like a demon's whisper. Her name was Selene. She was beautiful, descended from the moon. She said she was from Greece, and my weary mind thought of the *Odyssey* and heroic lore. Was I, a pathetic middle-aged man wrecked by life's tsunami, being saved? Would I spend the rest of my life in paradise with a goddess?

"Nice to meet you," she said. "You seem like a really nice guy. Can I have your phone number?" I hesitated, sure this was a scam. My instincts screamed to stop, but I lost to my desire. I gave her my number. In return, she gave me a kiss I would never forget. A gift after my loss? She looked so innocent, so perfect. Why did I deserve her? I argued with myself, but I kept losing to that desire.

A few days later, we met at a bar. A weird sense of familiarity washed over me. I hadn't been in a bar for twenty years—my wife was religious and hated alcohol. The feeling vanished as soon as our date began. She was so nice, talkative, passionate, and compassionate. That was the most precious thing. She understood me perfectly, even before I spoke, better than my wife ever had. Her words were an unforgettable melody. On that first date, I felt a crush stronger than any I'd ever known. We set another date for the following week.

I felt saved. One month to the day after that first meeting, we were married.

She knew everything about me, often voicing thoughts I hadn't spoken. I felt a moment of alarm, but it was disarmed by her innocent look and her heartbreaking history. She told me, through tears, how an older boyfriend had impregnated and abandoned her. Kicked out at eighteen, she was homeless for a time with her baby, who later died of an untreated disease because her identification was left behind at her parents' house. She spoke of suicide, of working twelve-hour days and going to night school, finishing four years of school in two, and finally being accepted to university.

Her story moved me. I told her my pain about Claire. We were the perfect pair, offering each other redemption from the deepest valley of life. She was flawless, her personality and appearance like polished marble. A miracle. A god sent to help me.

I thought I could use a year to mourn Claire and move on. But this goddess made me forget the woman who had truly loved me. It was the last mistake I would ever make. The mistake that pushed me into hell. Or perhaps, my fate was sealed long before I ever met Claire.

As I write this, my stomach is in agony. A pain that makes every second feel like 10,000 years. It feels like someone is warping my intestines like a rope. I can't call the police. She is beside me, watching me type. There is no escape. The answer is in her smiling face—a smile that reveals her cruel nature. Death is here.

I have vomited ten times this hour. My head is swelling. I have only minutes left.

"Why?" I whispered, blood spraying from my lips. "I've given you everything. What do you want? You'll get my fortune when I pass. I don't care about the jewelry or the spending. Why?"

After I asked for the third time, she spoke: "You should look at yourself, playboy. You have a debt to pay, far more than you think you owe me."

"Impossible! That's absurd!" I was shocked. "I'll give you anything! Another $10,000? Please, just tell me what you want!" My words were unorganized, broken.

She said in a cold voice, "If you can use that prideful brain, just think. Do you remember 20 years ago? That bar on Young Street? A girl, trying to look older than she was. She sat in a corner that no one noticed, hoping nobody would ask for the ID she couldn't show. She was quiet, trying not to be seen. Then a man approached. A polite gentleman in a white suit and glasses. He bought her the most expensive wine and told her, 'You're more mature than you look.' He offered her a ride, drove her to a motel, and later, when she was nervous, he visited her, gave her a hug, and a wad of cash. He told her she didn't need to worry about the future, she only needed to learn how to be a good mother."

"A month later, she was pregnant. But the gentleman had vanished. He took her trust, her youth, her future. All he left her was a child she couldn't afford. She was kicked out of school, then her home. For twenty years, she grew in the abyss. Abandoned by everyone. And that man, the son of Satan who started this tragedy, is sitting right here, still pretending to be innocent."

I was so shocked I stopped writing for two minutes. My brain used all its strength to do one thing: think. As she ordered. Think. It was all true. That's why the bar felt familiar. That's why I never went back. That's why she knew everything about me. That's why my pitiful wife, Claire, was gone—she would never be found. That was just the beginning. I should have noticed. I should have…

My limbs are so heavy, as if pulled by six times the gravity. I vomited again, more blood and digested remains. My head grew heavier. I tried to scream, but my muscles, my brain, betrayed me.

"Please, please," I whispered. "I beg you. I have a daughter. She's only eight years old. She keeps asking me when Mommy is coming home… I beg you, I'll do anything for mercy! I didn't mean to abandon you! I thought we were just drunk, I thought…" I had no strength left. I knew the ending.

This long game… she had won at last. For twenty years, she suffered immeasurable sorrow, was shattered countless times, lost her child to poverty and abandonment. She lost everything. She hated everything, but that hatred became her hope to survive. Twenty years of revenge, ending today, on the anniversary of the night it all began.

Before the end, I begged one last time: "Please… I can do nothing, I know. But I just want to hug you… once more… like that night twenty years ago… like that."

This is my last strength. The sky is beautiful today, just like that night. But my vision is turning dark.

Wait.  
Wait, why are you turning off the light
