I work at a gaming company, scratching out illustrations in a world where AI’s clawing at our jobs. I rent a dingy downtown apartment—cramped, damp, the kind of place where shadows cling to the corners. Rent’s cheap, so I stomach it. A week after moving in, I spotted it: a black stain on my bedroom wall, half a foot long, jagged like a tear in the plaster. Work was a nightmare, so I let it slide. But a week later, it had stretched—a full foot now, spreading like ink bleeding through wet paper.

You’re thinking there’s a body in the wall, right? I did too. I called my landlord, who sounded as lost as I was. He sent someone to rip the wall open, expecting mold or a busted pipe. Nothing. Just cold, empty drywall. They patched it, painted over it, and I figured that was the end. 

A month later, it was back—same spot, same creeping blackness, seeping through the fresh paint like a bruise. I should’ve called again, or packed my bags, but work had me dead on my feet—I’d stumble home and collapse, the stain a silent roommate. No stench, no whispers. Just… there. Until one night, I really looked. It was five feet long now, sprawling, and it had shape—a woman’s silhouette, her form pressed into the wall like a shadow burned in place. How had I not seen it?

I couldn’t look away. Her hair unfurled like dark threads, her face etched itself in—eyes, lips, a gaze that pierced. She was beautiful. Unnaturally so. Inspiration struck like a fever. I grabbed my tablet, traced her every line, then spent sleepless nights rendering her in CG. She was mine—my private muse, too perfect to share. I thought about slipping her into a company project, but no. She belonged to me.

It wasn’t enough. A screen couldn’t hold her. I taught myself 3D modeling, crafting her into something I could twist and study in the dim glow of my monitor. Still, she wasn’t alive. Then came the idea—mad, unstoppable. I bought oil paints, stood before the wall, and brought her to life over the stain. Crimson lips, skin like frost, eyes that shimmered wetly in the lamplight. She was real—or close enough. I pressed myself to the wall, kissed her cold mouth, ran my hands over her painted curves. And more. You know. It felt wrong, but God, it felt alive.

The thrill faded fast. I got sick of it—sick of myself. I started dating someone, tried to bury it all. She turned into just a painting, a warped memory I couldn’t erase. I couldn’t paint over her, though—she still owned me somehow. Nine months later, her face shifted. The smile curdled, her eyes sank with a quiet sorrow. After dates, I’d hear it—soft, mournful sighs drifting through the room, like wind through a cracked window. Dread coiled in my gut. I’d drown myself in whiskey just to cross the threshold.

Why didn’t I run? Stupidity, obsession—take your pick. Instead, I plastered posters over her—gaudy beaches and sunsets—sealing her away. It worked. The sighs stopped, the air lightened. She was gone from my mind. Until one month ago, when I got reckless. I peeled back a poster, just a corner, in the dead of night. The room felt too still. She’d changed—not into a snarling ghoul, but something worse. Her belly bulged, swollen and round, a pregnant silhouette glowing faintly against the wall. I thought of those nights—my hands, my breath, my madness. No. It couldn’t be. My hands shook as I slammed the posters back, the tape screaming as I pressed it down.

I had to leave. I found a new place, called a friend to help me pack. The apartment stank of stale fear as we moved boxes. He paused, frowning. “Neighbors? A couple next door?” I said no, voice tight. “Weird. I heard a baby crying—sharp, loud.” Ice flooded my veins. I didn’t want to know, but I had to. I pressed my ear to the posters, the paper crinkling under my weight. A baby’s giggle bubbled up, faint and wrong. Then her voice—low, tender, singing a lullaby that clawed at my skull.

I bolted that night. Moved into the new place, swearing I’d never look back. A week later, I saw it—a fresh black stain on the wall, small but pulsing, staring at me from the shadows.
