I don’t have a good memory of my childhood between watching my parents marriage fall apart through physical violence and always having to go back and forth between my parents it all became a blur. When I was with my dad especially it was bad, we lived in an apartment house that was attached to others side by side behind them was a patch of woods that at the time seemed endless. My dad usually left me to my own he wasn’t a very active or attentive parent, he would basically send me in my room with my computer or outside with no real supervision. When I was told to go outside I would usually just sit at a park that was at the side of the buildings near the woods where sometimes a few people would come and play with me if I asked or I would sit in a tree waiting for the sun to set. 

During a summer I had made a friend who liked to play with me alone she was older and always liked to play in the woods or walk with me around the outside of the woods near the park, I never thought of her as an adult or even a parental figure but a friend a real friend. We would talk about everything from watching new movies and creating new games like woods tag, where we would run into the woods and play tag but use the trees and creek paths as hiding spots.

Eventually I grew to have a crush on her and started to notice more about her, she had beautiful red hair and a sweet voice and her hands were soft, but her clothes seemed old like she had gotten them at a goodwill or Salvation Army, she was also had a smell of cinnamon.

One day I spent outside waiting for her, waiting to play our favorite game. When she did show up I figured it was to late for that game considering the sun was setting and I thought i had to go in soon anyways, 
But she had talked me into saying it would be “fun” and “exciting”. She wanted to be it first, so I ran into the woods looking for a place to hide but it was way darker in the woods I could barely see my own feet, I stopped trying to look for a tree quickly as I heard foot steps behind me but as I went to hide I was grabbed and held tightly, a brief panic took over as hands covered my mouth and pinned me to the ground, I could smell the cinnamon I knew before and I signed with relief, but as I tried to get up I was shoved back down confused I tried to move free but as I tried I was only held tighter 

I left the woods in tears, afraid and alone, with the only words burned into my mind, “Shhh, if you tell anyone I won’t be your friend ” 

Even at the age of 20, I feel like I’m alone.
