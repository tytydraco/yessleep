“Let me kill him!” I screamed, jumping over Frank’s prone body.

The three were-lions froze. 

I looked at Lacey, who stared back at me, completely destroyed. 

“Or better yet, let Lacey kill him. It’s her dad, she should do it.” I gazed at her, hoping that she would understand without words. “Now that she’s one of you.”

[The three monsters turned their eyes to the oozing wound on her arm](https://redd.it/17nlfmn). Despite the depth of the bite, it had somehow stopped actively bleeding, and already looked like it had shrunk from 19 inches down to 13. 

She flashed an inscrutable expression. 

Then she stepped forward, and I stepped back.

Frank looked up at his daughter, his eyes deep wells of sadness. She gazed back down, statue-still. 

The tension was tighter than a violin string stretched over a duck’s asshole.

Then I leapt at the nearest were-lion, aiming for the vulnerable part of his throat, knowing that precision in that moment meant the difference between living and dying. I had watched Lacey do it, and knew that I had to be as good as she was, if only for an instant. I was very, very afraid, but the fear and danger of the situation warranted my fear.

I missed, of course. He dodged me with great ease, slapping me to the floor in the most painful blow yet. 

“Ow.”

I rolled over to see Lacey jump forward with both arms outstretched. She struck one opponent with each of her hands, dropping them instantly to the floor. 

Then she whipped around and pointed her pistol at the face of the one I’d failed to subdue.

“WAIT!” I yelled. Then I rolled to my feet with all the elegance of a decomposing peach hitting the floor. “Ouch. It hurts to be.”

The two of them stared at me as I wobbled before them. “You,” I instructed, pointing my finger at the were-lion, “are going to tell all your high-born kinsmen that *she*,” I jerked my thumb at Lacey, “saved you from *him*.” I pointed down at Frank. “Before he ran away, of course.”

“No,” he growled. 

“Okay, then Lacey’s going to shoot your lion penis off with her tungsten bullet.”

“I have changed my mind and will do as you asked.”

“Well that’s just delightful to hear.” I turned to Lacey. 

She catches the breath in my throat at the most unexpected and inopportune times, and this was no exception. “Lacey, I’m sorry to press this, but…”

I flicked my eyes down to Frank before looking up at her once more. “You need to say goodbye.”

Loving another person simply means being vulnerable to them. The look on my future wife’s face pressed an indelible mark on the soft, gray folds of my brain; I could never again be happy in the same way after seeing just how much hurt my words inflicted on the best soul I know. 

Frank lifted his head. His face was crimson with the effort, and from the fact that he had been punched in the face. “Don’t try to say it with words, Lacey. The right words don’t exist. Say it with the life you’ll live, the live I’ll never see.”

I wanted to break.

But I didn’t have the chance. A thundering sound rolled through the hall; it sounded like six more of them were coming.

Frank’s eyes bulged. 

“Run.”

Obviously, I survived. But not everyone else did. That’s all I can bring myself to say for right now. I’ll have to [finish later](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
