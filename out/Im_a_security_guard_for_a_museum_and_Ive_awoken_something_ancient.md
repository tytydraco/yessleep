My name is Gary and I work as a security guard for a mid sized Museum in Chicago. I got the gig about a year ago. The pay is good but the work, well the work can get spooky.

The museum put me on night duties a couple months ago and well I’ve seen some things that wake me when I sleep. Sometimes you’ll see the occasional mouse that the exterminators seemed to have missed, spiders in corners, and once I even found a raccoon that somehow snuck in the woolly mammoth display.

Besides that I take my time checking each wing of the museum. The night can get long and tedious so I usually find myself attracted to the museums artifacts. There are certain places I don’t go no matter what my job entails. Places like the plague quarter? Hell no. Bloody battlefields? Absolutely not. If I have to go past them I will but very quickly.

Last month I was working my shift like any other night. I checked the west wing, upstairs, downstairs and back towards the east wing. \*CRACK\*. I stopped for just a minute to listen. The sound guided my ears over to the left of me. A staff door stood tall. I unlocked it, slowly opened my way into the room. Carefully I searched through the room, checking corners and crevices until finally I found what made that damn noise.

A mouse laid stuck in a trap. The trap had clamped its body down to the board but hadn’t killed it. It squeaked at me with urgency. “Alright little guy I’ll let you out but don’t let me catch you again” I said freeing the mouse. I smiled at an act of charity I was not used to doing for rodents of the Museum. I didn’t think the mouse would be able to move but surprisingly it scurried off quickly. I got up and made my way out the door, locking it behind me.

On my way to the east wing my eye caught sight of a statue dating back to the early medieval days.

I’ve always loved history. When other kids would read Goosebumps and dinosaur books I found myself invested in battles of the civil war. And yes I love the displays just not at night. From there, I delved deep into the history of the world. That which has been discovered at least. I always wondered what people have hid throughout history, what hasn’t been discovered.

I shined my flashlight on the statue. A large 7 foot statue of a knight in armor, a mustache drooping from his lips, and a shield with a cross on it. I noticed a crack on the statues hand. “Weird that it hasn’t fallen off” I thought.

I moved on, making my rounds through the night and finished the East wing. As I neared the main lobby I shined my flashlight to my left, then to my right. To my astonishment I saw what looked like the same statue. “That’s weird” I said to myself. Maybe the museum had made a copy? I looked it over as if trying to find a “made in china” sticker on it.

Then I noticed the hand, it had the same exact crack. And another along its arm. Paranoia took hold for a minute but I shook it off. Glancing down at my watch I noticed it was 5:56 am. I made my way through the lobby and out the door to switch shifts for the morning with Dillon. Dillon usually worked the upper floors but they switched him downstairs and put a new guy upstairs since there wasn’t much up there.

I went home later that morning and laid down to sleep. The statue crossed my mind again. I peeked out of my shut eyes to make sure it hadn’t appeared in my room. There was something awfully disturbing about it. I finally decided I was overreacting and went back to bed.

As I got ready for work at 6:00 pm I grabbed my taser and gun which eased my nerves. Later I walked up to the front doors of the Museum. Dillon and I greeted each other briefly as we passed by. Quickly I turned to ask Dillon “You didn’t see anything strange today did you?”, he snorted and said “No man, just the usual stuff like Anne Boleyn and Queen Elizabeth coming out of the painting to fingerbang one another”. I returned a glance of amazement at his sarcastic reply. “Alright man whatever” I said.

I moved into the lobby and began my shift. Right away I noticed that the other statue was no longer in sight. Maybe the day workers moved it elsewhere?

Lights don’t go out until 10:00 pm. At 9:00 I made sure to pass over into the east wing after my walk towards the west. As I crossed over into the east wing the statue came into sight. I checked it out and saw nothing out of the ordinary. And surprisingly the cracks weren’t there. Maybe they fixed it?

Anyways this put my mind at ease. As I finished my upstairs rounds I walked down the main corridor towards the stairs. I froze. There the statue stood in the middle of the corridor, right in front of the stairs. It stood as a guard does. The moonlight from the window bathed the statue in blue and white tones.

I walked slowly towards it, as if for some reason it was going to come to life. I looked it over, it was nearly cracked all over one side of its body. This was weird. I had to leave.

I made my way downstairs when a buzzing noise caught my ear. Not the kind of buzzing a razor makes. But one with high pitched ringing and tv static. It burned. Badly. My ears felt as if they were going to burst. Then the noise finally stopped. I walked back up the stairs gun in hand to see the statue only to find it wasn’t there.

I had to leave, this was getting too weird. I quickly formed a plan, leave the building, call my boss and tell him to get someone else because I could not do this anymore. Maybe I’m being hasty I thought. I couldn’t give up the job as this was my only form of income. I made a plan. I would walk down the stairs, make my way through the corridor, and to the lobby. From there I would “make my rounds” for the night but I knew better than that. Once I was in the lobby I was NOT leaving.

I took in a deep breath of air. As I slowly rounded the middle part of the stairs I peeked around the corner and down the corridor. Nothing. Not even a mouse.

I felt like could breathe more freely. I walked down the second set of stairs and into the corridor. Nothing in that hall was left untouched by my flashlight. I got halfway through the hallway and felt myself un-tense. I walked further.

\*CRACK\*

A noise I quickly located to my right side rang through the corridor. It came from a cleaning closet.

Must be George Mousington I thought to myself. Yes I named the mouse. He’s gotta be dead this time I thought.

I unlocked the door and opened it slowly to see the statue. It moved its head peering down at me with a stony scratching noise. The sound of both tv static and screeching filled my ears. My eyes met his. Those purple, infinite, glowing eyes. I quickly ran closing my ears, knocking into anything to get away. I had to make it to my vehicle.

I turned back to look into the corridor to see his legs now freely stomping their way towards me and his sword swinging by his side. A red substance had dripped onto the floor leading to where I was walking backwards from the statue. I felt my ears, they were ringing and hot. I looked at my hands and seen the blood. I had to go.

I ran faster and made it to the lobby, quickly I unlocked the doors and felt his presence behind me. I turned to see his purple eyes turn to a deep glowing shade of red as he raised the sword and swung it down at me. I dodged to my left and he shattered the glass of the door. I leaped from where I lay to move behind him, his back now to the doors. I pulled my pistol and fired two rounds into the statue both glancing off his stoney hide.

He swung again almost slicing me in half. If his sword wasn’t sharp it would definitely crush my body. I moved and ran down the corridor, I knew of a way out. As I ran I heard the static sound. I quickly found a lab room used for testing DNA on artifacts. I made my way in and slammed the door.

Now I heard nothing. I tried to call 911 but to no avail, I had no signal. “Ok I can jump out the window and get out before he notices I’m gone” I said to myself. The windows were high up maybe 6 to 7 foot high so I would need something to stand on. I took two desks and stacked them. I climbed the desks which were wobbly, I knew I needed to be careful to not alert him. I finally stood on top of the desks and tried to hoist my way to the window. As I did I pushed my weight into the desk causing them to clatter to the floor and fall. I caught myself and lifted myself onto the window ledge, sliding it open and climbing through. As I struggled out the window I knew I’d have to fall hard into the bushes below me.

I prepared myself, I thought landing on my feet would probably be ok. Just as I jumped out I looked to the lobby doors to see the statue stomping its way towards me. I hit the ground with a solid cracking sound. My foot shot pain through my leg. Quickly I turned my gaze to the statue not but 10 feet away from me.

I got up and moved limping in pain towards my vehicle. As I looked behind the statue started to run towards me. “OH SHIT” I thought. I limped faster as I heard the Stoney stomps catching up behind me. I got to my car and fumbled the keys unlocking it and opening the door. As I opened the door the sword broke the door off its hinges and sent glass flying into my face. I fell and crawled my way towards the back of the vehicle, grabbing the rear drivers side tire to lift myself up when suddenly I felt a sharp object pin my leg to the car and slice it off. I fell to the ground screaming in pain. Blood squirted out of my leg as it poured the oozy red liquid onto the feet of the giant statue. This was it I thought. I’m dead.

When suddenly the sun rose. The statue turned to look at the blinding light on the horizon. It ran from me to the museum but quickly was set solid and busted, crumbling to the ground. The statue then turned from solid crumbled rock and gave way back to a human form. Then I noticed a small circular symbol on the back of his neck as he laid unconscious.

I took my shirt and wrapped it around my severed leg making a tourniquet. I had no idea if I would even last by the time EMS got to me. I felt myself fading as I went unconscious.

I’m in the hospital now, writing this. I have no idea what that thing was. Nurse Mathers said Dillon and two others called the ambulance and police. Nurse Mathers told me some men wanted to come speak with me. She told me that they were happy to wait until I was comfortable. After I have finished uploading this I will talk to the men. I have no idea who they are. I’m worried about what my life will look like from now on being disabled. I feel like my life is ruined. I hope those men are coming to pay for this damn hospital bill because what the fuck was that? How could I even explain this whole situation without looking insane?

Anyways thank you for reading, I will update you all soon on my recovery journey.
