A rotting crooked smile slouches in the darkest corner of my room, smacking its lips. If I could witness the rest of the creature's face, it would be of a blood-eyed monkey starving to fuck me. The soaked blanket sticks to my skin like a flytrap, and the bed squeaks under my shivers.

I jump out of bed, stumbling down the hallway, halting against my parent's bedroom door. Their night light pours under the cold frame, and I gravitate towards it. I was little the last time I disturbed them this late, and it became a nightmare. They despised me ever since. But the dim light possesses me to crack open the door.

I turn on the light, and Mother is alone in her bed, lying by herself, but in the corner of her room, hunching over, is a hairy stranger I've seen only the smile of. Mother tries frantically to flip the light switch, but she can't turn them off - click - click - click. The stranger crawls over to her bed and is lying with her.

"Turn off the lights!" she screams.

I try to turn them off, but they don't work. Click - click - click.

"Ohh God - turn off the lights!" she screams louder.

I quietly close the door, swallowing the bitter puke crawling up my throat before creeping back into the darkness. Tripping over trapped thoughts of Mother's room, the sight of her body, her bed, and the decaying smell of the stranger violating her.

There's the smile again, only it's lying in my bed, waiting for me. I fumble for the light switch, but it doesn't turn on. Click - click - click. I can't see it, but I can smell it.

Fuck it; you can't create my hell. Only I can create hell for myself!

My thumb and fingers find their way into my mouth, and I bite down, tearing them to shreds. I gag as the slimy, torn flesh slithers down my throat. I savor the gnashing of my bones and teeth. A dark hand wraps tightly around my ankle; it feels so familiar. I'm being dragged back to bed.

"I created this hell for me, not for you!" I scream.

I punch and kick at my assaulter, but there's no arm or torso attached to the iron grip for me to strike. I can't stop them.

An echo of laughter comes from my burning lungs. I pause temporarily, gasping only to swallow the saltiness of my snot, blood, and splintered bones slicing down my throat.

"I created this hell for me, not for you! I created this hell for me, not for you!" I scream, repeating my newfound mantra.

I'm losing control of my mutilated hand; it keeps wriggling under my blanket, searching for dwelling in my private parts. It feels like a plucked raw chicken carcass.

My bed squeaks with pleasure. The light blinks; I'm lying over gnawed-off fingers and a blood-soaked blanket. The light dies, and I smile.

Finally alone.
