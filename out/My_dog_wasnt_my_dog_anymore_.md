My dog is not my dog, I’m still scared. 

This post may contain orthographic mistakes cause English is not my native language. Ty for understanding. 

My dog ​​has always been very calm, he is not aggressive and has never bit me or anyone, he’s a good guy. 
I was in the kitchen and I went down to feed him dinner, I saw him eat in a very strange way, too slowly (since I had him he has always eaten very quickly, he chokes and doesn't even chew his food, I guess it's because before adopting him he was homeless) when I realized this I looked at him again and got a little closer, then he started growling at me in a scary way, he was in an attack position, I swear I had never felt anything like that, his eyes were empty, I was really afraid. My dog, despite eating quickly, has always allowed me to touch him and his food, although this time it was not the case.
I took a step back and he just continued growling and getting more aggressive, so I decided to run up the stairs, he went after me as if nothing had happened.

I was quite upset and at the same time scared, so I started yelling at him to stay away, and he seemed to understand, so I went to get a bottle of holy water that I had kept in a closet and I went to him, I prayed an Our Father while I Sprinkled  holy water at him. 

I am convinced that what happened was not normal, I know that animals are unpredictable, but I can assure you that this is not something he would do, an owner knows his dog's temperament and the way he acts.

After all this he was already normal, I decided to check that he did not have any injuries that could be causing this behavior but he is perfectly fine, he let me check him and he was very calm. I don't think he was protecting his food either, because by the time I approached he had already finished eating and had moved away from the plate.

After this I took him out to the garden for a moment so he could poop and I could calm down, I heard him grunting, as if there was something or someone, I went out to look and saw a shadow move.
I felt the vibe very heavy and even more so because it was Easter, As I said previously, in my country the practice of dark witchcraft is very common during these times of Holy Week, specially in Good Friday, many road accidents occur, strange things happen in general. As I said, it's something that happens IN MY COUNTRY I put holy water along with lines of salt at all the entrances, I also sprinkled him and my other dog with holy water and salt.

We just got back from the vet, he had a complete checkup (dental, tests) and he is fine, I also read some comments that say he could have rabies but my dog ​​is up to date on all vaccinations.

What do you think? I can swear that it was not something normal.
