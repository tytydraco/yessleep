People who grow up near marshland learn rules nobody explains. You do not go out after dark. You do not follow lights you cannot place. And when someone says part of the swamp is off limits, you do not ask why. In Hollow Marsh, people do not vanish with a lot of fanfare. They simply stop being part of daily life. The locals say something watches that place.

They call it the warden. The first thing I noticed about Hollow Marsh was the smell. It did not smell like normal swamp, not just mud and muck and rotten leaves. There was something thick in it, like pond water that had been trapped in a bucket for years.

It clung to the back of my throat as I stood at the edge of the wooden overlook, hands on the damp rail, staring out over the reeds. “Smell never really goes away,” a voice said behind me. “You get used to it. Or you move.” I turned and saw him, the same wiry old man who had been standing behind the counter at the gas station when I pulled into town that afternoon.

Same faded ball cap, same flannel shirt, same permanent frown carved into his cheeks. “You follow me out here?” I asked. He shrugged. “You asked where Hollow Marsh was. Figured you would end up here before dark. Outsiders always do.” “I am not a tourist,” I said. “I grew up here. Left when I was a kid.” He squinted at me, eyes narrowing. “What is your name then?” “Evan Pike.” His expression shifted.

Not friendly, but different. Recognition mixed with something like pity. “Jim Holloway,” he said. “I knew your father. He was a good man.” I did not know what to say to that, so I just turned back to the marsh. The water spread out in a wide shallow basin, choked with cattails and tall brown reeds. Trees leaned in around the edges as if they were all trying not to fall in.

The sun was sinking behind them, painting the water with broken strips of gold that did not reach very far. Near the middle of the marsh there was a dark patch, a round area where the vegetation thinned out and the water looked deeper. Even from the overlook, I could see that it was black. Not dark green, not brown. Black. “You should not be here this late,” Jim said quietly. “It is barely six,” I replied.

He did not answer that. Instead he stepped up beside me and rested his elbows on the rail. For a long time we both watched the marsh in silence. I had not come back for scenery. My father was dead, lungs finally giving up after decades in the mill, and I had inherited the ugly little house on the edge of town that no one wanted to buy.

I lost my job a month later, and the cheap answer was obvious. Move back. Live there. Start over in the place I had tried to forget. I told myself it was temporary. I told myself a lot of things. “What do you remember about this place?” Jim asked. I frowned. “Nothing. We moved away when I was eight.” “You remember your father coming out here with the search parties?  When the Miller boy went missing?”

Something stirred, deep in the part of my mind that remembered cold mornings and the smell of wet moss. My father, lacing up boots. My mother, saying it was not a good idea to involve himself. Arguments in the kitchen. My father saying something about doing his part. “I remember people talking,” I said slowly. “A kid fell in.” Jim eyed the marsh. “That is what they said.” “You don’t think so?” He snorted. “Kids fall in ponds.  Kids fall in rivers. They do not vanish in waist deep water while a dozen grown men are ten yards away with flashlights.”

I did not like the way he said vanish. “What happened then?” I asked. Jim scratched at his cheek. “The same thing that has always happened. The marsh took what it was due, and everything went back to normal for a while.” He said it like it was a simple fact. “What it was due?” I echoed. He sighed. “Your father never told you the story, did he?” “I guess not,” I said. Jim nodded, as if that confirmed something for him. He tapped the rail once with his knuckles. “Then let me tell you the one he should have told you,” he said. “It is the only rule that matters in this town.”

“The marsh does not fall behind.” The wind rattled the reeds like dry bones. A crow called from somewhere in the trees. The dark patch in the center of the marsh seemed to shift, as if something turned just under that flat black surface. I swallowed. “What does that even mean?” He glanced at the sky. The last strips of orange were fading to gray. “Not here,” he said. “Come by the station tomorrow morning, Six sharp. Bring coffee. Black. I will show you something. I shouldn’t have to say it but don’t stay here to much longer.”

Before I could argue, he pushed away from the railing and walked back down the path toward the gravel lot. I watched his outline shrink between the trees until he blended with the dark. The marsh waited in front of me, patient and still.

Then, from somewhere near that black patch, I saw a ripple. Not a small wave. Not wind. A wide, slow circle spreading outward, as if something very large had moved just below the surface. I told myself it was a fish. A log. A trick of light. Then I left. The next morning I poured two coffees into paper cups from the old machine in my kitchen, drove into town, and found Jim already waiting in front of the gas station.

He was leaning against the ice machine, arms folded, as if he had been there for hours. “You are late,” he said, taking the cup without thanks. “It is six o five,” I replied. “In this town that counts as late.” He jerked his head toward the side of the station and started around it. I followed, feeling like a kid again, dragged along by some adult who had decided to share a story I was not sure I wanted.

Behind the station was a cinderblock garage, a row of rusty oil drums, and, tucked back against the fence, a small office trailer. Jim unlocked the door and led me inside. The trailer smelled like dust and old paper. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with cardboard boxes and binders. There was a desk with a cracked plastic top, a single chair, and a crooked corkboard covered in yellowed newspaper clippings.

Jim nodded at the wall. “There.” I stepped closer. The clippings were all about Hollow Marsh. LOCAL TEEN MISSING NEAR HOLLOW MARSH. SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING HUNTER, WOMAN VANISHES AFTER NIGHT NEAR MARSH The dates ran in a rough pattern. Nineteen Seventy one. Seventy four. Seventy eight. Eighty two. The gaps were not exact, but they were close.

Three or four years apart, over and over. I scanned downward, tracking the years. There were a few mentions of drownings in other places, a car wreck on the highway, a house fire. Jim had circled the words about the marsh in red ink. “That is only the ones they admit to,” he said. “The drunk who wandered in and never walked out. The kid who liked to sneak out at night. The woman whose husband swore she left town. If the last place they were seen was within spitting distance of Hollow Marsh, I count it.”

I swallowed. “So what is the pattern then?” Jim stepped up beside me and pointed a nicotine stained finger at the rows of dates. “Count the years between them,” he said. “Roughly three. Sometimes two, sometimes four. But the count is steady. The marsh takes someone on a schedule. When it does, the town gets a quiet stretch. No accidents, no drownings, no odd vanishings. Then the count creeps up again.”

“You think this is deliberate?” I asked. “I do not think,” Jim replied. “I know. The older folks had a name for the thing in the swamp.  They called it the Warden. Something that keeps tally in that water.”

I let out an unsteady laugh. “So this is, what, a town monster story to keep kids out of the mud?” “If it was just that,” he said, “you would not see this.” He tapped a clipping near the bottom of the board. It was newer, maybe fifteen years old. THIRD LOCAL MISSING IN A YEAR, ALL LAST SEEN NEAR HOLLOW MARSH.

I read the subheading. Then I noticed the date. The same year my father packed us up and moved. “I do not remember this,” I said, voice low. “You were a kid,” Jim said. “Your father did not want you anywhere near it. He was out there every night with the search parties. “What happened?” I asked. “The marsh fell behind,” Jim said simply. “Four years went by with no one taken.

People thought it was over. They started walking their dogs down there. Kids went to drink at the overlook. Then that year came, and it took three before the frost.” “Accidents,” I said weakly. Jim shook his head. “All of them were people who should have known better. A man who tried to drain part of it for a building project. A kid who boasted about swimming across it. A woman who used to dump trash in the reeds at night. The Warden does not just keep count. It also punishes.”

I turned away from the board. My head felt stuffed. “This is insane,” I said. “You cannot blame a swamp for every bad thing that happens near town.” “You can believe whatever you want,” Jim replied. “I am telling you the rule. The warden does not fall far behind. If it goes too long without a proper offering, that thing in the water comes looking.”

I did not sleep much that night. The house my father left me creaked in the wind. Every sound was like a footstep outside the door or a slap of something against the windows. I knew it was my own mind, stirred up by stories and clippings, but logic grows stale in the dark.

I got out of bed around midnight and walked to the kitchen for water. As I stood in the narrow hallway, I heard it. A faint sound, far off but clear in the stillness. Slosh. Slosh. Slosh. As if someone were walking while completely soaked, heavy boots full of water, every step leaving a puddle. I froze. The sound drifted, not quite outside the house, not quite inside.

It seemed to move along the street, past the front of the house, then fade toward town. You are imagining it, I told myself. In the morning, when I stepped onto the porch, there were no wet footprints. The dusty road looked the same. But something small had been left on the top step. A clutch of marsh reeds, tied together with a strip of filthy cloth.

I stared at it for a long time. By mid morning, the whole town knew. “Jim says it is a sign,” the cashier told me at the grocery store. “Means the count is coming due.” At the post office, an old woman shook her head. “Should have seen this coming. No one has gone missing in years.” At the diner, the waitress poured my coffee and whispered, “If you hear knocking after midnight, do not answer the door.” “I thought this was about the marsh,” I said. She shivered. “You think that thing cares where you are standing when it takes you?”

That afternoon I drove back out to Hollow Marsh because I had no better ideas and because fear does not always tell you to stay away. Sometimes it drags you closer. The overlook was empty. The air above the water shimmered with heat, but the marsh itself looked cold.

Flies buzzed in slow circles. The dark patch near the center had grown, or I had convinced myself it had. I leaned on the rail and tried to breathe. “All right,” I said under my breath. “If you are real, show me something.” Nothing happened, of course. Then I had the thought that ruined everything. What if you could cheat it?

If the Warden needed a body to keep its count straight, maybe it did not care where that body came from. If something already dead ended up in that water, would it be enough to satisfy whatever rule the marsh obeyed? On the ride back into town, I passed the small veterinary clinic on the edge of the highway. Out back there was a bright blue dumpster.

The idea finished forming. This is not your problem, I told myself. You could move. But the truth sat heavy in my chest. I did not have the money to move. I did not have a job waiting anywhere. The house was paid off. The only asset I had was planted at the edge of this town, and this town was planted at the edge of that marsh.

If the Warden was real, I was stuck with it. For the rest of the day, I tried not to think about the dumpster behind the clinic. By nightfall I had lost that fight. Clouds swallowed the moon. The road to Hollow Marsh was a strip of darker gray between the trees. I drove with my lights off for the last quarter mile, wincing at every crackle of gravel under the tires.

The bundle on the passenger seat smelled like freezer burn and something metallic. The clinic dumpster had not been locked. The thick black bags had been heavier than I expected. I told myself they were only animal remains, things already gone, things no one wanted. I parked behind a screen of scrub trees, far from the small gravel lot near the overlook path.

No one drove out here after dark if they could help it. My heart still hammered like I was about to rob a bank. I hauled the bag out of the car, staggered under the weight, and half dragged it down the path. Every twig that snapped seemed to reverberate through the area. Frogs stopped croaking as I passed, as if the whole marsh were holding its breath.

At the edge of the walkway, I stopped. The marsh stretched out in front of me, a black sheet broken by darker shapes. The smell was stronger at night, sour and heavy. “This is stupid,” I whispered. I wrestled the bag over the rail, tore it open with a box cutter, and spilled its contents into the water. “There,” I said through my teeth. “That should count for something.” The marsh swallowed it without comment.

For a long moment I stood there, waiting for some sign. Lightning. A roar. A voice from the reeds. Anything. Nothing came. Then, from directly below the overlook, I heard a sound. Not a splash. Not a frog. A slow, thick gurgle. Like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of mud. Something pale moved just under the surface, brushing against the submerged posts of the walkway.

Skin, I thought wildly. That is skin. I stumbled back, almost fell, then turned and ran up the path, branches slapping my arms. I could hear the sound behind me, following the posts, scraping along the wood. At the car, I fumbled the keys and dropped them, cursed, picked them up with shaking hands, and finally got the engine started.

Gravel spat from under the tires as I tore away from the marsh and did not slow down until the first streetlights of town appeared ahead. By the time I collapsed into bed, dawn was bleeding into the sky. When I woke, it was to the sound of my phone buzzing on the nightstand. I answered without checking the display. “Evan,” Jim said on the other end. His voice sounded strained and brittle. “Turn on your television.” “It doesn’t work,” I said. “Then go stand outside,” he replied. “You will hear enough.”

He hung up. My mouth was dry. I rolled out of bed, pulled on yesterday’s jeans, and walked to the front door. When I opened it, the first thing I heard was the wail of a siren. It came from somewhere near the highway, long and rising, then cut off, then started again. Other sounds carried with it. Shouting. A woman crying. The chop of a helicopter far off. I stepped off the porch. Neighbors were gathered in the road, some in bathrobes, some in work clothes, all looking in the same direction. Toward the edge of town and the tree line that hid the marsh. “Car went in,” someone said. “Up by the clinic.” “Took the ditch too fast,” another voice added. “Hit the embankment and went straight into the drainage pond.” My heart dropped straight through my ribs. Drainage pond. Clinic. “Did they get them out?” I asked. A man I recognized from the diner shook his head. “Driver was pinned. Water filled the cab before anybody could reach him.”

“Who was it?” I whispered. He hesitated. “Doctor Reeves. The vet." The man whose name was painted on the side of the clinic in tidy letters. The man whose practice I had raided for the pieces I had dumped into the marsh. He had been working late, I thought. Maybe locking up.

Maybe taking the curve faster than usual because he wanted to get home. Maybe his tires slipped on something. Or maybe the thing that keeps count had decided that if I wanted to involve his clinic in the ledger, it would balance it in its own way. My stomach twisted. I felt something watching us. Not from the crowd, not from the road, but from farther off.

The tree line swayed, leaves trembling. The air smelled faintly of stagnant water. The marsh does not fall behind. The words rang in my head, in Jim’s voice. I turned and got into my car. I found Jim at the overlook. He stood at the rail, staring at the dark patch in the center of the marsh. The sky above was cloudy and low, crushing the light out of everything. “You did something stupid,” he said without looking at me.

I opened my mouth to deny it, then closed it again. There did not seem to be much point. “I thought it would work,” I said. My voice sounded small in the open air. “If it just needed bodies, then maybe there was a way to feed it without anyone else getting hurt.” Jim laughed once. It was an ugly sound. “You tried to bargain with something that does not know what a bargain is,” he said. “That thing in there only understands two numbers. Ahead and behind.”

“They were already dead in that bag.” “The Warden does not care,” Jim replied. “You pointed at that clinic and told the marsh that is where you wanted the count to come from. It took you at your word.” He finally turned to face me.

His eyes were bloodshot. “Do you understand now?” he asked. “There is no cheating. There is no offering some poor animal and calling it even. There is only the count. If you try to dodge it, bend it, move it over an inch, it snaps back and takes more.” My throat was tight. “So what happens now?” “The same thing that always happens,” Jim said. “People mourn. They put flowers by the ditch. They say it was bad luck, a slick patch, a moment of distraction. They forget the reeds that will start growing thicker there next year.”

“And the warden?” I forced myself to ask. His gaze shifted past me, out over the water. “For a while, it is ahead,” he said. “When the frost comes, it will be even.

Then the years start again.” I stared at the black patch. It seemed larger now. I could see something moving under the surface, just at the edge of my vision. Not a fish. Not a log. Something bigger. Something that brushed the reeds aside as it passed. The wind shifted, carrying the smell around us. In it, under the rot and mud, I thought I could smell something else.

Antiseptic. Rubber gloves. The faint memory of a clinic hallway. “I did not mean for that to happen,” I said. He sighed. “Intention does not count for much with things like this.” For a long time we stood there without speaking. Finally Jim said, “You have a choice to make, Evan. Same one your father faced.” “Leave?” I asked.

He nodded. “Some folks stay. They make peace with it. They pretend it is all coincidence. They live with the knowledge that every few years the water will take someone, and they just hope it is not them or theirs. Others decide they do not want that thing in their rear view mirror every day.” “And my father?” I asked. “He stayed as long as he thought he was helping,” Jim replied. “After that year with the three of them, he knew he could not do anything.

So he packed you up and left. Tried to keep the story from following you.” I thought of the house, the unpaid bills, the empty job listings in town. I thought of the clinic, the twisted wreck of the car in the ditch, the reeds that would grow around that spot. “I have nowhere else to go,” I said. “That is the lie this place loves the most,” Jim said softly.

We both watched as a slow ripple spread outward from the center of the marsh. It rolled under the mat of reeds and lapped against the posts of the overlook. For a moment, as the water rose against the wood, I saw something pressed to the surface. A face. Bloated, pale, eyes open and staring. Mouth full of black water. It might have been my imagination, stitched together from fear and guilt.

Then it sank, leaving only the usual dark. “You see it now,” Jim whispered. “Yeah,” I said. At home, I walked through the rooms without really seeing them. The old photos. The sagging couch. The boxes I had not unpacked. My father had tried to cut me free of this place. I had moved right back into its shadow. In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face.

When I looked up, the mirror showed my reflection, pale and tired. For a second, as the water dripped from my chin, I thought I saw something standing behind me in the doorway. Tall. Thin. Shape made of dripping reeds and black, rippling skin, as if someone had stuffed a body with murky water and let it walk around without bones.

Its face wasn’t quite a face, features suggested by light and shadow. Where eyes should have been, dark sockets stared back at me. I blinked. The doorway was empty. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough to hurt. It was not in the house, I told myself. It was in my head. In the marsh.

I sat down on the edge of the tub and buried my face in my hands. After a while, I stood, walked to the bedroom, and dragged my suitcase from under the bed. I did not have a plan. I did not have a job waiting anywhere else. I had half a tank of gas and a mind full of fear. But I knew one thing. Staying felt less like survival and more like standing at the lip of a dark hole, waiting for my turn.

As I carried the suitcase through the front room, I paused at the window. From there I could see, far off beyond the stand of trees, a faint shimmer where the marsh lay. For a moment, I thought I saw something tall standing in the water, right at the edge of the dark patch. Watching the town. Waiting. The distance made it impossible to be sure.

It might have been a dead tree. A trick of light. Or it might have been the Warden, counting. I set my jaw, turned away, and walked out the door, got in my car, and drove. I did not look in the rear view mirror until I was miles away. But I knew the marsh was back there, patient, watching. It would not miss me. It would not chase me.

It did not need to. Somewhere, sooner or later, in that slow black water, someone else would step too close to the edge. Someone would slip. Someone would think they were safe. Because no one ever warned them. No one ever told them about the creature that keeps score in the dark water. The warden would keep its count. The Warden of Hollow Marsh.
