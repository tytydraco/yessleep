200 miles

I have been driving on this road for 7 hours now. At least I think so. I left my swim meet at around 8 o’clock at night and, instead of the wiser option of booking a hotel, I decided I could make the 4 hour drive home, immediately after my swim meet (which was supposed to end at 6). 1 hour of delays and another hour of shitty meet management, the meet finally ended and I collected my medal and began my drive home.
I live in Florida and this swim meet was across the state, on the West Coast. I live on the East coast, and, unfortunately for me, if I don’t want to drive all the way to Orlando (which would add 2 hours onto my trip), the fastest way back was a road that cut straight through the state, and through the swamp, called Alligator Alley. All was going well, I was listening to a podcast, there were around 3 other cars around so I didn’t feel alone, and I had a near full tank of gas. 

I had taken this same route this morning at a wonderful 4:00 am in order to get to prelims on time. The trip had been (thankfully) traffic free, a rare occurrence, even on a Saturday morning, as even breathing on a road within a 50 mile radius of Miami,will somehow lead to some geriatric crashing their car and there being 3 hours of traffic. 

The trip over had been fine, my meet had gone well, I had ever PR’d and medaled. My coach didn’t yell at me, and it had been a fast pool (if water can feel faster). All in all, it had been a great day. 

My ETA home was 4 hours (if I followed the speed limit), and I was expected to get home at around 1:00 in the morning. The only problem is, that after listening to a 3 hour podcast, I was still on Alligator alley. To explain a little, at this point, I should already have gotten onto I-95. I was driving around 10 miles above the speed limit, and again, I had been driving for 3 hours, but when I looked at the nav, it showed that I was still in the middle of the state.

This pulled me out of the driver’s trance I had been in, and I began to pay more attention to the road signs that I drove past. I couldn’t see any. To be fair,the round I was on  is pretty desolate, and I thought that maybe there just were no exits coming up, but the complete lack of road signs freaked me out a little. On top of that, the cars that I had been driving with had seemingly disappeared, though I don’t remember if they passed me, or if I fell behind. 

Another hour of driving and I was starting to freak out. My phone had seemingly stopped working. My gps still told me I was in the middle of the state, and the time had stopped. I thought that maybe this was due to not being close to any radio towers, but SXM still worked.

My car's mileage was still working, and I noticed that I had travelled nearly 200 miles. I specifically remember my starting mileage because I drive a slightly used Lexus and I am trying to capture the moment when I reach 80,085 miles, mature, I know. The weird part about 200 miles is that Alligator alley is only around 80 miles long. Again, I only know this because of my obsession with seeing my car's mileage spell BOOBS. 

This was my first time ever travelling back to my house from the West Coast, so I thought that I had maybe gotten a little turned around, maybe I had accidentally missed the entrance, and I was not on Alligator Alley, but rather headed South, towards the Keys? With that though, I resigned myself to a few more hours of driving before I would actually allow myself to panic. 

800 miles

I am allowed to panic now. I am typing this through voice-to-type (I know, so safe), so apologies for any misspellings or weird sentences, I hate Siri. 

I have been driving for around 800 miles, during which I have listened to nearly half of  an audiobook, and, freakily enough, watched the sunrise. This means I had been driving for 11 hours. Oddly enough, when I watched the sunrise, it was directly in front of me, which means I am driving East, which means, if I have driven 800 miles, I should be in the ocean right now. The State of Florida is only around 200 miles wide where I am driving. Heck, I should be in the Bahamas right now. 

I cannot truly express how impossible it is that I have driven 800 miles. Not only have I crossed this impossible distance, but my gas level has also not changed at all. 

My only working theory right now is that I hit my head while diving off the blocks at my swim meet, and have violently hallucinated the past 24 hours. That, or same situation, only maybe I drowned, and this is my purgatory before being shipped off to heaven. I should probably start playing Highway to Hell. Maybe, hear me out, every mile is a sin I have committed and I have to drive all my sins off.

Sorry for the rambling, I am very much bored, and there is only so much that  hours of music and audiobooks can do for that. 

  
  


1000 miles

My gas tank still hasn’t moved. My GPS still says I’m in the middle of the state. And the sun is rising again. I am not hungry, I’m not thirsty, I’m not even sore, which I normally am after my swim meets. I have been trying to entertain myself by looking for Alligators. The road I am on wasn’t named Alligator Alley for nothing. There is nothing but miles of swampland surrounding me, but oddly enough, there is no life. It's not only the absence of alligators that upsets me, but the absence of anything. I know I am traveling too fast to be able to see bugs, but there have been none that have hit my windshield, and I am in the middle of a Swamp. I haven’t seen any birds perched on the powerlines, nor cranes standing by the watery ditches just off the side of the road. All of which I saw on my drive over.

The rules of my purgatory don’t entirely make sense, my clock has stopped working, on my phone, my Garmin, and my car. None are working. My Garmin isn’t even sending me notifications about how unproductive I am being, despite my prolonged stationary position. Yet, the sun is still rising and setting, so the day cycle seemingly hasn't changed, but I don’t really feel tired, despite having been up for multiple day cycles (with absolutely no coffee mind you, and, as a 17 year old white girl, a day without Starbs is a day without joy).

Now that I think about it, I haven’t felt anything. No tingling sensations in my feet, no soreness in my back, and no discomfort despite sitting for what seems like nearly 2 days (if the sun can be believed). I have almost accepted at this point that I am dreaming.

My best guess is that during my 200 backstroke, an event done entirely on your back (for those of you that are slower minded), I miscounted the number of strokes I needed to take before flipturning (that summersault thing you see swimmers doing at the olympics) and bashed my head into the wall. From there, I can assumer the poor parent volunteers and the lifeguard on duty (hopefully the hot one on the second stand) dragged me out of the pool, and there is now some poor guy, the same age as me frantically pushing on my chest, desperately forcing air in and out of my lungs, and, if I am lucky and it is the hot lifeguard, maybe he doesn’t have his rescue mask.  

If you couldn't tell, I am going a little stir crazy right now. 

  
  
  
  


1650 miles

I am absolutely, incredibly, stupid. How have I only just noticed this now? Sometime in between the beginning of my drive and 1650 miles into it, or the entire length of the United States, heading North to South, the road had, at some point, transitioned into a one way, single lane road. Which meant I was no longer on Alligator alley, and was on a different road altogether.  On top of that, while checking my appearance in the mirror, my hair is still wet. Like, fresh out of the pool wet. How wet it was when I left the Meet and got in my car. 

While staring at my still wet hair, I see something odd behind me out of my back window. I quickly flip up the sun visor and glance at my rearview mirror and my heart drops.

A figure stands on the pavement behind me, tall and twisted, its limbs too long, its eyes reflecting the red sky like the glow of distant tail lights. I blink, and suddenly it’s closer. I can’t see its face, but I **feel** it watching. I adjust the mirror, trying to convince myself I’m just sleep-deprived,even though I don't feel tired, and haven’t felt tired for several days now, and  that the thing I saw on the road was a hallucination. The sunrise—if I can even call it that—is casting long, unnatural shadows across the dashboard. My hands are gripping the wheel too tight. I force myself to breathe, to focus on the road ahead.

Then, in the mirror, something shifts.

At first, it’s just a dark blue, like a towel and equipment I forgot about in the backseat. But as the miles tick by—1001, 1020, 1400—I swear I see movement. A slow, deliberate unfurling, like something stretching after being asleep for too long. My chest tightens. I don’t want to look directly. I can’t look directly. But in the corner of my eye, just beyond the edges of the mirror, something breathes.

It's a quick puff of warm air on my ear, I immediately slam on the breaks and burst into tears. I frantically turn around, but I see nothing but the towel and folded up techsuit and bikini top I have folded in my backseat. Still, at this point I am hysterically sobbing.

 I have never been good with fear. I will go out of my way to never experience it, I avoid all rollercoasters, and I still to this day have never watched a scary movie. My only exception is that I love internet horror stories. In fact, the podcast I listen to only focuses on those reddit posts where it is either the best read of your life, or a poorly disguised PSA on internet safety. My one coping mechanism with fear is humor. So please excuse me if anything I say is very out of context. 

With tears still dripping down my face, I slam my feet on the gas pedal, determined to reach civilization. 

  
  


The engine hums beneath me, steady and indifferent, as I force my foot down on the gas. My tears have dried into a tight, itchy film on my cheeks, but my heart is still pounding hard enough that I swear I can hear it over the wind. The road stretches endlessly ahead, straight as a blade, slicing through the swamp.

I glance at the rearview mirror again, against every screaming instinct telling me not to. The backseat is still. Just the towel and my folded-up tech suit, exactly as they should be. But I know what I felt—that brief, horrifying puff of warm air against my ear, impossibly close.

“You’re losing it,” I whisper, my voice hoarse. “You’re just tired. This is a stressful dream.”

Saying it out loud does not make it true.

The odometer now reads 1,700 miles. The gas gauge hasn’t moved. The clock hasn’t moved. The road hasn’t changed. I press harder on the pedal, as though speed could somehow break whatever loop I’m caught in, but the landscape remains unnervingly the same.

That is, until I see the exit sign.

It appears like a mirage, shimmering faintly in the hot air. The green metal sign reads: “EXIT 42 - GAS & FOOD” with an arrow pointing right. The relief hits me so hard I almost sob again. I don’t care how impossible it is—I haven’t passed a single exit in over a thousand miles, and now, suddenly, here’s one.

I take it without thinking.

The ramp curves gently downward, and for the first time in what feels like forever, the road is no longer a straight line. I follow it, white-knuckling the steering wheel, praying that at the bottom of this curve there will be lights, people, noise—anything but this awful, endless quiet.

The gas station appears as though summoned. A lone Shell station, bright against the encroaching swamp, with a flickering neon “OPEN” sign in the window. I pull up to a pump, throw the car into park, and sit there for a moment, trying to remember how to breathe.

But the longer I sit, the more wrong it feels.

The gas station is too quiet. No hum of refrigerators, no distant sound of cars from the highway, no chirping of crickets or buzzing of mosquitoes. I realize with a sickening lurch that the “OPEN” sign isn’t flickering. It’s stuttering—like a bad signal, blinking in an irregular, jerky rhythm.

I glance at the rearview mirror again.

There’s a shape in the backseat.

This time, I don’t hesitate. I throw open the car door and stumble out into the thick, humid air, heart hammering against my ribs. I don’t look back at the car. I can’t. I know that if I do, I will see something I can’t explain, something I won’t be able to rationalize away with exhaustion or heat stroke or fear.

The gas station door swings open with a mechanical chime, and I step inside, desperate for human contact.

There’s a cashier standing behind the counter, a tall man with hollow cheeks and a pale, stretched smile. His eyes are too wide, too unblinking.

“Long drive?” he asks, voice smooth and slow, like syrup.

“Yeah,” I manage, my throat dry. “I… I just need directions. I think I’m lost.”

His smile widens, just a fraction too far.

“Sure thing. Where are you headed?”

“Home,” I say. “East coast.”

He doesn’t answer right away. His gaze flicks over my shoulder, toward the car. I swear I see something move in the reflection of the station’s glass door, a dark shape shifting in the backseat, waiting.

“Well,” he says, slow and thoughtful. “You’ve come a long way in the wrong direction.”

A chill crawls down my spine. How am I going in the wrong direction. Every day I have travelled I have been directly facing the sunrise. It is literally impossible for me to go anymore East then I already am.

“Yeah” I laugh nervously. I am a 17 year old girl, alone, with a creepy old man, in the middle of nowhere. I feel like some fear is excusable.

“Where am I?”

 I ask, dreading the answer.

He doesn’t blink. It's then I notice something wrong about his face, it looks just like my swim coach, who is a tried and true Florida man, only it is wrong. His beard is too unkempt, his eyes a little too small, and his nose a little too pointy. 

I stumble back a step, and for the first time, the fear I’ve been choking down rises, sharp and undeniable. I turn and bolt for the door, ignoring the cashier’s soft chuckle behind me, a sound like dry leaves scraping pavement.

I don’t look at the backseat as I climb into the car. I start the engine, slam the door, and peel out of the gas station, tires screeching against the cracked asphalt.

In the rearview mirror, I see the gas station disappear into the haze, swallowed by the swamp. But the shape in the backseat doesn’t disappear.

It’s closer now. And I know, with a cold certainty, that I am not going home.
