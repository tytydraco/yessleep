The year was 2011, in rural northeast Ohio, when I had been living with my mom, sister, and mum mum, (that is my grandmas nickname, she’s had it since I was born).

Summertime was in full swing and so were the expected summer activities as a kid. My sister and I had many friends where we had been staying; a little trailer park with a big patch of open field directly to the upper left of the parking space in front of the trailer. Beyond the field were dense forests stretching into the surrounding national park nearest to us. At the edge of the forest, there was a drop off of about 7-8 feet, sloping down at a 60-70° angle from the edge of the field down to the forest floor. 

During winter, all the kids would grab plastic circle sleds or boogie boards and slide down the drop off as a makeshift snow hill. That spot was usually the meeting point for the neighborhood kids year round, which makes that day even more off. 

That day in particular was cloudy and dry, the air carried with the chill of early signs of fall, and it was quite dark out for it being the middle of the day. I don’t remember entirely why I had been outside that day, but I was alone in the field playing with wooden sticks in the shapes of guns. I was the hero and I was fighting off bad guys when I heard it. 

It had to be far away, but I wasn’t sure, partly because I didn’t exactly know where it came from, but I was also in the middle of the field and sound carried through the trees for miles, but it didn’t trail off like it should have. The tone of it sounded- distant, but the length of the cutoff was too short to be distant, if you understand what I mean. 

At first I thought it was a bobcat, since some had been spotted near the area the year prior, and it made me relax a little. I was a kid and didn’t think too much of it, and carried on playing my game. Then I heard it again, more clearly.

That time I knew it wasn’t a bobcat, unless it was some sort of call i hadn’t heard before. It was long, like it didn’t have a start or an end, as if it only got louder then instantly got quiet, like you turned the volume down on your radio super fast but never turned it off all the way, just barely there but still present. I wasn’t sure what to make of it. I didn’t think it sounded closer, nor did I think it got further away.

The idiot kid I was, I decided to walk towards the end of the field, almost as if I was drawn to it. I didn’t hear it again for quite some time, it had to have been 30 or so minutes of complete silence from the woods. Now I don’t mean dead silent, there were occasional cars that had passed during the time I was outside, and birds were chirping, but it felt like there was an absence of sound in a specific way. Like something was always there, and then it was gone. 

I got bored of waiting to find out what it was and was about to turn back to head home for the day, since it had been about 30 or so minutes of me waiting for this scream to come back, when I saw it.

Far back into the forest was an old dogwood tree that had grown to exponential heights and had no leaves on it, signifying it was dead. The tree had to have been upwards of 40 feet tall, with a trunk about 5 or so feet wide. At the peak of the tree, was a round grey object, unnaturally placed among the green leaves surrounding. Something deep inside told me that I needed to leave right away, retreat back inside like I planned and don’t look back. 

But I didn’t. 

Instead, I tried to focus on it to see if I could get a better look, and I actually did. I saw it move. 

Whatever it was, it was big. I realized with horror that there was detail on the object, but it wasn’t an object at all. It was a face, and from that distance I could see a yellow gap near the bottom of the face. Was it smiling at me? 

It was, and the closer I looked, the more detail I could see. Eyes as black as night without stars, like looking into the corner of your bedroom as a kid at night and swearing something lived in that darkness, thrived on it. It had no nose, from what I could see, as well as no ears. It was entirely hairless, the skin of whatever it was being smooth, but not shiny. Hence why I couldn’t tell at first what it was.

I froze, unable to move. My limbs were pulsating with lightning, my head screaming to move, to run, to do anything. But I stood there, motionless, unable to scream.

I swear to this day, creeping out from the woods, I heard it say my name. It wasn’t like the scream I heard earlier, no. It was deeper, guttural even, and drawn out like sharp nails scraping across chalkboards. Then everything went silent. 

This silence was different from earlier, not like the absence of just one thing. This was absent of sound altogether, like a deep sleep where all you dream of is pitch black emptiness.

It all happened so fast. Within seconds the head whipped back behind the tree and whatever it was came racing down the tree towards the floor, like a bear making its fast decent down a tree. 

The head poked back out at the bottom of the tree, still smiling. It stayed there for a full minute, without moving.

Without warning, this thing raced away from the tree, retreating back into the forest. It was tall, ab 6 feet and super thin. Almost past anorexia, its shoulder blades and spine visible through its skin on its back. It ran on two legs, although I never saw its feet. Its neck was long and thin as well, making the creature all the more unnerving.

I stood there for another hour, unable to think or move. Only when I heard my mother calling for me did I realize how long I was actually out there for. The sky was beginning to grow darker with nighttime approaching.

I headed back towards my house, unable to wrap my head around where all the time had gone and more importantly, what it was I had seen. Just before I rounded the house heading towards the front door, I heard the scream again.

It never got closer from when I heard it the first time, making me pause and think. Was it ever gone? Did it go back into the tree? 

One question was louder than the others. How long had it been there for?

To this day I still don’t know what it was exactly I saw back then, and part of me still thinks it never left. Mum Mum still lives in that trailer park, and I have visited hundreds of times since then. I haven’t heard it or seen it since, but sometimes I still hear that scream. The scream that never got closer, but never got further.

I wonder if it’s still out there.
