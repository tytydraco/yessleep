It began during my second year of college, the night before my Organic Chemistry final.
I hadn’t slept. I couldn’t afford to. My hands trembled as I tried, for the tenth time, to make sense of the same sentence, the words swimming uselessly across the page like ink in water - everywhere but in my brain. The clock ticked on in the background, each second a slow, deliberate heartbeat, echoing in my skull like a countdown to failure. With every tick, time seemed to taunt me.

Midnight.

One.

Two.

The air in the room was thick, stale with sweat, caffeine, and desperation. My shirt clung to my back. The walls felt too close. My eyes burned from staring, unblinking, at the same lines of notes that refused to sink in. I told myself if I just focused a little longer, just pushed a little harder, I could cram enough knowledge into my brain to scrape by. Just enough to survive. Just enough not to fail this one time. 
But the truth was, I was already unraveling under the pressure. And time wasn’t slowing down for anyone.

At around 4 AM I allowed myself a small bathroom break; I grabbed an empty glass to fill with water.

Out of habit, I looked up, bleary-eyed, into the mirror above the sink. For a second, I thought I saw something move behind me. Something tall and dark where there shouldn’t have been anything at all.

I turned around: nothing; just the clutter of the room, perfectly reflected into the dirty glass, right in the middle of which was my pitiful face, the face of a dumb idiot, of one who was yet again unable to plan ahead instead of cramming all his efforts into a last minute tour de force. I could think of no other face that I hated more than mine.

Then, it happened.

The glass rippled like a pebble dropped into water, and the reflection blinked, though I hadn’t. I leaned in, certain that it was just an illusion conjured by my sleep deprived mind. I put the glass down, touched my face, and recoiled in horror when I realized that only one of us was smiling, and it was not the guy on my side of the mirror.

Then the voice came. Low, soothing, impossibly deep. It didn’t echo in the room. It echoed... within me. 

"I can give you what you desire."

Any sane person would’ve screamed. Or bolted off. But I wasn’t sane, not then. Days without sleep and weeks of buried panic had dulled the sharp edge of fear. My thoughts moved like sludge. My mouth was bone-dry, and my heartbeat roared in my ears like a war drum. I knew I should’ve been afraid, but instead, I just stared.

Somewhere inside me, the last rational voice tried to rise, tried to scream that none of this was real. That this wasn’t how the world worked. But it drowned beneath the weight of fatigue and desperation. I was vulnerable in ways I couldn't even understand.

“What can you give me?” I asked. The words scraped out of my cracked lips in a hoarse croak, barely louder than breath.

The thing smiled; its - no, my - face stretched into something too wide, too sharp, like it had forgotten how human skin was meant to fit. "You want time," it said. "That’s what you wish for, isn’t it?"

"Don’t we all," I murmured, my voice little more than dust riding air.

It leaned forward, the smile deepening into something predatory, yet oddly kind. Familiar.

"I offer you a gift," it said. "The power to stop time. Completely. The world, frozen at your will. Move through it untouched. Think. Rest. Work. While no one else moves, no one else knows." 

My breath hitched. Was I really so far gone that I was entertaining a deal with a hallucination? Maybe. But if this was just a dream, what harm could there be in playing along? Fantasies didn’t leave scars. No one gets hurt when nothing is real.

"Nothing comes without a price. What would I owe you?" 

The thing tilted its head, that alien, predatory grin still stretched across our shared face like a mask that didn’t quite fit.
"Nothing that you can't refuse to give. Nothing beyond your control."

And just like that, it was over.

The reflection smoothed itself out, my face returning to its normal, exhausted shape. The echo in my skull faded into silence. The presence - the entity - was gone.

I blinked. Silence pressed in. My hand trembled as I reached for the glass of water on the side of the sink. I downed it in one long gulp, hoping the coolness would snap me out of whatever trance I’d slipped into.

Maybe I’d imagined it all. Maybe the stress had finally cracked something in my head. That seemed more reasonable than bargaining with a phantom in the mirror.

I shuffled back to my desk, collapsed into the chair, and before I realized I had dropped my head onto my chemistry book. Sleep had claimed me. 

-

I woke the next morning with no more knowledge than I’d started with the evening before, and with so little sleep that I might as well have been a reanimated corpse dragging itself to the exam hall. My brain felt wrapped in fog, every thought slow and sluggish, like it had to wade through molasses before surfacing.

At 8:59, I was sitting in front of an exam paper waiting to be flipped at the start signal. The room buzzed with quiet anticipation. Pens clicked. Pages rustled. A throat cleared. I hadn’t even flipped the paper over when a flicker of memory surfaced - my dream from the night before. Almost without thinking, and mostly as a joke to myself, I narrowed my thoughts and silently commanded the clock on the wall to stop.

To my utter astonishment... it did.

Everything did.

The professor, mid-stride, froze in place as if sculpted in wax. A girl across the aisle was halted mid-sneeze, her face twisted comically, hand suspended inches from her nose. The steady hum of the led lights fell into absolute silence. Even the motes of dust hanging in the sunlight next to the window paused, caught in midair like tiny stars trapped in glass.

Time had obeyed me.

I sat there for a long moment, heart hammering in the stillness, testing the edges of this impossible calm. Then, with the world locked in place around me, I calmly flipped the exam paper open and began to read. No ticking clock, no pressure, no anxious glances from classmates - just me and the questions. I took my time, worked through each problem carefully, checked and rechecked every answer. Hours might’ve passed. Days, even. It didn’t matter.

When I finally let time resume, it was as if only a second had passed.

That day, I aced the exam. And I never looked back.

-

At first, I used the gift carefully. Sparingly. To study. To think. To buy time during moments of pressure. It felt harmless. Efficient. Responsible, even.

After a while it crept into even smaller parts of my everyday life. Overslept? Stop time and get ready without being late. Need to think of a good comeback during a tense conversation? Freeze everything and prepare for as long as you need. Want to get a promotion? Hit pause, complete your tasks in half the time with double the results, then unpause like nothing happened.

Time became my personal playground. I used it to read more, learn more, do more. It felt like I was outsmarting the system, hacking life itself.

But the human body is not an infallible, incorruptible machine.

By the time I was twenty-four, things started feeling… off.
There was gray in my hair. Lines forming around my eyes and mouth. My joints ached after sitting for too long.

I visited a doctor who told me I had the stress profile of someone in their late thirties.
"Are you under extreme pressure?" she asked.
I brushed it off. "In this day and age, who isn’t?" 

If only in the back of my mind, I started to realize: time wasn’t freezing for me. It was only freezing for everyone else.

Every time I willed a pause, every hour I spent alone in the frozen world, my body kept aging. My cells didn’t stop dividing. My bones didn’t stop thinning. My heart didn’t stop beating.
I was spending my life in the stillness. Burning through it, actually.

I told myself I’d use it less. I didn’t.

It had become some sort of reflex. Drop a glass? Pause time, catch it. Need to pee during a movie? Pause time, go to the toilet, unpause. Forgot my keys? Stop time, go back home, grab them.

No stress. No consequences.

I never dated seriously. It was too hard to connect. People lived in the moments. I lived between them.

My friends joked about it. Said I was an old soul, that it started showing on the outside too. "I swear, you look older every time I see you."

They laughed. I forced smiles.

While they got married, had kids, built messy, vibrant lives full of imperfect moments, I lingered in quiet perfection. Efficient, solitary, my own wonderfully controlled perfection.

At twenty-eight, I looked forty-five. I moved like a tired man. A slow man. A man who had seen too much, too quickly.

Soon, there were no more calls from friends. No more texts. No one left to invite me to dinner or to ask how I was doing. I’d drifted away from everyone. Not out of anger or conflict. Just immeasurable, immense distance.

And then, no matter how often I would stop time to delay it, came my thirtieth birthday.

A milestone for most, for me, a gravestone.

I lit a single candle on a cupcake bought from the 24-hour grocery store. I was in no mood for celebration. With all the overtime I had been accumulating, who knew how old I actually was by this point. Birthdays had lost all meaning, and only the annoying skeleton of formality had remained. 

My eyes, now foggy with cataract, stared at the small flickering flame.

And then something moved. The shadows in the room that had been dancing with the flame started thickening. 

I stood up slowly, my joints protesting with every movement, each creak of bone a reminder of time’s toll.

I knew what this was. I know who this was. 

"You lied to me," I said, my voice rough, weathered by years of silence. "You said there would be no consequences." 

A ripple passed through the darkness. Then, like smoke drawing breath, the shadows coalesced into a familiar form - the version of myself I had once been. Young. Sharp-eyed. Unscarred. It wore my old smile, that arrogant, desperate curve of the mouth I used to believe made me brave.
"I said the price would be nothing out of your control," it replied, its demonic voice smooth and cruelly calm. "And you got exactly what you asked for." 

My hands trembled, wrinkled skin clenching into fists that had long since forgotten strength. I stared at the figure before me, my doppelgänger, frozen in the prime of a life I had squandered in stolen moments. I was an old man now, brittle and forgotten, peering into the eyes of someone who had never paid the cost.

The silence felt was suffocating, thick with everything I could no longer undo. The years I had leapt over. The memories I had never made. Birthdays I missed, seasons that passed without witness, people who had moved on while I paused the world to chase a fantasy of control.

Tears welled at the corners of my eyes; not just from anger, but from mourning. Mourning the man I might have been, the life I could have lived had I let it unfold, moment by moment, mistake by mistake.

"I thought I was saving time," I whispered, each word dry and crumbling, like dust dislodged from the top of a forgotten shelf.

"Instead, you were spending it," the creature’s voice whispered through my mind, with the very same voice that had haunted me all those years ago, "faster than anyone else. And gifting it to me. While others laughed, cried, failed, loved… you stepped aside into solitary perfection. You stole years of moments and filled them with nothing. You mistook silence for peace. Stillness for life."

My gaze fell back to the lone birthday candle before me. Its flame wavered once, as if unsure, then guttered out - its final breath of light swallowed whole by the dark.

And just like that, I was alone again.

Not in frozen time, but in a world that had kept moving, kept growing, kept living - without me. The silence I had once worshipped as sanctuary now rang hollow, a tomb I had built with my own hands.

And in that stillness, I felt them: the weight of all the seconds I had stolen. The missed laughter. The unshed tears. The embraces I never gave. A thousand lifetimes unlived, pressing down on me like ash from a fire long dead.

Time had never stopped.

Only I had.
