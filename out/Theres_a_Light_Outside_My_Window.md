I know this sounds totally insane, but I swear something is off with my new neighbor. I am honestly feeling so on edge every single night, like I cannot even sleep or think straight. I figured maybe sharing it here might help, because I need someone to tell me I am not losing it, or at least give me some idea of what I should do next. I know this might be long, but please bear with me.

I have lived in this same old house for years, and yeah, it has its creaks and weird sounds, but I have never felt like this before, not even when I had that creepy landlord a few years back. That guy was weird, always watching from his window at odd hours. This new neighbor is different, and I mean that in the worst possible way. For the past two weeks, I have noticed that no matter what time I wake up at night, there is a faint light behind my curtains, shining at a low angle like it is coming from a flashlight or maybe a phone.

The first night I assumed it was nothing, maybe a passing car or a cat. Then it happened again and again. Now I am sure that someone, I am almost certain it is my neighbor, is actually standing outside my window in the middle of the night, never making a sound, just standing there. I tried to catch them, but any time I rush to the window or fling open the blinds there is just darkness.

Let me tell you, that kind of silent persistence really does something to your head, you know, makes you question every thought you have. I started staying awake longer, pretending to sleep but with one eye half open, waiting for that faint glow. Sure enough, it is always there.

When I try to tell my friends, they say I am paranoid, stressed out from work, that I need a break. How can I take a break when I have this feeling that I am being watched, like studied, like maybe someone is waiting for me to slip up or drop my guard? It is not just the light either.

During the day, I have caught him staring at me from behind his curtains next door, just standing still. He never waves, never looks away like a normal person would when caught, just stares like I am some sort of animal he is analyzing. If that does not scream messed up I do not know what does.

I would call the cops, but what would I say? That I think my neighbor watches me at night because I see a weird light outside my window, that during the day he stares at me through his curtains? I have no proof. I worry that if I confront him it might escalate, like maybe he has been trying to work up the nerve to do something worse. I am just here waiting, feeling that clock tick in my skull.

It has gotten to the point that when the sun goes down I start shaking a little, and I lie in bed watching the walls, the door, the window, imagining that faint glow coming closer. Maybe pressing against the glass. Maybe one night I will wake and he will be inside, standing in the corner of my bedroom, silent and still.

I do not want to live like this, but I am too scared to do anything, too scared to even tell my family. They would just say I am too old to be afraid of the dark, that I am letting my imagination go wild. Maybe I am. Maybe it is all in my head.

But I can feel it, I can feel those eyes on me. I wonder how long he will wait before making a move, how long until something finally gives, because I cannot see a way out. I cannot rest. I cannot bring myself to just pull the trigger and call the cops.

I am stuck in a messed up state right now, waiting every night for that light to appear. It always does. I have no clue how the hell this will ever end.
