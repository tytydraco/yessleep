I don’t remember crawling in.

One moment, I was charting rock sediment with the rest of the team. The next, I was inside something wetter than lungs—something that pulsed like it hated the rhythm of my heartbeat. My hands sank wrist-deep in meat-like soil. Not dirt—no, this was veined flesh. Hot. Twitching. The floor convulsed gently, like it was dreaming. It smelled like placenta, battery acid, and burnt teeth. The kind of scent that coats the back of your throat like warm phlegm and stays there.

Something whispered beneath me.

Not from the walls. From inside me. Every time my elbow clicked, it hissed out a phrase in my father’s voice. “You’re not enough.” Click. “You’ll never be.” Click. “They’ll leave you behind.” My knees started to tremble, but not from fear—from resonance. Something in the floor was harmonizing with my bones.

I tried to vomit. My stomach convulsed—but nothing came up. Just a pressure, rising. And then… a hand. My hand. Fingers-first, it clawed up my throat, pale and slick with bile, nails chipped and twitching. It waved at me. I stared. And then it slithered back down. I can still feel its knuckles knocking behind my eyes.

My mouth isn’t where I left it.

It’s moving. Last night, I saw it pressed against the nape of my neck, curled like a leech. Whispering. Whispering soft regrets in my own voice. It told me about the time I mocked my brother’s stutter. About the girl I ghosted after her father died. About the night I watched someone cry at a party and said nothing. It kissed my spine with my tongue. It moaned apologies I never said. And it drooled down my back in thick, fibrous strings.

And that’s not the worst part.

I saw Sarah again.

Or something wearing Sarah.

She stood just past the dripping hallway, a silhouette of mismatched growth. Her skull was infantile—soft and domed, the fontanelle still sunken—but her limbs were adult, stretched and disjointed like a puppet halfway through becoming real. Her spine bent the wrong way. Her knees faced each other like praying hands. Her mouth moved in stuttering, wet spasms. But no sound came out. Only the echo of our last fight—my laughter—looping behind my ears like a tape reel I couldn’t eject.

The air around her bled. Not metaphorically—it bled, hemorrhaging sideways in slow-motion waves that stained the room like a rotting bruise. The color of dried rust and expired meat. The smell of Sarah’s shampoo, mingled with septic rot.

She reached toward me with arms that ended in mirrors.

Not mirrors like glass—mirrors like skin pulled tight over reflective bone. I saw myself in them.

But not as I am.

I saw the versions of me that never made it. One wore my mother’s face stretched across its own like a wet towel. Another chewed its fingers into stumps, and smiled through pulp-filled teeth. One just stood there, twitching—smiling—until its eyes caved in and it began to sing. And the song… it was beautiful. So beautiful I stopped breathing. I wanted to drown in it.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Time folds inward like a womb trying to forget the child it birthed. My fingernails have grown teeth. They chatter in my sleep. Sometimes I wake up with bite marks on my thighs, and I don’t know whose mouth made them. My bones feel waterlogged. My skin peels in sentences. Something wrote “you’re next” across my chest in my own stretch marks.

There’s a movement in the wall—just beyond the pulsing folds. Something is burrowing through the gore-veins. I can hear its knuckles cracking as it claws. It sounds like a mole with a baby’s head and it knows my name. It’s saying it backward. Over and over. Slurred and musical. Like a lullaby for the damned.

And worst of all?

I think—I think I love it.

It smells like home.
