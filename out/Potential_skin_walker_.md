Me and my friend O were having a sleepover with our other friend called P it was around 12am and we were sitting in bed we recently decided to baby sit this dog called pablo since the owners were on holidays.This dog was very hyper and would not shut up.                                           


O’s-dad had work the next day early since he works shifts at 6am and he was getting very frustrated as the dog would not calm down and he could not sleep with all the barking so we decided to take the dog for a walk to tire it and O’s mum agreed and gave us permission.                                                


In our pyjamas we went outside with the dog and started walking we decided to take the back road so we could have a nice toke while walking.It was pitch dark but a calm evening with no rain.We decided to go to a local take away that is open 4pm-2am. We rang previous at one am too do our order but there was no answer which was weird but we went anyways since it’s open and the website even said it was open and it usually always is.                                                             



When we got there it was closed and dark with only a dim eerie white and blue light and we were like FECK SAKE no FOCKIN chips dia ma shábhail.Little did we know that was not the issue at all.                                                                        


We decided to walk back home since it was late and our walk wasn’t meant to last that long.On our way home we received a call from P and I answered knowing she would be curious of our whereabouts.                                                         


When I answered there was no one talking and I said hello ? I hung up P called abainn but this time there was a croaked mysterious voice talking saying “ where are yous “ I thought it was P just putting on a voice since she always does this and tries scare us she once pretended to be possessed at 5am so this didn’t surprise us but it kept ringing after we hung up until we answered and said we’re almost home we will be arriving in ten minutes and the croaked voice answered by good… soon .                                     


As we walked up to the house all the lights were off. We were greeted at the door by O’s ma she looked very tired and did not sound like herself and she looked off.                                                              


She said “ yous take a long time are  yous sure yous didn’t see anyone “ we answered by no and went upstairs while her mum chuckled. We brushed this off and when we got upstairs P was lying on the bed and not corresponding and we didn’t see her phone.                                             


We rang her phone to hear the ringing was coming from downstairs. Where o’s mother was.We we’re creeped out at this point until we received a message from O’s mom saying “ where are yous I am where yous told me to go It’s dark and late are yous safe yous said yous we’re in danger “ then we realised whatever was downstairs wasn’t O’s mother.
