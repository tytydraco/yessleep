*NSFW* : Discussion of suicide.

- - - - -

Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other - not in any meaningful way - and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it."* Maggie reassured me. "*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

*“Because, honey, that room is a* [*storage closet.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
