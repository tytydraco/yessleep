It started last night around nine. I was watching Spirited Away for the third time since seeing it last year, and I heard two rapid knocks. Then two more. Then two more. Always like that. “DuDum. DuDum. DuDum.”

I got up to look through the peephole and saw no one. I go to the kitchen, grab a knife, and return to the door. I open it slowly and look around the hallway.

Nobody was around, and there was no way to get away without the echo of the steps reverberating from the walls. I return inside, pick up my little black cat, and plop on the couch again.

Then, it happened again. “DuDum. DuDum. DuDum.” The second one is always a bit louder, a bit harder. I go back to the door to see if there’s a piece of trash or something stuck.

I inspect the door carefully this time and find nothing out of the ordinary. I decided to shoot my landlord an email, considering a text at this time was a bit uncouth.

“Hey,

I’ve been hearing knocks at my door for about twenty minutes now and nobody is around. Hoping it’s just an issue with creaky hinges or something, but I’d really appreciate if you could take a look at it.

Best,

Isabel.”

The knocking stopped around eleven and didn’t continue until the same time the next night. For two hours, two knocks, never-ending. I turned the volume up on my television until I could only feel the knocks, vibrations hitting my bones with the wall of sound my speakers were emitting. I wonder if this could be some sort of delusion.

It’s Sunday, and tomorrow Bruce (my landlord) will be by to look at it. So I grab a glass, pour some wine, and go back to the episode of White Lotus with plans to drift off on the couch. The episode ends, and the knocks continue. For another half hour or so, this treacherous sound amplifies from the beginning of my apartment. I decide to go outside, find a cigarette, and smoke until the sound rests.

The next day, Bruce came. He was a pudgy bald man with a sad face and even sadder voice. I’d be creeped out if I didn’t feel so damn sorry. His eyes never stayed in one spot for more than a second, and his height still intimidated me despite him being no more than five-four.

He put WD40 on the hinges, checked the cracks for lodged…anything, and, finally, took a screwdriver out. He takes the battery out of my lock and reattaches the cover. “Alrighty, let’s see what that does.” I didn’t expect much from Bruce, so even coming down in sincerity meant enough.

The knocking continued that night, but this time, it didn’t stop. I open the closet next to the front door, inspect the bathroom, look in the kitchen, and find nothing. I close the closet door, and the knocking gets quieter. My mind must be playing games with me.

The knocking finally subsided at 12:07 am, which was followed by a stench.

A stench so horrific, it could only mean one thing. I called the police to report the smell, reporting that I could smell it in my apartment so one of the neighbors must’ve died a few days ago. I did have an elderly woman who didn’t leave much, if at all. I figured that the inevitable had struck.

I wish.

The police came to me first. That was my first red flag. Then they asked to open the closet muffled the knocking. So I did. They take out my cat crate, Swiffer, and air mattress, throwing them aside as one retrieves a knife from his pocket.

He cuts through the carpet, tears it up, and takes some sort of sledgehammer to the planks.

There was a young man, maybe 17, concaving in on himself. He was withering away from a combination of hunger, thirst, and living under the floorboards. He was dead, but in a peaceful sort of way, like seeing the body at an open-casket funeral.

I remembered later, Bruce never put the batteries back in, and neither did I, yet the lock has been working perfectly. And who fed him? Who gave him water?

I moved out the day this was discovered, moving back in with my mom and sisters to be close to family. I still think about the three coupled knocks. Was it code? Did it mean he needed food? Could I have helped him?

I moved into a new apartment a few days ago, and while I’m not sure I believe this, it’s back. “DuDum. DuDum. DuDum.” I really think I might be losing it.
