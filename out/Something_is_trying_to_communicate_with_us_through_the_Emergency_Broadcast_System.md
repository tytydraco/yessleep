I work the night shift doing routine maintenance in a run-down regional emergency broadcast centre. I'm sure you're familiar with the alert system - I grew up with the annoying "This has been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System" disturbing television viewing and radio listening and although things are gradually moving to a text-based system, the old way of sending these alerts out is still alive and kicking.

For more years than I can count, it was mindless work. Fixing broken antennas, power surges and old cables corroded through years of service took up a small percentage of my time and thinking about the more glamorous paths my life could have trodden took up the remaining majority. Same old stuff, night after night - until a few weeks ago.

It started with the test tones. The standard was a triple-beep cadence - the harsh sound that you might be thinking of when you imagine an emergency alert - but it had... an extra modulation. A fourth pulse was neatly tucked within what should have been static. It would have gone unnoticed if I hadn't been running a waveform visualiser, but I was because I always found a weird calm in watching the patterns come and go when we were testing. I logged it as what seemed to be the most logical explanation - signal bleed - and moved on to ruminating about whatever was on my mind at the time. Usually, after I logged an incident, I would receive a response by the next night's shift, or in case of some emergency, that same night. I never received a response to this incident.

The anomaly never showed up during actual alerts, only during weekly system testing. Always the same, four beeps instead of three. Still no response from my multiple flags.

I accepted I would never scratch the itch of discovery in this instance and began to ignore that fourth beep, but then the tones became more complex. Underneath the standard alert, sub-tones layered themselves in rising pitch and trailing off like some unknowable voice. Spectrographic analysis revealed something akin to compressed audio, so I isolated one such piece and slowed it down.

It sounded like a voice unable to surface from underneath a deep ocean cavern - mumbling in a cadence and tone unlike any language I had heard. Indistinguishable from some odd form of background noise, save for a little sense of instinctual knowing that nestled itself within. I logged the strange subtone as another incident, half-knowing I would receive the same response as before and by now feeling an unease stemming from some nebulous origin. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the *ding!* indicating an email had come into my inbox, only to be left feeling... very badly *off* after reading it. It was from the Chief Broadcast Engineer, a man whom I'd met on my first night and not once since.

"*Stop digging.*"

That same night, the power in the entire centre went out. It took a little while, but the backup generators kicked in and my screens sputtered back to life. Except one. It remained blank, a useless hunk of fairly expensive matter - and one that I needed at that, so after unsuccessfully attempting the usual tricks, I crawled underneath my desk and opened up the computer that powered it. The dusty motherboard and overworked fan that I expected to see weren't there - nothing was - except for a sludgy mess of thick black fluid. Pulsing and bubbling in a dance of horrific sentience as if trying to communicate through impossible means.

I stumbled backwards onto the cold floor beneath the desk, my heart threatening to hammer through my chest and form a soup of blood and fear in a pool around me, and when I cobbled together the strength to sit back down, I never bothered logging the incident.

Something within me pleaded. Begged. Screamed at me that something was badly wrong. But at the heart of it, nothing worth losing this job over had happened yet. I was creeped out - *scared* \- but I could put up with scared.

Last Friday, the scheduled test alert came through again. Four beeps again. The standard EBS spoken message again. But the subtones were different this time. Stretched, far enough to be easily noticed and impossible to ignore.

I isolated the waveform again, and this time it wasn't just the sound of a voice begging to form but not quite being allowed. It was actual speech. Speech I initially thought to be distorted, but twenty plays later, I found to be terrified. Desperate.

It was repeating a phrase I couldn't quite comprehend - like it was spoken through a tin can on the other side of some wall. But it became clearer with each of my innumerable playbacks, like it was easing me into understanding - a hideous form of exposure therapy.

Two words were buried in that signal.

Whispering and pleading.

"*Help us.*"

I only wish that had been the end.

Because the metadata in that signal listed the origin node, a signifier of *where* that information came from.

A point of data that I had been trained to expect to remain the same throughout every test.

But it wasn't from the location I had expected it to be.

It wasn't even from any location in our local vicinity.

It wasn't from Earth at all.
