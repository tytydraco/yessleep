I lost all physical control of my body when my mother bit me. It all happened so quick, I didn't have any time to react. One moment I was planning my future, the next a walking puppet. My stomach is in a perpetual state of ravenous hunger, and my body in constant agony. I don't even know how long its been since it all started. We're all trapped in this hell together.

All I can really do anymore is reminisce of the past. I have to constantly push down the memory of what my mother and I had done to the rest of our family. The day had started off normal as any other. You'd of never realized the world was ending unless you were directly at ground zero. I remember the loud slam of the front door spelling the end for me. I didn't pay it much attention, but my daze of staring my computer screen was shook whenever I heard a ear splitting scream following the initial slam.

I looked over at my door in a state of panic and anxiety. Racing out of my room, I ran towards the entrance of our home. Nothing could of prepared me for the visceral scene before me. Lying sprawled out across the ground was our family dog. He was yelping out in pain as a large figure ripped into its flesh. I stared on in silent horror as I witnessed the animal I loved so much die. There was something about the noises hitting my ears that caused this dear in headlights moment. I wanted to run, I wanted to scream. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

This was probably the last mistake I'll ever get to make, as the figure quickly snapped its head up toward my gaze. To make matters even more terrifying (and frankly hard to grasp), I recognized this person. The woman who had raised me since birth just finished eating our pet, and I was next. Everything in my mind screamed for me to run, but there must of been lead in my shoes because I didn't. I just stared and watched her approach me. All it took was one bite for me to lose all conciseness.

I'm unsure how much time had passed since that point, but eventually my eyes did open again. At first, I assumed what I had was a horrifying nightmare. It had all the signs of one. Unfortunately, I quickly came to the realization that my body was currently in motion. I wanted to scream, but my mouth did not open. I needed to panic, but my body did not respond. All I could do was stare on in horror as my body moved on its own.

It's kind of morbidly peaceful after it was over. My family and I spend our days shambling from room to room seemingly for no reason. Mom must of locked the door when it all started I guess, because we can't seem to open the door. Or maybe we can't figure out how, my body doesn't really seem to understand a lot anymore. We had heard a noise outside some time ago that sent waves of hunger throughout my body, forcing me to slam my head to attempt to make my way outside. However, it didn't work. Nothing ever does anymore. The feeling eventually faded, almost like my body forgot the noise even happened. Then it was back to wandering.

I just want this hell to end.
