I awoke to the blaring sound of my phone alarm, dizzy and disoriented. I almost ignored it momentarily, but panic shot through me like an electric jolt. I grabbed my phone, squinting at the time: 4:02 a.m.

"Oh, shit!" I muttered, repeating it like a mantra as I bolted out of bed. I was late for work.

The room was pitch black—no light from the hallway, no glow from the microwave clock. I quickly realized the power was out. My half-charged phone became my makeshift flashlight as I fumbled to get dressed.

I kissed Rachel, my wife, and my daughter, whispering quickly, "Love you," before rushing out the door. But as I looked down at my daughter, her small face still frozen in sleep, something tugged at my chest. I should've taken more time. I should've kissed her, told her I loved her more than just in passing. It was one of those moments you don't realize you'll regret until it's too late.

When I stepped outside, the whole complex was swallowed in darkness. No streetlights, no porch lights—not even the moon's faint glow. The air felt thick, heavier than usual, and the silence was unsettling, broken only by the faint hum of a distant car engine.

"It's just a power outage," I told myself, sliding into my car.

But as I drove, the darkness didn't let up. My headlights barely pierced it, illuminating only a few feet of road ahead. The void surrounding me stretched endlessly like something was blotting out the world.

I passed a few other cars on the highway, their headlights flickering weakly in the gloom, like candles in a storm. One driver honked and waved frantically as they sped past, their face pale and wide-eyed. Another car pulled over, its hazard lights blinking weakly before cutting out entirely. Unease settled in my stomach, but I kept driving.

The radio crackled to life with bursts of static and half-finished sentences:

"...engulfed the city at approximately..." *static* "...authorities urge residents to..." *static* "...stay indoors until further notice..."

I turned it off, gripping the wheel tightly. Something wasn't right.

That's when I saw it.

A cluster of bright lights shimmered in the sky ahead, grouped in an unnatural pattern. At first, I thought it was a constellation or aurora borealis, but the lights were too close and vivid. They shifted slightly, almost imperceptibly, like embers drifting in a breeze.

I pulled into the lot of a gas station, desperate to find others. A handful of cars were parked haphazardly, their drivers standing outside, staring at the sky. I stepped out and approached them.

"Hey!" I called, jogging toward the group. A woman stood there, clutching a child tightly, rocking him back and forth without a word. Her face was pale, eyes filled with a haunted kind of worry. An older man leaned on a cane, his face pale and eyes wide with fear. A young guy in a baseball cap stood beside them, looking equally unnerved.

"Does anyone know what's going on? Is this just a blackout?" I asked, trying to steady my voice, my heart pounding harder every second.

The woman didn't respond. She just held the child tighter, rocking him faster.

The young guy muttered, "I thought it was just the city... but this?" He gestured to the sky, his hand trembling.

The older man finally spoke, his voice low and hoarse. "Where are the stars?"

I froze and looked up. He was right. The rest of the sky was empty—no stars, moon, nothing. Just that shifting cluster of lights hanging in the air like some unnatural force.

My stomach churned. "What the hell is that?"

Before I could say anything else, the cluster moved. Slowly, deliberately, the lights spiraled inward, folding over themselves. For a brief moment, I saw the stars beyond—the stars we'd been missing—then they disappeared again, swallowed by the shifting mass.

The toddler started screaming, a sharp, piercing cry that cut through the air. I felt it in my bones—the instinct that told me to run.

The lights shifted again, and I realized what I saw with growing dread.

It wasn't a cluster of stars.

It was teeth.

The lights formed the edges of a massive, spiraling maw, its ridges twisting and curling like a slow, deliberate blink. The darkness wasn't the night sky—it was the body of something so massive it blotted out everything.

I stumbled back, gasping for breath. My heart pounded in my chest, too fast, too hard. Around me, people started screaming. The air grew frigid, and the ground began to tremble violently.

I turned to run, but my legs wouldn't move. What was I even running from? There was nowhere to go.

Then, silence.

Complete, suffocating silence.

At first, I thought it was just the absence of sound—the stillness of the world around me. But as the seconds stretched, I realized something far worse: the silence wasn't natural. It felt wrong, almost painful. My ears rang with a pressure I couldn't shake off, as though something was crushing my eardrums from the inside.

The toddler's cries, the rumble of the ground, even my panicked breaths—all of it was gone. My body trembled, but I couldn't hear the shaking. The world had gone mute, not from the absence of sound—but from its crushing weight, as if the air had become so thick that sound could no longer travel.

I watched in horror as the gas station sign bent, snapping like a twig under an invisible force. The woman clutched her child, her mouth open in a silent scream. The older man's cane snapped in half as he collapsed. The young man's car crumpled like paper, swallowed whole by the void.

I dropped to my knees, pressing my hands against my ears in a futile attempt to stop the pressure. But the silence... the silence was not something I could escape.

I closed my eyes momentarily, trying to breathe and think of Rachel, my daughter. The things I hadn't done, the moments I hadn't shared. Maybe this was it; perhaps this was the end. But even as the darkness closed in, I could still remember them—my family. The ones I'd failed to love enough to hold close.

I let go.
