I shot awake, gasping for air, clawing at the sheets in a futile attempt to hold onto the life I once had, but like always it slipped through my fingers. The dream wasn't a nightmare, at least not this time. This time the nightmare was waking up again. I sat up in bed and rubbed the sleep out if my eyes, knowing I wouldn't be getting back to sleep.  

After climbing out of bed and getting dressed, I headed downstairs to the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee. The clock on the wall displayed 4:15AM, not that time really mattered now anyway. I flicked on the record player and smiled as John Denver began to sing about a place that was almost heaven through the house speakers.  

I've been living in the house for the past few months, thriving for the most part, here at the end of the world. But the one thing I'll never get used to is the suffocating silence. Luckily for me, the solar panels on the roof allow me to keep music or movies playing all throughout the day. I try to keep myself busy most of the time, chopping firewood, taking inventory of my supplies, working out, familiarizing myself with the weapons in the basement arsenal and learning to cook better than I ever have. There is an old ham radio downstairs that I scan through occasionally, but so far there's no one out there. Sometimes I ask myself why I keep going, why keep living with no one else around. The truth is, I’ve learned to appreciate the freedom of solitude. Don't get me wrong, I'd trade all the comforts of this world just for someone to talk to, but this seems to be the hand I've been dealt. So here I am, at the apocalypse, alone, in paradise and prison.  

I had just tossed a log into the smoldering fireplace as the lights flickered out, and the music slowed to a stop. I glanced around in confusion; the power had gone out. That had only happened one other time since I had been there.  

A couple weeks after I had moved in, there came one hell of a blood storm. It rained and thundered for three days straight; lightning had struck and split a few of the trees surrounding the property, which had since provided me plenty of firewood. The power cut out a few days after it had all finally ended, I made my way to the roof to see that the solar panels had been caked with blood and were beginning to sprout the spongey red fungus that tends to grow where the rain collects. It took a solid day of scraping and scrubbing to clean the panels of the stuff. After that, I made sure to go out and clean the panels after every rain, which had only happened twice since.  

I made my way back upstairs to the bedroom balcony. I keep two rifles next to the balcony door, an M1a with a 6x scope and a suppressed model 700 with a night vision scope. The sun hadn't come up yet, so I grabbed the 700 and scanned the property. After a few minutes and no signs of any ferals, I headed back downstairs. The roof couldn't be accessed from the inside of the house, so I grabbed a flashlight and clipped my pistol holster to my belt before beading out the door to the garage.  

I hadn't had many troubles with the ferals since moving into the house but every once in a while, I could see them in the tree line. Stalking some wild animals, a rabbit, or an opossum. On one occasion, I had watched them coordinate a hunt and take down a doe and fawn; it was terrifyingly fast and brutal. I considered shooting at them, but at the time they had been staying away, I didn't want to give them a reason to notice me. 

After making my way to the garage and retrieving the ladder, I climbed to the roof and shone my light over the solar panels. At first, I saw nothing amiss. The panels were relatively clear of debris, other than a thin layer of dust, and a few fallen leaves blown up by the wind. Everything seemed to be hooked up correctly until I got to the far side of the roof, that's when I saw it. Something that even in this insane world I live in now made no sense.  

“What the hell?” I murmured as I stared down at three long scratches gouged into the panel and cutting through the main power cord that ran to the house. I knelt down to examine them closer. I splayed my fingers and placed my hand over the three scratches; they spanned wider than my hand and were easily two feet long, digging deep into the roof's shingles below the power cord. I stood and scratched my head, “What could have done this?” I wondered. I turned and looked around at the trees surrounding the house, none of them were close enough for a feral to have jumped from, also how would a feral have done this? They are basically just humans turned into animals; no, this was something else. Either way, I had to fix it. 

I sighed as I dug through the supplies in the tool shed, finding nothing. There was nothing in the garage either. You’d think the guy who built an apocalypse proof compound would have back up supplies to repair the one and only power source. I guess I have no room to talk, I wasn't prepared for anything, I just lucked into finding this place. With no other options, I was going to have to go to the hardware store in town for a new power cord and hopefully another solar panel, if I could find one.  

I hadn't left the property since I moved in, and I had to admit I was pretty reluctant to do so, but I had decided that having power was essential for survival. So, after throwing a few water bottles and some protein bars into my backpack, I headed for the armory. I used the flashlight to scan along the walls for the rifle I had chosen to be my “go outside” weapon. The vet who had built this place had an affinity for weaponry; every firearm was labeled with its proper designation, caliber, and a nickname. The one I chose was a Mk18 mod 0, chambered in 5.56 millimeter. It had a side mounted flashlight, red dot sight and a sound suppressor, the nickname printed on its label read “Mr. Sandman” I loaded the rifle and slid a few extra magazines into a pouch on my backpack, then grabbed a few extra mags for my 9mm as well and slid them into my pocket. Overkill? Maybe, but I've been out there before and these days I tend to think the boy scouts had one of the best and most applicable mottos, “Be prepared.” I climbed into my truck and cranked the engine to life. Making sure the gate was locked behind me, I headed for town. 

The long empty road was just as eerie as I remembered, only now the cars that littered the sides of the road were stained a ruddy brown and covered in fungal sprouts. The strange growths dotted the landscape; some of the fungal clumps grown as tall as small trees, despite the chill of winter. The world I had known was definitely gone, replaced by a sick, oozing hellscape. 

As I drove, I noticed an old farmhouse, just off the road. The place was completely overgrown by the blood fungus. I thought I saw movement in one of the windows, so I slowed down to get a better look. I watched in disgust as part of the fungal growth bulged out from the house window; the membranous skin stretched and split open. A geyser of red brown fluid erupted from the opening, followed by the emaciated body of a female feral as it thudded to the ground unmoving.  

Curiosity drove my movements as I pulled my truck to a stop and put it into park. I stepped out onto the dark tacky road with my rifle in hand. After scanning my surroundings, I cautiously made my way toward the farmhouse and the seemingly dead feral. With every step across the road, my boots made a sound like peeling duct tape. The closer I got to the house; I began to notice a smell. It was a subtly sweet smell, almost like honey or syrup on freshly made waffles. It smelled good, really good. “What is that wonderful smell?” I wondered as I stepped closer and closer, losing awareness of my surroundings.  

Suddenly something jarred me out of my stupor. I looked in confusion at my hand outstretched to the towering fungal growth. “What?” I asked aloud, then looked down at my feet to the thing that had jarred me out of it. I stumbled back and almost fell. The emaciated feral was still alive. She had grasped onto my ankle and was trying to bite through my boot but lacked the strength to do so. She managed to croak out a few weak grunts before collapsing back to the ground and just staring at me, eyes filled with hunger and desperation. 

As I looked down on this thing that was once a human, I began to realize that I wasn't the only one living in hell.  

“I'm sorry.” I whispered before raising my rifle and firing a single round through her head, ending her suffering.  

As the shot rang out, the sound of agitated groans, grunts, and growls came from the other side of the house. I stepped back towards my truck raising my rifle in the direction of the sounds, but when a pack of blood thirsty ferals didn't come pounding around the house, my curiosity grew. With my weapon at the ready I slowly made my way around the house and saw why I wasn't being chased down and ripped limb from limb.  

The back of the house had been completely covered in a thick layer of the fungal flesh that grew down to the ground and out like a huge toadstool. And there, partially consumed by the blood fungus, were three more ferals. The one closest to me was embedded up to its waist; its teeth snapped in my direction as its arms flailed madly. The next one had only its left arm trapped inside the fungus, I could hear bones grinding and flesh beginning to tear as it pulled and pulled, desperate to get at me. The third was nothing more than a head jutting out, shaking back and forth; its teeth gnashing. I had seen ferals sleeping on the stuff before but now I understood why. The fungus emits some kind of pheromone that draws in the ferals, and clearly me. Once the ferals bed down, the fungus begins consuming them and they don't even realize it until it's too late. I shot the trapped creatures. They may have wanted to eat me, but they didn't deserve to suffer like that. Before I left, I made a mental note to come back and burn this damn house of horrors to the ground.  

Fifteen minutes later, I pulled into the hardware store parking lot. The blood fungus I had seen down the alley next to the store had grown massive, and I could smell the enticing pheromones as soon as I stepped out of my truck. As a precaution, I took a bandana from my glove box and wrapped it around my face, blocking out most of the smell.  

I stepped into the hardware store and flicked on my rifles light and did a quick sweep through the building to make sure it was clear. The previous owner of my house had dozens of books on military tactics and survival. Between chores, watching movies, and generally feeling sorry for myself, I had been doing some useful homework.  

When I was sure the building was clear, I made my way to the electrical isle to find the right power cord. It took some searching, but I finally found three or four cords that I thought I could make work. I stuffed them all plus extras into my backpack and was about to go searching for a spare solar panel or two, when I heard a sound. It took me a moment to realize what it was, since I hadn't heard any animal sounds for a while. It was a small weak meow, and it had come from the back room, the one I hadn't checked.  

I carefully pushed open the door to the back room and scanned the area. The meow came again, and I pointed my light in the direction the sound had come from. There at the back of the room was a large garage door; the blood fungus had grown under the door and started its way across the concrete floor. There, in a basketball sized growth was a small black kitten.  

I stepped over to the small, trapped animal. Its back legs were nearly gone inside the fungus. It looked up at me weakly and gave me a small pitiful hiss. Maybe I should have shot it and put it out of its misery. But, that's not what I did. I quickly knelt and pulled my knife, cutting the fungal growth away from the kitten’s legs. When it was free, the kitten hissed and scratched and tried to get away, but it was too weak. I took off my overshirt and wrapped the kitten up in it before heading for the store exit.  

As I approached the door, I saw movement on the other side of the parking lot. I knelt down behind cover and watched as a lone feral sniffed its way across lot. I figured since it was only one, I could take the shot from here and get to my truck before any more showed up. I sat down the shirt wrapped kitten and took aim with my rifle through the cracked open door. I had placed the red dot on the things' head and was about to squeeze the trigger, when another feral crawled out from around the corner of the building, then another and another. There was a whole pack of them, a dozen or more and right there in the middle. His bald, scarred head held high, was the alpha feral.  

I grabbed the kitten and slid farther back into the shadows of the hardware store, watching the pack as it moved through the parking lot. The alpha was focused on my truck as he began to sniff the air. “Shit.” I breathed as he began to snarl and search around, sniffing here and there. Yeah, he still remembered me alright, I quickly and quietly made my way to the back of the store, hoping it would be a defendable position. 

 I peeked around the corner from my hiding place and could see the pack coming closer to the store entrance. As the alpha pushed the door open, I ducked back behind the corner of the isle. My heart was pounding in my ears as the footsteps and sniffing came closer and closer. I held my rifle tight and flicked the selector to full auto. If they got me, I'd at least take some of them with me. There were three or four of them inside, based on the sounds of movement and different grunts they were making. They were spread across different isles moving all together, leaving no space for an exit. My breaths were coming in shaky bursts; my body flooded with adrenaline. The sniffling was coming closer and they began to softly grunt to each other; one of them was no more than 10 feet away.  

“Should I attack now?” I thought. “Try to surprise them, maybe I can get one or two and the others will be scared off.” I was about to leap up and begin firing, when suddenly the others began hooting and hollering outside. The approaching ferals stopped and bolted back out of the store. When I thought it was clear, I peeked around and saw that the rest of the pack was jumping around in a panic outside. 

 A big feral held onto one of the smaller male ferals as he tried to go towards the alleyway beside the store. The alpha approached the two and forcefully separated them, holding the big one back as the dazed looking smaller feral stumbled away from the pack and out of sight. With the decision made to abandon the weak, the others watched in silence for a moment before collectively turning to leave the area. As I watched this all taking place, the kitten under my arm let out a weak meow, causing the alpha to stop and turn back to the store. I dropped back out of sight and prayed he would just leave with the rest. I watched as he stood there, watching the entrance for a few tense moments. Finally, the alpha let out an irritated grunt and turned back to leave with the others.  

I waited a few minutes after they had left before I cautiously exited the store. Turning back to look down the alley beside the store, I saw the feral. He was lying on a large cushiony growth of fungus, fast asleep. I almost shot him but decided against it. Contrary to what you see in movies and video games, suppressors aren't actually silent; they only dull the sound to a manageable level. I didn't know how far away the pack was, and I did not want to attract their attention and have them following me back to the house. 

When the kitten and I had finally made it back home, the clouds had turned a deep maroon, the way they do before a blood storm. I brought the kitten in and gave it some canned tuna and fresh water. It still hissed anytime I came near but at least it was safe and I wasn't completely alone. I gave it a pillow and left it in one of the spare rooms for now. I think it will be alright in time, but its shriveled back legs will probably never work again. Thunder boomed outside as the first crimson drops began to tap against the window.
