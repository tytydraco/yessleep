After debating with myself whether I wanted to share this here or not, I decided it was worth it if only to get the word out. What follows is some advice I want to share based on a personal experience I had over 20 years ago. Take it or don't. But if I save even one person from trouble or hardship, it was worth it. I'm going to be kinda vague (I sort of explain why below) but anyone in this situation is gonna know exactly what I'm talking about.

Anyway, here goes:

You can sketch. You can draw. But don't scribble. Don't doodle. If you find yourself making the same shape over and over, and one day you find your signature is (somehow) even starting to look like that, stop. Only pick up a pen or pencil to write until it's over. 

Don't make open ended bargains or wishes or deals or sort of plead into the night. Don't repeat those wishes to yourself, even in your head. Definitely do NOT say them out loud when (you think) you're alone. If you feel like you've gotten a response, or a confirmation, maybe you have. But you're not going to like it. There's always a cost.

If anyone hands you a manuscript or notes or a book and says it's from a secret society throw it away without looking at it. Get it out of your house. Even if the person is a trusted friend or family member. This might seem silly and you might be embarrassed and they might even get upset with you. That's better than the alternative.

Names have power. They are also double edged swords. There are some things you can't forget. You know the whole thing about "don't think about a pink elephant"? Yeah. 

Related: you're gonna want to look up more about this, try and figure it out, do your research. Resist that impulse. It's not gonna help you get out from under it. 

If you experience something weird, maybe you're having a break with reality. If someone else experiences something weird with you, maybe it's infrasound or carbon monoxide or a gas leak. If you and someone else experience something weird in multiple locations across several days or weeks, it's real. I'm sorry. 

It's good to be confident and believe in yourself because you're going to need that. But also remember that pride and arrogance can get you into trouble and you can't do this on your own. I'm not saying it right, but sort of...believe in your ability to get out of the situation but don't think of yourself as all powerful or all capable.

You'd think being outside in the daytime or in public places would help. It doesn't. Hallowed ground helps. 

Speaking of, gonna rustle a lot of jimmies with this one (idk if people even still say that) but it has to be said: find a sincere church that's more about love and kindness instead of White Republican Jesus and go there. Maybe a mosque or synagogue would work too. Idk because I didn't try that. I can't just say "if you believe sincerely enough in something to help you it will" because I tried the magic and self will thing and it did not work. 

I don't think they can hurt you. Physically hurt you. Or at least not a lot. I think it's all based around fear. They can affect your physical surroundings though, and they CAN touch you. 

Once you've had an encounter, it's going to be with you the rest of your life. And because of that, sometimes even remembering it is going to be like...an invitation for it to come back. Try not to focus or perseverate on your experience. Names have power, like I said above, and there's a quote that says something like, a person is what they thing about all day long. Don't let it be them. 

This is gonna sound like it contradicts the above, but: you are also going to doubt yourself. Doubt that it ever happened. You'll wonder if it was a dream, or you're misremembering it, or you made it out to be more than it was. Basically you're going to gaslight yourself. This is incredibly normal. You went through something traumatic that probably ran counter to how you thought the world worked. This is your brain's way of trying to protect you. 

When you do get to the other side of this, and I really hope you do, you're gonna have some PTSD. There are going to be seemingly innocuous things that trigger you. For me it was things like bees buzzing, lights flickering, and waking up at weird hours at night.

It's not gonna help that if you do try to tell someone in your real life about this, they're going to assume you're crazy or were on drugs. Even people you love and trust. Try not to blame them. Odds are if they were telling you about this instead of the other way around, you'd do the same. 

Definitely reach out for professional help. Don't be embarrassed or scared. You're not going to get committed. If the experience you had is firmly in the past, you're not going to "pass" any of their diagnostics for things like schizophrenia.  A good therapist is going to go with something like "whether I think this is real or not, it's clearly real for you, so let's talk about that" This is not them gaslighting you. They are framing the experience and helping you to frame the experience in a way that's conducive to processing it. 

If one day you have kids, watch them for all these things. This stuff likes to stay with a family. And every new generation is a new chance. All the stuff little kids say that most parents can blissfully ignore (there's something in my room, I have a new imaginary friend, refusing to talk about something they drew) you don't get to. But if you yourself closed the door hard enough then your kids will hopefully be fine.

Related, you might find yourself looking back to your own childhood and finding some things you didn't recognize at the time. Some experiences may become recontextualized for you. It's gonna be okay. You're still you, you're not who they made you be. 

Okay, that's all I've got. If you think you're in trouble you can DM me. I'm not gonna be more specific in messages though. And I'm gonna know right away if you're sincere or not. People are really creative but it's not the kind of thing you can fake.
