I stood in that dark corridor among the ashes of my innocence for what could have been hours. The compound was devoid of any organic sounds—no footsteps or scuffling or anything that might be another living being on approach. All that returned to my own gentle breathing was the breath from iron lungs and windpipes billowing out from grated mouths on the wall. The shallow gasp of a dying manifold.

I still had no idea what had happened as I looked down at what was once June. I couldn’t say why she had suddenly turned to ash in my arms. She hadn’t been dying—at least, I didn’t think so. Maybe I was just in such poor shape that she’d looked fine in comparison.

Had Il-Belliegħa done something to her in its chase? Poisoned her in some way that only took her life once we were finally safe behind these compound walls? Was being too close to the creature and its shifting aura somehow a time machine that had returned her to the dust the roots had plucked her from?

That couldn’t be the case, I noted. Hensley 5 hadn’t ever been near it; she’d only faded once I’d killed her.

It had to be something else. Something within those tender moments that I shared with each of them before they faded into light, and I drew them back in.

I think I had already pieced it together in that moment, but I didn’t have time to dwell. My assumption a moment ago about this place might be wrong, and maybe it wasn’t safe like I thought.

I was close. So close.

The key was in my pocket, and the drill was near.

The issue was, so was Ann. There was the threat that Il-Belliegħa was still going to climb back up the cliffs, yes, and I truly had no idea if it could actually get through these doors or not. Right now, though, he was a threat that was on hold. I had to get through my clone. My worst half who was determined to keep me here.

There was no way that she hadn’t heard the door grind loudly open, and even if she hadn’t, I felt watched. The dark shell of a camera on the ceiling glinted in what little light bled in from around the corridors to either side of me. She had to have some idea that I was here.

Still, with how long I was standing in place, she didn’t show. Maybe that was because she didn’t know what to do, or maybe it was because she’d rather get the drop on me, but there was also a small chance that I was wrong. This place looked big, and maybe she wasn’t near the camera monitors. There was a chance she hadn’t heard or seen me yet.

If that was true, I could use it.

I was currently down an arm and a leg, which meant a physical fight was out the window. Even sharing my frail physique, Ann could pummel me like a professional MMA fighter in my present condition. It also meant I had no chance at stealth. I couldn’t take precise, silent steps down the hall when I was going to have to shuffle, practically hopping on one leg. That meant I needed to be smart about this. Play to any strengths I had going for me.

There wasn’t a lot. All I had was the key as leverage, and the moment Ann knew I had it, she’d just take it by force. It was going to come down to a verbal encounter—I knew it was unavoidable—but I had no idea where to go with it.

Ann hated me, and while I sensed hesitation in her actions, anytime her and I spoke, it always would amp up, no matter how patient I tried to be. She held too much resentment. Too much hatred for the pain she blamed me for. I suppose I wasn’t completely innocent in that regard either.

I needed a new angle; a way to talk to her and glean the situation without her immediately tying me up and throwing me in a closet. I needed to look as harmless and weak as I could.

I needed to look innocent…

My head snapped downward at the thought, an idea quickly brewing. I looked harmless enough with my shattered limbs, but there was a way that I could make myself even less of a threat to Ann in a way that she would never expect a sudden backlash toward her.

June was always too afraid of confrontation with her, and June and I also happened to share a face.

Air grated past my teeth with grunts sprinkled in as I lowered myself on one leg, reaching to scoop up June’s clothes. Once I had them, I stood, then shuffled over to the wall in the shadows, right beneath the camera. I had no idea if this would work, but it was the only plan I had at the moment. If I could feign as June long enough to gather information from Ann, find Hope, then come up with a better plan to flip the script, I may stand a chance at still pulling this off.

‘June, if you’re in here with me now,’ I called out into my own head, ‘I *really* need you to help with the talking here.’

Ironically, of everything I’d done since I arrived here, nothing came close in difficulty to simply changing my clothes. I pulled the drill key from my pocket and slipped the rubbery keychain between my teeth, clamping down hard as I undid my arm sling. The limb screamed and bit at my nerves as its shattered innards scraped against themselves, but I just breathed deeper and forced myself to keep going.

With how much my body was trembling, I almost crashed to the concrete several times, so instead, I just fell to my ass and continued there. My jacket was the loosest object on me, so it came of relatively easily, but my shirt that was matted to me with sweat and blood? It was agony. If you want to know what it was like, try it yourself. Sit on the floor with your left leg and right arm completely limp, then try to undress. Anytime those limbs move accidentally or brush against the floor, imagine somebody running them over with a car or scraping a cheese grater along your muscles.

It sounds overly grotesque, but I promise it doesn’t even come close to the true feeling. There’s a reason hospitals cut clothes off when they need to operate on a damaged limb.

And all of that was just getting them off. Slipping into June’s clothes was a nightmare, and I was so thankful that the spares we had found her were somewhat loose and baggy. Trying to guide my crunching leg into the pant sleeve was nauseating, and tugging her shirt far enough out to snap over my dangling arm was like pulling a tension band. By the time I was fitted in June's outfit, and my own was nothing but a pile on the floor, I was dripping with sweat, tears, and snot; a mess more tired than when I’d begun.

I prayed that it was all going to be worth the effort.

With limbs like Jell-O, I grasped the wall and wobbled to my feet, pulling the key from my mouth and tearing the chain loose. On my broken leg, June had an extra pocket on her calf, so I reached over and slipped the key inside. It was too chunky to fit in my boot, or hide in my mouth. If Ann patted me down, hopefully the mushy limb would be enough of a deterrent.

Before I left the area, I took one last look at the pile of black sand, then at my dead man’s jacket on the ground that I’d worn since the first day I’d arrived. The one that a monster so graciously gifted me with from its previous victim. I hoped that there was some sort of symbolism in me leaving it behind.

The Kingfisher compound was not what I had been expecting.

The entrance that I’d just left behind gave the impression that it was going to be the kind of dark bunker you’d find in horror films and ghost stories. A decrepit, cold concrete compound with steaming pipes and leaking ceilings. The indifferent, metallic body chute outside gave the illusion of rusty industrial guts hungry for twisted progress and blood sacrifice.

The area by the door must have been that way for efficiency’s sake, however. Once I rounded the corner into a lot where several work trucks were parked, I passed through a set of double glass doors into a lobby.

It was clean. It was welcoming. Modern green couches and chairs were peppered invitingly about the space, and cozy burgundy rugs helped zone areas off among the sprawl of sleek black granite. The walls were still concrete, but it was polished and washed with grand paintings to fill the massive surfaces. An urban chandelier dangled over the whole space, but with the lights off, it seemed more like a looming presence than a welcoming sun. The only glow in the area were some accent LED lights like the ones in the rig control rooms, so I moved toward them where the front desk was.

As I drew near, I immediately got concerned about the validity of what Ann had told us through the speaker. That Il-Belliegħa hadn’t yet made in inside this place. Unlike the rest of the lobby, behind the desk was a disaster. Everything from its surface was violently thrown onto the floor, and every drawer and cupboard was yanked open, their guts also splayed across the tile for all to see.

Despite the gore against he office supplies, however, there was none from an actual person. No scratch marks on the counter or smashed in furniture. This looked more like a human had come through in a whirlwind looking for something, or gathering up valuables. Whether this was from Ann searching for the key that I was currently holding, or from the people who’d left it in a hurry, I had no idea.

Speaking of the latter, behind the desk and lit by the LEDs, a large, ornate crest cut from steel and wood was hung on the wall, the signature logo of the bird this organization was named after standing proudly within. On the top in small letters, it read ‘*Praesentia Ad Perfectum’* and beneath where the bird perched, ‘*Kingfisher’.*

A portrait beneath it of what I could only assume to be the entire team that once inhabited this place hung, displaying smiling faces of several with some stern professional ones speckled in. It made my throat tight to see how many there were. I wondered how many of the poor, young, naïve faces in the image had been in here and made it out alive, and how many others were the hanging flesh suits that I’d just seen moments ago.

I suppose it didn’t matter now. Either way you sliced it, they were gone, and my empathy was better spent elsewhere than the people who dragged me into this hell with their hubris. Turning toward the nearest corridor, I continued.

The halls were also dark as I crept down them, save for a few dull safety bulbs aglow every couple of light panels. It draped the whole facility in an eerie life, almost like a sort of limbo. A place that I knew would never see use again, but still somehow managing to live with what life support it had been hooked up to.

I hoped that the gate that brought me here would shut down with it when it finally died. I wondered if Ann had already figured out a way to stop it so that no other unfortunate souls like us got flashed here…

The deeper I went into the facility, the more I started wondering where she was. It was no wonder she hadn’t heard me from the front; there was still no sound, and the place was so staggeringly big that I had no idea where I was going. I found a map on the wall at one point that pointed me to the main control room, so I figured I’d start there.

I felt no real fear as I moved; Ann had been right. It seemed nothing had been able to make its way in here. The monsters and everything else must have been deterred by the door and its barriers, and I suppose that Il-Belliegħa must have been too. After all, my car proved that physical objects still posed a threat to him. Plus, even if he could shift past the door, the only other instance he could run to of this place was probably one where it never existed, meaning that a giant slab of solid rock would be the only thing on the other side.

Still, that safety net didn’t stop me from jumping when I heard a loud bang crashing down the corridor ahead. There was a door open to my left that had light spilling from it; a full bulb glowed, like someone was inside. There was another bang a few seconds later, than another until I heard it topped off with my own cries of anger.

“Damn it!”

Ann’s voice immediately set me on edge, knowing that confrontation was now imminent. I didn’t beat around the bush. I shuffled onward slowly, running through every scenario in my head of what might be waiting for me.

When I finally reached the door and peered in, I found that the room was some sort of living space, one of what I assumed to be many studio apartments crammed down here for the tenants. The room’s original style was lost now, though, because like the front desk, it was torn apart.

In the middle of the room, Ann sat on her knees surrounded by every book, paper, and drawer that had once belonged to a shelf. I even saw a kitchen drawer with silverware in it nearby. I knew exactly what she was doing; she was looking for the key.

It made anger boil up inside me as I watched her, knowing that this was what she had been doing the whole time instead of letting us in. She had been willing to risk our lives to Il-Belliegħa if we hadn’t found the code. Hell, she wasn’t even near the cameras to monitor if we were safe outside or not.

I wanted to scream at her. I wanted to immediately rush her and strike her down while I was unnoticed. Apparently my stealth hadn’t been an issue, because Ann was so caught up in her work and was already making so much noise that she didn’t even notice my approach. It would be so easy to shuffle toward her and throw myself on top. Grab a fork or butter knife from the silverware drawer and pin one into her.

The mental image of that sobered me up, however. Images of what I had done to Hen 5 replayed in my head; that desperate fear in her eyes as she tried to breathe past the irreversible wound in her throat. It sent a chill through me that I even considered I could do such a thing again. Something June had told me after echoed in my head, and I swallowed hard.

*‘That clone was one of us, and you didn’t even consider trying to talk to her.’*

Along with that came the other half of June’s words. The thing she’d told me just before Il-Belliegħa had shown up. The request she’d had regarding Ann. I wasn’t ready for that truth yet, however. I was still too angry and hurt. Too stubborn and tired.

Instead, I focused on the now. I focused on my original plan.

Closing my eyes while Ann continued rummaging through boxes, I attempted to dig deep into my innocence. To find the spot that June had spirited off to deep within me. Truth was, I was pretty nervous and scared anyway, so it wasn’t too hard. Most of all, I was still grieving, which made it the easiest.

I found my hands moving to the sides of June's hoodie where my fingers pinched the fabric and began rubbing, just like when I was a young girl. I nearly teared up when I felt how worn and tattered the fabric already was, a thin layer of grime there from June’s scuffed up hands always dwelling here. I wished she was still with me for this part. It would have made it easier.

“Ann?” I called out in my most solemn voice.

My clone snapped around fast, then leapt to her feet with wild eyes, looking like she’d seen a ghost. Frantically, she scrambled for something next to her and whipped it up, pointing it at me. A gun; or, at least some-what one. Most guns aren’t bright orange.

It was a flare gun.

I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t know much about weapons, but I know that a gun capable of shooting a flaming rocket several hundred feet into the air would certainly be able to punch through my skin at how close she was. Even if it wasn’t, the ball of flaming chemical reaction would easily be able to lick flames onto my loose, baggy clothing. I didn’t trust my ability to stop, drop and roll properly with a broken arm and leg.

The point was, I knew better than to try Ann. With the way she was looking at me, there was a moment that I was scared she might pull the trigger anyway. Thankfully, once I put my hands up fast and feigned a frightened look like June would, she eased up.

“J-June?” she stammered, “is that really you?”

I nodded frantically.

She shook her head as her emotions began to amp alongside her preexisting frustration, “How? How did you get in here? Where did you find the code?”

This idea was going to be harder than I thought, because I immediately wanted to snip back verbally. Flip her shit for acting like I wasn’t allowed to pull the same tricks she had. I didn’t want to give the satisfaction of a real answer—she didn’t deserve it—but the issue was, I was June right now, not Hensley.

“W-We found it in an email on another computer,” I told her, “Hensley figured it out.”

Ann adjusted her grip on the gun, then flicked her eyes to the door, “Hensley? Are you out there too?”

I quickly shook my head, “She’s not here. It’s just me now.”

Ann gave a skeptical look, then told me to back up into the hall. I obeyed, till my heels were to the wall of the opposite side of the corridor, at which point Ann stepped out and looked both ways, checking my claim. She still appeared to have doubts, but her gaze at least turned back to mine.

“What happened to her? Where is she?”

She asked this with *almost* genuine concern. Like she was worried for me. I found it ironic, but knew that if there was ever a time to spite her while playing this role, it was now, especially if she was already worried about what she’d done.

I tried to make myself cry, which, honestly wasn’t hard. I was already tearing up as I felt the frayed sides of my jacket, and all I needed to do was focus it more. I hadn’t even had time to grieve June, so I just let it out right before Ann.

“She… didn’t make it… we found the code to get in, but then… Il-Belliegħa—it showed up, and it… it…”

I lay it on thick, tapering off like the sentence was just too much to bear. Maybe it was cruel. Maybe it was a bad idea to pick at Ann’s mental state any further while she was already an unstable person, but deep down, part of me needed to know.

Ann had wanted me dead so badly, and she was willing to cast me aside to steal my old life. She’d been feigning all this time, like she’d actually gave a shit about us enough to let us stay alive in this stupid compound, so now, I wanted to see. Was everything she said true? Or was it all just another manipulative game to her?

My money was going to be on the latter, but as I watched her face morph, I was quickly proven wrong.

Our pale face went even paler, and the distance between our eyes became miles. Ann’s mouth fell open, and air came hard to her, the plastic of the flare gun beginning to rattle as her hand trembled.

“N-No, you’re lying,” She said, stepping forward and sticking the gun further out, “You’re lying June—this is part of your plan to stop me, isn’t it? Where is she?!”

I did my best to cower against the wall, but my broken leg brought me to the floor, adding to my performance. I put my hands up to shield my face, then pretended to weep louder, “I-I’m not lying, Ann! I swear! I-I’m sorry—I tried to save her, but she ran off and—and—”

I crumbled my words off to hyperventilation, and that really forced Ann’s denial away. She stumbled back all the way across the corridor to her side, then when the wall met her shoulders, she was jostled to the floor with me, sliding down and finally taking the flare gun off me to place her hands to her head. Her wild eyes remained staring vacantly forward as she wrestled with what she had done.

“I…I didn’t mean… I didn’t mean for that to happen. I thought I had more time.”

God, I wanted to spit at her for that. Stand up and scream at how dense she was. I got so caught up in my own lie that I couldn’t help but feel that phantom fury. She didn’t mean for that to happen? What the hell did she expect? I had warned her what was coming, and she didn’t listen. She had no idea how long it was going to take her to find what she was looking for—which would have been never—and she was willing to keep us outside the entire time, then she had the audacity to feel bad when it blew up in her face? I couldn’t believe how stupid a version of myself could be.

And I couldn’t help but let my mask slip slightly, “She warned you it was coming, Ann…” I sniffled, a hint of bitterness to my tone.

Ann was too shocked to notice. Her eyes only danced to mine with tears for a moment before she shook her head, “I… I didn’t mean for it to get any of you, June—I never wanted that—you have to believe me.”

I said nothing. I wasn’t about to validate her.

The cold air creeping toward her forced her gaze back to the floor, and she hugged her knees. I let her sit like that for a while before I tried to get up, my leg and arm preventing me from doing so. Ann’s focus snapped back on me to remain vigilant, but when she saw my sorry attempts to sit up, she finally noticed how decrepit I was.

“Are you okay?” she sniffled.

I nearly laughed at the stupidity of that question, but held it in, thinking of what June would say, “I-I’m fine—just got banged up is all. I think I broke my arm and leg…”

I saw another splash of guilt crash onto Ann’s face as remorse gnawed at her insides. She leaned her head back against the wall and looked up at the ceiling, letting out a pained sigh as tears continued to flow.

I don’t know why, but of everything so far, that was what did it for me. That was the action that got me to feel my first flicker of empathy.

I had felt myself do the exact same thing so many times in my life, after a fight with Trevor or the morning after getting drunk and doing something stupid. It was the sigh of shame. The clarifying breath that helped me sort out just how much of a piece of shit I was.

That empathy was further compounded by what happened next. Ann stood and crossed the hall to where I sat, taking the gun off me to offer her hand. I looked up with bewilderment, and she extended further.

“Come on. Just don’t try anything,” she said, her once proud voice hollow and defeated.

I obeyed and was surprised by how gentle she was with me as she guided me back up. Once I was standing and holding onto the wall, she analyzed me once over to truly appraise the damage. I must have looked like a mangled doll, because her expression was not one of good news.

I could tell that she wanted to ask what happened to me to put me in such a ragged state, but she thought better. It was a question she’d only feel more guilt over, and that would only inspire more bitterness in me. Instead, she pointed to my arm.

“We should get that in a sling. It’s not good for it to be hanging loose like that.”

“I had one, but I lost it while I was running away.”

Ann nodded, then took another deep breath. “Come in here. Take a seat on the bed.”

She didn’t trust me enough yet to help me walk, but she patiently waited while I made it back into the room and did what she asked. Moving to a closet, she pulled out a small throw blanket and then cautiously crawled onto the bed behind me, leaving the gun on the far nightstand. She moved in close, ready to get to work, but hesitated.

“Like I said, don’t try anything, June.”

“I won’t,” I weakly returned.

I winced and grunted as Ann aided me in lifting my arm, then began stringing up a sling. Once that initial pain was over, it wasn’t so bad. Just awkward silence as she did her best to tie it up secure behind my neck.

She had to brush my hair away in order to do so, and as she ran her fingers through my locks, I felt a tingle rush over my scalp, followed by a forlorn memory playing like grainy film across the back of my eyes.

Mom and I sitting on the edge of the bed like this while I brushed her hair or she brushed mine. There was a lot less pain then, and neither of us were trying to mend a wound, but then again, maybe in those days, the wounds that needed mending weren’t physical.

I sat in silence while Ann worked, looking around at the mess she’d created when a question finally burned to the end of my tongue.

“Where’s Hope, Ann?”

There was a noticeable pause in her answer, as if she was ashamed to tell me one of her further failures. Finally, she muttered out, “She’s fine. I have her in a wing of the compound next to the control room. Another hall of living quarters.”

“She’s locked up?”

Ann didn’t respond. Just let her silence do the talking.

“Is she still sick?” I urged, “How are you taking care of her if she’s—”

“She’s not sick, June,” Ann quickly snapped, making me shut up fast. She finished cinching the sling, then slipped off the bed, grabbing her gun once more and leaning on the nightstand. “She’s not sick… She’s up and moving now.”

Something was wrong with the way she worded that; something that I think she hoped I wouldn’t pick up on.

“What does that mean?” I questioned.

Ann’s finger nervously traced a groove around the flare's trigger guard while she stared starkly at the floor, “That stuff that got on her… it changed her. She’s fine, but she’s been acting differently. I don’t see her much anymore except to bring her food.”

Another bout of frustration flared up in me, but again, I held it in. It wasn’t something June would do.

“Hensley and I found the other clone she dropped from the ladder,” I told her, “She’d grown inside of a monster and was covered in that goop too. When we found her, she was feral and crazy… Is Hope, um… did she also…?”

Ann’s eyes flicked up to me in horror, but then quickly darted away once more in shame. She pursed her lips, trying to think of how to answer before she finally stood, “Come on. Let’s go see her.”

My heart skipped a beat, but I obeyed, especially when I found the gun pointed at my back. I looked at Ann in disbelief, having thought we’d reached a point of understanding, but clearly the guilt from ‘Hensley’ dying only earned me so much good will.

I stood and began to shuffle down the hallway, using the wall as my guide while Ann kept the flare gun pressed to my spine. I moved as slowly as I could without angering her; the dread mounting in my stomach the closer we drew to where Ann said Hope was being held.

I didn’t want to see her.

All this time, I’d been worrying about Hope and fighting so hard just to reunite with my better half, but now that I had achieved that goal and was on my way to see her, I was only dreading it. What was she now? A beast like Hensley 5? A shell of what she once was? Or maybe she was still exactly how I knew her, only decaying and rotting away; a sight of her that I didn’t wish to see.

Whatever the case, I sucked it up and continued onward. Rain or shine, I needed to get to her, and I needed to see for myself if there was really no way of fixing what was broken like Ann had said.

On our way to the wing, we passed the control room. It was at the end of a main corridor leading back to the lobby and had two double doors wide enough to fit a jeep through. They were open, the lights on within, and I could see that it too had been thrashed by Ann’s pursuit for the key.

Its interior was the same as the rigs; concrete boxes with trimmed lighting and retro-futuristic tech lining the walls and various stations. Far in the back of the massive room, against a wall, there was a raised platform with more industrial terminals, and beyond that, massive spires of sleek brass and steel, strange lights and coils running along their curved lengths as they vanished into the ceiling.

I didn’t need to guess what the machine was.

It was our ticket out of here.

My heart beat fast from both the revelation of how close I was, and that I was nearing Hope’s prison cell. What was the next part of my plan? I hadn’t even thought this far ahead. Sure, I’d successfully fooled Ann, but what now? I had the key that she needed, she wanted to leave without us, and I was most likely about to be locked up beside Hope. On top of that, the half of me that I was about to see again might be a monster, and though I’d desperately wanted to bring her back home with me, there was no way I could do that so long as she was a feral beast.

I needed time to think—to assess the rest of the situation before I made a hasty move. Maybe there was still a way out of this mess where Hope and I lived.

‘And Ann?’ I heard a small voice nag at the back of my mind.

I pushed it away for now.

We stopped at the blast door blocking the rest of the hallway ahead, and Ann reached into her coat pocket, pulling out a blue keycard like the one used to get into the rigs. Before tapping it to a reader on the wall next to us, she moved into view then looked me in the eyes.

“She thinks she’s in here for her own safety. I told her that I would keep her safe while she heals and look for a way out.”

I was very confused why she was telling me this, or why she would lie to her at all, but as Ann’s eyes bored into me, the realization hit, “She… She doesn’t know what really happened back at the hospital, does she? That you left Hensley and I?”

Ann once again let her silence speak for her before continuing the thought, “She's gotten a lot more… temperamental. Things that confuse her make her angry and upset. You’ll be okay so long as you don’t rock the boat.”

That struck a bit of panic into me, “Wait, you’re going to lock me in there with her *alone*?”

Ann kept her eyes steady and calculated, “You’ll be fine, June. Like I said, don’t rock the boat.”

“What does that mean?” I pleaded, “Would you just tell me what’s wrong with her?”

For a moment, I could see a skeptical glance spread across Ann’s face. A small suspicion at my sudden outburst. June would get scared and panicked, but she didn’t lash out, she shrunk away. I reeled in my performance a little and tried to look more scared.

“Ann, is she going to hurt me?”

“No. She shouldn’t. Just play along, with the story I gave her, and she’ll stay happy.”

I shook my head, “What do you expect me to do if you get the drill running and leave? You’re going to trap me here with her forever?”

Another look of guilt spread across her face, but she visibly choked it back down, “I need to think, June. The circumstances have changed now, and I need to come up with a new plan. Just stay here for a few hours. I’ll come check on you soon.”

I wanted to protest. I wanted to scream at her and finally break. I wanted to wrestle the stupid gun from her hand and take control of this flaming car that she was about to drive off a cliff. I didn’t though. I held my ground, knowing that flying off the handle rarely ever did any favors for me.

There was still a way out of this, I just needed to find it.

Ann tapped the card to the pad, and the metal began to groan and creak open.

The blast door raised to the sound of metallic gears clunking, and as they did so, they revealed the dark wing beyond. There were no safety lights in the rest of the hallway, only a dark hall of doors with a circular lounge at the end. The lounge was the only source of light; a fluorescent chandelier hanging above and casting its glow partially down the corridor. All of that barely held my attention when I saw the figure standing in the middle of the hall only 40 feet away.

It was only her silhouette backlit by the light from the lounge. Her murky reflection stood equal to her in the black tile beneath as she stood with her head cocked, looking straight at us. Her limbs were longer than usual, putting her a whole foot or so above Ann and I, and her joints looked slightly crooked. She had an almost feral hunch to her that I had seen in Hen 5, yet despite this, her posture seemed more controlled. More intentional. She was a half-breed between known and unknown, and as she spoke, her voice betrayed the same quality.

“Ann? Is that you?” she called in a cheery tone that groaned and ached with an underlying growl.

I could hear the nerves in my clone's voice as she called back, “It’s me, Hope, don’t worry.”

Hope moved forward, her legs moving so awkward that occasionally, she had to stretch a long arm down like a walking cane, “Y-You just came with f-food,” her voice stuttered, “Who is that with you?”

Ann flinched a bit at her steps closer, and she quickly spoke to halt her, “I-It’s good news, Hope. June turned up. I found her pounding at the door and let her in.”

Hope perked up like an excited dog, and tilted her head, “June?”

I struggled to speak, my heart thumping blocking my throat, “H-Hey, Hope. I’m glad to see you’re okay!”

“June!” Hope cried again, beginning to skitter closer. Ann quickly put a stop to this by calling out.

“Whoa, hey! Hang on, Hope, you can’t come out here, remember? It’s too dangerous.”

I could feel the tension of the air shift drastically. Hope’s hunch became more prominent, and one of her hands found a permanent home pressed against the floor. “I-I’ll be okay, Ann, I’m feeling *so* much b-better. Can’t I please come out?”

“N-No, I’m sorry, Hope,” Ann told her with a quiver in her voice, “You need to stay in here. Its not just the sickness; it’s a lot of things.”

There was a growl that came rumbling down the hall from Hope’s throat, and my hair stood on end as Ann took a subtle step back. I was quickly realizing what she was warning me about with not rocking the boat.

“June is right there, though. *She* was just outside. If it’s so dangerous, why is *she* out there?”

Ann quickly looked to me with desperation, and though I had no desire to play her stupid game, I also didn’t want to get us both screwed over by whatever happened when this new Hope got mad, so I stammered something out quickly.

“I-It is dangerous, she’s right, Hope. I-I barely survived getting here. I don’t want you to get hurt either.”

That thankfully seemed to ease my twisted clone's nerves, and she raised back up to let her hand only hover over the floor. I felt a bit of pressure release until Ann spoke again next to me.

“Don’t worry, though. You’re not going to be alone anymore. June is hurt too, so she’s going to stay safe in here with you, isn’t that nice?”

Hope perked up even more, standing fully upright and staring me down. Her eyes sent a chill up my spine as they glinted like an animal in what little luminance they caught around her shadowy face.

“June, I missed you so much! I’m s-so glad you’re safe. Where is H-Hensley? Is she here too?”

My throat grew tight once again, but before I could say anything, Ann shoved me with the barrel of her gun before quickly tucking it behind her back, “She can explain everything to you in a bit, Hope, but I need to get back to looking for a way out, okay? I’m getting close.”

“Ok-kay, Ann. P-Please be safe o-out there.”

Ann didn’t respond. I looked her dead in the eye over my shoulder, trying my hardest to not shoot her the death glare she’d normally get from me, then held that look the entire time the door slowly lowered between us.

It was so loud that by the time the clunk came to a stop, I barely heard Hope’s bare feet and hands clambering toward me. I turned back and nearly screamed to see her sprinting my direction, then actually followed through when she slammed into my chest. My broken arm was crunched violently against my torso, and I probably would have been knocked off my shattered leg if not for Hope scooping me up into her lanky—much stronger than normal—arms.

“June! June, I was so w-worried for you when I woke up! Ann t-told me you and Hensley didn’t make it out of the hosp-pital. That we were the only ones left!”

I squirmed and gasped in her grasp, unable to breathe or speak from the pain keeping my chest locked. Finally, she shifted me in such a way that I could squeak out a small “Hope!”

Her twisted mind barely registered the pain in my cry, but once she did, she finally let up, dropping me back to the floor. I stumbled to my knee, then quickly looked at my arm, checking to see through the wild agony if it’d somehow been made worse for wear.

Hope noticed this and quickly let out a gasp, “Oh my goodn-ness! I’m s-so sorry! I forgot you were hurt! Here, let me help!”

Before I could react, she shot a limb out and grabbed my slung arm at the joint in the elbow, wrenching it up and making me finally let out an unfiltered cry. It jarred her back before the pain boiled up in anger, and I shouted, “Hope, stop!”

She backed away like a kicked dog, and for a moment when I looked up, that’s what I saw. In the shadows, it was still Hope. Sweet, happy hope that wore my own face better than I ever did. But as her shock from my wails wore off, it began to twist.

Her jaw clenched, and her eyes seemed to sink deep into her dark sockets, her pupils dilating into pinpricks too small for any human to manage. She bared her teeth at me like a feral dog, and I saw that her gums had receded, making her teeth look long and skeletal, stained yellow from all our time being here. The gash on her face that had lapped up the ichor that cursed her into this beast to begin with was flayed and bloated, black infection lines tangling out across her forehead and cheeks.

In under a second, she’d gone from Hope to monster.

“I was only trying to help you,” She growled, making my heart thump fast.

I fell back away from her, afraid of what was about to happen next, and it seemed justified. Hope began lumbering forward on all fours, but just before she got to me, one of her arms buckled beneath her, and she crashed to the floor, coughing and hacking up a dense fluid from the back of her throat.

She spat it out harshly onto the tile between us, a thick sludge of blood and blackness, and when she managed to scrape her tangled head of knotted red locks off the floor and look into my eyes again, her face had returned to normal. More normal than even before her switch.

It was clarity behind her eyes. Desperation and pain. A Hope I’d known long ago.

I forced myself back up as she panted heavily, then scooted a little closer.

“Hope?” I asked.

She swallowed hard then spoke, “Something is wrong, June… I feel so weird; my head… there’s something in it, b-but it's not me…”

Her words turned my stomach sour, and though I was rightfully frightened of her now, I forced a few inches closer, reaching out and taking her hand, “It’s okay, Hope… I’m going to fix this. We’re still going to get out of here.”

In her clarity, she looked me in the eye, and for a moment, I swear she saw through me. Saw something behind my own that told her who I really was. Which person she was truly talking to. She squeezed my hand, and a tear ran from her eye.

It lasted only a moment before her eyes fogged over again, a smirk returned to her thin, cracked lips, and she scraped herself up.

“It’s so nice in here, June! I can’t b-believe this place exists in the abyss like this! C’mon l-let me show you around!”

With my hand still viced in hers, no way of escape, Hope dragged me to my foot, and then off into the dark hallway.

I tossed one last look back at the door as I went, eyeing the keypad. There may have been no way of escape from Hope at the moment, but should I solve this mess first, Ann was in for a rude awakening.

One of the perks of her thinking I was June was that Hensley had the original master keycard.

Ann hadn’t bothered to pat me down for that key either.
