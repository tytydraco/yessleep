"John?"

I put down my newspaper and looked up at the smiling woman in front of me. She had a distinct familiarity to her, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

Clearly noticing my lack of recognition, she clarified, "I'm Angela."

"Angela, of course!" I stood up and extended a hand. My phone dropped, almost causing the coffee to spill all over the table. "I just always see you in uniform. What brings you out here?"

She laughed and shook my hand. "Just because I don't have a coffee spilling accident every morning doesn't mean I don't have a cup every once in a while." She paused at me rolling my eyes, and cocked her head for a moment. "Do you wear contacts?"

I shook my head. "Even my dad still doesn't need a prescription. I got 20/15, last I checked." Now it was her turn to roll her eyes.

She took off her own glasses which were silver featuring surprisingly thick lenses. "I got these a couple days ago, and they're...odd. I want your opinion on them. Is that okay?"

I accepted the glasses. "Of course!" I love trying on other people's pairs of glasses, and telling them just how bad their vision is by how well I could see through them.

Putting them on, I was amazed at how good they felt to put on. No headache, and perfect vision even with the thick lenses. "Damn, these are good!" I exclaimed, perhaps a bit too loudly. "Seems like you don't need glasses that much either!" I took them off and extended it back to her.

She ignored the glasses and put on a pair that was in her purse. "Thanks for telling me that, but I'm actually legally blind." She turned away.

"Wait!"

Somewhat exasperated, she turned around.

"What do you want me to do with these?" I gestured at the glasses still in my hand that she had handed me just a second ago.

She gave me a look of pity. "I would suggest giving them away. That's what I did." She turned away again before giving one last turn back. "And don't forget to look at it. It moves slower when you're looking at it."

At the time, of course I knew it was an odd interaction, especially that last part, but I didn't really pay much attention to it. I stared at it for a moment, as if expecting the glasses to move from my hand and jump at me. When that didn't happen, I decided to try them on again.

Somehow, even my vision seemed to be improved by them, so I decided to keep them on. After finally finishing my coffee, I left the coffee shop and headed out.

That day was my day off. Days off are amazing because I can just walk from my house to the coffee shop, all without leaving the beach. It was such a gorgeous place, I was so lucky to have lived there.

As I continued moving along the beach, I thought I heard the sound of breathing behind me. I whirled around, but even with the beach so crowded there was nobody that was close enough to have made that sound. I naively brushed it off as the wind.

I spent the whole day watching TV, and lost track of time. I heard that same noise again, a little louder than before. I was sitting in my rocking chair, so I couldn't have exactly whirled around from that position. Nevertheless, I figured the AC had just turned on.

Immediately afterward, I heard the sound of the garage door opening. "Laura, is that you?"

For a split second I had the feeling that it wasn't Laura who was behind that door. Even so, she opened the door and yelled, "Dammit, John! Why didn't you pick up Gracie! I called you like 50 times!"

I felt around my pockets and dread filled my body. "Ah shit." I said, "I left it at the coffee shop."

"Well, go get it!" my wife sighed. "And when you come back, we're gonna have a talk!" She brought Gracie into her room and started speaking to her something I couldn't quite hear.

"Perhaps she's speaking Latin incantations to her," was my immediate thought, but I dismissed the notion. Why was I thinking any of this? I'd never had intrusive thoughts like this before.

I headed back outside, onto the beach. Normally, all I could hear at night were the waves. This time though, I thought I could hear someone running and breathing heavily.

It was so far ahead that I couldn't make out what was running, but I could tell that something was out there. I dismissed it, even taking off the glasses that I still had on.

Perhaps it was just my vision failing me, but I couldn't see whatever was running anymore. I could still hear it, though. Breathing. The sand on its feet as it ran.

I put the glasses back on and was startled when I saw that not only was whatever it was still there, but it had moved significantly since I had put my glasses off. Looking at the pace it was going now, down the beach, there was no reason why it should be so much closer.

It was finally then that I remembered Angela's words. "It moves slower when you look at it."

The breathing noises that I heard sounded more like wheezing at this point, and were so loud they practically drowned out the noise of the ocean. Even so, I dared to try again.

I took off the glasses, for no more than a second, then put them back on again.

I couldn't see it with the glasses off. But when I saw it again, it was no longer a large distance away from me. I don't know how close it was--maybe half a football field?

The breathing, the noises, sounded louder than my own thoughts. But somehow, I was able to remember the other thing Angela told me. "I would suggest giving it away. That's what I did."

There was only one person that I knew was awake at this moment. I quickly ran back inside, to the surprise of my wife. She opened her mouth, mouthing the words "We need to talk." The roar in my ears prevented me from hearing anything else.

I turned back at the door that I had just entered. I had looked away for too long, and it was already at my door. Slowly, it took one step forward, then another. It didn't even need to open the door to pass through it. It unfurled itself, rising up to the height of the ceiling in the middle of the room. My wife was standing close enough to it that I could see both of them at the same time.

She was still talking to me, but of course any semblance of noise other than the breathing and cackling of that thing was a lost cause. In one swift motion, not even daring to blink, I ripped the glasses off of my face and pushed them onto Laura's.

I could feel that dread as I took off the glasses. Taking off the glasses before had not had that effect on me, perhaps it was because the two of us were so close. Even so, the moment that my wife looked into the glasses, all the noise, all the dread, all the visions of seeing that--that *thing*. It all stopped.

For a moment, all I could hear was my ears ringing, unaccustomed to the quietness of the house.

Then Laura, my wife, the love of my life, started screaming.

I know I'm a bad husband. But I'm not a bad father, I swear. My first thought was Gracie. I ran into her room, shutting the door behind me, as her mother was screaming and wailing in the other room. I held onto her tight mumbling "it's okay, it's okay Gracie" to her, but mostly it was for myself. When the clawing at the door started, I pushed myself against her bedroom door to stop it.

At last, I heard a soft *crunch* and that was the last noise I heard coming from the living room. I held up a finger to shush Gracie and, after a moment of hyping myself up, opened the door, went out, and closed the door.

All the lights were turned off. I braced myself, then flicked on the switch.

There was Laura, calmly turning the page of a book that she had been choosing to read in the dark. She was wearing those glasses, and her old pair of glasses were under her shoe.

"Hello, John." she said, without looking up. "Thank you for giving me these glasses. I'm sorry about the mess but I just don't see how these other glasses--" she lifted her foot, "could ever compare."

I wish I could say that was all that happened. I've been...busy, lately, so I don't really have the time to share everything right now. I'll finish this off by saying that I'm sorry, Laura. You deserved better than someone like me.
