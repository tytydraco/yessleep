I hate using the word widow but that’s what I am.

I’ve been that for three years now, ever since my husband died from a liver infection caused by chronic hepatitis.

We never had kids and it hasn’t been easy to get used to an empty house. I try to fill my time with work and volunteering at church. I haven’t moved on yet but I’m trying, one step at a time.

Strange things started happening to me about a month ago.

It began one night when I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night to the sound of the curtains moving and decided to grab a glass of water. When I opened the fridge, its light cast two clear shadows on the floor. I let out a scream and dropped the glass.

There was nobody behind me or anywhere in the house. I searched every room, terrified it might be an intruder. I convinced myself I’d imagined it and went back to bed.

But the next night the same strange waking happened. I got up to use the bathroom and when I flipped the ceiling light on, two shadows appeared on the floor again.

It was obvious nobody was there so I just stood there confused, trying to figure out if it was some weird trick of the light. Then I noticed the outline of the other shadow. It was a man. Not only that but the build and the hair were exactly like my husband’s.

I must have stared at that shadow for minutes, stunned, until it moved on its own like it had a life of its own.

It took a few steps toward me, raised a hand like it was telling me to come closer, and then vanished.

\*\*\*

The next day after service I went out for coffee with Adam and told him what had happened.

Adam was a divorced man my age who also volunteered at the church. We’d become friends.

“Maybe he just wants to know if you’re okay,” he said, sounding skeptical.

“I don’t think that’s it,” I said, not wanting to explain why.

“Then maybe try talking back,” he shrugged. “You might find out what he wants.”

Adam looked uncomfortable with the whole conversation, even more so because it was obvious he liked me. I’ll admit I liked him too but I was afraid to get close to anyone after my husband.

Still, I tried his idea. On the nights it happened again, every couple of days, I spoke to the shadow like I was speaking to my late husband.

If it understood me, it didn’t care. The gestures stayed the same and even got sharper and more aggressive as the days went on. Always the same hand motioning for me to come closer. But come where?

Things really escalated one night when I didn’t wake up naturally. I woke up choking in darkness.

Something was pressing hard against my face and I couldn’t breathe. I thrashed on the bed, my lungs burning, and managed to fall off and break free.

It was my pillow that had been over my head but there was nobody in the room. I ran to switch on the light and saw the man’s shadow next to the bed. Its face stretched like it was smiling.

\*\*\*

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I left the house and wandered until dawn. I just couldn’t stay there.

I went to work but left early, my mind stuck on what had happened. I called Adam and we met at the same café where I told him everything.

“There’s something off about this,” he said, thinking. “Why would your husband want to hurt you?”

“You didn’t know him, Adam,” I answered, tears streaming. “He’s not the kind of man who’d want me happy without him.”

Then I told him everything I’d never told anyone. How I’d met my husband when I was seventeen and he used my innocence to trap me in that house. How jealous, obsessive, and possessive he was.

“He’ll never leave me alone,” I finished, stunned at how much I’d said.

Adam’s expression shifted from doubt to pity. I don’t know if he believed the crazy story about shadows but he invited me to stay at his place in the guest room.

I hesitated but agreed. My closest family lived three hundred miles away and there was no way I was sleeping in my house.

He was very kind and respectful. We ordered Chinese and watched a movie on opposite ends of the couch. I wondered if this was what normal couples were like.

Later I said good night and went straight to my room where exhaustion hit me and I practically passed out on the bed.

I only woke up again in the middle of the night to a sharp noise, like something falling. Terrified, I stepped into Adam’s hallway but didn’t find him in the living room.

I noticed his bedroom door was half open and the light was on. I called his name but got no answer, so I pushed the door and saw the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

Adam’s pale body was hanging in the air, stiff, his legs twitching. His neck was tied to the curtain, twisted into a rope like a noose.

And beside him, my husband’s shadow was cast on the wall, making that same gesture with his hand.

\*\*\*

I rushed to cut the rope, but it was too late. So I called 911, grabbed my things and left the house right then. I caught the first bus to my mother’s and that’s where I am now.

Mom was happy to see me but confused by the terror on my face. Two days have passed and I’ve barely eaten a thing.

She must be wondering why I can’t find any words to explain what happened, and especially why every night I refuse to turn on any [light in the house.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Accomplished_Low7889/s/M2gfM4b1Qm).
