“We collected a new sample from the field a few days ago,” Olaf said, his voice tinged with both excitement and unease. “Initial assessment gives us some shallow information about it. However, we believe that we need to investigate it at a photonics level. Are you up for it?”

“Sure,” I replied, hiding my excitement at handling a new field sample since my last one six months ago. “Tell me what your initial findings are.”

“Okay,” Olaf replied, “The sample was collected in the Arctic roughly 792 meters from the research station a few weeks ago. The sample is a perfect cube with a length of 36 cm. It appears to be pure black. Field equipment indicates that no light reflects from it. Tests conducted on its reflectivity include 365 nm and 395 nm UV sources, as well as the standard red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, and magenta flashlights. We also have seen no light transmit through the sample, so we can only assume that it absorbs 100% of any incoming visible light. I will send you the visible light spectroscopy graph for your reference.”

He paused, then added, “Interestingly, despite its size, the sample is relatively light, weighing only 1.44 kg.”

“I should also mention that we found the sample beside two mummified male bodies,” Olaf continued, his voice dropping to a whisper. “We found their IDs, and they would be 35 and 47 years old as of today… if they were alive. No signs of physical conflict. No damages or discoloration on their attire. Initial assessment indicates they died due to the cold. These bodies belong to the researchers who were reported missing from the station a month ago. The exact report date was September 13, 2017, at 05:16. We also found that the sample is not radioactive.”

I contemplated Olaf's initial report and concluded that the sample was probably not a threat since there were no signs of conflict found on the dead researchers. But why were they taking the sample away? The sample’s surface was behaving like a perfect blackbody, absorbing all incident electromagnetic waves—at least in the visible light spectrum. Maybe it’s temperature sensitive.

“Hey Olaf, what was the surrounding temperature and sample temperature when you found it?” I inquired.

“Both outdoor and sample temperatures were recorded at 2.1 degrees Celsius,” Olaf replied. “I know that you’re the only one currently working in the optical properties center. Do you need any help? I can request for technicians to assist you during your investigation.”

“Yes,” I replied. “I will need two. This will optimize the measurement and calibration procedures.”

“Sure,” Olaf said. “I will get Arya and Seo-jun to help you. They know their way around a lab.”

The next day, precisely at 07:16 on October 17, I collected the sample from Olaf and we began working with it in the dark room—a special optics lab where no external light could enter. Seo-jun, a strong and tall fellow with a calm demeanor, carefully took the sample from the metal crate. Arya, a small-figured woman with keen eyes and meticulous nature, prepared the table for it. I was setting up the equipment, which included specialized flashlights, lasers, and a hot plate.

After the setup was finished, I instructed both Arya and Seo-jun to measure the temperature of the sample and the room, as well as assess the sample's reflectance, absorption, and transmission profile using the specialized visible light and UV sources. In the meantime, I tested the hot plate to ensure it could vary temperatures in 0.25-degree Celsius increments and maintain them for at least 10 minutes.

Arya reported back to me, mentioning that the current sample and room temperatures were exactly the same, 21.3 degrees Celsius. She also noted that while they measured no reflection of light from the sample, they detected a 5.1% transmission rate through all sources. This meant the sample had become slightly more transparent. Perhaps the profile changed due to the 19.2-degree Celsius increase. It was time to test this hypothesis.

"Arya, please set up the hot plate on the table. Ensure we have everything needed to maintain a uniform temperature profile throughout the sample," I instructed. She acknowledged my instruction as I motioned for Seo-jun to come over. "Seo-jun, assist Arya by placing the sample onto the hot plate and securing a transparent heat shield to ensure even heating."

“Oh, I forgot. Get a port in the thermal shield ready for a thermal camera. I will need it to verify that the sample is evenly heated during the process,” I added, addressing both of them. “While you are working on that, I will calibrate the thermal camera and ensure that the equipment is properly positioned. I’ll also check that the heat shield controller is working properly. We will need to take the reflectance and transmission measurements when the heat shield measurement ports are open.”

After we completed the setup, I explained the next steps. “I will handle the hot plate temperature increases. Arya, you will manage the reflectance and transmission measurements using the green light source. Seo-jun, you will handle the heat shield ports and monitor the sample with the thermal camera.”

After a few minutes, I inquired, “Is everyone ready?”

Arya and Seo-jun nodded in agreement. “Okay,” I said. “Let’s begin. I will start by setting the temperature to 22.0 degrees Celsius.”

As I set the temperature of the hot plate, a surge of excitement mixed with nervousness coursed through me. The sample's mysterious properties were unlike anything I had encountered before, and the pressure to ensure every detail of the setup was perfect was immense. My mind raced through the checklist—calibrating the thermal camera, positioning the equipment, verifying the heat shield controller. The anticipation of potential discoveries was exhilarating, but the fear of missing a crucial step kept me on edge.

“Sample temperature is uniformly heated at 22 degrees Celsius. That’s fast,” Seo-jun exclaimed. I verified, and he was correct—it only took the sample roughly 47 seconds to uniformly heat. I had expected at least 7 minutes considering its size.

“Arya, I’m opening the measurement ports now. Get ready with the measurements,” Seo-jun said.

“Ready,” Arya replied.

As Seo-jun opened the ports, Arya took the measurements. “Transmission rate is measured at 8.3%. No reflectance rate measured. That’s a significant increase, fellas,” Arya said.

“Wow. That’s impressive. I’ve never seen this before. Let’s continue our measurements in increments of 0.25 degrees Celsius until we reach 40 degrees,” I said.

Seo-jun nodded in agreement, but Arya seemed confused or distracted.

“Hey Arya, are you with us? What’s going on in that head of yours?” I asked.

“Nothing,” she replied. “I thought I heard someone besides you call my name. And that they wanted us to stop or something before it’s too late.”

“Strange,” I said, pondering her words. “I’ll keep a note of that. Maybe the sample is communicating with you. But considering the institute’s objectives, we must proceed.”

She hesitantly nodded in agreement. I should have considered her words then, but my main concern and purpose was to uncover the sample’s secrets. No matter the cost.

As we incrementally increased the sample’s temperature, it became exponentially more transparent. I also noticed that Arya grew increasingly concerned and distracted. At around 30.50 degrees Celsius, when the sample reached a transmission rate of 36.4%, Seo-jun's calm demeanor changed, showing signs of hesitation and nervousness.

When I inquired, he said, "I started having visions of a city of rocks and obelisks. Colors I've never seen before, shimmering beautifully. The sky was all black, and I could see the outlines of many beings. I thought I could hear them whisper, but I couldn’t make out the words. However, there were two figures I thought were human, motioning their arms as if to tell me to stop right now."

Arya and Seo-jun exchanged worried glances. Arya spoke up, her voice trembling, "I don't think we should continue. This feels wrong. I'm really scared."

Seo-jun nodded in agreement, his usual calm demeanor replaced by visible anxiety. "I have to agree with Arya. These visions... they feel like warnings. We should stop before something bad happens."

I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. "We must continue. These warnings could be nothing. We have to see this through."

But Arya and Seo-jun insisted, their voices growing more urgent. "No, we can't. This is too dangerous," Arya pleaded. Seo-jun added, "We need to stop now before it's too late."

My patience was wearing thin, and frustration boiled over. Their incessant concerns and fear were hindering our progress.

"If I cannot get either of you to pull yourselves together, I will have you both removed from this facility at once. You will both be fired and sent back home dishonorably. And you will never, ever work in any research facility again for as long as I live. Is that understood?" I yelled.

They both nodded in agreement. I think Seo-jun flipped me the bird, and Arya swore at me under her breath when I turned around, but that did not matter. What mattered was this sample.

I completely tuned out both technicians' voices as we continued working. Like clockwork, I kept telling them the temperature settings of the hot plate and instructing them to take the transmission rate measurements. We finally reached 100% transmission at 36.50 degrees Celsius.

The sample was beautiful. It was a pure, transparent crystal, almost invisible to the naked eye. I removed the heat shield and began to touch—no, caress—the sample. It didn’t feel hot or cold. It matched my body temperature almost perfectly.

I heard the sounds of a door opening and closing, accompanied by the rushing of two sets of footsteps. My help must have left, but that didn’t matter. Only the sample mattered.

After caressing it, hugging it, I stared deep into its beautiful transparent body. Slowly but surely, I could see obelisks and pillars made of perfectly smooth minerals. They sometimes stood perfectly still, sometimes tilted. Their colors were indescribable, yet beautiful. One obelisk stood out from the rest. It was the largest, standing nearly ten times taller than the others. Somehow, it terrified me. I felt like it was looking at me, but it had no eyes. I dropped the sample and slowly walked backward.

As I turned towards the door, I noticed a figure standing in front of it. Its shape was wildly confusing, defying even the most basic understanding of physics and geometry. It looked thin, yet thick. Huge, yet extremely small. It emitted a color beyond my understanding. Was it red, black, white? I couldn’t comprehend it. It made no sense. This figure made no sense at all!

I turned around and tried to make it to the emergency exit, but I was met with yet another being. This time, it was shapeless. Formless. It looked like a shadow, a void leeching the color from everything near it. I couldn’t wrap my head around what I was seeing. Was it coming close to me? Was it far away? Was it surrounding me?

Suddenly, the color began to strip from me, slowly. My arms and legs shrank inch by inch. A mysterious force pushed me into that damned sample. Physically, I felt nothing, but somehow, indescribable pain coursed through me, as if I was being ripped from my body.

Sucked into the sample like a vacuum, I saw my body fall numb to the floor for a few seconds. It was just skin, bones, and hair wearing my standard lab clothes. My eyes were gone.

Looking down, I saw that I was free-falling into the city full of obelisks. It may have only lasted seconds, but it felt like hours before I slammed into the ground, face first, with tremendous speed.

Fear gripped me, but there was no pain. My nose, my face—everything was intact. Examining my body, I found it in perfect condition. My clothes were perfectly clean.

Surviving the impact seemed impossible. I wished I hadn't.

Standing up, I recognized the tallest, most menacing obelisk in the distance. By eye, it looked like it was miles away. The moment I blinked, I stood about six feet away from it. Shocked, I fell down suddenly. How did it get in front of me? Did I teleport?

For a few seconds, I stared at it, trembling. The shimmer and brilliance of its indescribable color captivated me. It looked opalescent, black, and shimmering purple simultaneously. Every time I blinked, it seemed to change its shape—sometimes really large, very thin, huge at the top and tiny at the bottom. However, the surrounding obelisks and monoliths remained the same, standing as silent sentinels in this otherworldly landscape.

I quickly stood up, making an attempt to flee from the monolith, but stopped as I noticed I was surrounded by formless entities. They all had a similar dull, grey color, yet their presence was overwhelming. Each entity seemed to express pain and anguish, their distorted forms writhing in silent torment. The air around them felt heavy, as if their suffering was a tangible force pressing down on me.

Turning around to assess my surroundings, I saw the two missing Arctic scientists among the crowd. Their faces were unmistakable, etched with sorrow and pity. But the rest of their bodies, my God. Their bodies were formless, like the others. They seemed to be caught in a perpetual state of transformation, their features melting and reforming in a grotesque dance of agony.

From that point, I recognized that my fate was sealed. There was no escape. Slowly, I would whittle away into one of them, to feed this ever-hungry city. I could feel it already—my fingers were numb, devoid of sensation. My sense of fear had vanished, replaced by a cold acceptance of my doom. The city seemed to pulse with a malevolent hunger, drawing me deeper into its grasp.

Looking around, I could see my lab in the sky, and the faces of the horrified staff, including Arya and Seo-jun. They must have discovered my body. Their expressions were a mix of shock and despair, mirroring the emotions I could no longer feel.

If I have the strength like the last two scientists here, I will try to communicate with them. If I can, I want to say this:

*Arya, Seo-jun. I am sorry. I should have listened to both of you. My pride and lust for knowledge got in my way. But listen. Do not let anyone ever touch that damned sample. If they do, their body temperature will make it perfectly transparent… and they will suffer the same fate as me.*
