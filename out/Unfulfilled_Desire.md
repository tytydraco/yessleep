As I approached the glass door, I couldn't help but think to myself that maybe my gift wasn't good enough perhaps it was too mundane, but surely Christina and Tom wouldn't care after all they were the richest couple in town and could easily buy whatever their hearts desired. “Hey Gary how are you” says Tom as he opens his door to welcome me in, “Why hello there old friend, real nice weather we're having”, “I suppose it is come on in buddy” , I'm so glad that you could make it” says Tom. As I entered the house I saw candles burning, the stench of those candles was so pure and innocent, “nothing could beat it” I thought as I entered the dining rooms where dozens of others were waiting for Tom and Myself, I could tell that they were all eager for the festivities of this wonderful night to begin after all it was Christmas Eve for goodness sake, and to make things even better Tom and Christina recently got engaged so I could tell that this party was going to be a good one.  
  
Before taking my seat at the table I set the gift I brought for the two on the top shelf of one of the nightstands in the dining room. My gift in a rather smaller box than some of the others I was sure could have been the best gift here at this party although I still had that thought in the back of my head that the gift wouldn't be good enough for the pair's standards. Eventually though my worrisome self got over the “gift issue” and continued in greeting all the other guests at Toms and Christina's home, Mrs Williams who was also attending the party was a rather quiet old woman and who was someone who I frequently was in touch with she was rapidly ascending in age and constantly needed help with stuff around her house, and with my glorious amounts of free time that I always found myself in due to my lenient schedule with my job I figured why not lend the extra help?  
  
“Micheal, how are you?” says Mrs Williams, as I said before Mrs Williams is rather old and is not very good at remembering names or anything for that matter hell she even has sticky notes on her fridge in the kitchen to remind her to do the simplest of tasks, such as “Take sleep meds” or “Flush the toilet after using it”. I think it's fair to say that the early stages of dementia are definitely kicking in. “Haha you must've forgotten Mrs Williams my name isn't michael, Its Gary!”, “Oh heavens sake sorry dear I’m not very good at remembering things” says Mrs Williams, “Yeah you're telling me”, I mumbled, as my conversation drew increasingly more plain and boring with Mrs Williams I noticed something rather strange I then found myself staring down the hallway at Tom's backyard patio door, beautiful striped curtains lined his patios glass back door, however the curtains did not block the shadow that I could still vaguely see through the curtains. I was rather curious and frightened at the same time I found my eyes gazing at this figure, it was already starting to become very dark outside and to my knowledge there weren't supposed to be any more guests attending this lovely party.  
  
“What in the world?”I mumbled to myself again, Mrs Williams must've noticed my eerie and frightened state as she tapped me on the shoulder and asked “Are you seeing the figure too?”, I nodded my head in pure astonishment, “So I'm not losing my mind?” I said, “No honey I saw that figure as soon as I walked into this house, don't worry about it though it's probably just another guest” said Mrs Williams, “I suppose it is” I then wondered to myself “Why would there just be someone standing out there for the whole of this party, ah whatever doesn't really matter” I thought to myself. As my conversation with Mrs Williams finally ended and the night became dull I found myself staring at who for some reason was spending the majority of the night looking for his engaged partner Christina, he must have eventually gave up though because he started saying his goodbyes to the people that were leaving early, mainly people with kids, but even people without children were leaving, so I figured it was time to exit before the party got too dull. As I said my goodbyes to the remainder of the guests I took one last look down the hallway in which I initially saw the figure.  
   
  
It was gone almost as if nothing was ever there, all I could see was the beautiful curtains. However these curtains would be no more, I exited the house quickly, grabbed the remote switch from my pocket, and clicked the tiny red button, I ducked behind a stone wall near Toms garden just in time and watched the house disintegrate and explode into pieces “this is wonderful” I thought to myself, Finally that arrogant son of a bitch named Tom got what he deserved. He was always acting better than everyone else, always bragging about how wealthy he was and talking down to everybody else who didn't have as much as him. Not only did I give myself the pleasure of knowing that Tom was gone but I also knew now that my gift in that little brown box was easily the best one at the party. As I entered my car I let out a magnificent laugh, the hardest I've laughed in a long while. Then however “the figure” aka Christina entered my passenger side door and we drove off down the long driveway and thought about our new lives together and the best part was she hated Tom's guts more than I ever could which was why I was so pleased when she was got in on this little plot I had to destroy Tom for good.
