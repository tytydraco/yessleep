I have literally have no other way of putting this. I'm trembling writing this right now. For context my best friend; Sal is a sweet and very intelligent guy. 

Him and I met in elementary school and have remained best friends even now in our 30's. We went through the army and med school together.

 We're both practicing general surgeons and don't have the same time to hangout with each other like we once did. But we try our hardest.

But one day several months ago he seemed different. Alarmly different. 

Sal was a very strong Christian and didn't smoke and hardly ever drank. He also (while quite the ladies man) never had casual sex.

I first noticed when we went to hangout several months ago at his ranch house. I walked into his house to the smell of Marijuana. I saw him with a glass of bourbon and a joint hanging out of his mouth.

I was perplexed at the sight. My first though was he's just trying something new. Besides weed is legal in the state we live in it. It was just very unlike him.

 Then from around ths corner a woman walked out. I thought again that he was just trying things out. Maybe he loosened up a little prehaps. 

I introduced myself and we all hungout I had a few drinks and got a little tipsy. I wasn't drunk enough not to drive.

Sal and the woman were pretty wasted. I just had a weird feeling about it. Sal and I made eye contact for a second, and it just didn't feel like him.

His eyes were just cold and empty feeling. While a year ago he had such soft and caring eyes. I felt uneasy, which I had before looking into Sal's eyes. 

I decided to leave and it was odd because Sal wanted me to leave. He seemed happy to get me out the door. He was always the type to talk to you for another 30 minutes before you left, not this time. 
A few days later I saw an article over a missing woman on my phone. She looked exactly like the woman Sal had over that night. That's because she was. I wouldn't put it together until much later. 

A couple weeks later Sal wanted me to come over again. Of course I agreed, he was my best friend and I wanted to hangout with him. I went over that night.

This time it was even worse. He was drunk when I got there. He was a mess and completely unkempt which was not like him at all. He was sluring his words and looked like he hadn't slept in awhile. 

This time he had 2 women over. I sat on the couch across from him and he began to makeout with these 2 women in front of me. I told him I needed to talk to him in private and pulled him to his bedroom. 

His room was a complete mess too and smelled of a very strong and distinct odor. That's when I had to just know what was going on. 

"Sal, what the hell is going on?"

"What are you talking about?" He slurred.

"You're drunk? Your house and you are a complete wreck? You have these women over making out with you? What's going on?"

"That's just the way I roll."

"No it's not. Look, if somethings going on you need to tell me now." 

"Maybe you just don't know me as well as you thought."

"No, I know you and I've known you for over 2 decades. This isn't you, this isn't the Sal I know."

"What if I'm not the Sal you know, huh? People change. You don't like it you're welcomed to fuck off."

That's when I knew something was very wrong. Sal did not ever use profanity. Not ever, I never even heard him peep a damn or hell, and those words are in the bible too. This is when I got very concerned, but what could I do. Sal was a grown man making his own decisions. I wasn't in any position to tell him how to live. 

At the same time though he was my friend and seemed like he really needed help. I decided to leave that night though and think of a way to help him out. As I left his room something caught my eye.

In the corner of his beige bed sheets was a red crusty stain. It very much resembled dried blood. Of course I was oblivious and thought nothing of it, but I remembered it.

I told him I was leaving and he walked me to the door only to slam it in my face. His blinds were up in his living room window. I peeked in to see him and those women sorting cocaine. 

I was mortified, my best friend was in serious need of help. I should've called the cops then, I should've went in there and slapped him and demanded he stop acting that way. I didn't though.
I was very busy the next few months though. I had several surgeries booked and I just didn't want to accept my best friend was a whole different person. 

3 months went by and in that time we texted a hand full of times. I thought about seeking some sorta therapy for him. Like an intervention of some kind. 

What I decided to do was to just ask him if I could come over. It just be us 2 and no booze or drugs. He agreed and went over there. His grassed hadn't been mowed since I was there. 

When I went inside it was just a complete mess. There was trash all over the floor including several empty bottles of liquor. It smelled of urine and feces. There was blankets everywhere randomly.

He was sitting on the couch and looked horrific. He looked like he had lost 20 pounds. His hair was long and greasy. He had grown a beard that was matted up and looked like it was full of food.

He looked like he hadn't slept in a week. He was just sitting there slouched over supporting his head with his hand. I came over and stood in front of him. 

"Oh my God, Sal you look..." 

"Horrible. I know." He mumbled

"Have you been to work since we last saw each other?"

"No. I quit."

"You, you quit? Why? That was a great hospital to be working in."

"Cause I didn't feel like it. I don't care anymore."

"Look pal, you need serious help. I don't know what's going on..."

"I don't need shit!"

"Can I at least get you some water? You look dehydrated."

"Fine."

I walked over to the sink for something to really catch my eye this time. It was a tiny bone on the counter top. It looked exactly like a proximal phalanx bone. I had just done a trigger finger surgery the prior week, so human hand bones were fresh in my mind. But most of all that made me very disturbed about it was because Sal is a vegetarian. 

I questioned him on it.

"Hey there's a bone on your counter top?"

"Huh?"

"A bone."

"Oh that. I had some fried chicken the other day."

"But you're a vegetarian."

"Yeah, I stopped being one a few weeks ago."

I got him some tap water in a cup and decided to have a look around. I told him I had to use the bathroom, but he looked so out of it I didn't even think that was necessary. 

The first place I looked was in his bedroom. It was just tossed around. Of course he hadn't changed his bed sheets since last time I saw him. That stain was still on it. I went to get a closer look. It definitely looked like dried blood without a doubt, but how could I be sure?

Then I decided to look around some more. Every other room looked mostly unused. But the basement door had a padlock on it that it didn't have before. It was one of those heavy duty ones a bolt cutter would have trouble getting through.

I decided to get the key and find out what was down there. I went into the living to get his key ring off the rack by the door. The only trouble was that it was right next to the couch. I went into the living room with my heart racing.

I slowly walked over to the rack. He looked asleep completely hunched over with both hands on his face. I slowly crept over and reached out to grab the keys. They slightly jingled and I nearly had a heart Attack.

I slowly walked back to the basemenf being as silent as I could. There were about 10 keys on this ring. I just looked through them until hoping the key had the same brand name. It didn't so I had to go through all keys. Even though I wasn't making anymore noise than a house plant it felt like every move I made was equivalent to a game of racket ball.

I put the 6th key in the slot and that was it. I slowly turned it and pulled the padlock off. I had just cracked the door when I felt a hand wiz by me and slam it shut. I jumped and looked over to see Sal standing there fuming.

"What are you doing." He said in such a stern aggressive voice.

"I just wanted to know what was down there."

"Whatever's down there is my shit! It is my personal stuff! Get the fuck out of my house!"

"Sal, I'm worried about you! This isn't you!"

I just kept looking into his tired, angry eyes. His once blue green eyes that had been the only person I had trusted now so brown they were almost black. It was terrifying, I didn't recognize this person.

"You know I could cut your fucking head off for this! You just make me wanna stab... ughhh!" Sal got so fueled with rage he couldn't even finish his sentence. 

"Sal, I'm... I'm sorry."

"I. Don't. Care. Leave my house right now."

I hung my head and walked to the front door while Sal just stood next to the basment door. When I left like I had just lost my friend forever. A few days went by of just pure depression for me. I cried a lot thinking of the love I truly felt for Sal. He wasn't just a friend he was family. He was my friend equivalent of a soulmate. I was grieving it felt like.

After a week went by I saw an article over a missing woman again. Only it wasn't a missing woman it was missing women. Several women had gone missing over the last few months. I recognized three of these women. They had all been at Sal's.

My mouth was literally wide open. I couldn't blink I just kept looking at these women I recognized. I just thought no way, a coincidence. He couldn't have. Maybe him doing all the other bullshit he was doing was within the bounds of reality, but Sal wasn't a murderer.

He wouldn't even kill a fly. Then again I never thoughf he would do any of the things he was doing, and the bone, the bloodstains, and especially the basement.

I just tried to let it go. To face the fact that maybe he was just going through something and that there was nothing I could do to help him. Maybe it was something that just had to be waited out. 

A month went by and I just couldn't take it anymore. More women went missing. I couldn't sit there and stew in the idea that my friend was gonna be like that, and that he might be responsible for these missing women. 

So I came up with a plan. I had a few vacation days I could use to stake out his place tonight and while he was gone I could sneak in and find out what was in the basement. Surely if he was killing these women that's where some evidence would be. 

The next day I took off work and drove to his house. I parked on the part road opposite of the direction he'd need to get to town. I made sure I had everything I needed to be sure I could do this properly. I even had my revolver on me just incase. Not that I could bring myself to kill, but if worse comes to worse it's a last resort for my safety.

It was about 7 hours before he left. I assumed he was going somewhere to pickup women. If I was wrong I'd be screwed, but I figured he'd be gone for at least 2 hours. As it takes 30 minutes to get to town and another to get back in itself. I immediately pulled my car into his drive way and got my handy little lock pick kit ready. He had both locks on his door locked. Which seemed like he was somewhat paranoid to me.

I went in it was still in the same condition it was in last time only worse. There were roaches and ants everywhere, and even more blankets scattered around. I decided to see what was under these blankets.

It was more of what looked like blood stains. It couldn't be. I pushed onto the basement. It was still the same massive padlock. It took me a bit longer to unlock it then the doors but I did it. I walked down to see that it was the cleanest place in the whole house. Until I got fully down the stairs.

There was a bed, there was bloody surgical tools next to it on a tray, and a video camera set on a tripod right in front of it. I was in the most denial I'd ever been in. There had to be any other explanation than he was a serial killer.

I didn't touch the camera outta fear of what was on it. Then I saw a few bags in the corner all trash bags. I checked them all out it and it was just filled with weird miscellaneous items. Chap stick, panties, some jewelry, and just weird stuff like that. The first few bags had stuff like that in it.

The last bag didn't though. Then I saw a woman's wallet in one of the bags. I took it out to see it still had an ID in it. It was one of the missing women. In the same bag was a few other things.

It had Sal's clothes covered in blood. Of course my first thought was this was the blood of his victims, then I noticed something unexplainably odd to me. I looked at the clothes very thoroughly, and the back of the shirt had cuts on it.

That's where the blood was mainly at and the cuts in the shirt looked like whoever was wearing them was stabbed several times in ths back, and these were definitely Sal's clothes. In the same bag was polaroid photos of Sal. These pictures were disturbing because they clearly were taken without Sal's knowledge. 

They were very obviously taken in secret, because they were taken outside through the windows of his house while he was doing mundane activities. I didn't even remotely know what to think of it. 

I didn't have time to think I had to go. Thankfully I got out before Sal got back and was able to catch me. I put the padlock back on the door and relocked his front door. 

I'm writing all this sitting in my house after seeing everything in his house. That's not the Sal I know, but I've been through every with him. I can't lose him. I know it's nieve but maybe there's some explanation. Maybe someone's making him do this. 

He's my best friend and I need to help him. I'm going back to his place to find out stright from him what the hell is going on. I need to know and he needs to tell me. I'll make an update once I'm back and I know the truth.
