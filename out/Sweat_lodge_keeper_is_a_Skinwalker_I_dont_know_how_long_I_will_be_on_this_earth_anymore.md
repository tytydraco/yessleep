Sweat lodge keeper is a Skinwalker, I don't know how long I will be on this earth anymore.

My name is Adrian, I am an 18 year old Native American. I live on the Kehewin Reservation, my favourite sport is Lacrosse. I am actually really good at Lacrosse, I even played a championship game for my school out on the reservation. My friends, Mason, Dan, and Andrew and I always go to this Sweat lodge 4 times a week. The rules in a sweat lodge are very clear and must be followed, you must never talk unless you are asked to speak, women and men must be on different sides of the Lodge. The women must sit like mermaids, never with legs crossed. Only the men in the Lodge sit with their legs crossed, It's forbidden for a woman to enter the sweat on her Moon time, she must wait until her time is done. All women have to cover their bodies neck to toe, usually wearing tall gowns and long pants. You cannot wear accessories as our first ancestors came with nothing on their first days on the physical earth, as the Keeper says, never bring any negative energies inside of the lodge. Every 4 sessions lasts from 20, from up to 45 minutes. Sometimes these sweats can be as long as 5 hours. The sweat lodge works by using really hot rocks that have been sitting in the fire for hours. The keeper splashes water onto the rocks causing really hot steam inside of the sweat. It's dark. When I say dark, it's dark. You literally cannot even see your own hands. Even close up. The sweat has a keeper, the keeper is the one who runs the lodge and sends prayers throughout the world. In my Reservation, the keeper's name was Lawrence, we call him Larry for short. 

I found this man weird, he was always twitching in inhuman manners. He always had coyote pelts, sometimes he would even wear one as a cloak. I never thought much of it at all, I always just thought he was connected to the spirit of the animal. Sometimes his stare gave me chills down my spine, his eyes had no life in them. They just terrorised me. His eyes were similar to that of a coyote, his voice was erratic. 

But other than this, he was a normal man. I enjoyed his company. He was usually an understanding man and taught me many native teachings and folklore, he knew a lot of teachings I never even heard any elder mention in my life. Lawrence always gave off a weird energy, sometimes the energy felt the same as staring at an animal straight into the eyes at midnight. The bright yellow eyes. Something felt off about him. His pupils were oddly very small, with the rest of the eyes larger. This gave him a terrifying look. 

His drumming and singing was powerful, his drumming felt like an ocean wave hitting against me. His singing sounded like a ritualistic chant. Comparable to a wolf Chuffing. If this all doesn't weird you out, sometimes his eyes glow firing red, with white pupils. I've noticed this only happens when he has the skin of a coyote on his back, especially when he wears the coyote. His hands and feet were really abnormal compared to a normal human's hands and feet. They had webs in between the fingers, his nails were similar to claws. Lawrence is a man who lives in a small home on the reservation, far off into the wooded areas. He lives alone, his house was created all by his work. By the way, not to mention is indigenous name is ᐱᒧᐦᑌᐃᐧᐣ ᒣᐢᑕᒑᑲᐣ which translates into walking coyote. This name can explain his passion for coyotes. 

My friends Mason, Dan, Andrew and I are crazy f\*ckers, we would always whistle after 9:00 at night. When we did, *I would always hear something running inside of the woods, we all f\*cking hated the running footsteps. Sometimes we would even get a reply back with whistling, a few times we would hear screams from hell, from quite literally hell. They didn't even sound human, the screams weren't just screams. They were animal-like screeches, they always had coyotes and lynx-like screams. We all were the troublemakers of the Reservation so our names are always known when mentioned. No one says "who" "what" when we are mentioned. Except for Lawrence, I don't know why everyone doesn't like talking about him. They all tried to keep Lawrence a secret, only a few people knew him. They were all elders, nobody younger than 40 knew him. Only Mason, Dan, Andrew and I were the only younger ones who knew him. I don't know why the elders would always shush us when we mentioned Walking Coyote.*   


Right after the Sweat sessions were done, I would always help Lawrence clean up the sweat Lodge. Sometimes he would invite me to go find rocks in the river for the next sweat. Lawrence and I had the strongest relationship out of Mason, Dan and Andrew. Our sweat is shaped like a pregnant woman's stomach, the materials used to shape the sweat are willow and deer skin. In the winter, the sweat is protected inside of a warm cozy cabin. 

Yesterday, Lawrence was acting a bit unusual compared to how abnormal he already is. Yesterday, his coyote skin cloak had feathers and coyote teeth as earrings on the coyotes ears. His eyes were even creepier, his pupils were tinier as the rest of the eyes were shaped more circle-like, almost like a goat's eye. Not weird enough, he grew a few inches taller. He called us into the sweat, we all entered the sweat. "The spirits are ready, whenever you are" Lawrence announced. Confused as we are, we are now silenced because the sweat has already started. He also announced that an elder is visiting us in the second round, the elder wouldn't be male, He stated. Rather the elder was female. We never usually had a female visitor. Suddenly, I heard Mason, Dan and Andrew choking, they were suffocating and Lawrence kept on drumming as usual. I got worried and asked him to stop the sweat, he silenced me and told me not to worry because they are going to be safe in the spirit life. He kept on going chanting and drumming, and I finally had realised that Lawrence is a powerful evil witch. I wanted out. I tried to open the sweat lodge door, except Lawrence grabbed my leg and told me not to worry because I am safe. when I sat down, I closed my eyes, shutting tightly. Out of command, my eyes were forced open. I couldn't close them. Damn right, I couldn't even squint my eyes.  I saw two eyes. Two red eyes, that glow. The two eyes had white pupils.

 The second round has reached, the elderly women came inside. It was Kokum, she liked it when we called her Kokum. She greeted me and held my hand, then she went to the opposite side of the room from me. I kept my head down in fear, my body couldn't help but tremble, I cried to myself, because on the second round Mason, Dan and Andrew had just disappeared into the thin air. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I broke the Lodge door and ran out of the Sweat. I still heard the drumming afar from me, the drumming was getting more aggressive as the farther I ran. The chants were no longer a human's chant, the chant was the sound of a coyote yipping and howling. I ran into the forest, I hid inside of a bush. Suddenly, the drumming had stopped.  I heard a blood curdling scream from afar. I didn't look, I couldn't move from the amount of shock my body handled. I could hear a coyote running, not to mention it's winter. I heard canine-like footsteps running, it was approximately 25 meters away from me, according to myself. The same footsteps me and my friends heard. The coyote was 20 meters away, now 10 meters away from the forest. The f\*cking footsteps gave me trauma. But then the walking coyote turned the other direction. As I got the chance, I ran out of the bush from the forest. I heard the bastard following me. The f\*cking thing was taunting me, it would stop for a while, and then it would run again. I ran until I reached my Auntie's house, the coyote backed away because my Auntie was burning cedar, skinwalker's do not like cedar. 

My Auntie, worried for me. She knew what exactly happened. She told me I didn't need to explain because she understands. She gave me warm chicken noodle soup, and a piece of baked bannock. 

She put me to bed. I'm traumatised. The coyote is peering through my window, I am writing this at night. The coyote won't leave me alone. The eyes, the eyes unsettle me. The eyes are f\*cking human. The coyote is tall and stands on its hind legs staring at me through the window, not to mention the arms are the shape of Lawrence's arm. My Auntie told me to stay inside of my room, I have cedar burning inside of this room. My Auntie had told me it's better to stay here, because if I leave the room. The coyote would climb inside of the chimney. It's funny because my window is 7 feet above the grass, and the walking coyote is standing with its hands peering through. My Auntie has no neighbors with her. All I can do is sit in my room, hoping I would be saved by someone. Somehow. My Auntie tried to contact a medicine man to send spiritual help from afar. I'm staring into Lawrence's eyes as I'm writing this.
