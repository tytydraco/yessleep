This is the first page of a letter left by my brother seven years ago, and I don’t know what to think. Everyone in our family thought that Derek went no contact after high school, and it hurt me. Derek and I had a really good relationship. We would go on hikes a lot and even though he was a much stronger hiker than me, he would match my pace. The summer after graduation Derek went to work at a camp, telling me how excited he was to work with kids. I was proud of my brother for going out into the world, but then he never came back.

In the beginning Mom and Dad called Derek several times a week to no avail. Eventually we called the camp to ask if anything happened to him, only to be told that Derek was an exemplary counselor and left once the summer was over. It took about two months for my parents to accept that Derek must have decided to leave home without another word. I went on with my life, going to college and finding a boyfriend.

About two days ago I received a letter. Apparently it got lost in the system until dead letters found it. Just one look at the hand writing I immediately knew who wrote it. I didn’t know what it had in store, my mind went to many places. It sat on my desk unopened, I even thought about throwing it away until my boyfriend convinced me to read it this morning. Admittedly, I was curious what Derek wanted to tell me seven years ago, what his excuse was to leave us without a word, but I didn’t expect this.

Dear Amber.
I hope your summer was fantastic! If I remember right, you start your senior year in two weeks! I am so proud of you, more than I can ever express. I’m writing this to apologize, because I’m not going to be there for it. Things happened this summer that I need to rectify, and I hope that you’ll come to understand and forgive me. What I am going to write you may not believe, but it doesn’t matter, I just need to tell you.

In the first few days during staff training I learned that Kilimata valley camp had a legend. You know me, I’m a sucker for local legend, especially when it involves where I work. The legend was based on a large bell in front of the mess hall. We’d ring the bell for a slew of reasons, calling dinner, wake up, going to bed, and so on and so forth. Apparently the bell is older than this country, being forged in Sweden in the 1600s.

For the actual legend, this bell had gotten the name hell’s bell, being said to drive men mad by its sound. Apparently the smith of the bell took his own life after it was completed. Yada yada, death and so forth, and somehow the founder of Kilimata valley camp got his hands on this bell, remaining it to the jolly hills bell in a hollow attempt to move away from it’s apparently violent past. Every couple of years, campers would go missing, having gone mad from the bell’s influence! I thought it was a lazy legend, something to haze the newcomers with. Later that night I was woken up by the older counselors ringing the bell wearing sheets over their heads. Real mature of them, I know, I thought it was the end of it. Admittedly, it was a really nice bell.

You’re probably very confused why I’m talking about a bell so much. You’re more than likely wondering “how does a bell explain why you’re leaving me behind?” I promise it will make sense soon. Or not, it might make less sense actually. But it doesn’t matter, time for the reason I am writing this. About four weeks into the summer, I was woken up at 2:19 AM by the bell. I was confused, but if the bell was ringing there had to be a reason so I got up. I was half a moment away from turning the light on and corralling the campers up when I realized I was the only one up. No one was even stirring in their sleep.

I was surprised, considering that a loud ass bell was ringing. I quietly went over to my cabin mate's bed and shook him up. He sat up, rubbing his face.

“Hey, what’s up dude, is something wrong?” he asked in a hushed voice. I was confused why he was whispering, so I just talked in normal volume.

“Uh yeah everything is fine, why’s the bell ringing, is it some night event?” My cabin mate put his hand to his mouth, shushing me. I got frustrated, putting my hands up.

“Dude! Keep your voice down, they're trying to sleep!”

“What? Dud- the bell is ringing, what is my voice going to do?”

“The hell are you talking about? Quit being an ass, we have a lot to do tomorrow.” I thought he was just pulling my leg, and I wasn’t having it. I was going to start arguing with him but he rolled over and told me to go to bed. Until then I hadn’t noticed that the ringing had gotten noticeably louder. I didn’t want to bother my cabin mate, I clearly annoyed him, but I needed to know why the bell was ringing. I glanced out of the window, curious if any other cabins were active. Nothing, every cabin’s lights were off, no one was outside. Intent on figuring it out I threw on some pants and slipped my shoes on. 

Stepping onto my cabin porch, the ringing had gotten uncomfortably loud. It was like someone was pushing sewing needles into my ears. Cupping my ears, I took a speed walk towards the mess hall. With each step towards the hall the ringing got louder. Every strike shook my brain, my body flinching, shaking from its vibrations. My walk turned to a jog, a jog to a run, and then a run to a sprint. My ears burned from the sound, begging for relief. I didn’t even know it could ring this loud. I reached the back of the mess hall, clenching the sides of my head in a feeble attempt to shield my ears. As I started to run around the side of the mess hall, I thought about how I was going to rip whoever was ringing the bell a new one.

The moment I rounded the front of the mess hall, the ringing stopped. My ears rang, it was like I had listened to music way too loud for way too long. I collapsed to the ground, letting out a pained breath. I laid in the grass for a couple of minutes until I remembered that I was here for the bell. I stumbled to my feet, looked at the bell, and saw that no one was there. I assumed that whoever rang it ran away, so I turned to walk back to my cabin. As I was taking my first step, I felt uneasy.

I swear on my life that someone was watching me, just out of sight. I felt eyes burning into me from across the lake, but that felt unimportant. My eyes and mind returned to the bell, feeling drawn towards it. In that moment I had gained a single confusing desire. I wanted to ring the bell. Amber I know it makes no sense but, something wanted me to ring the bell.

I walked towards the tower until I was about seven feet away, staring up at it. My eyes flickered across the lake again, feeling that piercing glare stronger than ever. I looked down at my feet, grabbing one of the decorative rocks. I didn’t want to pull the rope and wake everyone up, so I was going to throw a rock at it instead. I stepped back, geared up, and lobbed the rock at the bell. When rock hit metal, the world around me snapped away. It was like someone changed slides in a presentation. One moment I was standing in front of a large wooden building throwing a rock at a bell at 2:00 am, and the next I was standing in a valley of tall grass at dusk. I didn’t even hear the bell ring.

This is the end of page one of five. I don’t know what my brother was talking about, and I don’t know if I want to read the next page. I want to burn them, go on thinking Derek left me behind for some selfish reason. I don’t know, we’ll see if I read them.
