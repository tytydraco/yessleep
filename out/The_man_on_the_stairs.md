I’m the youngest of four siblings.

We lived in a narrow townhouse, the kind where every room had to serve more than one purpose, and privacy was more of a suggestion than a guarantee. A tight fit for a family of six, but we made it work.

The second floor had only two bedrooms — one for all of us kids, and one for our parents.

At the very top of the stairs, between the two rooms, my dad placed an arinola — a chamber pot — so we wouldn’t have to stumble down the stairs half-asleep if we needed to pee at night.

He said it was safer that way. The stairs were steep, and the house always felt a little colder, a little darker at 3AM.

I was maybe six or seven. Still small enough to curl up in the corner of a shared bed.

That night, I drank too much juice before bed. It was probably mango or orange — I don’t remember exactly — but I woke up in the middle of the night, my bladder screaming.

Everyone else was asleep.

The room was quiet, the kind of quiet where even the electric fan sounds far away.

I sat up slowly, still groggy. The only light came from the streetlamp outside, leaking through the slats in the window.

I tiptoed out of bed, careful not to wake my siblings.

Slid the bedroom door open.

Walked out into the dim hallway.

The arinola was in its usual spot — right by the top of the stairs, nestled between our room and my parents’.

I squatted.

Relieved myself.

Still half-asleep, blinking heavily.

And then… I opened my eyes.

At the foot of the stairs, just barely illuminated by the window glow —
there was someone.

A man.

Sitting.
Still.

His back was to me.

He wasn’t moving, but something about the way he sat — the slope of his shoulders, the shape of his neck — it felt wrong. Not just unfamiliar. Wrong.

I thought, maybe it was Dad.

Maybe he went downstairs for water and was taking a break on the way up.

I whispered,
“Dad?”

No answer.

A little louder this time —
“Dad?”

Still nothing.

No shift. No breath. Like he hadn’t even heard me.

And that’s when I noticed something else.
He wasn’t just sitting.

He was facing the wall.
Not looking down the hallway, not toward the living room —
his nose was nearly pressed to the wall at the base of the stairs. Like he was studying the texture of the paint. Or listening to it.

The silence turned heavy, like the air was thickening. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

But I needed to be sure.

I turned toward my parents’ room.

Their door was open — it always was, just in case we needed anything at night.

I crept over and peeked in.

There they were.

Two figures.
Asleep in bed.

Mom…
and Dad.

Breathing softly.
Undisturbed.

So now I’ll ask you the question I’ve never been able to stop asking myself:

If both of my parents were in bed… then who was the man on the stairs?
