Part 21:

I wasn’t completely sure if it was just the alcohol in me or pure instinct, but I put the pedal to the metal and sped right outta there.  I didn’t really know what the deal was with this new stage that Anastasia was on, but she had already given me enough of a warning about what could’ve happened to me if I had gotten too close during it.    Eventually I looked back and noticed that the orb of red light emanating from Anastasia’s house wasn’t still chasing me.  But now I had to figure out how to get back to Anastasia’s place.  And I was way too drunk to figure out how to do that myself.  I was just glad to have not gotten my dad’s truck stuck in a ditch again.  Not to mention the fact that I was the only one on the road.  ‘Cuz yeah, if ANOTHER car had come around during that time, my dad’s would’ve been toast.

I know only two drinks doesn’t sound like a whole lot, especially not when you’re slightly on the bigger side like I am.  But ya gotta remember that this was still my first time ever having any alcohol to drink at all, so I’m working with literally NO tolerance here.  And then there’s the fact that I had had two over the course of only one hour, so there was also that.  Even though Anastasia probably weighed less than me, she probably wasn’t anywhere NEAR as out of it as I had felt, even though she had just had so much more purely because she seemed so much more used to the stuff.  And once I had made my way back, she didn’t seem too out of it at that moment, anyway.  Though, once the liquor started to properly set in, the effects would become a bit clearer. 

Anyway, I was just thankful that I had taken Annie’s advice and brought my dad’s phone with me.  I looked up her address, which I had kept in my phone’s note’s app (since I knew there was no way in hell that I would’ve remembered it on my own) and got ready to head back.  But there was a slight problem with this:  I was using my DAD’s phone and NOT my own.  Because y’know.  That one kinda had to stay home on the charger in order for me to not find myself dropping dead anytime soon as a consequence of the phone having died, which would’ve meant certain death for yours truly.  Well, whatever.  It wasn’t like I had made any turns in my frantic scramble away from Anastasia’s.  All I would have to do was make a slightly illegal U-turn, hopefully stay on the road all while STILL keeping myself out of any ditches, and her house would have to turn up eventually.

Maybe I could’ve avoided drifting off the road if I had just walked back, but it was WAY too cold for anything like that.  Annie was gonna have a fit if I had spent so long out in the frigid cold, just like she had last weekend.  I turned my headlights on and started turning back.  I didn’t know if I quite had the space to turn around since these backroads weren’t all that wide, seeing as how they weren’t expected to accommodate all that many cars at any one time, but I gave it a shot anyway.  I ended up off the road, but thankfully, there weren’t any ditches nearby, so I was able to get myself situated and back on the road again soon enough.   

Even if I didn’t have her address, the red light had lit up her house to the point where I could still more or less remember what it looked like, and I was able to find my way back soon enough.  And by the time I did, I finally remembered that I wouldn’t have even NEEDED that reminder of what Anastasia’s house had looked like since the address was STILL in the search bar of my dad’s google maps app, which was the whole reason why I was ever even able to make it up there in the first place. 

And the whole reason the ADDRESS was in the search bar was because back at home, back where I had access to my OWN phone, I had ALREADY looked up the address and put it in the search bar before even getting in the car.  Ugh.  Only two shots in and I was already losing it.  Or maybe I would’ve forgotten it anyway.  I did have a track record of forgetting basic things even while sober too, so that was still entirely possible.  Whatever.  I made my way back to Anastasia’s easily enough either way.

By the time I had gotten back, it was 2:07, so my little adventure away from Anastasia’s and back again had taken a little longer than I had meant for it to, but it didn’t really matter, since we still had plenty of time before The Sandman would be back to check up on Anastasia by 3.

“Well, I see that you are still living, meaning that you have taken my advice and did not attempt to watch me sleep again,” said Anastasia, greeting me at the backdoor and leading back to her bedroom.  “I do appreciate that.  I would not have been particularly ecstatic to find that you had done that once more.  If you had violated my personal boundaries for a second time, even after having very sternly and explicitly communicated them to you, then I must confess that your passing would not have greatly troubled me,” she said.

As much I knew she had meant business just then, I couldn’t seem to focus on all that since the whole red-light business had gotten me curious about another thing.  Back at 1 AM, I could see red light emanating from her house, but it wasn’t like it was threatening to outright consume me the way that it had at 2 AM.  I also couldn’t hear very much from inside the house, even though I could hear everything crystal clear at 2 AM halfway down the street.  What had made such a difference?

“Yeah, no worries, I totally get that,” I said, responding to what Anastasia had said from before.  “But there was such a loud noise.  There was all this red light and it seemed like it was about to get me.  What was that all about?” I asked.

“That was a direct result of the final stage,” she said.

“But how did you sleep through it?  The noise was so loud, and the light was so bright.  How come you didn’t wake up?” I questioned.

“The blanket that I gave you last week not only blocks out the cold, but also all light and sound.  That was why the brightness, in tandem with the amplitude of the sound, did not awaken me.  And no one else would have woken up since the light would be invisible to anyone who does not play Sleep Points just as the clock is.  And the sound that The Sandman makes does not, of course, arouse the attention of any non-players either,” she explained.

“What would’ve happened if the red light had caught up with me?” I asked.  “You said ‘I see you’re still alive’.  Does that mean I could’ve died?”

“Yes.  Yes, you could have.  Though, only because you were awake.  If you had been asleep just as I was, you would have been just as safe from The Sandman as I, myself, had been,” she answered.  “If you had arrived even a few minutes earlier than I had suggested, you would have encountered a similar situation.  I honestly must apologize for not having warned you of this in advance.  I had not expected you to be early, though considering the level of risk at hand, it was grossly negligent of me to not have planned for that contingency,” she said, apologetically.

I had honestly thought it was only 1:00 by the time her house had come into view, but that idea was based on the red light.  But now I knew that she still had to be asleep for another 5 minutes after the fact.  The Sandman must’ve stuck around even after 1:00, so that must’ve meant that I was actually a few minutes later than I thought.  Maybe the aftermath was all I had really seen.  That was the only way to explain why I hadn’t seen the red light expand out toward me the way that it had done in the lead-up to 2:00.  That stage of The Sandman’s visit must’ve thankfully been over and done with by the time I had gotten there.  And I had only just barely missed it.  Thank God.

“It’s all good,” I responded.

“You must forgive me.  My thoughts have not been nearly so organized as they should be as of late.  Partly the alcohol is to blame.  Though, discounting tonight, I haven’t consumed any since you returned my blanket to me.  I believe the majority of this comes about as a result of my friend’s time having ran out.  Even before you said a word, I had a feeling she was gone.  I was in a very delicate state early Sunday morning because I knew that if she hadn’t broken her clock, she would have been taken at 4 AM.  I, of course, had been asleep at 4 AM.  Though I could’ve set the alarm for 4:01 and seen for myself.  I was allowed to be awake 1 minute after 4 as I had yet to ascend to my own latest Stage.  The final stage,” she said.  That didn’t sound good.

“But I don’t want you coming away with the impression that I will be taken any time in the near future.  The fact that I am now on the final Stage means only that as  little as half my time is up.  I have played for three years, and thus, if I am conservative with my Sleep Points as I most definitely intend to be, then I should have up to another 3 years to go.  I may very well live to see 2022,” she said.  Well, she almost did.  She got pretty close.  December ’21 ain’t bad.  She almost made it to the other side of the pandemic.  But like she said: that’s still a LONG ways away from where we are in the story right now.  Which means I got a LOT of writing to do before the end of this year.  At this rate, I won’t make it to 2025.  I’m just lucky I even made it to 2024.  So yeah, you guys are gonna have A LOT of new posts comin’ your way pretty soon.

“Well, thankfully I only saw the red light around your house by the time I had showed up,” I said, changing the subject from our inevitable deaths in the coming few years.  And if ya can believe it, she didn’t really wanna fight me on that.  “The light wasn’t like coming after me or anything like that.  But I guess that’s because you still had to be asleep for another 5 minutes even after 1 o’clock.  I guess that’s why I had seen the light from your house, even though it wasn’t expanding out to get me,” I answered.

“That is correct.  And I am quite thankful that the light cannot be seen by anyone uninvolved in Sleep Points lest the entire neighborhood be awakened.  My blanket’s capacity to block out the light and sound helps as well.  Were it not for that, I would need to resort to rather extreme methods indeed to keep myself asleep,” she explained.

“Y’know, your blanket actually reminds me of something else,” I said, thinking back to the first night of Stage Two, when I still had it with me.  “Now, obviously I hadn’t done it, but the thought had crossed my mind to try and use it to go to sleep while I still had it.  Part of me kinda wonders if maybe I shoulda done that, thanks to what I see it doing for you.  Would that’ve been okay?” I asked.

“No.  No, it would not have been okay.  You were right to have never used it to fall asleep.  You were to use it only as I had directed.  And I assure you that you would have been quite sorry for yourself if you had not,” she said bluntly.

“Okay.  I mean, yeah, that’s kinda what I figured.” I responded.

“Good.  Your instincts served you well.  You do not strike as one who gives his instincts due credit, but I am pleased to know that in that instance you did,” she said.

“Well, I wouldn’t really say that.  A lot of how I’ve made it this far ultimately came down to trusting my gut,” I said.

“I assume that is true.  Most tend to trust their instincts when the stakes are sufficiently high.  Though I suppose I meant my previous statement in a more general sense.  In an everyday context where your own immediate well-being does not hang in the balance, you strike me as the sort to second-guess yourself even when it would’ve been unnecessary for you to have done so,” she explained.  “A game of survival such as this shall hopefully teach you to leave behind such foolish tendencies as those in due time.”

“This is one of the few positives I see in alcohol consumption.  Unhealthy though it may be, it has us acting in a much more instinctual manner.  We are less inhibited and do not question ourselves as we are otherwise so apt to do.  We speak far more frankly and openly.  This is why I cannot help but to consider moderate alcohol consumption in the company of others to be an ultimately pro-social behavior.  Perhaps it is my own bias attempting to rationalize my drug of choice, but I cannot help but believe that you have acted and spoken more ingeniously toward me under the influence of alcohol than you ever have before when you were in a state of greater sobriety than at present,” she said.

“What does ‘ingenuously’ mean?  Like ‘honestly’ or something like that?” I asked.

“Correct.  Your instincts guided you to ze truce yet agyan.  And if you had had more to drink, you might’ve more confidently presumed zis,” she said.  Her ‘th’s were starting to come and go, by this point.  Or maybe I should say “zis” point, now that her Russian accent was beginning to creep back in here and there.  Sometimes she’d pronounce them right, other times not.  I guess it was just whenever she felt like it.

Although I probably shouldn’t harp on this point too much since she could get kinda sensitive about that, what with how she was always trying to sound as American as possible and, to her credit, tended to do a pretty good job of that.  Like I’ve said before, I would’ve never known she was born in Russia if she hadn’t said so on the first day of school.  Again, with a name like “Anastasia”, I would’ve probably guessed there was some Russian in her, but with how good her accent was, you really wouldn’t’ve thought that she, herself, had been born there.  But at the time, I hadn’t really realized what a sticking point it could be.

“You sound so much more like a Russian when you drink,” I said.

“I suppose that should tell me that I have had quite enough,” she said, going back to using her ‘th’s properly, probably to avoid sounding as Russian as she had before.

“I would truly hate for my Russian origins to corrupt my English as it does for my parents.  As proud as I am to be a Russian, I also take great pride in having exquisite command of the English language.  I would hate for my natural Russian accent to compromise that,” she said.  “Or at least whatever remnant of a natural Russian accent I have left.  I am vastly superior at speaking English in an American accent than I am at speaking Russian in a Russian accent.”

“Well, Annie, if you’re so proud to be Russian, why not go by ‘Anastasia’ instead of ‘Annie’?” I questioned.  “I mean it’s a really pretty name, right?”

“As a principled socialist, I refuse to be a Romanov.  I suppose that is rather controversial so will leave some time for that to marinate,” she said.  She paused for a second or two. Not that she really needed to, with me, though.  I didn’t judge.  Much like a lot of other Gen Zers, it wasn’t like I was the biggest Capitalism fan anyhow. 

“Anyway, that means that I would rather not share a name with one.  I am Anastasia Dmitrievna Baumana, not Anastasia Nikolaivna Romanova, and I choose to go by ‘Annie’ such that I might emphasize this important distinction.  ‘Dmitrievna’ from my father, named ‘Dmitri’, ‘evna’ from the suffix ‘-vna’ added on to the end of all female middle names.  They are called ‘patronyms’ as Russian middle names are always derived from the first name of one’s father.  The son’s patronym follows a similar pattern, albeit with the suffix ‘-ovich’, in place of ‘-evna’ or ‘-ovna’, or anything else of the like.  Lastly, there is ‘Baumana’, from the fact that daughters have an additional letter ‘a’ appended to their surnames,” she explained.  “In summary, I dislike the name ‘Anastasia’ not because is it Russian, but because I detest its association with the Tsarist Regime,” she explained further.

“But now I have strayed much too far away from the topic about which I had intended to speak to you.  What sort of progress have you made on falling asleep with your head under your blanket?  You will need to get used to that, because starting Monday March 25^(th), you will have to be both asleep AND have your entire body under your blanket by 5 AM.  I did warn you of that, did I not?” she asked.

“Yeah, I remember you talking about that.  But I’ll be honest, I haven’t made much progress,” I confessed.

“Do you have an air vent in your room?  It would be quite good if you had a consistent flow of less contaminated air entering from underneath your blanket,” she said.

“Yeah, I remember you talking about that.  But I don’t really know if it’d help.  After all, I think my main problem is with the fact that I’ve never fallen asleep like that before, so I don’t really know how to start,” I said.

“Zat is vhy iz so important zat you get practice before start of Stage Sree,” she said.  “I don’t know if I would truly consider it ‘natural’, per se, but damn do I love putting on a Russian accent while under the influence of vodka,” she said, grinning.  “I feel so much more connected to my nation of birth,” she said.  “It likely isn’t even a particularly good accent, at that.  My parents would be humiliated.  But I find it rather enjoyable, regardless.  That is of course why I did not press the issue of your pronunciation when I taught you that Russian saying from before.  I only insisted that you try it.  I have spent the vast majority of my life in the United States.  My pronunciation is also liable to be a bit off,” she explained.

“Well, I guess going back to your question about air vents, I do have one in my room, but it’d be pretty difficult to get my bed situated right to the point where it’d be blowing under my blanket,” I said.

“Why is that?” she asked.  “What about it is so difficult?”

“Well, for one thing, my bed’s pretty heavy, and then there’s the fact that it’s pretty far away, so I’d have to carry it a pretty long way.  And plus, I would have to turn it around a bit to get it aligned with the vent,” I explained.

“Then you should make an effort to increase your upper-body strength over the course of the next three weeks,” she said.  “If it is too difficult to do all at once, then make incremental progress day by day.”

“But won’t my parents think it’s weird that my bed is moving around like that from one day to the next?”

“Meh, Probably,” she replied.

“Okay, cool.  So, what do I say when they ask?” I asked.

“This is not a problem you will have to encounter if you simply move it there all at once,” she said.

“Uh, yeah it is.  My parents are gonna see that my bed somehow got transported all the way across my room and then probably ask what that’s all about,” I said.

“Not if you return it to its original position before they wake you up,” she said.

“Cool.  So I’m just gonna have to lug my heavy-ass bed all the way across the room to go to bed, and then haul the damn thing all the way back before morning, just to avoid getting my parents’ attention,” I responded.

“That is one way to do it, yes.  Or you could simply tell your parents that you would rather have your bed near the air vent,” she said.  “They likely won’t ask further questions.  And even if they do, you could simply tell them that you enjoy the breeze,” she said.

“But that’s still gonna require me to move my bed all the way over to the other side of the room in one night,” I complained.

“And?  You have the entire night to accomplish that.  Take breaks throughout the night, if you must.  This is all perfectly doable.  Your mind has an astounding capacity to turn the possible into the impossible, Morgan,” she said.

“Ugh.  Fine.  I guess when you put it like that, I could MAYBE pull it off,” I conceded.

“Good.  Now then, back to Sleep Points.  You should know that I will now require Sleep Points just to make it through the night.  If I spend them only on keeping myself alive from one night to the next then, given the amount I have right now, I should make it to make it to late-January 2022.  This is why I am so reticent to continuously supply you with further sleeping aids:  it will ultimately cut into the number of nights I have left.  I would rather not give up what little time I have left if I do not have to,” she said.

“There are thirteen stages to Sleep Points and I am on the Thirteenth.  If you think the first two stages have been taxing, then you should know that you have seen hardly anything at all as of yet.  Now go.  It is now 2:50.  You should leave if you know what is good for you.  Feel free to go home.  Or to come back for another hour.  Or two.  I will welcome you all the same,” she said.  And with that, I headed on out. 

Only to find none other than Brian Truman waiting for me on the other side of the door.  And yeah.  He didn’t look super jazzed to see me.  He didn’t look like himself at all.  His hair had fallen out.  His eyes had so many revolting bags around them that I was surprised he could even see.  He had such a deranged and twisted look about him too.  He had the same twisted grin that The Sandman did Wednesday night when I only had about 6 hours left to go to sleep. 

“Well, well, well.  Livingston told me I’d find you here.  And here I was thinkin’ he was fulla shit like usual.”  I wasn’t quite sure what kind of sleep-deprived cryptid he had turned into, but I didn’t wanna stick around to find out.  Not that I had much of a choice.  He was completely blocking my way out.
