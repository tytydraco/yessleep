I found the following set of papers on October 1^(st) of last year. It was found in an old box, down in a basement holding one of the archive stacks of the Historical Society of Salem. It tells an incredible tale…if you believe it. And you should; I tell you, the reader, you should. This actually happened. No question in my mind. At all.

I now present the manuscript in full:

I’m writing this down to communicate what happened to me to…well, I don’t really know who should see this. Or what they can do about it. They really can’t do anything about it. Nothing. Not a thing. It depresses me to write that. It’s…it’s the finality of it all. The destiny. I am destined to suffer from this point on.

It all started back in October 2024. I was in Salem with some friends. We hit up a few places to have some fun. I was a Salem University student, happily studying physics (can that subject help me now?), and I wanted to enjoy the Witch City as Halloween started to descend upon the place. In truth, Halloween sort of lingers all year round, but one could arguably state it begins its approach sometime in the summer, maybe mid-June, and then is it all-out in full around mid-September. Then the last three or so weekends before the actual holiday, it’s climax upon climax upon…you get the picture.

Too bad I didn’t get the picture about what I was doing on that night…

Sorry. I’m getting to it…

So, anyway, my friends and I hit Rockafellas and O’Neils and the like. We did the Count Orlok Nightmare’s Gallery and the Halloween Museum. We even did the Chamber of Terrors…yes, believe me, that is the most frightening haunted house in the city; seriously, if you don’t want to be terrified and just want a casual evening, then skip it. But we were all tough guys, we could take it!

The evening was winding down. I had had a few drinks, but I wasn’t intoxicated, I really wasn’t, this has nothing to do with drunkenness, with too much imbibing…I was just in a goofy, young mood I guess. And younger than my young age already, to boot. College students should know better, after all.

Anyway…I suggested we do something more fun than touristy stuff and eating appetizers and drinking beer. I said…let’s take one of those tours, the walking tours. Someone said they didn’t want to spend the money on one, maybe another time; someone else said they already started for the evening.

I said: Let’s join one.

They all looked at each other, not understanding.

Let’s not pay, I explained…let’s just filter in with the crowd.

Well, ah, not supposed to do that…

Sure. You’re not. So what…

Um…they rejected my proposal.

I was offended. I let them know. Words, after they were traded like stocks on an exchange, led to them going home for the evening and me walking off into the nighttime of Salem. I was pissed. Not pissed as in the Anglo definition of pissed…although I was a little that, too. Pissed as in the American idiom…pissed off. Angry. Pissed as in…

I’m going to do it anyway.

I saw one of the tours. It was near the Old Burying Point. The tour guide with their amplification bellowed out facts and stories about how haunted the place was. I walked near it. I was a little nervous but, I ended up doing what I said I wanted to do…

I filtered in.

One person next to me saw what it was I was doing. She whispered to me.

Come on, you can’t do that, for paying customers only…

Okay Karen, I said.

Excuse me?

Shut up, Karen.

The boyfriend piped up. I called him Kevin immediately.

The tour guide with the olden hat upon his head noticed what was happening. He looked at me and Karen and Kevin. But he really was only looking at me.

Sir, I don’t recall you –

I interrupted him with slurred, surly speech. He quieted. Ignored me for the rest of the walking tour. I wasn’t worth the hassle, apparently, and there was no Salem PD handy anyway.

I walked on, stealing the tour…yes, stealing the tour, until the very end. When everyone had congratulated the guide on a most wonderful, educational experience and finished their gratuity-giving, I went up to him. He just stared at me. Yeah, I began, sorry and all; just was walking the night here in Salem and couldn’t help but be attracted to your group and the fun you guys were having. As expected, the rejoinder: you could have paid like everyone else. Yeah, I know, but it was too late for that. There were always other nights; especially this month. Yeah, true, I guess, but anyway, I’ve got to be going. He then said something…in Latin, I think it was? Maybe some of it was Latin? Some of it maybe another language? And I swear, I don’t know why I thought this, but maybe some of it was in HP…as in Howard Philips, if you get my meaning…

I started…I started to feel…weird…even thinking about it now, recalling the feeling, I’m feeling…weird, halting, dizzy…as I write this out. My hand is hurting as I dip this ridiculous bird feather into this stupid bottle of squid ink, or whatever it is. The world felt blurry around me, things started to spin and get hot…friction-hot…and then…

I found myself in a barn that reminded me of the Salem Pioneer Village, I think it’s called. Was Hocus Pocus filmed there, at least a scene of it? Whatever.

I’ll spare you the details. Mostly I spare them because I’m tired and due to be pressed to death a couple hours from now. My last request was for a writing instrument and a tablet to set down my tale. And pass them along to…whom? Who will be the keeper of my notes, my brief memoir at the end? And for what reason? To warn them of a tour guide in Salem who, on the Saturday of the third weekend of October 2024, a guide who presumably practiced actual witchcraft, punished me for stealing a walking tour by sending me back in time to the actual witch hysteria so that I may be caught up in it and become accused and executed, all of it? Who is going to think this memorialization of such will be considered anything but a hoax? A joke not written by someone from history but by a source more modern in nature? Come on, I know the drill as well as anyone else.

Yet I do it anyway. To pass the time. To keep my mind off the horror which will befall me before I know it.

But I can tell you this. I know now there has to be an afterlife (amongst other things out there). I shall pick a part of the city I once studied and played in and haunt it for all its worth…

\*\*\*

There. There is the manuscript I found. What a wild tale, huh? I actually checked with someone down at the university, a history professor who specialized in the witch hysteria. She told me two interesting things:

1 She had never heard or read anything about this manuscript, and knew of no one who did…

2 There reportedly had been strange sightings in Pioneer Village of a person in their 20s (read: college-age) walking around seemingly in a fog; supposedly some people claim they actually heard him ask aloud if anyone could hear him, have they seen his story, and can they help him get away…

The professor stated that some of the walking tours told this story, and that it started showing up the last several years.

Well, let me tell you, here’s what I did.

Remember what I said at the beginning…I found the story October 1^(st) of last year. That would be 2023. It was now 2024.

I decided to find out if this was true or not. I made a guess as to where the narrator would have been on that particular Saturday he mentioned. And guess what…

I did find him.

I actually saw him saunter up and filter in.

I then did the same thing.

After the Karen/Kevin-insult exchange, I went up to him. I told him, he needs to leave. Now. I showed him the manuscript. He said it did look a little like his writing. As if he did it by candlelight. I informed him, he probably did do it by that light source. He glanced through it, but I gave him the summary. The tour guide saw us, and others stared at us, perhaps thinking this was part of a show. I asked him to quiet down. He complied. The tour began to walk off. We followed along…well, I followed along only because he refused to comply on that point, he said he wanted to see this to the end.

The tour guide came up to us. The kid started to mouth off. I started apologizing for his behavior and offered to pay for both of us. The guide just smiled. And then he spoke…

And now I hope my set of papers is found so someone may warn me as well…

\*\*\*

I found the above in an old antique bookstore in Salem. I found the story of these two hapless narrators so fascinating that I had to scan it and upload it to my favorite Reddit forum.

And you know what? Yes, it’s a few days out before the identified date. I’ll be heading to Salem with my partner to investigate this for our paranormal YouTube channel. We intend on trying to track down the mentioned professor at Salem State University. Probably won’t find any of them. We’re skeptics, after all. But we do want to believe, so we won’t leave any stone unturned.

I’ll let you know what I and my partner find out…check out our channel, and please, like and subscribe, won’t you?...
