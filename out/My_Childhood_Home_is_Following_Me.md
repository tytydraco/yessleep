I know it sounds crazy. Trust me, I would think it was crazy if I heard it from anyone else. I almost hope that I’m crazy. Maybe everything has been some massive hallucination and I’m actually in some sterile, white room muttering to myself. That’s less scary than the idea that all of this is actually happening. That somehow a house has been following my entire life.

But I digress. I’m not asking you to believe me. I’ve talked to therapists, tried medication, nothing seems to work. If anyone on this site has any ideas, anything at all, even some mental disorder I haven’t thought of yet, please let me know! I’ll try to recount everything as best I can, but you’ll have to excuse some gaps in my memory.

The house is an ugly old thing with peeling yellow paint, and a rotted out front porch that desperately needs to be replaced. The whole thing leans slightly to the left–bad foundation, Dad always said–and in the summer skunks and racoons make nests for themselves under the porch. How the place didn’t end up condemned is beyond me, but Mom and Dad always did their best to make it a home for me and my baby brother, Ethan. 

Needless to say, everyone was excited to start making plans to move. Mom and Dad had finally scraped together enough money to get a better place, something more suitable to raising a family.

I was seven at the time and obviously wasn’t included in the house-hunting part of the planning, so you can imagine my confusion when, after a long, boring flight, and then a long, boring drive, we pulled up to the exact same house we had supposedly left behind.

“Why are we back home?” I remember asking.

“That’s right, this is our new home!” Mom said. I had a pretty bad speech impediment when I was little so it’s not impossible that she misunderstood me, but at the time it was more than my seven-year-old, jet-lagged brain could handle. I remember sobbing uncontrollably while my parents walked around the house, ‘ooh-ing’ and ‘ahh-ing’ like they had never seen it before. 

But it was the same house. It didn’t just look the same, it was the same. The stairs to the basement were just inside the front door–one wrong step and you’d fall–the walls were painted the exact same shade of moldy green with chips and cracks in the exact same places. All of the rooms were the same shape and size and in the same places. The lamp fixtures were the same. The baseboards were the same. There was even the black scuff mark in the kitchen floor tile from when I wore my roller blades inside. 

But nothing I said would convince my parents. So I moved back into my old room and for the next three years we lived in the same house in a different town, in a different state. 

Then we decided to move again, this time because Dad got a job offer a few towns over. So, before I knew it, we were packing up, I was saying goodbye to my friends, and we were going somewhere new.

Or we were supposed to.

My stomach sank when we pulled up the driveway and I saw the house. Same peeling yellow paint, same rotted porch that should have collapsed years ago, same ratty old rosebush by the front gate. 

This time I was older and mostly over my speech impediment so I was better able to voice my confusion to my parents. I pointed out the chip in the wall that looked like a duck, the marker lines on the doorway that they had used to measure my height, the light in the bathroom that always flickered no matter what Dad did to fix it.

It all fell on deaf ears. Mom and Dad were smitten with the house all over again no matter what I did or said to make them understand. 

“Don’t be silly, Amy,” Mom said, “our old house didn’t have–” she trailed off and waved her hand around vaguely, searching but unable to find anything to point out.

Because there wasn’t anything different. Because it was the same house. 

Once again I moved back into my old room and Mom and Dad unpacked everything into the exact same places they had been before we moved. 

I didn’t sleep well that night. I lay awake and stared at the same ceiling I had been looking at for ten years and wondered if I was crazy. After all, I was the only one who thought the house was the same. Little Ethan didn’t seem to notice that anything was off. Sure, he was only three, but I was only seven when I first noticed it. Would I have noticed when I was Ethan’s age?

Thinking in circles was making me thirsty and I got up to get a glass of water. I had all of the squeaky floorboards memorized so I could slip down the hallway without a sound, but when I reached the bathroom door I saw something out of the corner of my eye, coming from the living room. A little flash, like someone had quickly hidden a flashlight.

I tiptoed to the doorway and peeked in, and I saw it. For just a moment, but plain as day. The couch was white. Our couch is ugly green and yellow plaid. The couch was different.

It only lasted for a second, barely time to blink, and then it was back to normal. But it happened. I know it did. 

“I caught you!” I yelled triumphantly, “I caught you, house! I saw you change! You can’t fool me!”

And then I was sitting in my bed. I didn’t wake up, I didn’t go back upstairs to bed. One second I was standing in the living room and then I was sitting in bed like I had never left. 

I got scared then. I remember shaking so hard my teeth were chattering and the only thing I could think of was that the house was angry with me. It was mad that I had caught it. 

I stopped trying to catch it after that. If I woke up in the middle of the night I would cover my head with the blanket and hide from the house until morning. I ended up wetting the bed a couple of times because of that, much to the dismay of my parents, but I couldn’t risk upsetting the house again. It had only put me to bed last time, but who knew what it would do if it happened again?

Eventually, as I got older, I managed to convince myself that it had been a dream. What else could it be? Just the overactive imagination of a tired little girl in a new house. Because it had to be a new house, it was just similar to the old one, that was all. 

Fast-forward to now and the reason why I’m writing this down. I just moved into my own place. I got a job a state away and found a place nearby that I could–miraculously–afford. 

I’m sure you can see where this is going, and you’re right. When I pulled up the driveway there was the same house looking back at me, peeling yellow paint, rotten porch and all. 

I sent a panicked text to Mom, asking her to send me a picture of their house. A few painful minutes later I got a picture and a concerned question in reply.

The same house. How could the same house be in two places at the same time?! I hadn’t looked like that when I saw it online while I was house-hunting, right? But the more I thought about it the more I realized…I don’t remember house hunting. And once I realized that the more holes I find in my memories. I know that I went to school but I have no memories of it; no friends, no teacher’s names, nothing. If you asked me if I dated anyone in highschool I would say yes, because I know I did, but if I couldn’t tell you who they were, what they looked like, or what we did.

I have an awareness of doing things, but if I have to think any deeper on anything more than whether or not something happened it’s a blank. Like in movies when there’s a scene change and you know something happened off camera but you didn’t actually see what it was. 

Did any of those things actually happen? Did I go to school? Did I have friends? A boyfriend? 

I’m sitting in bed right now, the only light is the glow of my phone screen, and I can feel the house watching me. I think it knows.

Please, if you have any idea what might be going on, please tell me! I feel like I’m going crazy. Am I crazy?
