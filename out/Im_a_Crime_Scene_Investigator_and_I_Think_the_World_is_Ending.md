I am a crime scene investigator at a police station in California. My team was piecing together a suspicious situation involving a dead body that was reported to have appeared out of thin air and falling onto a woman's car as she was commuting on US Route 101. In one of the hands of the corpse was a recording device. What I heard on it still baffles me. I have heard many recordings and similar things of that nature and I cannot explain what I listened to on this device. I have listened to insane criminals and schizophrenics. I have not listened to something like this before and thought it was true, but I really can't explain it. Here’s the transcript of the recordings on the device that I swiped from our databases:



EVIDENCE: Verbatim Transcript of Recording Device


[Audio Transcribed: 18 January 2020]


October 27th 2016


My name is Howard [REDACTED]. I just bought this recording device because for a little while now I have been working on a project which I am extremely lucky to have partaken in. 

A team of archeologists have made a huge discovery on the shore of the Pacific Ocean. I volunteered to help on their project without receiving pay just so I can see firsthand what they have found. My first day is tomorrow, I will report afterwards.


October 28th 2016


First day on the job yielded exciting discoveries already. The project is a far greater discovery than anticipated. Let me explain. About two weeks ago, a massive earthquake shook the coast of [REDACTED] California. A fissure opened in a cliff face next to the ocean and revealed a chapter of our past that has been forgotten by time. Most of my coworkers are baffled as to how any of the things that they have discovered made their way into this cave because there was no entrance other than the one that just appeared. Inside relics of the past are plentiful with pots and different metal medallions and such. But that isn’t the best part. 

These findings date back two thousand years or so before the human race was known to have used these items. Stone carvings and pedestals sit expertly designed in their ornate stature. Though it was exhilarating finding all these new yet old things, there was an odd aura inside the “room”. The room resembled a cave more than anything. Everyone else either didn’t feel it or just ignored it. I worked but I was uneasy, something is off about this place.


October 31st 2016


It’s Halloween today… How fitting. We worked dusting off new findings but one worker stumbled out from behind a pillar, face white. I swear his eyes looked as if they were a window to somewhere else. They were voids in his pupils and irises. Surely I was seeing things, right? Shaking, he walked to the center of the room. My colleague, Susan, got up and asked, “Hey, are you okay?” He looked in her face and started to pull something from his side. His hand snapped up to the side of his head and there was a loud bang. He crumpled to the floor, his head spilling its contents on the cave floor. The gun clattered into his own pooling blood. Screaming ensued by a majority of the archeologists. Before I knew it the police were there taping off the scene with yellow and ushering us away before a body bag was hauled out. I went home before the day was half over, and now I don’t feel like eating. I might just try to sleep.


November 1st 2016 


It took hours to get to sleep last night, the image of the man’s open head haunted each and every thought of mine. I slowly started to drift off and as I slipped into unconsciousness I began to dream. I wish I hadn’t gone to sleep. It all felt so real. I dreamt I got up from my bed and ran barefoot 15 miles to the cave. It was raining, which drizzled into my eyes and made everything blurry. I wasn’t minding the pain of the rocks and broken glass I may have stepped in along the way. When I got to the cave I tore the yellow tape off the entrance and stepped right behind the pillar that the man came from behind before he shot himself. I knelt to the base of the pillar and saw a small symbol on a circular carving in the side of the pillar. I pushed it inwards and it slowly sank inside. 

A small rectangle at the base of the pillar revealed a curious artifact. It was made of a dark bronze-like metal. It was similar to a modern rubiks cube. But when the sides were turned the opposite side turned as well. I then proceeded to run the 15 miles back home and put it in my credenza drawer. That is where the dream ended. I woke up much later than normal. I am now sitting on my bed, too scared to go check in the drawer to see if it actually happened. My feet are torn up. My sheets and clothes are damp. I am I don’t know if my dreams were real or not. They couldn’t be, right? 


November 2nd 2016


I hadn’t gotten out of bed yesterday. I just sat accompanied by my torturous thoughts. Today after a slightly better sleep I awoke and made my way to the credenza. My hand shook as I reached for the handle to the drawer. I hesitated for what felt like days before slowly dragging it out. Placed in the middle of the drawer, there it sat. The cube was clearer now, and random symbols were on various squares. Some sides were purely flat. At the sight of it my chest filled with dread mixed with curiosity. 

I slowly lifted it out before turning a few sides. Each twist was strangely smooth for something so ancient. As the symbols rearranged with each turn, my fingers seemed to follow a pattern that I didn’t understand myself. But as I finished, the middle square of each side sprung outwards. On the sides of those pieces was English. But English did not exist yet if the dating on all of the artifacts was correct. I couldn’t believe what was written.

    

We the disciples are one with time. We give up our lives, our souls, our human form to serve the creators. They speak to us in this shrine. Here we experience time over and over. We watch the universe die and rebirth. It is fantastical. Exquisite. Beautiful. Above we view them, the master planners. We watch as they weave the universe. We are so significantly small, yet so important in the role of everything. 


What the fuck does that mean? Is this a joke? It can't be, no one is sick enough to do that. I continued to look at the sides, there was a set of instructions. The instructions said to go to the Hand of the Ocean in order to find the shrine to the masters of our universe. I’m recording this as I am driving. I have a feeling I can’t explain that I think is leading me somewhere. I need to figure out where the Hand of the Ocean is.


November 3rd 2016 


I drove and drove and drove late into the morning. Each time I got closer the feeling’s strength wrapped around me. I no longer feel like I am in control of my own actions. I feel as though I am almost being puppeteered by some… thing. I arrived at a coastal cliff face of some beach I am unfamiliar with. As I got closer to the cliffs which were rather far from any houses or buildings I could see. As I got closer, I spotted strange claw-like appendage made out of stone reaching for the sky. It was half as tall as me. As I parked rain started to pound the Earth. I reached back and grabbed my rubber jacket before walking out, only things with me being my recorder and the cube. I grasped the cube tightly as I walked over to it. The wet earth squashed beneath me and made sucking sounds as I walked. 

Lightning started to crackle and boom. The storm got angrier with each step I took. When I got to the hand there was a square depression in the palm, almost asking for the cube to be inserted. I looked at the cube and my distorted reflection trapped in its bronze metal. I moved to put it in and the edges seemed to light up with electricity as it slid into place.

A massive hum burst from the ocean. The pulse of air made me stumble and I fell backwards into the sandy wet soil. I got to my feet, trembling. In the ocean something was making the waved ripple oddly. The ground began to shake. Like a breaching whale a massive structure glided out of the water. As it rose the cube slowly evaporated into the air as a brown mist. The wind picked up. It was chaos. Slowly from the structure a long stone pathway constructed itself. The whole thing looked natural as if the waves shaped the structure themselves. Now before me stands a structure that I can only describe as an alien. I was too far into this journey, even if I could turn back I wouldn’t. I started the long walk on the weathered bridge.

(heavy panting)

 I- I don't know where I am. I was (coughing) in the structure. Inside was a strange massive room. I hadn’t looked up yet. Oh God I wish I didn’t. I was focused on the different support beams when I looked outside one of the windows. It looked like the sky was flashing black and gray and blue. The flashing got faster and faster. 

(sobbing) 

There was a ring of light in the sky that wobbled faster and faster. Until the light disappeared. I stumbled back in fear and then became aware of the support beams on the walls. Each one was different. I don’t know how I hadn’t noticed before. I had just been looking at them. The first one I saw was covered in eyes.

(more sobbing) 

They were all watching me. As I looked at the others they all were different. If I looked at the one covered in nerves my body would begin to tingle and I felt sensations I didn’t know. The one that had the worst effects though. The heart. The beating heart. When I looked at it I had discovered a new sense which I can only describe as the sense of the outside world. After I looked I could feel an energy around me like no other. It was drawing my eyes… Upward.

(screams) 

On the ceiling there was a tear. A rip in reality. I could see the strands of the universe. It could have been considered beautiful, a painting of everything that has and will happen. It wasn’t complete. As my eyes slid across the ceiling which took almost an infinite amount of time I saw it. The thing weaving the universe. 

(more anguished cries) 

It was infinite. I can’t even find the words to describe it. Its fingers split apart into so many others like the branches of a tree. It had trillions of arms. When I saw its body there was no beginning or end of it. Before I knew it I was levitating off the ground. I had unknowingly stepped over an artifact I had missed. I was shot faster than humanly possible into the abyss where the universe was not yet constructed. The things I saw were impossible to conjure up in imagination. How could I be seeing these things? How is my mind not fractured into billions of pieces? I wish it were.

(more crying) 

I’m just sitting on desolate rock floating about in the nothingness now. 


Date: Unknown


I can feel something behind my eyes. It shouldn’t be there. It crawled in at some point, probably when I looked at the heart. 

(laughs) 

I have been sitting here for so long, I don’t even know how long it has been. The thing behind my eyes. 

(giggles and inhales sharply)

It tickles. At first it itched and I tried to get it out, but now I don’t want it out. It's a part of me I see a cave on this rock. I want to see it. Maybe there’s food inside. I am awfully hungry. 


Date: Unknown


When I went into the cave there was a strange room with a table. On it sat many strange geometric shapes and a leather mat with symbols on it. I was examining the curious objects when behind me I heard shuffling footsteps. I whipped around to see a cloaked figure. The cloth he or she was wearing was a shimmering blue-green. They were shorter than me, but still quite ominous. In my crazed state I asked them if they knew where I could find some grub. They revealed their gloved hands and removed one of them. Before I could react they touched my forehead. 

Immediately the broken pieces of my mind started to fit together. I had no clue before how broken it was. Slowly the horror and disgust I felt returned. The figure pulled their fingers away and I ducked over and let the contents of my stomach spill. Most of the vomit was acid which left my mouth tasting vile. Then my hand was grabbed and the figure led me to the table. I could barely utter any words. All I managed to get out of my mouth was a question. I asked what this all was. Then the figure spoke. They said that there was only one way for me to know. Their voice wasn’t discernibly male or female and the look of their hand could have been from a person of either gender. They told me that I had to make a choice. 

They walked me out of the cave and something new stood before me. There were two doorways, one with an eye above it and the other with a heart on it. The figure said one will let me know the truth of everything happening here and the other will let me leave. They let go of my hand and stepped backwards before seeming to slide into the floor. I looked at either door. I wanted to leave but which would let me go? The heart in the first structure was something that lifted the curtain that veiled anything that my mind wasn't supposed to comprehend. That had to be the wrong door. I walked through the one with the eye above it. And I found myself standing on a cliff. Off the edge of the cliff it seemed to go miles down. I am sitting here now recording this, I do not know if I made the correct decision. I can only hope.


Date: Unknown


I- I am so sorry. I didn’t know what I was doing. I wanted to die and I didn’t mean to, or didn't want to.

(Sniffles)

I think I just ended the world. The things, I could hardly put into words, they appeared and they said there was only one way for me to escape an eternity of pure mental torture. While they spoke the cliff I was on was encircled in a massive funnel of cosmic clouds. Above an object slowly descended. When it got lower I could tell what it was. It was massive. A block the size of a world itself floated down and sitting upon it was a creature that was hardly able to be rationalized. Its body was easy to look at. It was oval shaped with two extremely long arms which were connected to its lower body and folded above. Its hands rested on the edge of the object. It had two other appendages which reminded me of the pedipalps of a spider which twitched and spasmed. The top of its oval shaped body was a tangle of tree branch-like antennae. The part that was unable to be described was its eye. Oh it was awful. The eye was like a hole through its body. It spewed a primordial energy like the ejection beams of a black hole. When I looked inside I could only see a concoction of pure knowledge if that makes any sense at all. It looked deep into me, and spoke. It wasn’t words that it spoke. It was more of a- an injection into my mind. 

(wet sniffle)

It said that I have to choose. Either I can die or I can stay and learn and transcend my original body. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so bad. My head is in such pain. The being said that if I choose to die then the universe would have to be destroyed. Destroyed because the concept of these creatures wasn’t meant to be shared with any human.  Isn’t meant for human interpretation.

(sobs)

I told it that I want to die. I am so so sorry. I asked that my body at least be found. This is my last recording, I will die in a few moments. You have maybe a few years before everything collapses in on itself. I just couldn’t bear to live with these horrible images ingrained in my mind. If you ever find this recording, tell my family. My parents' names are Richard [REDACTED] and Martha [REDACTED]. Tell them that I will always l-

Three years after his disappearance his body was discovered on US Route 101, 2 miles North of Port Orford.)




I have just shared this with you today after leaving it be for nearly two years after the case was ruled a suicide. It's sat in the back of my mind and I couldn’t stand the constant nagging that I should say something to the world. If it is true, I can only hope that our extinction is quick.
