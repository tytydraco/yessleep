I had this little rash on my arm. It itched like crazy, and I kept scratching it. I meant to clean it and get some cream or see a doctor or one of the millions of responsible adult things you do with things like this, but I didn't. I kept scratching it.

I scratched it until it bled. I scratched it until it became a little hole in my arm. I scratched as it spread up my arm. Maybe I needed a shot. Perhaps it was a bacterial infection, and I needed some antibiotics. Either way, I didn't do any of that. I just kept scratching.

I kept a little nail brush with me to clean the blood out of my nails from the constant scratching. I wore a jacket in warm weather, so I wouldn't bleed everywhere. When the jacket sleeve became crusty with blood, I should have probably gotten a chunk of my skin removed or a skin graft. I should have probably gotten my arm amputated, but I didn't. I kept scratching. 

I scratched until my arm was numb, and I couldn't even feel it. I knew it itched, though. I could look down at the purple and green skin and layers of orange puss and knew it was itchy. The way the skin peeled back and the crusty way it tried to scab. I knew it was itchy, even if I couldn't feel it anymore. 

It's a lot harder to type with one hand, but I really can't feel this infected crusty limb attached to my shoulder. I had to start wearing an air freshener around my neck to mask the smell. It's pretty bad. Who died? Are you okay? Should I call someone? Probably, maybe, most definitely. 

It started to creep up my neck. That itchy, scratchy tingle. I could feel it going for my cheek. I couldn't stand it. I rubbed my face on the collar of my stinky, crusty jacket to make it go away. Maybe some vitamins would have done the trick. Or an essential oil. I hear alkaline water is a lifesaver. It's probably too late for that, anyway. 

When it got hard to see the screen to write this, I should have gone to the eye doctor to see what this infection was. I tried blinking it out, but it kept itching. I scrubbed the eyelid with my blood-stained, yellowed nail brush, but it only bothered me.

Even if it feels good at the time, never scratch your eye with a fork. 

If I wasn't so lazy, I could have gotten up and grabbed some eye drops. Or a hot compress would have helped. But I didn't do any of that. I kept on keeping on.

My scalp is drying out. My hand comes back with clumps of hair after I try to stop the itching. Ugh. I think I'm dying. I don't know what this infection is, but it's getting worse. I don't know how much worse it'll get, but I feel like I'm losing my mind. I should post this in a medical sub or telemed. I should email my doctor, but I'm not. I'm sharing it with you instead.
