It’s watching me as I write this.

I can’t see it, but I sure can feel its presence lurking behind me, just barely out of reach of my peripheral vision. That’s how it operates, and if it is trying to push me closer and closer to insanity, then that's how it is succeeding at its purpose. Despite the fact that as far as my visual senses are aware there is nothing amiss, every other bodily cue that immense and untold danger is merely inches away from me is firing on all cylinders. The hairs along the back of my neck are raised, the skin that they cling to tingling as I involuntarily shiver upon daring to imagine what might be in the room with me. Every sound that occurs both inside and outside the room seems to be amplified to the maximum, even my short breaths and the steady beats of my heart sounding like I’ve abandoned all semblance of stealth.

Sweat begins to formulate around my shoulders and legs as the temperature of my surroundings seems to steadily crawl higher. My chest is spreading a panicked sensation throughout the rest of my body that results in steadily increasing paralysis. My limbs feel heavy, my head feels glued to this angle. All logic is abandoned as before I even realize it, I’ve convinced myself that if only I remain utterly still and fixated on the glow of my laptop whatever entities that exist within the fabric of the shadows of my bedroom won’t be compelled to harm me.

I realize this sounds like I stayed up a bit too late, listening to a scary story while the dark of the night is draped over my surroundings, the perfect kind of environment for the ever-present human imagination to let loose and convince oneself that it is in immediate and mortal danger. And honestly, if that is indeed the assumption you have come to, to be perfectly fair the feelings that are currently living within me are not at all far off from the ones that that type of scenario would induce. After all, as I described earlier, there is no physical proof that I’m not alone in my bedroom, psyching myself out and nothing more. But see, it’s not just the body’s natural way of sending danger signals that has thrust me into the depths of this near-debilitating paranoia.

Whatever is watching me, it has made communication, and it knows exactly how I’m going to die. That’s why, despite sheer terror threatening to overwhelm my ability to function entirely, I feel I need to get this written down and out there. Should I go missing, or be found horribly disfigured, or discover whatever else that might await me in the near future, I want this account to serve as my last words, both to my family and to the universe itself. To anyone that cares for me that might be reading this, let this serve as your closure if my death provided none.

Upon re-reading what I’ve written thus far, I feel as though I’m getting into this too fast. And to be completely honest, between the prior paragraph and this one, I’ve calmed down a bit. It felt like I was waging war against the demons of hell themselves to gather enough courage to rise from my seat, turn around to face the backside of my room, and make my way to the bathroom. But, ultimately, the urge to relieve my bladder overpowered my fear of the forces at play around me... well, that, and the fact that nothing had happened to me a few minutes into writing this. I half-expected that the being would be reading this over my shoulder and make a move against me as a result. Due to the contents of my writing triggering nothing out of the ordinary and my intense feelings of panic slowly dissipating, I was able to convince myself that it wouldn’t be immediately dangerous to try moving around for the first time in what felt like hours.

Thankfully, my judgment was right. I survived the few heart-stopping seconds that it took to get to my light switch as well as the death-defying trip to the bathroom and back. I have now returned to my trusty gaming chair, sitting in front of my desk with every light source in the room proudly turned on and the light-blue of my walls comforting me. I no longer feel a presence with me, and as such, I am free to write more fluidly. So, to get back to the intended point of this section, I feel it is best that I backtrack a bit and do my best to explain what exactly has been plaguing me these past couple of days. Even when the paranoia subsides, I am still aware that what I can only describe as my soul is sending me a subtle message, one that proclaims that my time is growing short. I am by no means ready to die, nor do I have the courage to face my death with dignity. But alas, reality is reality whether I have accepted it or not.

All this being said, I feel it is necessary to include the briefest of summaries concerning my lifetime within this digital message in a bottle that I’ve decided to create. Both so that perhaps you can better understand my state of mind, and so that I too can better analyze it. I’ve always learned about the world around me best through the written word, after all.

My name is William, and I’m currently a nineteen-year-old college student majoring in English. I’ve been warned about the job market at the end of the road I’ve decided my higher education to go down numerous times, but I’ve decided I can’t ignore my love of writing for something as materialistic as more ambitious money-making opportunities. Language, writing, literature, all of that has been with me for as long as I can remember. It was as though I was born with a love for the craft when it came to anything contained within those subjects, specifically the art of storytelling.

As you might imagine, a life of reading and fantasizing about becoming a published author myself resulted in an introverted nature building up within me. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I’m socially inept, but I often find myself with a strong lack of desire to interact with my peers, this frequent sentiment of mine mostly starting in high school and continuing to persevere in college now as well. I’m not without friends, but I don’t go out of my way to make new ones or even necessarily maintain the relationships that I consider myself to have. In a similar vein, I would certainly love to have a girlfriend, but I just can’t seem to muster up the willpower to engage in the things that might help me find one.

My sister, Anya, is the exact opposite of me in many ways, all of them beneficial to her in my view. She’s a few years younger than me, fourteen and in the midst of her freshman year of high school, but even so, I can’t quite remember living without her. For all the trouble I may have connecting with people elsewhere, I’ve always felt a strong bond with my sister. She was always on the more mature side for her age, and as such, she could easily keep up with the level of conversation I enjoyed. She was incredibly sociable, effortlessly attaining popularity both at school and the numerous extracurricular activities she enjoyed. Not only did she possess the qualities I lacked, which in of itself I found to be admirable, but she seemed to be inclined towards a virtuous nature as well; since a young age, she has been obsessed with helping out anything and anyone she could, whether it be animals, children, or adults.

Currently, she claims to aspire to be some sort of doctor and manages to excel academically despite the business of her social life. She too remains single, but for entirely different reasons than me. Anya has repeatedly rejected boys due to their ‘immaturity.’ Hopefully, she maintains her high dating standards as she gets older. In any case, I have more confidence in her future than anyone else I’ve met. Anya will undoubtedly go on to succeed in her personal life and contribute in very tangible ways to making the world a better place.

I just wish I harbored the same strength of confidence towards myself.

I would say my parents are equally supportive of the both of us, although I am certainly going to be put into a tricky position if I continue to neglect finding some sort of job to help bring home more household income, especially with my college bills piling up... but, realistically, if the encounter with the being outside my window is indeed meant to be a sign or some sort of premonition, I likely won’t get the chance to do that.

A chill just ran up my spine upon writing that. I admittedly have been dreading to get back to the reason I’m writing this in the first place. As is usually the case, the therapeutic powers of writing had succeeded in momentarily soothing over my fear of what’s to come, or I guess, what might be in here with me at this very moment. It’s fun to ignore reality, even if just for a little bit. I enjoy the escape even under normal circumstances, but now that the possibility that I might be leaving my sister and my parents behind at any moment is very real... acknowledging the present moment is more terrifying than ever.

In the spirit of acknowledging reality, I suppose there are those out there facing grimmer fates than me at this very moment, so it’s only fair that I come to terms with mine. The creeping paralysis is once again washing over me as I’m mentally recalling the events of the past few hours, but I’m going to resist the urge to remain frozen entirely until I manage to finish this account. All the lights are on, the window blinds are closed, and at least to the naked eye, there is nothing else in the room with me. So, here we go. This is what I encountered outside my window and why I’m sure my death is imminent.

It’s weird to think about now, but merely hours ago this had been a regular Friday night. I drove home from campus (my college was located only an hour away from my home, so I always returned on weekends), and had a nice dinner with the family. Afterwards, I played one of my favorite games with my sister: relentlessly making fun of whatever teeny-bopper drama she was watching before bed. After everyone else turned in for the evening, I began my nightly ritual. I’m never quite ready to sleep at the 10 or 11PM timeframe that my family typically grows tired at, and as such, I enjoy being the only one awake in the house for a couple of hours, spending this ‘overtime’ gaming, as there usually isn’t much other time in the day for it. Adhering to my typical pattern when staying at my home, I set up my gaming laptop on the giant wooden desk that dominated the back half of my room, looking forward to advancing through the story of the current fantasy RPG I was obsessed with.

Before I loaded in, a strange, lonely feeling washed over me as I realized the only light source in the room was the faint glow of my computer screen. My room wasn’t that big, but it was enough so that when shadows draped over most of it there was certainly a foreboding thickness in the air. At least, that’s what I’ve begun to think. The only real objects in my room besides my book-crowded desk were the small twin bed behind me, and the bookshelf placed to the far left. Immediately beside my desk was the door to my closet, always remaining closed during the nighttime hours as per tradition since I was young. Even when you don’t feel like you’re being haunted by an ethereal being, opening a closet door in the dark of night has an inherent spookiness to it.

I hadn’t yet put on my headphones, so I sat there in silence for a moment, soaking in the heavy weight of loneliness that had descended upon me out of nowhere. As a writer, I've always tried to face emotions head-on, so that I could better understand them when it was time to write a character that was going through something similar. I find fulfillment in absorbing as much of the raw emotion as I can, feeling it to its full extent then articulating exactly what it felt like within my mind later on. This time, though, the more I focused on the exact nature of being alone, of the darkness and shadows that swathed my room, the more sinister everything around me began to feel. Gradually, I went from being safe and tucked away in my childhood bedroom, to being surrounded by avenues of attack from the most malicious of unseen entities.

I let my mind spiral far enough that it was difficult to regain control, to ground myself with logic and reason. My closet was no longer a wardrobe, it was the home of a creature waiting to pounce; the corners of the room were no longer divots filled with shadow, but the hiding place of demons watching my every move; the space under the bed was no longer an unkempt mess of forgotten objects, but a gateway to hell itself. Even the area under my desk that my legs occupied began to feel dubious, like slimy hands with serrated claws might grab my ankles, drag me into a cold, dark abyss.

I began to feel clammy as my mind continued to plague me with its ghoulish fantasies, when my eyes flicked past the vertically rectangular window to my right. I noticed that I hadn’t yet closed the blinds. Typically, I did so soon after the sun set, in order to prevent the cold of the glass from cooling down the room too much. Apparently, I had forgotten to close them earlier.

I instinctively went to approach the window and close the blinds when my brain all but verbally commanded me to stop. In and amongst all of the other nonsense it had fabricated about the supposed dangers of my room whilst alone in the dark, it had now become certain that indescribable danger waited just beyond the window, that if I were to get too close to it, I would provoke whatever was waiting for me outside.

Despite the fact that I didn’t have an audience to witness my childish fear of the dark, I felt embarrassed for even entertaining the possibility of any of this by squinting hard at the glass, to see if I could detect any evidence of a stranger with ill intent looking back in at me. All that I could find was the cover of night; with the clouds blotting out the moon and stars, I couldn’t even see the outline of the fence at the end of our lawn or the big tree that grew to the left side of it.

I mentally kicked myself as I forced my legs to unpeel themselves from the chair and head towards the window. All of this was stupid, and yet, my mind was able to make me practically shake with fear just by dreaming up fiction. I suppose that may be a drawback of possessing a vivid imagination.

I was admittedly feeling proud of myself for utilizing the human gift that is the ability to reason things out to calm myself down, but all of that was dashed the second I actually reached my window and had my hands on the blinds. A second wave of irrational fear slammed into me, much more violently than the first. Suddenly, I was sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that immense danger was drooling with anticipation mere inches away, the only layer of protection being the thin pane of glass that separated this room from the outside world. I roughly drew the blinds shut, leaping back into my chair as fast as I could, heart pounding.

I continued to stare at my window, now covered by deep blue shades, taking some calming breaths.  They weren’t doing much good. Somehow, I was so far down this mental rabbit hole that I continued to genuinely believe that I was surrounded by a sinister force. The more I dwelled on it, the more I became sure that this force was emanating from my window. Perhaps I had closed the blinds just in time; similar to how I used to duck under my blankets when I got scared as I child, I felt this thin veil of protection was all I needed.

That’s when I heard a tap on the glass.

Every fiber of my being must have frozen in unison at that moment. I’ve had small episodes of childish fear like this before throughout my teenage years, the window often even being a highlight of my concern, but never had anything happened to actually substantiate it. This time was different. This time, I had unmistakably heard a tapping on my glass.

It took me a moment to realize I was holding my breath, but even then, I didn’t let it go. Something was out there. I just knew it. Something was just beyond my curtains, staring at the glass, waiting to get a peek at me.

Eventually, I had to breathe, inhaling and exhaling as thinly as humanly possible, even that small action feeling as though I were taking a risk. Despite the overwhelming fear coursing through my veins, I decided I couldn’t stay in this chair, couldn’t stay facing the window like this. Ever so carefully standing back up, my legs shaking all the way, I prepared to make a dash onto my bed, formulating the quickest route to burying myself within a heap of blankets in my mind, when another tapping against the glass of the window stopped me dead in my tracks.

It was a hollow, expectant sound.

*Tap. Tap.*

My breath caught in my throat, my stomach twisted like it was on the verge of forcing me to vomit. My eyes were slowly drawn to the window, staring intently at the closed blinds despite the fact that doing so would reveal nothing about what waited for me outside.

Then it spoke.

*“William,”* I didn’t hear the voice so much as it slithered into my mind, as though my thoughts were commanded to think this specific set of words in this specific order. *“Would you be at peace with dying?”*

My paralysis broke, my brain shut down. Without thinking, I leaped onto my bed, the mattress rocking against the wall and the springs protesting the sudden crash of body weight. In a frenzy of child-like regression, I swaddled myself under my assortment of blue and gray blankets, burying my face underneath them and quivering with terror. The only thing I could think to do was fill my mind with as many other thoughts as physically possible. I frantically went through nearly every positive memory I could muster, desperately trying to force out the overwhelming panic, to deter the monster outside by refusing to acknowledge its existence.

I don’t know exactly how much time elapsed, but my guess would be it was about an hour before I dared move from the cocoon of blankets that I had constructed for myself. The glow of my laptop screen was still illuminating the part of my room near my desk and the wind outside had picked up, creating that soft howling sound against the walls.

Something had shifted in my spirit, I could just tell. While the debilitating nature of my fear had subsided, there was a much more permanent dread instilled within me.

I was confident that I was going to die soon.

Thinking about it now, whatever was waiting for me just beyond my window, had made sure to force my thoughts to give its voice a taunting edge to it. Whatever entity or creature that was, *it knows when I’m going to die.* And it surely knows that my time is going to run out soon.

As I'm finishing this up, I can say with confidence that I feel its presence behind me once again. It has come and gone so frequently over the duration of writing this that I am sorry to say I’m getting somewhat used to the feeling of existential dread. Somehow, it is able to get into my room, to stay just of my sight. I know it's there, though. If it is indeed reading this as I suspect, then it knows that I know it's there as well.

I’m not sure what’s going to happen next. I’m surprised I’ve lived this long, honestly. Perhaps it is letting me write this final testament out of courtesy. I suppose it is possible that this being only means to imply that it *knows* when I'll die... but no. Its telepathic voice was too confident, too haunting. This thing is going to kill me. I just don’t know when.

To Anya, my parents, any of my other family or friends... if you guys read this, I don’t know why or how this is happening. I love all of you, and I truly do hope that I’ll wake up tomorrow. Even if I do, I’m not sure how much longer I’ll have.

Anya, if this is the last you hear from me, I want you to know this: you truly do have the world in your grasp. If anyone can attain their dreams, if anyone can make the world a better place, it’s you.

**Update:**

The perfectionist in me decided to proofread what I thought would be my ‘final words’ before officially posting. I guess my brain really did decide to finally shut down, because I fell asleep at my desk. I’m actually writing this a few days later- as you can tell, I woke up the next morning, alive and unharmed. Well, unharmed in the physical sense. I decided against posting this originally because I was still attempting to rationalize everything, convince myself that I just had short episode of near-insanity and that I could view the events of that night as nothing more than a bizarre nightmare.

Over the past few days, I’ve quickly come to realize that reverting to the way I used to feel, how *life* itself used to feel before encountering that being, is impossible. Whatever that thing was, ever since I first encountered it that night, it hasn’t left me. I can feel it watching me at all times, even if I can’t see it. It’s hiding just out of view, leaving detection up to my ‘sixth sense,’ or whatever you want to call it. I don’t know if it is playing with me before going for the kill, or if it really is only here as a harbinger to my untimely demise at the hands of some other tragedy.

All I know is that wherever I go, it follows soon after. If I live long enough to come to any conclusions, discover anything more about my otherworldly stalker, I’ll be sure to write about it again. I don’t know when my lasts words will be written, but I want every bit of this to be documented, especially if I can find a way to prove that this thing really exists. As for now, I’m dreading more sleepless nights ahead of me.
