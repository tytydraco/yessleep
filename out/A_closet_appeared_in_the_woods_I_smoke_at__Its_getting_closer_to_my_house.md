I need someone to see this and believe me.  I have called the police multiple times, and I have had friends check it out with me, but no one will or can do anything about it.  Not now.  I’m at the end of my rope, and I just need to know it’ll all be ok.  Let me explain my situation as clearly as possible, and then perhaps someone can help me before it's too late.

I live on the outskirts of Roanoke, Virginia, just on the cusp of the Appalachian rainforest.  Like anyone lucky enough to live so close to a natural wonder, I go on weekends to camp and smoke in the forest.  After a long week of working a soul-crushing remote job doing nothing all week, the forest has been a haven for me to recharge.  This has been a part of my routine for several years now.  I go to the same abandoned campsite and stay overnight, cooking while high and loving every second I am away from it all.  I knew this spot intimately.  I knew where to get the best view, the best spot for my fire, the perfect patch of soft foliage for my sleeping bag, everything.  Never in all my years visiting this site did I notice anything peculiar or out of the ordinary, until earlier this month.  

After enjoying several rounds of campfire hot dogs and generous amounts of weed, I decided to stand on the scenic cliffside and enjoy the evening breeze.  High as a kite, like the loser I am, I stood on the precipice of the cliff, feeling the wind on my face.  When I turned around, I almost jolted right off the cliff.  Just outside the light of my fire, poking out of the treeline, was a doorway.  Its silhouette jutting out of a bush, it faced me.  

I stood petrified, convincing myself for several moments that I was high and could just be seeing things.  Bracing myself, I slowly approached the campfire, hoping that the more I stared at it, the quicker it would disperse, a simple illusion of the light on my inebriated mind.  It did not.  Fully protected in the warmth of the bonfire, I stood waiting.  For what, I have no idea.  Perhaps I hoped it would leave as easily as it came.  My anxiety, fueled by weed, began to blur my head with a suffocating dread.  

Several more minutes passed before I finally decided to investigate.  I pulled out my LED flashlight from my camping supplies and forced my feet to approach the pair of doors protruding from the bush.  The forest darkness enveloped it until I flicked my light on.  Fully exposed, I examined it from multiple feet away.  

It looked like a closet door.  The pair of simple oak doors was coated in a clean layer of white paint, unmarred by the surrounding forest.  The doorframe itself, also a white trim, twinkled with the 2 sets of bronze door hinges, pristine as the day they were made.  

The modest design was unsettlingly modern for a mountain range riddled with the bones of century-old settlements, many I passed on my weekly adventure.  An anxiety that was impossible to pin down ravaged me as I begged my body to sober up quickly.  Instead, my curiosity took over.  Rationally now, I understand that, at that moment, there was nothing inherently menacing about a pair of doors in the woods.  But if I knew then what I do now, then I never would have gone near them. 

I stepped closer, light fixated on the closet, fully expecting a beast to jump screeching out of it like some childhood nightmare.  However, only the crunch of leaves under my boots echoed through the wood, even as I placed my hand on the knob.  With a smooth click, I turned the knob, and gracefully the left door opened, without a sound.  Nothing but the treeline greeted me on the other side.  

The relief was a high in and of itself.  The tension calmed as I caught my breath.  Fear dispelled, curiosity was all that remained.  Like a dolt, I played archaeologist and spent the rest of the night examining every inch of the closet.  The bizarre appearance still tainted my mood with a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake, but it didn't stop me from running my fingers all along the doors and trim, trying to find any sign of weathering.  Still, no signs of age, let alone deterioration.  

Fully analyzed, or as well as it could be considering my current state of mind, I snuggly packed myself away into my sleeping bag, ensuring the fire was fed enough to last a couple more hours without me.  I lay, facing the closet, its presence prodding out of the bushes.  Needless to say, it took me a while to fall asleep.  It stood stoically, its mint condition paint revealed by the crackling campfire.  Sleep came, along with a sober mind that reassured me that my horrible habit wholly caused my paranoia.  It definitely was a wake-up call to reexamine my smoking.  

In the morning, I blurrily stumbled about packing my campsite, the lack of sleep weighing me down.  It stood all the while, completely revealed in the daylight.  Its immaculate condition was vibrant and visible.  With a final glance, I looked it over before shaking my head in disbelief and beginning my journey home.  Another week came and went, work hazing by and chores done here and there, and then, the weekend returned.  

After a hesitant decision, I decided I wasn’t going to let last week's abnormal visitor keep me away from my relaxing routine.  The drive to the mountain trail was… tense.  That foreboding had remained nestled in my mind, waiting for this moment to come, and it returned loudly to the forefront of my thoughts.  Reaching the parking lot, just below the trail, I took a deep breath and put the car in park, trying to will my anxiety away as a childish notion.  Unloading my pack, I began up to my hidden campsite; it was still early afternoon.  As I made my way up, I took my usual turn off-trail when I almost lunged backward.  My heart punched my ribcage as I regained my balance.  The closet was standing in the middle of the path.  

I stared at it, disbelief painting my face.  It was the very same one.  Same coat of white paint, same bronze hinges, same trim and doors.  As polished and clean as the first night I saw it.  I stepped closer to feel it, the familiar grooves confirming this was, for certain, the same closet.  Walking around it gave me no answers; there were no signs of drag marks, no footsteps indicating it had been carried.  No evidence for how it got here.  With what little curiosity I had left, I reached gingerly for the doorknob.  An attempted twist was met with firm resistance.  The closet was now locked.  A cold sweat broke over me as I twisted the handle desperately, shaking the door with each try.  

Firmly, it remained locked.  I can’t describe the reasoning; all I know is that this filled me with a coldness I couldn’t shake.  My sweaty palm released the knob, heart aching as it continued racing.  I didn’t want to be there anymore.  Even though my camp was another mile away from it, I didn’t want to be in the woods anymore.  I tore back down the trail, head aching with a palpitating fear.    

Throwing my pack into my car, I drove home.  Almost an entire day down the drain, this would have irked me under normal circumstances.  Instead, I sped home with the desire to lock myself away and spend the remainder of the night binge-watching TV.  I ached for distraction as I pulled into my driveway.  Immediately, I tossed my pack onto the floor and pulled out a bottle of vodka from the freezer.  Drinking and TV, that was the cure I needed, the relief from this underlying nervousness.  

Hungover the next day, I decided to plan a different type of trip the following weekend.  I called a friend, inviting them out for a quick camp session.  My friend Vince was free.  I told him all about the closet and planned on showing him as well.  Talking it over eased a lot of my worries; the presence of someone genuinely interested in seeing it deterred most of the more menacing aspects of the situation. 

Distracted most of the work week, I pressed into another weekend.  A rekindled anxiety gripped me.  Picking up Vince and joking through the car ride helped immensely, but it remained burrowed in the back of my mind.   We pulled up and, after grabbing all our gear, began the trudge up to my secret spot.  Vince distracted me with observations on the natural beauty of the forest and exclamations about how excited he was to finally see not only my hidden campsite, but a mysterious anomaly he joked was straight out of an *X Files* episode.

Fully expecting to run into the closet on the way up, I was shocked to reach the campsite without spotting it.  Vince shared his disappointment that I tried to feign in response, but the relief flowing through my system was obvious.  So, an uneventful good time filled the night, then, after the most restful night I had had all week, I woke to a gorgeous dawn.  With a taste of relief still in my mouth, I packed up the site, letting Vince sleep in a bit as a sign of gratitude.  When he woke, we pulled on our gear and laughed our way down the mountain.  The drive was pleasant, crisp morning air filling the car.  With a huge thank you, I dropped Vince off and resumed my drive home.  The veins of the Applaichan forest trail along the highway basically up to my doorstep, which I peacefully glanced at as I finished the last portion of my journey, when something caught my eye.  Breaks in the treeline I drove by showed glimmers of it as I slowed down.  A rising nervousness spilled from my stomach as I pulled to the side of the road.  

Shakily, I stepped out of my car and gazed down into the forest several yards away, trying to find another breakage I could see through.  A gap between a huddle of trees guided my eyes into the clearing just past them.  There it stood.  The shadows of the wood were incapable of hiding the white of the closet.  It sat squarely facing me.  My breath caught in my throat as I peered at it. 

Even from that distance, I could see.  One of the doors was cracked open.  Fists clenched, I stood frozen, enraptured by its foreboding presence.  A minute or so passed.  Then, the door shut.  I bolted to my car and tore down the highway, desperate for the safety of my home. 

The urge to call some form of law enforcement, or maybe the local rangers of the trails, filled my head as I began to spiral.  I needed answers, I wanted security.  I never wanted to see those closet doors again.  I could barely look at my own anymore.  Every night, I stared down the foot of my bed at them, expecting them to congeal and morph into the pair from the woods. My otherwise plain oak closet stood innocently as my mind played tricks on me.  Did the doors just turn white? Were my hinges turning bronze?  No, they stood, their plain oak held in place with metal hinges.  

 I have been sleeping on my living room couch for a couple of nights now.  No matter how childish I felt, I just couldn’t stop psyching myself out.  Working from home helped in the sense that I didn’t spend every morning driving while in a state of borderline hallucination, expecting the closet to appear in my rearview mirror.  My fridge was stocked too, but I knew I could only go a couple more days pushing off going outside.  

Finally, the day came when I had to step out.  Like an idiot, I pushed it off so last-minute that it was well into the evening when I decided I couldn’t survive off a dwindling supply of snack foods anymore.  I spent several minutes in front of my door, desperately trying to numb my nerves by ridiculing my pathetic behavior.  With a forced speed, I opened my door and marched willfully to my car.  My eyes remained fixed on my car; no glances into the nearby treeline were allowed.  Slamming shut into the safety of my car allowed a moment of relief as I buckled in and drove down the driveway.  

I deeply resented my local grocery store for being in the direction of the mountain trail, but I pressed on, eyes glued to the road.  I got my supplies and began my journey home without a hitch.  I could breathe easier as I turned down the familiar side roads back onto the highway, forest cusping all sides of me still.  I passed the last sighting of the closet, and with newfound courage, I dared a passing glance as I zipped down the highway.  I recognized the breaks in the treeline, but there was no closet to be seen.  No white monolith staring back at me.  

I finished the drive with high spirits, listening to music on an otherwise solemn drive.  I turned back into my neighborhood, enjoying the blur of green trees caught in my headlights as I slowed.  A blob of white interrupted the passing emerald colors.  I slammed on my brakes, bags of groceries spilling in my backseat.  

The night around me began to feel suffocating, blackness surrounding my car.  Stomach aching with the rising bile of fear, I glanced in my rearview.  My red brake lights illuminated the daunting closet, just barely visible behind a pair of withered trees.  It’s bronze hinges glinting in the crimson light, door cracked open.  I stared, too afraid to blink as I shivered in my car, throat choking down the quivering horror my stomach demanded to release.  I saw it in the closet; my eyes stung.  A hand was gripping the side of the left door from inside.  Just as I registered it, it pulled quickly back inside, slamming the closet shut.  

A panic polluted my lungs, and I slammed on the gas.  Pulling into my driveway, nearly crashing into my home, I ran inside and began to dial 911.  I was in hysterics, I’m surprised the cops even showed up, considering my raspy voice gagging for air between sentences.  My shaking remained when they pulled in fourty minutes later, and continued as I pointed in the general direction I saw the closet in the woods.  I told them a man was following me, hoping that would spark more determination in the officers scanning the scattered veins of forest around the neighborhood’s entrance.  

Nothing came of it.  No signs of a man, let alone an anomaly like a closet sitting solemnly in the middle of nowhere.  I apologized and saw the police officers off, too numb and exhausted to heed whatever advice they gave me.  I couldn’t bring myself to enter my bedroom, so I slept in my clothes on the couch, TV and lamp light on all the while.  

The weekend dawn came and went.  Saturday was here, and no camping was to be done.  I did eventually gather my groceries from the car.  Thankfully, the cold Appalachian fall nights kept most of the frozen stuff in a salvageable state.  Once again, I holed up in my home, trying to distract myself, smoking and drinking.  I had the curtains drawn all day.  I couldn’t stand looking out towards the woods.  By nightfall, I was beyond intoxicated, barely conscious as I lay on the couch watching TV.  Getting up to pee, I stumbled past the living room window, balancing myself with the curtain.  It shifted with me, and my drunken walking corpse couldn’t rebalance in time.  I tumbled to the hardwood floor, nearly bashing my head on the coffee table in the process.  With a clang, the curtain rod came down with me. 

Grunting, I pulled myself up, curtain still in hand.  My head throbbed as the abuse I had put my body through came rushing in all at once.  Rubbing my knee, I hobbled back to the couch and plopped down like the defeated sack of meat I was.  Returning my attention to my aching temples, I began rubbing them as I turned toward the scene of the tumble to see if anything besides the curtain had been damaged.  I slight dent in the wall from my elbow, and a bent curtain rod.  I realigned my sight to the window, hoping I hadn’t cracked it.  

The window remained intact, revealing the long stretch of lawn outside, lit by my back porch light as it flickered the last of its life away.  The dying illumination revealed something else.  In the woods just past my property line.  

It stared at me from the treeline.  Squarely facing me from the shadows.  That closet.  My scream winded me as I jumped from my couch.  My porch light died.  Black night pressed against my window, stifling all sight beyond those panes.  I ran to my doors, locking them, before running back to my window and pathetically attempted to fix the curtain.  The cheap aluminum rod was too bent to fit, and one of the hooks had been pulled out of the wall.  On the brink of tears, I pleadingly, tried to cover the window with a single dangling curtain.  My porch light flickered on for a second more, its last gasp at life.  

In the blink of an eye, I saw the closet on my lawn, before darkness hid it once again.  A moan of horror and defeat gasped from my throat.  Grabbing my phone, I tore to my room, locked the door behind me, and pulled the curtains shut before dragging my dresser in front of the window.  Another 911 call, promises of them being there soon.  

That was twenty minutes ago.  I’ve been hiding here all this time, hoping that writing this whole experience down on my phone would keep me sane for just a few more minutes.  And that someone out there will know how to help me.  

I think I hear someone knocking on my front door now.  It's still locked.  And I can’t answer it.  I’ve been in the corner of my bedroom for the last ten minutes.  The closet is in my room now.  I blinked one moment, and it had replaced my closet entirely.  The smooth click of its doorknob echoed in the room.  It's been creaking open ever since.  Centimeters at a time every couple of seconds.  Please, someone, believe me and help me.  Before it's too late.  

I see its hand now, gripping the side of the door.  Its rotting flesh perfectly contrasting with the pristine wood of the closet.  Please, someone, help me.
