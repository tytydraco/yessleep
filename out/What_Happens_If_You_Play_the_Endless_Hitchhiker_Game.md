I don’t really know where to start. I’ve already deleted and rewritten this post about ten times, because it sounds too absurd even to me. But if I don’t get this out, I think my head will explode… or maybe something worse.

My name is Jake. I’m 25 years old, I live in a small town in the countryside, the kind of place where rumors become solid truths just because no one has much to do besides repeat them. Here, everyone has heard about the “Endless Hitchhiker Game.” It’s almost a local rite of passage, a dumb courage test that teenagers do on boring nights, usually after a few warm beers and empty promises of money, women, and fame.

But don’t be fooled: it’s not just a legend to scare kids into not taking dad’s car. I know that better than anyone. This game took from me what I held most precious: first my brother, then… well, you’ll understand.

Please, if you ever hear about this challenge, if some friend brings up the idea like it’s just a joke, don’t go. No matter how much they doubt you or laugh at you. No matter how tempting it is to test the unknown. This game is a bottomless pit, and whoever gets close to the edge ends up slipping, sooner or later.

My brother, Noah, was two years older. He had that kind of energy that lit up the room: he talked loud, laughed easily, had an annoying habit of tapping people lightly on the shoulder when he wanted attention, like the world was a natural extension of his body. I idolized him as a kid. He took me biking to the lake, taught me to play pool, covered me up when I woke up crying from nightmares. But when I was 15 and he was 17, something between us started to crack. I was the studious youngest one, he was the young pragmatist with gasoline in his veins. We had silly fights that grew like mold.

That fateful week, we had a stupid fight. I wanted to use the car on Saturday to go out with some friends, but Noah showed up in the kitchen saying he needed it that night. We argued and he snatched the keys from me, running out the door.

— “Where are you going?” — I asked, already at my limit.

— “To play the game,” he said. “If I win, I’ll buy my own car and you won’t have to share anything with me, kid.”

That hit me the wrong way. I shot back without thinking, almost spitting the words out:

— “Do whatever you want, Noah. I hope you go and just disappear already.”

Those were the last words I said to my brother. He left, slamming the door, laughing loudly… and never came back. They found the car three days later, parked on the shoulder miles away, engine running, doors locked from the inside. No sign of him. No sign of struggle. Just the radio tuned to empty static and the passenger seat wet, like someone had sat there after coming out of a lake.

Now, about the game, here’s what you need to know:

The “Endless Hitchhiker” has no clear creator. It just exists, floating in the collective imagination of this town for at least two generations. I remember hearing about it when I was little, waiting for the school bus. An older kid, chewing gum loudly, said he had a cousin who tried it, disappeared for days, and came back mute. Another one swore that a classmate’s dad won a fortune after playing, but started sleeping in the basement, saying the light hurt his eyes.

Later, when the internet became everywhere, the game got new life. Anonymous posts would pop up in weird forums (the kind you open at three in the morning, with a black interface and ads for illegal meds and married women in your area). They had titles like:

“Did the ENDLESS HITCHHIKER CHALLENGE — ASK ME ANYTHING”

“the passenger asked me something I can’t tell”

“there is no prize, only debt”

Almost always the thread would just stop out of nowhere, or the author would post something incoherent days later, like they had a little “literary stroke.”

Later on, printed copies started appearing. Someone would type the rules on an old machine or print them on cheap paper, sticking them to poles on Main Street, near the school, the movie theater. Yellowed papers, wet with dew, taped with electrical tape. I read one of those sheets myself when I was about thirteen. I kept it inside a biology book, forgot about it for years until I found it again after everything had already happened. I still remember it almost word for word:

THE ENDLESS HITCHHIKER CHALLENGE

1 - Go alone, or bring someone willing not to interfere.

2 - Choose highway X-17. Don’t use GPS. Don’t bring maps.

3 - Drive at night, no destination, until you see the first sign that says “SLOW DOWN.”

4 - Stop the car and wait. Don’t get out.

5 - Offer a ride to the first who shows up, no matter who it is.

6 - Obey ALL instructions from the passenger. Don’t ask where you’re going.

7 - Never look back when the passenger gets out.

8 - If you reach the end, they’ll leave something in the car. Don’t open it until you get home.

9 - If you try to leave early, you’ll walk forever.

Back then, I laughed at it. Told my friends that whoever disappeared on the road must have crashed drunk and gotten lost in some thicket, or used the superstition to run away from parenthood or something like that. But it’s easy to be skeptical when nothing affects you directly.

After Noah disappeared, I spent years with that stuck in my throat. My mom withered away. Our dad too, but in his own way: he’d spend long stretches silent in the garage, staring at the tools, working on the car, his face wet with sweat or tears. I never could tell which.

I carried the weight of what I’d said to my brother like a tumor. Some days I’d catch myself repeating it under my breath:

“I hope you go and just disappear already.”

The subtle cruelty of how careless I was when I said that fed on me, reminded me all the time that maybe it was the last thing he heard from my mouth. And the worst part is Noah left laughing. He left thinking I didn’t care…

Little by little, life arranged itself the way it does when the chaos is too big to process. I started working IT at a small local shop, where I spent more time swapping broken mice and rebooting modems than programming anything at all. I met Maya in one of those rare moments of human interaction, a backyard party, questionable drinks, bad music.

She was the kind of person who barged into my routine without asking permission. She laughed at my dry jokes, grabbed my hand on our second date and never let go. She was loud in the right way, complained about the price of coffee and the state of the world with the same vibrant indignation. And, little by little, she made even Noah’s memory hurt a little less.

But to forget completely is impossible. Especially here, where every corner seems to whisper old stories, where the echo of rumors never really dies. The “Endless Hitchhiker” kept showing up, the inevitable Zeitgeist: a poorly done graffiti on the wall of the old gas station, scribbles on a school desk. A silent reminder that, sooner or later, someone would want to try again.

When Maya started hearing about the game (it was a friend of mine who bragged about knowing the “real rules”), she thought it was hilarious. She spent days nudging me, saying we should try it, just to prove it was all drunk nonsense.

Before you judge her, I hadn’t told her about Noah. At least not everything. I told her about my brother, about how close we were and how he disappeared, but no mention of the game or anything like that. Maya was a big city girl, I figured she’d see these small town legends as just “backwater superstition.” In a way I was right, but she genuinely thought it was a fun and curious idea.

— “Imagine, Jake,” she’d say, leaning on the kitchen counter, swirling her half-empty glass. “You and me, facing the myth. When we get to the end, I want my prize: a million bucks or an endless milkshake.”

I’d laugh awkwardly. Change the subject. But she kept insisting, with that spark in her eyes I hadn’t seen since before Noah disappeared. A spark that mixed curiosity and challenge, like the universe was just a board waiting for her to flip the game.

Until I gave in. Said we’d do it my way, following every rule to the letter, no fooling around. Deep down, maybe part of me wanted to confront it. To face the same road my brother did and, maybe, in some crooked way, understand him.

In the week leading up to that day, Maya was electric. She made a playlist for the trip, full of silly songs that got stuck in your head, bought snacks and energy drinks “to celebrate our victory over the supernatural,” as she put it, and even packed an old camera she’d inherited from her grandfather, “to capture the moment we bust the myth.”

I watched her with a strange mix of tenderness and a dread that seemed to settle deep in the pit of my stomach. Sometimes, in the middle of her jokes, I’d catch myself smiling in an almost automatic way, while inside I kept recalculating the risk, measuring how much I was willing to sacrifice just to keep that spark in her eyes alive.

The night before the “big event,” we slept together at my apartment. We didn’t have sex, not that time. We just lay there, our legs tangled, trading silly confessions. Maya said her biggest fear was abandonment, so she didn’t want to go alone, or let me go alone into this. I knew where that fear came from. I laughed, kissed the top of her forehead and promised I’d always be there by her side. She took my hand and traced imaginary lines on my fingers until she finally drifted off to sleep.

I, on the other hand, stayed awake long after, staring at the ceiling and listening to the intermittent hum of cars outside. I wondered if Noah had done the same, if he’d lost sleep the night before. If he was scared, or if he was truly brave.

A stupid thought crossed my mind, almost pulling a nervous laugh out of me:

“What was Noah’s biggest fear?”

When the sun rose, we got up and prepared everything with ritualistic exaggeration, gathering supplies like we were heading to war. Maya brushed her hair twice, “because what if ghosts care about good presentation,” and I checked the tire pressure as if that would protect us from any hungry entity.

Before we left, she pulled me close and gave me a long kiss, without her usual rush.

— “If we win the prize, I promise to share it with you. Even if it’s just the milkshake,” she said, with a crooked smile.

— “How generous,” I joked, but my chest tightened in a strange way.

The drive to highway X-17 was quiet, the kind of comfortable silence full of small certainties only two bodies used to each other can have. Maya tapped her fingers on her knee, watching the scenery slide by through the window, and I focused on the asphalt, trying to ignore the fact that the world seemed just a bit grayer than usual. In the background, low, some pop song from her playlist played like white noise.

When we finally spotted the faded blue sign marking the exit for X-17, I felt my heart give a stupid jolt, like it was about to drop. Maya noticed, squeezed my thigh, and said in an almost sweet tone:

— “Hey, Jake. Let’s not make this a big deal. It’s just a road. Just a bunch of concrete and white lines.”

I forced a smile.

And with that, I turned onto the highway that seemed to stretch out infinitely ahead, swallowing our car and, though I didn’t know it yet, swallowing me too.

The X-17 (I don’t need to explain this is a made-up name, since I don’t want any of you to try this) had a curious way of imposing itself. It wasn’t wide, it didn’t have potholes or creepy signs. But it felt… too quiet. There was no movement: no trucks, no headlights coming the other way, not even many streetlights. The asphalt stretched effortlessly, lazily winding through dark pine woods where the wind rustled the treetops but made no sound at all. It was like we were in a completely sterile, controlled, almost laboratory-like environment.

We drove for a good twenty minutes in that suspended state, Maya making occasional comments about the playlist, about how the car seat smell seemed worse at night, about the strange color of the moon rising, stained yellow. I answered with grunts or tight smiles. The truth was my body was so stiff my shoulders ached.

Then, without warning, the sign appeared.

It wasn’t big. Painted in faded yellow, black letters half worn off. But there it was, solemn and inevitable:

SLOW DOWN

Maya took a deep breath, let out a nervous giggle and squeezed my thigh even harder. I eased my foot down, felt the car protest slightly. The engine gave a low groan, like it disliked this as much as I did.

— “This is it, right?” — she asked, her voice almost a whisper but trying to sound playful.

— “This is it.”

I pulled the car over onto the shoulder. The engine still purred, restless, the speedometer needle twitching slightly like it didn’t want to settle completely. Inside, we were suddenly left with nothing to say. Maya reflexively fixed her hair, looked in the side mirror. I, meanwhile, kept my eyes glued to the rearview mirror, watching the strip of road disappear into the darkness behind us.

The whole world seemed to hold its breath.

That’s when I saw the first movement — a dark silhouette appearing, as if materializing out of nothing and shadow. It walked slowly, unhurried, steady steps, hands hanging by its sides. As it got closer, the low beam headlights lit up a worn-out suit, a crooked tie, and an old-fashioned hat, the kind you only see in old movies.

Maya gripped my arm so tight I felt her nails pierce through my shirt.

The man reached the passenger window. He stood there, head tilted slightly to the side, like he was studying a painting in a museum. Then, slowly, he bent down until he was face to face with the glass. The car’s interior light flicked on with the movement, revealing a long face, ashen skin and eyes set too deep, shadowed by almost black circles under them.

He smiled.  
It wasn’t an evil smile. It was… terribly ordinary. Somehow it reminded me of the kind of smile my grandfather used to give.

I don’t know what came over me, but I did what the rules said. I unlocked the doors.

The handle turned without a click. The man got in, sat down next to me, turned to Maya with the same smile, and shut the door in an almost ceremonial silence. She shrank back instinctively but kept her chin up, eyes fixed on the windshield.

For a moment, no one said anything. Then the passenger took a deep breath, as if he wanted to savor the air in the car, and spoke in a low, hoarse, oddly polite tone:

— “Keep going, please. I’ll tell you when it’s time to turn.”

I just obeyed, feeling sweat break out on my forehead despite the car’s air conditioning. My hands were damp too, making the steering wheel slightly slippery. I didn’t dare look at my passenger, but I knew he was watching me, the fear crawling up my spine like prey, stalked by its predator.

I could only hear my own breathing, too heavy, mixed with the persistent hum of the engine. I glanced briefly at the rearview mirror, hoping for some sign of headlights in the distance, any proof that the rest of the world still existed beyond that stretch of road. But there was only the compact darkness, so dense it almost felt solid, like it could be cut with a knife.

Maya cleared her throat. I don’t know if it was to break the silence or to clear away a fear she couldn’t quite hide.

The passenger then rested his hands on his knees — long, thin fingers, nails short and far too clean for someone who looked like he’d crawled out of a grave. He turned his face slightly toward her, keeping the same focused stare. I didn’t look at him directly, but I could see out of the corner of my eye the precise, restrained, almost meticulous movement.

— “Bless you, miss,” he said, tipping his hat in greeting.

— “Th-Thank you,” Maya whispered — I could hear the fear in her voice.

I didn’t want to leave her like that, so I tried to shift the focus off the man by asking a question:

— “So… where are you from?” — my voice came out weak, in a tone I didn’t even recognize as mine.

The passenger turned his face toward me, so slowly that for a moment I feared he wouldn’t stop. When his eyes finally met mine, I felt an involuntary tightness at the base of my stomach, as if something small and cold had coiled itself there.

He held my gaze for a second or two — long enough for my heart to pound out of rhythm. Then he smiled again, this time in a way more threatening, more true, his teeth worn down and slightly conical… and he said:

— “Oh, I come from many places. But for now, I’m only going where I need to.”

I didn’t know what to say. That seemed to close off any chance of more conversation. I had the dumb instinct to glance at Maya, searching for some hint of shared understanding, like I might find in her eyes a silent joke to break the weight of that moment. But she stayed rigid, her hands clenched in her lap, gripping the fabric of her pants like she was trying to anchor herself to something solid.

The passenger settled deeper into his seat. For a moment, he just watched the road ahead, body leaning slightly forward, as if he were contemplating a landscape far beyond what my eyes could reach.

Then, without changing his calm tone — almost too polite — he spoke:

— “At the next turn on the left, please.”

I nodded, swallowed hard, and kept driving. The road seemed to bend at an impossible angle, almost an exaggerated arc, dipping through trees so dense their branches met above the asphalt, forming a kind of natural tunnel. The car entered that suffocating half-light, and for an instant the world seemed to grow even quieter, as if the engine were holding its breath along with us.

— “Jake…” — Maya murmured, her voice a faint thread. Just that. But it was enough to make me want to let go of the wheel, pull her out, and run until our lungs burst.

Instead, I just looked at her and tried to say the only thing I could:

— “It’s okay,” I lied. “It’ll be over soon.”

— “It’s about to begin,” corrected the passenger, in an almost distracted tone, like someone commenting on the weather.

I felt the blood drain from my face. The road stretched on in near absolute silence, broken only by the low growl of the engine and our uneven breathing. Maya was squeezing and releasing her seatbelt in a nervous tic, while the passenger watched the black forest scenery outside with the calm of someone admiring a familiar garden.

Then he turned to her, so suddenly that the seat creaked under the shifted weight.

— “Tell me about your mother, Maya.”

The air seemed to thin, as if the question had pulled something vital out of it. Maya’s eyes widened a little, she blinked several times. Her hand found my arm, gripped it tightly, but she said nothing.

— “Please,” he continued, in a polite tone. “I love family stories.”

Maya took a deep breath. Her knuckles went white as she clenched my sleeve.

— “She… she was great. Funny. Most of the time. She liked loud music…”

Her voice faltered, turned into a brittle whisper.

— “But she had problems. Said she needed it to forget. I didn’t… I didn’t want her to forget me too.”

The passenger’s eyes glimmered with something I can’t name. A silent pleasure, maybe. He tilted his head, so slowly the motion seemed to belong to some other creature, not a human being.

— “So the fear of being left alone came from her.”

It wasn’t a question, but Maya nodded anyway, her chin trembling. I wanted to tell her to stop, to give him no more of that fear. But my throat closed up, like it was full of sand.

— “At the next bend, pull over,” the passenger said, turning his gaze back to the road.

I obeyed, feeling my heart pounding so hard it seemed to push my ribs out of place. I hit the brakes, the car shuddered. The road there was wide, but lined with twisted pines, their branches hanging low like deformed arms. The passenger pointed to the side of the road without even looking at me.

— “Maya, dear… look outside. I think someone’s waiting.”

Maya took a while to turn her head. First she bit her lip, took a deep breath. Then, with the slow, reluctant motion of someone who fears what they’ll find, she looked out the window.

I looked too — I couldn’t help it.

Between the trees, something began to take shape. It was as if the darkness condensed into vertical, elongated lines and then filled out, gaining form. First came legs — far too thin — then a narrow torso, almost translucent. The arms hung long, bending at an odd angle, the hands dragging across the carpet of dead leaves.

The head… God. It was far too large, the face long, the skin almost clinging to the bones. The hair fell in damp, oily strands, sticking to its cheeks, partly hiding the eyes — two deep, frantic hollows that darted in their sockets as if trying to fix on everything at once. When the face cleared, I wanted to hit the gas… it was a sickly version of Maya’s mother. I’d seen her in photos before — we didn’t talk much about her because, after Maya’s father died, she’d drowned herself in drugs and within a few months vanished. That’s where Maya’s fear came from…

But the worst part was when the mouth opened, too wide, and a sound came out. It wasn’t a scream, nor a word. It was like a wet sigh, sucking in too much smoke, trying to speak between coughs.

— “Mom…” Maya said, in a trembling whisper, her hand instinctively reaching for the glass.

The creature stretched its neck, so thin it looked like it might snap. Then it started to laugh — a wet, broken sound, through lungs full of fluid.

Beside me, the passenger just let out a satisfied sigh.

— “It’s time to move on,” he said, resting his cold hand on my shoulder again. “Or we’ll miss the gift that’s waiting for you.”

I pulled away almost with a jump, the tires skidding on the damp asphalt. As we drove on, I looked one last time in the rearview mirror and saw the long figure bending to follow us with its eyes, its mouth still open in that horrid smile. Maya shrank into her seat, hiding her face in her hands. The passenger began to whistle, the uneven sound filling the car with a kind of music that didn’t belong to any safe place.

And I just kept driving, hands locked on the wheel, praying there really was an end to this. But that last sentence he spoke… worried me.
