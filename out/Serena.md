I can’t stop thinking about her. She lives rent free in my head. The way she laughed, the way she smiled.

 I try to keep busy, so I don’t have to think about it. 

I don’t know where she is now, but I pray that she’s found. I almost feel bad for her, but I can’t. What she did to me? How bad she hurt me? Why can’t she just leave me alone. 

I remember when she first appeared at my work. I was stocking shelves at the time. She asked me which isle the bread was in, and I helped her find it, next thing I know she was here for an interview. 

She got the job and I congratulated her on her way out. She looked back at me and smiled. Not a happy smile, but more of a grin. I brushed it off thinking she was going to be one of the fun colleagues, the ones who know how to mix a little work with play. 

I did a little asking around and come to find out she asked specifically for night shift, my shift. I was a little surprised but I figured we needed a little more help around here in the evening. 

We got to talking on one night, while we were sorting out inventory. She told me that she’d lived around here for a while, and she’d considered getting a job here but the pay was not preferable.  

I asked her about her life and her hobbies, and she told be she’d just broken up with her boyfriend who moved out of town to pursue his legal career. I thought it was weird that he just up and left her here, and that she didn’t want to go with him. Upon further investigation it turns out that he was cheating on her in law school, but she didn’t find out until after the break up. I believed her too, until I saw her leave work with man who seemed to know really well. In fact they were holding eachother in the parking lot for a while. 

I know it sounds like I was jumping to conclusions but just wait a second. I did consider that maybe she was dating again, but then on our next shift when I told her I had seen them and that I thought it was cute she looked dead at me, as if I had crossed the line. Admittedly, I had, and so I backed off and apologized.  I didn’t see him or the car again. She started pulling up to work in a beaten truck, instead of the fancy Mercedes that the man was driving.  I felt like I had fucked up, so I tried going up to her mid shift with a better, more well thought out apology. Instead of being upset, she turned to me and smiled. She said she wasn’t offended, and that it was a man she had met on a dating site last weekend. She proceeded to go into huge detail about the entire situation, which made me slightly uncomfortable. A couple of points in the story were extremely far fetched, and sounded fabricated. 

I politely smiled and told her that I was happy for her, and that I hoped they worked out. She gave me that same slightly annoyed look, and then continued talking about how excited she was to see him again. 

The next time I saw her was a week later. She was folding boxes to take out recycling and as soon as she spotted me she marched right up to me, box cutter in hand. She asked me if I had asked for a shift change, to which I replied no. I told her that I had requested a week off to see my mother in Chicago, because she came down sick with Covid. 

She didn’t believe me. 

She gave me an evil look, before turning on her heel and walking back toward the back door. She refused to look at me for the rest of the shift. I tried not to hold it against her. I figured maybe the pay was stressing her out or she was going through some personal stuff. 

At the end of the shift she had seemed to have calmed down, and as we were getting our coats and bags she asked me if I needed a ride home. I politely accepted, it seemed like a good idea not to waste $18 on an uber or to bother my friend again. 

We got in her car but we didn’t move for a solid few minutes. She looked at me smiling, expecting me to say something, but all I could come up with was “thank you, I really appreciate you giving me a ride.” I felt stupid and awkward, but she laughed. 
 When she eventually figured out that was all I had to say she asked me where I lived and we began our commute. 

The drive to mine wasn’t very far, but it felt far, until I realized that we had passed the junction that led to my house. It wouldn’t be that big of a mistake if she didn’t have Apple Maps on at full volume. I politely informed her that we had missed the exit, but all she said was “hmm?”  

I repeated myself, again, politely. She looked a little bit upset by this statement, her eyes still locked on the road. Soon we started taking unfamiliar turns, and the scenery began to look different. Eventually we pulled up into a driveway that definitely wasn’t mine. 

“Okay! Are you hungry?”  She said. I told her that no, I wasn’t hungry, and asked where she had taken us. She proceeded to tell me that this was her house, and that she was tired and did not want to drive way out to my house (which was 10 minutes from the store). 

I told her that we had passed my home 45 minutes ago, and that she had driven us further than that. She laughed and took her keys out of the ignition. I started to panic, but I didn’t want to upset her, so I tried to hide it. 

I said that since we were here now I will come in and grab something to eat. At this point I was a little concerned and figured I’d bite the bullet and pay for a $50 uber I just wanted out. 

We got in the house, and instead of turning on any of the lights she headed straight upstairs into what I presume was her bedroom. I turned on a lamp and sat on the couch waiting for her to come down for 10 minutes, and then I called it. I booked my uber but it was 20 minutes out. I also texted one of my friends to tell them where I was and what I was doing. 

Five minutes later I heard her calling down the stairs. 

“Darliiiing, darliiing.” 

I thought she was calling her cat so I minded my own business. After a solid minute of silence she came tumbling down the stairs with her makeup and hair done. She looked right into my eyes and asked me if I was coming up. I said no, and that my uber was arriving shortly. She started yelling and screaming at me, that I was an asshole and that I led her on, and that we clicked. 

I apologized and told her I was extremely sorry that I had given her the impression that I wanted to date her, and that I thought she was dating someone. She looked confused for a second, but then began laughing hysterically. 
 
“That’s my friend, i paid him. I thought maybe if you saw me with him you’d hurry up and ask me out.” 

I couldn’t believe what she had just said. I told her that this wasn’t okay and that I should leave; but she came bolting at me, grabbed a porcelain fish and tried to hit me with it. I dodged and quickly ran out of the house and down the driveway. I saw lights in the distance and prayed it was the uber. 

The car pulled up and I hopped in.  The very next day I quit my job and arranged to stay with my mom in Chicago for a month or two while I process what happened. 

I got a few text messages from my neighbor saying that a shitty truck had pulled up into my driveway and sat for hours at a time. I called the police about it but they told me when they had driven by they didn’t see anything.  I discussed this with my mom and she suggested packing up and moving in with her, so that’s exactly what I did. 

I haven’t been back to the house since. I am currently trying to sell it online but I’ve asked a friend to help me out. I don’t want to go back there.  I have a new job here in Chicago, and so far I’ve kept to myself. I’m not really interested in getting to know any of my coworkers. Hopefully they don’t think I’m an asshole. I saw in the news recently the girl I escaped from had gone missing. I’m worried about her, but I can’t bear to think about her. I just hope that she isn’t hurt.
