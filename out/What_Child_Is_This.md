“Watch ye therefore, because ye know not what hour your Lord will come.” — **Matthew 24:42**

We have been commanded to watch for the end of days. We watch for the man of sin, that son of perdition, the Antichrist, who will appear on the horizon like the morning star. As dawn breaks, he will come, heralded by the False Prophet. There will then be the final battle between good and evil, the blessed and the damned, the Christ and the Antichrist. Yet we do not know when all of this will come to pass.

We must watch even unto our own end.

“Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,” Fr. Abebe prayed.

As the coffin was lowered into the earth, the Sisters responded, “And let perpetual light shine upon her.”

“Amen.”

A white cross was planted at the head of the fresh grave, which was pointed toward the east. With a charcoal marker, I wrote the name of the deceased in large black letters.

***Sister Salome***.

With Sr. Salome’s death, the convent of *Regina Pacis*, founded by Italian Roman Catholic missionaries outside Adigrat in the last century, was left with only four Sisters, including myself, and Fr. Bernard Abebe, our priest–confessor, who travelled each Sunday from Addis Ababa to celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and hear our confessions for the week.

Sr. Salome looked younger than her thirty–three years, but her personality made her seem older. She was devout in her prayers and penances and fastidious in her work around the convent. Her purity and simplicity of heart shone through in everything she did. She was as comfortable working in the laundry as she was greeting the Bishop of our Diocese. She refused any adulation from the Sisters, who endearingly referred to her as “Our Saint,” while she insisted she was a mere handmaid of the Lord, allowing His will to be done through her. Due to her genial and reserved nature, none of us noticed she was ill until she collapsed one day during Morning Prayer.

It was All Hallows’ Eve when Fr. Abebe called Dr. Joseph Beyene, who examined Sr. Salome and diagnosed her with an unspecified form of cancer. Due to its advanced stage, she was given a prognosis of less than a year. We were too preoccupied with ourselves to notice her illness until it was too late, and she was too humble to say anything about herself. Dr. Beyene said she should have been in extreme pain, but she must have offered her suffering to God in silence. She was moved from her cell to the infirmary as her illness progressed, and after nine months of palliative care, Sr. Salome surrendered her soul to God.

As Srs. Catherine, Hana, and Fatima walked Fr. Abebe to his car, I gazed upon the cross at the head of Sr. Salome’s grave. *Have mercy, O Lord*. Crossing myself, I returned to the convent, looking out of the barred window in the main corridor until Fr. Abebe drove away. Taking a set of keys out of my pocket, I walked into the chapel. Kneeling at the stairs leading to the sanctuary, I moved a bouquet of flowers to the side, uncovering a latch in the floor. I placed a key into the latch, which opened the door to the cellar.

Grabbing one of the altar candles, I walked down the stairs into the cellar, which was located directly beneath the Tabernacle above in the sanctuary. The sounds of soft whimpers broke the silence. Chains rattled from across the cellar. Through the candlelight, I saw a woman, heavy with child, chained to the wall.

Leaning forward, I held the candle closer to her face.

“Sister Salome.”

I have not been entirely truthful in my recollection of the past nine months.

After Sr. Salome collapsed during Morning Prayer on All Hallows’ Eve, Fr. Abebe indeed called Dr. Beyene, who examined her, but he did not find she was ill in the conventional sense.

She was pregnant.

When the Sisters and I were informed Sr. Salome was pregnant, the four of us were in disbelief. *How shall this be?* Dr. Beyene said she was at least eight weeks along, which meant the child was conceived by September. *Had she been assaulted?* Not likely. She would have told us. *How else?* I could not fathom she would break her vows, but while I racked my mind for an answer, I remembered she was sent to Addis Ababa in August with a delegation of priests and religious brothers to greet a newly ordained Bishop, who was visiting our country as part of a larger trip to East Africa.

Entering her cell, I walked to Sr. Salome’s bedside. She looked away from me in shame, but I grabbed her face with my hand and forced her to look at me. I pointed to her abdomen.

“Who is the father of this child?”

“I’m sorry, Sister Mariam. . . .”

I slapped her in the face before she could continue blubbering.

“Who is the father?”

“The Bishop,” she confessed. “It’s the Bishop’s child.”

“Our Bishop?”

“No,” she answered. “The visiting Bishop.”

She cried as she said she could not clearly remember what had transpired between her and the Bishop, but I did not know whether or not to believe her. *Who could say she was not lying?* I released her face from my grip and began to walk to the door. I came to a sudden stop as she exclaimed, “He did what he was told to do.”

I turned around slowly.

“What?”

“The Bishop,” Sr. Salome said. “He said he did what he was told to do.”

“What did he mean?”

“I don’t know,” she conceded. “He didn’t tell me. All I can remember is he apologised, but said he only did what he was told to do. He said I was his virgin. I don’t know what any of it means.”

*Could it be?*

As I thought about her situation in further detail, I slowly came to the realisation that the prophecies of the Lady of Adwa could be coming to pass as she said they would.

When I entered the convent, I was one of many young women who made the same decision after we heard of the messages of the Lady of Adwa, a series of apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three sisters who lived in a village near the historic city of Adwa. The visionaries, Elisabeth, Joanna, and Felicita, were watching over their flock of sheep when an extraordinarily bright light shone above a tree. The girls cautiously approached the tree when they were able to see the figure of a woman in the light, dressed in a white gown with a matching sash and white mantle. The woman appeared to be floating above the dead tree’s withered branches, her hands clasped together in prayer. Elisabeth and Joanna heard her ethereal voice, while Felicita could only see her lips moving. The girls wondered in fear what was happening when the woman began to speak.

“Do not be afraid,” she said. “I come from Heaven.”

“Who are you?” Elisabeth asked.

“My children, I am the ever Virgin Mary, Mother of your Lord and God,” she answered. “I have come to tell you something of the greatest importance.”

The sisters drew closer to the woman, who had now identified herself as the Blessed Virgin Mary, as she continued to speak.

“Do you love the Lord our God, my daughters? If you do, listen to what I have to say. The world is in grave danger if men continue to afflict the Lord our God with their sins. He will inflict a chastisement on all mankind if His wrath is not appeased by prayers and sacrifices by souls such as yours.”

The sisters’ parents were troubled by what their daughters told them. The girls’ father swore them to secrecy, while the girls’ mother informed their parish priest about the alleged apparition. The parish priest in turn informed the Bishop of their Diocese, who authorised him to conduct an investigation into Elisabeth, Joanna, and Felicita, and their alleged messages from God through the Blessed Virgin Mary.

I was enthralled by the Lady of Adwa and her message of prayer and sacrifice. It gave me a sense of purpose. I felt the call to become a religious Sister. I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to my Lord and my God. As I prepared to leave my home to enter the convent, the Tadesse sisters had two more visions of the Lady.

During the second vision, the Lady said, “My daughters, you know that to be worthy of the Lord our God, you must be fastened to His Cross with three nails. Poverty, chastity, and obedience. Of these, obedience is the most important. Listen only to me and do as I say. It is almost time for **the One to Come**, whose birth will be the beginning of the end of the world.”

“‘The One to Come?’” Joanna asked.

“The **Antichrist**,” the Lady clarified. “**The One to Come** will be born of **a false virgin**, unfaithful to her Spouse, who shall conceive in her accursed womb, by help of the Enemy, with **a man of God**.”

“What will he do?” Elisabeth asked.

“Tremble with fear, my daughters, tremble with fear. For all of your sins, the Lord our God will hand mankind over to that same Enemy, the ancient serpent, who will work through his False Prophet and his Antichrist, to claim as many souls as he can.”

“Oh, Mother,” Joanna exclaimed. “What can we do?”

“Pray, my daughters. Pray very much. Offer yourselves as sacrifices to your Lord and God. Appease His wrath before it is too late.”

In her third appearance, the Lady of Adwa appeared to the Tadesse sisters, who were joined by their mother and aunts, as well as friends and neighbours. The girls’ eyes glazed over as a bright light descended from the sky and rested above the dead tree. After an hour and a half, the girls came back to their senses. However, they were not as peaceful as they had been following the previous apparitions. Elisabeth and Felicita looked visibly shaken, while Joanna was sobbing. The girls’ mother asked them a question.

“What did the Lady say?”

Joanna and Felicita looked to Elisabeth to answer their mother.

“‘It is too late,’” Elisabeth answered.

After I moved away to *Regina Pacis*, I kept all of the messages of the Lady in my heart, but I did not know how the official investigation into the alleged apparitions concluded, whether they were declared “supernatural” or “not supernatural,” because I was cloistered from the rest of the world as a postulant in the convent.

“Sister Mariam?”

I was brought back to the present moment by Sr. Salome.

“Sister Mariam,” Sr. Salome repeated. “What were you thinking?”

“I was thinking. . . .”

*Should I tell her?*

“. . . .it would be better if you were dead.”

She frowned as I thought about what I said.

*What if she* were *dead?*

I walked back to her bedside.

“Now. . . .” I whispered. “You will listen only to me and do as I say.”

We were able to dissuade Dr. Beyene from reporting his findings to Fr. Abebe. He helped us to concoct that story that Sr. Salome in fact had cancer with a poor prognosis. She was moved to the infirmary when she started to show, which we hid from Fr. Abebe when he visited. We acted as if she was really dying, and as her due date drew closer, we made a plan to stage her death and move her to the cellar for the birth of her child.

Her child, the Antichrist, who was prophesied in the Scriptures.

“If any man shall say to you: Lo here is Christ, or there, do not believe him. For there shall arise *false Christs* and *false prophets*, and shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive even the elect. Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.” — **Matthew 24:23** – **25**

“Sister Mariam?”

Sr. Salome slurred as she said my name. Her chains rattled as she sat up as far as she possibly could. We came to the decision to chain her after Sr. Fatima suggested she could try to intentionally hurt herself or her child. Sr. Salome squinted in the candlelight, her face aglow with its flame.

“Has Father Abebe left?”

“Yes,” I answered. “How do you feel?”

“It is almost time.”

She held her belly as she complained of hunger and thirst. I called for Sr. Catherine, who walked down into the cellar, carrying a tray with a bowl of oatmeal and a glass of water. Sr. Salome ate and drank, aided by Sr. Catherine, as if this was her last meal.

After Sr. Salome finished eating, Sr. Catherine took the tray and its contents as she and I walked up from the cellar together, leaving Sr. Salome below in the darkness. I locked the latch and covered it with the bouquet of flowers before I directed the Sisters to return to their assigned duties.

On the following day, I knelt in front of the marker for Sr. Salome’s supposed grave, praying to God for guidance. Were we in league with evil for allowing the birth of the Antichrist? Would we not be justified in ending his life? Or was it the will of God that the Antichrist be born? I did not know. I could possibly never know. With a sigh, I crossed myself, and I heard the roar of distant thunder.

We were due for a storm.

Lightning struck and thunder clapped as I prayed Evening Prayer with Srs. Catherine, Hana, and Fatima in the chapel on a sweltering evening in June. As we concluded with the Sign of the Cross, we heard screaming coming from beneath our feet. Srs. Hana and Fatima went to the infirmary, while Sr. Catherine and I descended into the cellar. Sr. Salome was still screaming, a loud, piercing scream, and as we drew closer to her, we saw her water had broken.

It was time.

Srs. Hana and Fatima called for us from above, indicating they prepared the infirmary for Sr. Salome. Sr. Catherine unchained her, and we led her upstairs to the chapel, but she collapsed on the steps of the sanctuary. It was apparent she could no longer walk.

“Sister Salome,” Sr. Catherine pleaded. “It’s only a little further.”

In response, Sr. Salome screamed as she held onto her belly, her contractions getting stronger. She would not be able to make it to the infirmary.

“Bring the supplies here, Sister Catherine,” I directed.

“What?” Sr. Catherine baulked. “She can’t give birth in the chapel.”

“Bring the supplies here,” I demanded.

Sr. Catherine went to get the supplies from the infirmary, while Sr. Hana pulled me aside as Sr. Fatima looked after Sr. Salome.

“What?”

“The grave. . . .” Sr. Hana trailed off. “Sr. Salome’s grave.”

“What about it?”

“It’s open.”

I followed Sr. Hana to the main corridor, where we saw through the barred window that Sr. Salome’s supposed grave had turned into a mess of mud and muck. I directed Sr. Hana to help Sr. Fatima in the chapel, and I went outside in the storm.

I struggled to see through the blinding rain, but I was finally able to see the white cross had blown away, while the coffin was exposed through the sludge. It was open. I was able to see the carcass of the hyena I slaughtered and placed in the casket to avoid suspicion about an empty coffin. As I looked intently at the grave, I believed I saw shadows out in the storm, but before I could think about that any further, I heard Sr. Hana call for me, and I ran back inside.

In the chapel, Sr. Salome was laid back on the steps of the sanctuary, her legs spread, while Srs. Catherine and Fatima knelt by her right side, placing bands of cloth, scissors, and a basin of water to the side to assist her in labour. I knelt in front of Sr. Salome, while Sr. Hana joined Srs. Catherine and Fatima, who were holding up Sr. Salome’s habit.

I recalled a specific part of the second appearance of the Lady of Adwa to the Tadesse sisters.

“That **false virgin** shall bring forth before the Tabernacle of your Lord and God, defiling what was once holy. Her son will be **evil incarnate**, screaming and shrieking in front of the altar of his God and yours. He will be brought forth in **a temple of God**, sitting in the sanctuary as if he were God.”

With a deep breath, I started to assist Sr. Salome.

*Lord, have mercy*.

I thought I heard thunder clap while Sr. Salome screamed in agony, but I noticed that it sounded similar to a gunshot. Unable to leave Sr. Salome in the midst of labour, I told Sr. Catherine to see if the doors to the convent were closed. She exchanged a glance with Srs. Hana and Fatima, but she stood up and walked to the chapel doors.

Before she opened the doors, a bolt of lightning struck outside, flooding the chapel with its bright light. In the flash, the doors were opened by three women, all of whom were in nuns’ habits, and one of whom shot Sr. Catherine directly in the head.

I was unable to react before Sr. Hana stood up and immediately was shot twice in the chest, collapsing beside me, choking on her own blood. I could not move at all. I was petrified. Sr. Fatima screamed, abandoning me with Sr. Salome, but she was unable to make it far before she was shot in the back and fell to the chapel floor.

With a cry, Sr. Salome brought forth her child in one final pang.

*From her blood and pain comes our destruction*.

She was ashen and pale, and she was unable to even see her baby boy before she fell unconscious, lifeless and limp, on the steps of the sanctuary. She was bleeding heavily. Terrified, I tried to focus my attention on her and her newborn, ignoring our dead Sisters, as well as the three veiled women who murdered them, even as they surrounded us.

I held the baby carefully in my arms as I stood up. I looked around at the three women, one of whom raised her gun to me, and she gestured for me to hand the baby to her.

I was paralysed by fear.

*What should I do?*

I looked down at the newborn, as well as the haemorrhaging Sr. Salome, before the woman stepped closer to me with her gun pointed at my forehead. After a moment of hesitation, I handed the baby to the woman, and the three of them spoke with each other in a language I did not know. *Vergine madre*. *La falsa profetessa*. *Michele*. The three women looked at me one more time before one of them drew her gun and shot Sr. Salome in the head.

Shaking in fear, I looked down to the floor as the three women exited the chapel, leaving me with four corpses, as well as my habit and hands and face covered in blood and viscera.

In the distance, I could hear something through the storm.
