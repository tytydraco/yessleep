I doubt anyone reading this will be old enough to remember when two boys from Winstead went missing in the Welsh mountains. Their story of being found two weeks after a motorbike accident where Willie lost his leg briefly became national news and made my grandfather, Arthur Trevelion, and his best friend ‘One legged’ William Chambers, local celebrities. After the media attention faded away they lived a normal life in the village. They were both regulars in their local pub, if one came to the bar the barmaid would pour two pints because they knew the other was soon to follow. It became tradition at the strike of midnight every New year for Willie to take off his prosthetic leg, Arthur would fill the socket with beer, and both drank to their health. Both started businesses, married, had kids, divorced, then lived alone. Arthur recently passed away, just a month after William’s death. Both suffered heart attacks - I suppose that was just another thing they did together.

They say you shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t intend to. But I believe the truth needs to be told, so I want to tell you the true story of what happened when Willie lost his leg.

Back in 1972, William and Arthur were taken on a summer trip with Winstead youth club from the flat Fenlands of Eastern England to the Brecon Beacons in Wales. The landscape couldn’t be much more different from their homeland, with steep green valleys, roaring waterfalls, and rugged grey mountains. They were put up in a hostel amongst the mountains and the boys loved it, they were both eighteen and yearning for freedom and adventure. In Willie’s own words, the two were ‘a pair of little shits’ who got up to all sorts of trouble. Then one day they excelled themselves.

After a morning of hiking and raft making, they returned to their lodgings for the afternoon. Both William and Arthur were interested in cars, but William was particularly interested in motorbikes. He had one back home, a heavily dented and rust covered mongrel of a 50cc dirt bike he cobbled together from discarded parts. He used to love taking it out across the fields, and making his escape when they got inevitably chased off by the farmers. Arthur would often ride pillion. Willie was delighted when he saw a brand new 175cc Honda Scrambler in a beautiful royal blue parked up outside the hostel office. Arthur recalled that he became obsessed with the thing, Willie described it as ‘All the way from Japan…’ as if it was a starship from another planet.

When night came William decided to act upon his obsession. He conspired with Arthur to sneak out while everyone else slept and pinch the Honda’s keys out of a jacket left hanging in the office. Arthur got the key and they wheeled the bike away from the activity centre in silence. Once hidden behind the curve of the valley they dared to start the engine, Willie sat as pilot and Arthur jumped on the back, then they sped off in a puff of exhaust smoke. They flew down random roads, the yellow headlight dimly guiding their way amongst the sudden twists and turns, turning upwards into the dark mountains and eventually leaving the tarmac road and heading onto gravel tracks. On one sweeping right hand bend the front wheel lost grip and slid out, sending the motorcycle slapping to the ground with a metallic crunch. The bike went ahead, grinding along the gravel, its headlight and tail light swirling in a brief chaotic dance, until it disappeared over the edge of the road. Willie and Arthur slid along behind it, but summer clothes and skin don’t last long when moving fast across gravel. They both left blood on the road, like red crayons on sandpaper, while momentum dragged them after the motorbike and down the mountainside into darkness.

This is where the accounts differ. Not between Arthur and Willie, but between what Arthur said then, and what he recently confessed. After Willie’s funeral Arthur started to suffer from manic episodes in the night. I thought it was just bad dreams triggered by his grief, maybe early Alzheimer’s or dementia. I'm no expert on the medical side and we never had time to get him assessed given the state of NHS waiting lists. But Arthur insisted this wasn’t just in his mind. Arthur told me that at night he saw his old friend as an eighteen-year-old, hopping through his bedroom door in his tattered and bloody clothing, scared, confused, and crying out “Where is my leg!?”. Willie held onto the door frame for stability, leaving red smears on the white paint. Night after night he would visit. Day after day Arthur would obsessively wipe the door frame clean. 

The story Arthur told at the time was that after the crash he eventually awoke battered and bruised, but Willie remained unconscious and much more badly injured. In the process of the crash and the tumble down the cliffside Willie’s leg had been broken, twisted, ripped off below the knee, then lost to the mountain. Arthur made a tourniquet from his belt and despite the cold Welsh summer he sacrificed his own clothes to staunch the bleeding from Willie’s stump. Arthur tended to his friend as best he could regardless of his own injuries. He collected water from a nearby stream and fed it to Willie from his cupped hands whenever conscious. After a week both started to get desperately hungry, Willie was worryingly weak, and Arthur managed to catch and strangle a couple of rabbits by hand, which had to be cut with a sharpened stone and eaten raw. Willie could only stomach small slithers of the bloody meat before passing out again. 

During daylight Arthur searched the valley but couldn’t find any way back to the road. After what felt like countless days he found the motorcycle’s blue petrol tank on the mountainside with a few drops of fuel left in it. He shook it out over some kindling and eventually managed to spark a flame by hitting pieces of metalwork together for a spark. On the fire Arthur cooked some rabbit strips skewered on the end of a stick and ate as much as he could. Willie was awoken by the cooking meat and managed to eat a few bites while conscious. Later that day the smoke from the fire was spotted and rescuers found them. Willie was found just in time to save his life and his survival after two weeks injured in the wild saw Arthur declared a hero in the papers. Willie spent months in hospital before settling back into their normal lives at home in Winstead. They confessed to the theft of the bike but escaped prosecution as it wasn’t in the public interest. Arthur became a carpenter, Willie became a mechanic (nothing ever put him off motorbikes). They remained lifelong friends.

When Willie died of a heart attack last month it hit the whole town hard. He was a tearaway kid but he was a kind, funny, carefree man. He always felt he owed a debt of gratitude to my grandfather, and by extension, toward me and the rest of my family. He gave me a job in his garage when I finished school, I helped out as much as I could and he paid me far more than I deserved. He even kept paying me a salary while I was off at University so I could focus on studying. Grandad Arthur started to take his turn for the worse straight after the funeral. I came back from Uni for the funeral and stayed in his spare room to keep him company. He was retired but still in good health and was endlessly working on renovation projects around the house which I tried to help with.

Every day we would work on his projects, watch whatever football or bad TV show was on, then go to bed. At night he would wake up, sometimes so terrified he would be shouting frantically. The first night I heard him shout I thought we were being burgled and I ran into his room brandishing a hammer I grabbed from Arthur’s toolbox, but there was nothing there. Grandad began to look sad and weak, like I had never seen him like that before. He was always strong and quick to laugh, even about the accident. When my mum cooked him dinner he would say “Better than raw rabbit!” as a backhanded compliment. He became so quiet.

These terrors happened every night for weeks. I didn’t always hear him wake, but I always saw him cleaning up the next morning. He eventually told me Willie was haunting him in the night, more than once I asked him, why? They were such close friends until the end. He didn't answer. I once read a book that suggested ghosts exist as unanswered questions, so Arthur needed to try to answer the question and put the ghost to rest. I didn’t believe in ghosts, but maybe this would exorcise the spectre within his own mind. 

Then on his last morning I went in and checked on Arthur. He was exhausted from scrubbing his door frame clean after another sleepless night. The paint was wearing off, exposing the bare wood beneath. He had developed dark bags under his eyes. He stopped cleaning, sat on the end of his bed and started sobbing. 

“Sorry.” Arthur said softly through his tears. “I’m sorry Willie.”

I had never seen him like this. Just completely broken. I sat with him until he calmed down, then Arthur said he had something he needed to confess. I felt like he wasn’t just confessing to me. “Everything I said before about the crash was true,” he told me. “Except for the rabbits.”

I was confused at first, I couldn’t think why he would lie about that. But he continued, “You have to remember, it was weeks. We had nothing to eat. We were cold and injured. We were both dying, but Willie was going to die first if I didn’t do something. I searched, I tried hunting, the rabbits ran as soon as they saw me and I was too weak to chase them. The stream was shallow and it had no fish. There were no berries….there was nothing. Then, I found it in the stream, kept cold and fresh...” He stopped and took a deep breath like he was just about to go underwater.

“What did you find?” I asked.

He looked up at me, then down at the floor in shame, “His leg.”

That night there was no shouting. The next morning there was no cleaning. I went to Arthur’s room to check on him and found him still in his bed. Heart attack according to the coroner. Maybe he was simply haunted to death by a friend he ate part of, and fed part of themselves to. But I choose to believe that Willie came one last time, an older, understanding Willie, Arthur answered his question and decided to go with him. If Arthur had let them both starve in that valley they may never have escaped, they may not have had the chance to see their children or grandchildren grow up. Judge him if you will, it was a grim choice, but it was a choice that needed to be made and Arthur was the only one who could make it. Arthur and Willie would probably joke about it over a pint if they could. They loved each other, not that men of their generation could easily admit it. They would have done anything for each other. Arthur did what he had to do. 

The morning I found him dead there was blood on the door frame. It wasn’t Arthur’s.

It was all true… except for the rabbits.
