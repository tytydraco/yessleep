Me and my girlfriend Lizzy are the best monster hunters around. If anyone needs a monster to be hunted and found they call us. That’s all normal people ever cared to call us for. When we were done with our hunting, they would pay us and make sure to get us to leave as soon as possible. We didn’t need a mind though. That just meant we could go back to our cozy cabin. Ever since we met, all me and Lizzy had other than our families was each other. As I said before, we aren’t what the people around here would call normal. I’m a tall menacing looking man with crazy strength and my girlfriend well…she was a werewolf. Now I know what you’re thinking. “What does being tall have to do with not being normal?” Like I said, I’m pretty scary looking, at least according to them, and they don’t understand when I talk to certain members of my family. Or “friends” as my mom likes to call them.

Anyway, me and Lizzy had just caught our finished out latest hunt. It was a nasty beast that put up a hell of a fight. But I was no problem for us. It growled as we had it in a net and we’re getting ready to go collect our bounty.

“Good hunt as always, Nutso,” Lizzy told me. She wasn’t that furry monster that was helping me kick ass just a minute 

“We should have enough money to last us for a while with this one,” I replied. I took out one of my friends I brought up earlier. A coconut named Rosie. “I’m about ready to call it a night. Wouldn’t you agree, Rosie?”

Rosie of course agreed. Lizzy grinned, her fangs showing as she did so.

“I think that she can agree that we need something to eat after this fight,” Lizzy said.

I chuckled. That was my Lizzy. Always ready to eat. Luckily she didn’t have the taste for humans. She liked pretty much any normal food though. Her parents say that she has a bottomless pit. After seeing some of the things she’s eaten and how long she can do it, I’d have to agree.

“Alright, let’s get this sucker in and go dig in.” I said.

We continued on our way when we noticed that there was someone ahead of us. It was dark so we couldn’t really see the person since they were a little far. I figured maybe they were just waiting for someone so I kept walking for a bit until I felt Lizzy grab my shoulder.

“Wait,” She said, looking straight at the figure ahead. 

I looked between the two wondering what was up with Lizzy. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Here some person was at night just looking in our direction as we were walking. But then again, what could some random creep do to us?

“What’s the matter?” I asked. Just after that, Lizzy started growling and trying to pull me back.

The figure walked closer, and as he did so, I got a look at his eyes. They were blood red and dead looking. Almost as if life was draining out of him with each step.

“Help me…” The man uttered. “Help me…”

“Buddy, I’m gonna have to ask you to stop where you are.” I said.

“No!” Lizzy let out a yell before getting in front of her. I grabbed her shoulder and she turned to me, her fans showing once again, but this time in anger. The hungry Lizzy was gone and the beast that helped me with the creature in the net had returned. On all fours, she ran at the man and pounced on him. 

“Lizzy, wait!” I called out to her. I ran over to see that the man was now smirking as she had him in a chokehold. She let out an angry roar and she went down and tore into him. Blood began to get everywhere. I backed up as Lizzy ripped apart the guy that I was sure had to be a vampire.

When she was done, she got up and turned to me. Her teeth were bloody and she was giving me a smirk of her own.

“Help!” The voice of a woman screamed. “Help! It’s them!”

Lights turned on and people began running out. 

Lizzy, who was herself began when I looked at her muttered, “Oh shit.”

The woman that was screaming got on her knees next to the remains of the man that Lizzy had taken care of as she started to cry.

“My friend!” The woman cried. “They killed my friend!”

The people around looked scared and angry.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?!” One guy yelled.

“I’m calling the police!” A different woman screamed.

“Hey fuck of!” Lizzy growled at them. “He was the one who came to us and he’s not what you think he is!”

“You heartless psychotic bitch!” The woman on her knees yelled. “He was my friend! He was my friend and you killed him!”

“Hold on!” I said. “None of you saw what happened!” I wasn’t even sure what happened myself. I had no idea what the guy’s intentions were but I trusted Lizzy. I took out Rosie and held up to the people surrounding us. “Rosie can explain everything!”

“There he goes with the coconuts again!” A woman said, backing up away from us.

“Get back!” A man had gotten in front of us with a shotgun. “I said get back! I knew you freaks would snap one day!” 

I, not wanting to make this worse, held my hands up calmly. “Look-“

I didn’t even get to finish as I had to move out of the way after the man had shot at me. This caused Lizzy to lose it. She jumped on the man and bit the side of his face until it bled. That wasn’t enough for her. She then clawed the man in the chest and he let out an agonizing scream. 

I saw more people approaching and took the shogun and shot it a couple of times in the air. “Get out of here!” I said. Fuck that wasn’t a good idea.

I held Rosie up so she could repeat what I said and the people all ran screaming. All except for one. 

That woman on her knees was still there. Only her expression was much different. That’s when I noticed something that I hadn’t before. She had those same red eyes. Only difference is that they were much more lively and full of mischief.

“You two like hunts?” The woman asked us with the most sadistic smirk I had ever seen. “Congratulations. Now the real one begins.”
 
This was only a couple hours ago. And we’re in the middle of the nightmare.
