Ding-Doooong!

The door bell rang for the third time, like a knife it stabbed into my heart filling me with a mortal dread. My pulse quickened and my heart hammered hard in my chest as I hid behind the front door. Every muscle tensed and I closed my eyes shut, praying to God that they would go away. 

A moment of silence is shattered by loud and powerful slams into the door. I nearly leapt out of my skin as the door shook from heavy blows. I swear I heard one of the hinges creak from repeated stress.

Even though I wanted the pounding to stop I knew if I made any move it would mean my death. I stood my ground and leaned into the door with my body weight. 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw my wife frantically dialing 911. It wouldn’t do any good, they already came here a month ago and found nothing. 
Then I heard the most terrifying sound I have ever heard in my life.

“We want your SKIIIIIIN!”

I felt like I was going to pass out as my heart pounded in my chest and sweat covered me head to toe.

This things’ raspy voice called out again, now mixed with guttural choking from how agitated it was.

“Give us your SKIIIIIIIIIIN!!!”

Bang! Bang! BANG!!

The door began to warp from above me and curled inside the house. Chips of wood rained down on my face and made it hard to breathe. Tears flowed down my cheeks as I realized this might be the day that I die. 

I didn’t even get a chance to have a kid.

Just then one of my neighbors drove by in their pick up truck and the headlights filled the house. Reflected across my green couch was the shadow of this creature. It’s enlarged egg shaped head, huge muscular frame, and abnormally elongated arms cast a horrifying vision across our couch and part of the living room wall. 

Then, the headlights of the truck disappeared and the knocking finally stopped. After making sure it really was over, I went over and held my sobbing wife close to me and waited for the police to arrive. 

This time, the police could not deny that something happened. The door had been pushed inwards by almost a foot. The upper set of hinges had come clean off the wall, the screws lying on the floor next to our closet. And several sets of clawed footprints were found in our front yard leading up and away from the front door. They found deep scratches dug into the wall along the outside of our house near the first bedroom. 

They also found tufts of black fur in the bushes next to the front door. 

The police said it was an attempted break in and they suspected they had a dog with them. We knew it wasn’t a dog, these were humanoid creatures with intelligence. They knew that we knew they existed and we were next.

These things came from our well and they pretend to be people. They kill them and then live inside their skin like a costume. They could be your neighbor, they could be your sister. The only clue you have that they are not who they say they are, are when they have the skin slip for a second or when they try to pronounce words with a ch sound. Like Chocolate, Charlie, or Chalk. Instead they make this guttural clearing or choking sound. 

My name is John Bowman and we live on Myrtle Hill road in Ohio. If you live near here then be warned that they are roaming through the woods and they have already claimed the lives of several of our neighbors.

Once they know you are aware of them, then you are next. It’s only a matter of time. 

These things are real, and they’re multiplying!
