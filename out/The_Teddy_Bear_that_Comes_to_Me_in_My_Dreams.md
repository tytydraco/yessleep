That nightmare started haunting me about six months ago.
It all began with a dream.

I saw a teddy bear — just an old plush toy, brown and worn, with dull glass bead eyes. But something about it felt wrong. Maybe it was the faded fur, rubbed thin by too many hands, or the subtle, almost invisible sense that its stillness wasn’t natural.

The bear was sitting in a dusty, half-lit room, in a vintage armchair covered with faded fabric. I took a step closer — and the toy slowly turned its head toward me.

“I played with Andrey! It was so much fun!”

The voice was bright and cartoonish, like something from an old children’s cassette tape, yet the sound came straight from the stuffed toy’s body — no speaker, no mechanism.

I didn’t feel fear — only a cold, sharp confusion.
Who was Andrey? The name meant nothing to me. I opened my mouth to ask — but the sound of my alarm clock tore the world apart.

When I woke up, my room felt strange. The walls seemed too close, the air thick and heavy. In the corner stood an armchair — empty, yet I couldn’t bring myself to look at it for a while.

The day dragged on, dull and gray, until that evening a notification popped up in my school chat:

“Andrey’s dead.”

The chat, usually silent, suddenly came alive — questions, condolences, fragments of memories. It took me half an hour to realize who they meant. Andrey… We went to the same class, but barely talked — different circles, different lives. I wouldn’t even have recognized him on the street. They said he was driving late at night when he suddenly felt sick, lost control, and crashed into another car.

I remembered the dream.
A coincidence, I told myself. “Andrey” is a common name. Nothing more. I pushed the thought of the teddy bear out of my mind and got back to my routine.

Two months passed.
The dream returned. The same dusty room, the same heavy air, the same old chair in the corner. The bear was there — waiting. Motionless. Time itself seemed frozen around it. My heart started pounding; my hands trembled. Still, curiosity won over fear. I took a step forward. The floorboards creaked — the sound echoed strangely in the silence.

The toy twitched. Its glass eyes glimmered with a dead light.

“I played with Larisa! It was so much fun!”

A burst of childish laughter — many voices at once, bright and distorted — filled the room, bouncing off the walls like dust motes singing in the air.

I woke up with a ringing in my ears.

At work, when I saw Larisa’s office door closed, a tight wave of dread hit my chest. She was always early, always smiling, her desk smelling faintly of coffee from a paper cup. Today, her door was locked.

I told myself she’d just overslept, or got stuck in traffic. Didn’t want to make a scene. I sent her a message and went to my own desk, but I couldn’t stop glancing at that door.

By noon, she still hadn’t shown up. No replies. No calls answered. The unease became unbearable. Finally, I told my boss. He frowned, tried calling her himself, then found her mother’s number.

Two hours later, the news came crashing down. Her mother, worried after our call, went to Larisa’s apartment. She found her lying in the hallway — lifeless.
The paramedics said she’d died early that morning. Heart failure.

The dream came flooding back, suffocating me.
Andrey’s death I could dismiss — he’d been almost a stranger. But Larisa… her death hit like losing a piece of myself. I tried to convince myself it was coincidence. Maybe my subconscious noticed something was wrong with her before she died. Maybe my brain twisted that into a nightmare.

But deep down, I knew — the bear would come back.
And I was terrified to find out whose name it would speak next.

A month ago, it returned.
Same room. Same stale air. Same cursed chair. The teddy bear sat perfectly still, its glassy eyes catching the dim light. I froze, my skin crawling. Then the bear turned its head.

“I played with Karina! It was so much fun!”

Karina. My ex-girlfriend. We’d broken up long ago but stayed on good terms. If I’m honest, my feelings for her had never truly faded.
Hearing her name broke something in me. I dropped to my knees, tears streaming down my face. I begged the bear to spare her.

I woke up trembling, soaked in cold sweat. My hands shook as I grabbed my phone. I called her again and again — no answer. My heart raced; thoughts scattered like birds in a storm. I called our mutual friends. One finally told me Karina was on vacation in Turkey with a friend.

It took a while to reach that friend. When she finally picked up, groggy and annoyed, I was shouting, crying, trying to explain that Karina was in danger. She didn’t understand at first, but eventually threw on a robe and went to Karina’s room. I could hear her knocking, calling her name — silence.

She fetched a hotel staff member. After some arguing, he unlocked the door.
The hinges creaked — then came the scream. A raw, soul-tearing scream that still echoes in my head.

The phone slipped from my hands. I collapsed to the floor, sobbing.

Later, the friend told me what she saw: Karina lying on the floor by the bed, eyes wide open, face frozen in horror. The doctors said her heart had stopped.

The next day, I quit my job.
Days blurred together — endless searching, reading, trying to understand. Psychology, dreams, the paranormal — nothing helped. I wasted nearly all my savings on psychics and fortune-tellers. None of them could explain it.

What terrified me most was the not knowing.
What was it? A curse? A warning? A prophecy?
And why me?

Last night, the teddy bear came back.
Its head turned toward me. The glass eyes gleamed.
Then that sweet, cartoonish voice — full of childlike delight — sang softly:

“Soon, we’ll play together.
It’s going to be so much fun…”
