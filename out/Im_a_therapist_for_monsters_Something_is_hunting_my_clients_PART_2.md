 

Hey everybody, my last post was just a few days ago but a lot has happened since then, Monsters being slaughtered in unimaginable ways i didn’t think were possible. All done by the same being, Timeo himself. I went to Lucifer with no luck, he’s afraid of him, which is saying alot coming from the devil himself. My only chance to find out how to stop this threat is go to the big man in the sky himself: Yahweh.

I aligned the salt into a circle around me and lit the candles properly, I sat in the center and cleared my mind. I felt myself falling into darkness before not being able to breathe, I opened my eyes and found myself looking at a light above me. I felt myself drawing so I swam to the surface to see a kingdom enveloped in light. I brushed myself off and began to walk towards the gates to see St Peter with a key. “Tessa? Long time no see! How are things down there?” He asked with a smile on his face. “You didn’t hear, did you?” I asked, he looked at me concerned. “They never tell me anything, I only let people into heaven here. I don't question much afterwards.” he replied, a look of concern growing on his face. “I need to speak to the high council here, the archangels, somebody, anybody.” I pleaded, he nodded and let me in, “I must warn you they all seem rather busy as of lately.” He said, opening up the large golden gates. I walked through to see large open meadows of grass with bright vibrant flowers, kids and young adults picked fruit from bright green trees and two rivers ran alongside a glossy brick path to the kingdom.

I walked through the doors into the small city, it looked like that of New York but there was no misery, only happiness and hope. I wanted to stay, but knew I had to help the monsters that were being slaughtered. This is bigger than them and it's bigger than me as well, I need to go up to the top and see if they can stop this madness before it escalates beyond monsters. I arrived at the house. The creator, yahweh, god, whatever he goes by when it comes to you. His house was humble, a simple log cabin next to a large lake with birds perched along the shore. I sighed as I began to walk to his door. I knocked on the door three times and heard walking. He slowly opened the door. “Tessa, my child! What a lovely surprise, how are you feeling today?, I kid, please come inside this is very important,” He said. He wore a coat similar to that of a lumberjacks with a short brown beard and short hair spiked up in the front. I nodded as I stepped inside.

His house had a warm feeling, I mean he was god so why wouldn’t it? He pulled out 2 small kitchen chairs and turned them into arm chairs. “Please sit down with me Tessa, we have a lot to discuss.” He sat down and pulled two mugs of coffee out of nowhere and offered me a cup, it was always exactly the way I liked it. His smile quickly faded as he used his hand to pull a coffee table into existence where he laid out a piece of paper. “I know why you’re here, it's Timeo.” He said, his expression dead serious, I leaned in. “Can you ring him in? I mean obviously he’s one of yours-” God cut me off “He’s not one of mine, I think you need to really know my origin. The genesis of this world, and its surrounding universe.” he said, his tone dead serious. “I’m ready,” I said after a moment of silence. He nodded as he began to explain his origin.

“Billions of years ago, before the creation of this universe there was nothing but darkness, no light, no nothing. No singular cell could survive in this nothingness, except for me. I was formed into being and my birth caused the big bang, for the next few billion years I would shape the cosmos for there to be light no matter where you looked. It wasn’t enough though, in the back of my mind I knew something else was there. It lurked in the shadows and never showed itself, but I knew its intentions, its goals to complete when I was finished. Eventually the fear of me being alone with this thing was too much so I made animals to keep me comfort, to ensure I could calm myself knowing I could go to these innocent beings and be happy and avoid the thing lurking in space. Eventually I made Adam and Eve, and when I did the tree of genesis formed, its apples were filled with the thing that I feared. So I warned them, I told them to never eat the apples or they would feel the fear I did. I didn’t want humanity to suffer but- It wasn’t Lucifer who tempted Eve that day, it was Timeo. He tempted her into eating the fruit and she did, so out of fear I cast them out to not infect the others with this fear, but it was already too late.”

“Over the next thousand years I kept trying to limit the spread of his influence, I did terrible things to try and keep him at bay. I tried to make it up to them when they came here but I can never forgive myself for the things I did, sending my son to cleanse the fear from them only to fall to it himself.” he teared up and rested his head in his hands, “How do we beat him?” I asked, he looked at me with dry eyes, “we can’t, I can’t. Best I can think of is to prevent him from taking too much control, do not let fear influence your decisions” He said, sipping from his cup. “Is that all? This guy is out there murdering monsters and your advice is to not let him influence my decisions? Can you do anything?”I asked, he looked up at me with tears in his eyes, “he was here wasn’t he?” he nodded, I took a step back, feeling panic rising in the back of my chest. “Archangel Michael was put in critical condition from his attack but he managed to thwart him off, he’s lucky angels can’t die.” He looked at me, he grabbed my arm and imbued a rose vine like tattoo across my forearm. “Look to it when you’re in his presence to feel comfort,”he said, I smiled as he waved his hand.

I shot out from the salt circle, when I did I heard a distinct tapping on the windows of my kitchen, I knew what it was. It was an alternate, I looked outside to see myself staring back, an impossibly wide grin and wide expressionless eyes. Its jaw was hanging open as its arms were to its side. I waved at it and it opened the door to come inside, “what’s your name?” I asked it, it tilted its head and started to move its jaws to form letters. “My…. Name… Does…. Not… Matter” its voice came out like static, it was clearly difficult for it to speak. “So I’m assuming you all were displaced with that new being on the rise?” I asked, slowly nodding, “so why come here?” “To… Seek… Help,,,""You won’t get any here, I spoke with Yahweh, this threat is older than him ""What… Is… his… Name…?””Timeo, his name is Timeo, he killed one of my clients when I met him. Saying he would make humanity be put back on the food chain””I…Know…Him…” “You do?” I asked, leaning forward to look it in the eyes. It nodded its head slowly.

The alternate turned and gestured for me to follow, I followed it into the woods where I noticed the blue mushrooms begin to glow brighter and brighter. Only to realize they were connected to antlers, the being stood up and gestured for us to walk into the hole it covered. The being looked similar to that of a water buffalo, but with massive antlers the size of the tall spruce trees surrounding us. When we walked inside I saw several monsters and creepy story characters, some you might know, some you might not. At the front of the group was an injured skin walker missing his arm, his eyes glowed yellow and his antlers were snapped off brutally. Behind him stood the rake, long horse, the cartoon cat, and a severely injured slenderman. “I can’t believe you guys survived, I thought you 4 would be high profile targets due to your fame.” I said in disbelief.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We were able to get away from him thanks to the skinwalkers and alternates,” Cartoon cat said, Slenderman nodded as the alternates worked to seal the door shut. “Oh I’m afraid nobody can get away from me” Said a familiar voice, I turned around and was frozen in fear. There sitting in the empty chair was Timeo. “How did you get in here?” I asked, he laughed as he took a puff of a cigar. “You know I can't understand how you people can smoke these things, all they do is make me cough” He laughed, the remaining skinwalkers huddled around the surviving monsters, the alternates stood guard, grabbing short swords. He smiled and poured a cup of tea for himself, “I hope you know one thing, everyone else says’ it’s nothing personal’, but for me? Oh it is very, very personal, how long has society worried about things that couldn’t hurt them? The dark? The boogeyman? No more, society shouldn’t be wasting away! It's time to have fun with my new toys.” He smiled as he sipped his tea, I looked at the vine tattoo on my arm and immediately felt safe again. An alternate grabbed him from behind and threw him to the ground.

“Interesting” he said, immediately recovering back to his stance. He grabbed the alternate and in a split second it burned into ash, Slenderman extended his tendrils and tried to restrain him but immediately got pulled in and had his throat slit. I watched in horror as the monsters I had come to know and love over the years were mercilessly slaughtered, an alternative threw me out of my trance and began to drag me out of the hideout. “Come…On…We…Can…get..to…safety..” It said, showing the emotion of fear even though its mouth was stuck in a grin. All of a sudden it was impaled and dragged back by Timeo, I was alone, the woods grew tall around me as the night enveloped it into darkness. I Began to panic as I heard all of the animals silence themselves. An apple fell down next to me, it was jet black. “Take the bite Tessa, see what Eve and Adam saw when they took that bite, you know you want to.” He chuckled from the distance, I crawled myself against a tree as I saw his silhouette appear and disappear throughout the low hanging fog.

I looked away and looked back to find his face inches from mine, a massive smile on his face. I tried to run but my legs were numb with fear, I began to crawl away as he slowly walked over me. That same smile on his face, his clothes were covered in monster blood, he bent down to get to my level. “You know something Tessa, this is fun for me. The thing about you is I need you alive, because you’re the only mortal being who has a connection to Yahweh. And I’ll come visit you every night if I need to, because he is the one I need to complete my plan. Now you are going to warn him, tell him I will not be so kind to his people, on humanity if he doesn’t give me what I need.” He said, “Piss off!” I screamed, he laughed “You think I care if you want to do this or not? I only need you as leverage, someone he knows he can’t let down.” Timeo said, picking me up and setting me up on a tree stump, still frozen in fear. “What the fuck do you want?”
