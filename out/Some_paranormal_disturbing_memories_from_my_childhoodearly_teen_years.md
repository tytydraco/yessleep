Hi guys! I wanted to share some of the things I remember from back when I was a child that now seems... weird

Be me, 4 or 5yo, watching CN or whatever, being invested in the TV, hypnotised as a kid is while watching cartoons. 

There were two big shelves on the two sides of the tv, 5 floors of glass shelves with glasses and stuff in them. Just while I was watching, laying on the carpet, all the glasses fell, from nothing. It want an earthquake or something like that. I know it because only the glasses fell, not the shelves. And they were deep, if it was an earthquake, there couldve been at least one remaining there. 

There wasn't. I remember my mother coming to the room and how she started to scream at me about the mess from all the glass across the floor. She soon realised it wasnt me. I wasnt tall enough to reach the upper shelves.

Yesterday I asked her if she remembered. She told me she did and went silent... That confirms i wasnt dreaming.. Its honestly creepy that i whould've died this day.

During puberty I had a lot of sleep paralysis, but some of them were really fucked up. Once, my parents were doing some changes to my room so i had to sleep in the living room. 

There was a big mirror in there, just standing on the table next to the wall, facing my bed cuz we were planning to put it on my wardrobe in my bedroom the next day. I woke up at night to see a bald, pinkish man with a black robe staring at the window. 

He noticed me and shakes his hand to greet me... somehow, i managed to wave him back. Then, he stayed for a bit and got back in the mirror... I broke it in the morning, I was terrified. When my parents asked me why tf did i broke it, i said i dropped it by mistake down the stair and it wasn’t intentionally. Hell it was. 

To this day, i don’t know what the hell that think was, but im sure i wasnt sleeping. I couldnt fall sleep again that night, i spend the whole 4 hours staring at the mirror till the sun came out. 

One night, around an year later, i woke up to my brother, sitting on my gaming chair, watching me. He was just staying there, in the dark, watching me. I was still asleep so i just I asked him why isnt he sleeping, not thinking much about it. He said he is drawing. I yawned and turned around, ready to fall asleep again... just to see my brother, sleeping next to me on the bed. 

Then, i heard a pen falling behind me... I did not fuckng turned around, I couldnt. When I woke up, I picked up the pen. Wtf. A fking pen on the ground next to my bed… My room got a ton of things on the floor of my room, its a mess i admit it but… it was too weird for it to be a coincidence. 

I asked my brother if he could sleep on the couch in the living room tonight. He agreed, asking me why. I told him i wanted to be alone. He was 9 so i dont know what did he thought i wanted to do. Not like i knew, i just… felt good being alone this night. 

Thanks to anyone who listened till the end, my story might not be the most interesting or extraordinary here but i wanted to share as... I rlly find it... creepy…
