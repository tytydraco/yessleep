This whole... fiasco... started on a pretty normal day, just like any other. I woke up, got dressed, and headed out for work. I decided to take the bus that morning since I had accidentally slept in a little and I was already running later than I would've liked. As I boarded the bus and showed the driver my ticket, I noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye. It was a figure, lurking in the back of the grimy bus, watching me with dark, unblinking eyes. I couldn't make out any features, but I could feel its gaze boring into me, making my skin crawl. I glanced in its direction, still about 37% asleep, but I saw nothing other than a few other people, mostly glued to their phones.

I quickly shook off the feeling. I had stayed up pretty late the night before having an impromptu horror movie marathon, so it was entirely possible that the combination of a lack of sleep plus the horror movies from the night before was having lingering effects.

At first it seemed like it was just a case of my own mind working against me, but the figure seemed to follow me wherever I went. It was always there, just out of sight, watching and waiting. After a while I honestly started to feel like I was losing my mind.

One night, I was alone in my apartment, trying to relax after a long day. But as I was lying in bed, I heard a strange noise coming from the corner of the room. It was a low, guttural growl, like something out of a nightmare. I sat up, my heart pounding in my chest, and saw the figure standing in the shadows.

I couldn't move, couldn't speak. All I could do was stare, frozen in terror. The figure stepped forward, revealing its true form. It was a creature, with long, bony claws and skin as black as coal. Its eyes glowed with an otherworldly crimson light, and its mouth twisted into a sinister grin, revealing rows of elongated teeth far too sharp to be human.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The creature approached me, its claws reaching out to touch my face. I closed my eyes, waiting for the worst, but then something strange happened. The creature's touch was gentle, almost comforting. In a hoarse voice which seemed to echo through my mind, it whispered something in my ear in a language I couldn't understand, but its tone was oddly soothing, almost maternal.

When I opened my eyes again, the creature was gone. I was alone in my room, but I could still feel its presence, like a warm, protective aura.

The encounter with the creature left me shaken and confused. I couldn't explain what had happened or why the creature had seemed so threatening at first, only to become comforting in the end. But as the days went by, I started to notice changes in myself.

I began to have vivid dreams, filled with strange, otherworldly landscapes and creatures that I couldn't even begin to describe. In these dreams, I felt like I was being guided by a presence that was both ancient and powerful. And when I woke up, I felt more rested and energized than ever before.

At first, I was afraid of these dreams, but then I started to look forward to them. I felt like I was being shown something important, something that could change my life forever. And as the dreams continued, I began to understand what the creature had whispered to me that night.

It was a message of hope, of power, and of transformation. The creature had shown me a path that I could follow, a way to tap into the hidden potential within myself. And as I took my first steps down that path, I felt a sense of purpose that I had never felt before.

As the days turned into weeks, and then into months, I became increasingly obsessed with the creature and the dreams it had shown me. I couldn't stop thinking about it, couldn't let go of the feeling of power and transformation that it had left within me.

At first, I tried to keep my obsession under control. I continued to go about my daily life, going to work, seeing friends, and trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy. But as time went on, my behavior became increasingly erratic.

I started to withdraw from my friends and family, spending more and more time alone, meditating on the dreams and the message that the creature had given me. I stopped going to work, convinced that there were more important things that I needed to focus on.

And then, one day, the creature appeared to me again. This time, it was no longer just a presence in my dreams. It was real, standing before me in all its terrifying glory.

I should have been afraid, but instead, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. The creature spoke to me, its voice echoing in my mind like a chorus of ancient spirits. It told me that it had chosen me for a reason, that I had been blessed with a gift that few others could understand.

And then it offered me a choice. I could continue to fight against it, to try and deny the truth of what I had become. Or I could accept it, embrace the darkness and the power that lay within me.

In that moment, I knew what I had to do. I accepted the creature as a part of my life, and it accepted me in turn. From that day forward, I became something more than human, something ancient and powerful.

But as my powers grew, so did my madness. I became isolated, spending more and more time in the shadows, communing with the creature and the other beings that inhabited that world beyond ours. And though I knew that I was losing my grip on reality, I couldn't bring myself to care.

As I accepted the creature into my life, I felt its presence grow stronger and more oppressive. It was no longer a comforting guide but a malevolent force, twisting my thoughts and desires to its own ends.

The dreams it showed me were no longer filled with strange landscapes and creatures. They were nightmares, horrific visions of blood and pain, of twisted and mutilated bodies, of grotesque rituals that made my stomach turn.

And yet, I could not turn away. The creature had become a part of me, and I was addicted to the feeling of power that it gave me.

As I delved deeper into the darkness, I began to lose control of my own mind. I lashed out at those around me, alienating friends and family with my erratic behavior. I lost my job, my home, and any sense of stability that I had once had.

And still, I could not resist the call of the creature. It promised me even greater power, if only I would continue to serve it.

And then, last night, it appeared to me in person. It was a grotesque thing, all twisted flesh and glowing eyes. It spoke to me in a voice that echoed through my very bones, promising me a future beyond my wildest dreams, if I would just follow it into its kingdom of darkness and shadows.

But as it spoke, I could feel my sanity slipping away. I knew that I was in the grip of a force that was beyond my understanding, and that it was slowly destroying me.

I have realized that I have been deceived  and that this creature is not a guide or a mentor, a muse or a guardian. It is a monster. One far beyond my ability to resist.

I fear that I may not live long enough to escape this fate that I have brought upon myself, so I am sharing my story here in the hopes that at least a few people remember me after I am dragged into the creature's hellish domain.
