Hello so I am a man who is not what most would call “paranormal”. I grew up around quite weird shit, whether it be in drug infested mobile homes or backwoods where the only person was almost a mile away.  

This… thing though… it definitely put a new page in which could be a horror story. I’m not talking about a fucking boogie man or little zombie no no no it was different in any and every worse way it could be. Like most stories and recollections it starts out normal. Me and my ex best friend decided to go on a hike of sorts to where we’d walk on a trail then go off it and basically freestyle throughout the woods(we both grew up in very wooded parts of the us so brush didn’t bother us in the slightest). It wasn’t that bad of a morning even tho it was a bit foggy it didn’t make a difference to me.

 About twenty ish minutes going deep on a more experienced hikers path we decided that we shall go off of it and go up the mountain since it was said a little waterfall was up near the top. Suddenly I heard “it”. A slight scream. 

 A scream that sounded like someone’s throat was filled with blood and they tried to let out a shout of sorts yet it was distorted terribly. My hairs shot up and my friend looked back at me with a face so white he looked like a corpse. We sort of ran up the hill for a good couple minutes and tried to not let it get to us since we honestly loved hiking and the woods itself.

 The second I started thinking about the waterfall is when I smelt it… that horrible fucking smell. It smelled like a dead body that had rotted in an oven for months in the summer. It was beyond putrid and we had realized it. We was walking in circles. From what I thought was us heading up we was actually walking downhill. My look went blank and me and my friend decided to look at a gps or some sort, yet nothing fucking worked. 

 We decided to book it in any direction we didn’t care we needed to leave immediately. From the corner of my eyes I could see its mouth fucking god the teeth… it was like shredding out of its gums while blood and some sort of disgusting plack like substance covered it. I cried. Not even tears of sadness or being “scared”. I had pure dreadful fear. A thought shot across my mind of me dying knowing that if this fowl mockery of a beast caught me I’d die a gruesome and terrible death. 

 Tears ran down my face and with the worst decision of my entire life I decided to turn… and look. I saw its face. Pure white with a horrible crepid mouth of sharp razor like teeth and eyes with nothing but fucking darkness. Eyes so dark my soul reflected upon them and fear embarked me. Then it happened. It stopped just entirely. Right from where I last saw it and the worst was yet to come. It moaned my name out. A moan that wasn’t sexual or silly no. It was as if a person succumbing to illness slowly moaned a name out with their dying breath.

 I couldn’t hold it back anymore and looked forward once again to see my best friend yelling my name out to hurry. The embrace of his arms pulling me into his car felt somewhat nice. Yet I had no memory of us going to his car? He looked shocked that I was awake and then told me what happened. 

 He explained how we woke up that morning and went into the woods then I took off running without him, then while searching for me hours later he found me almost naked yet my clothes was folded neatly beside me. My face was cold to the touch so he thought I was dead but felt a pulse so he dressed me kinda then rushed me to his car so we could go to an emergency room. It was so… confusing. That was 4 months ago and every time I close my eyes I can see “it”. That thing just moaning my name out. Me and my best friend completely stopped talking right after that seeing how trauma had almost pushed us apart now.

If anyone can tell me what this thing may be I would be more then grateful to know, my mind has been cluttered ever since
