I'm a bugman—an exterminator—by trade, but old and retired now. I used to live in New York City in my heyday, if you'd believe it, but try living there nowadays on a bugman's salary, so years ago I moved out to a little town called Erdinsfield. Boring place but with nice enough people.

A few months ago I ran into a townsman named Withers. He saw me in the grocery store, and though I did my best to look the other way, before I knew it he was calling me over, and unfortunately my mother raised me too polite to straight up ignore somebody like that.

“Say, Norm, didn't you say once you were an exterminator?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I did say that I *was.*”

“Because I think I may have a little bitty insect problem.”

“...as in: I ain't one no more.”

“Oh, no pressure,” said Withers. “If you have time and could take a look. Not in a professional capacity. Friendly-like. We could invite you to dinner, eat a meal and then you could maybe have a little gander.”

“Sure,” I said, regretting it even as I shook his hand, and got what felt like a static shock for my trouble. Maybe the world was reminding me of the price of my stubbornly good nature.

We agreed I'd drop by next Saturday.

When I got there, I could smell Mrs Withers’ cooking, and it smelled delicious, so I thought, *What the hell, eh?*

We sat down, Withers, Mrs Withers, the two little Withers and me, and shared cutlets, mashed potatoes and a side of boiled beets. I have to admit, I hadn't had a home cooked dinner as good as that since my wife died. “Well, that was much better than alright,” I said after I was done, and Mrs Withers smiled and Mr Withers said I was welcome to come again any time I liked. Then he got up—which I felt was my cue to get up too—and led me to a room in which blue bugs were crawling up and down the exterior wall. They were a most extraordinary colour. “Used to be my office,” said Withers, “but I obviously can't work from here any more.”

There was no question in my old mind that this was an infestation, but even after racking my brains I couldn't figure out an infestation *of what.* I'd never seen insects like these. I crouched down to look at them and they seemed to sense my interest and disperse.

“They don't bite or anything like that, but I still don't want them in my house. And they're spreading too. I think they're in the walls, maybe eating through the wood frame too.”

“I don't think they eat wood,” I said, remembering the various pests I'd met in my life, “but I can't honestly tell you what they are either.”

“I guess they have different bugs in New York City. Do you think I should get someone to eliminate them?” Withers asked.

“That would be my advice.”

“Someone local?”

“That would be reasonable. If there's one thing I know about pests it's that if you have them, so does somebody else.”

“Even though they're not doing anything?”

“What's that?” I asked.

“I mean: do you think I should have them eliminated despite that they're not doing anything bad.”

“They're in your house,” I said. “That's reason enough.”

Withers smiled brightly. “You're right, of course,” he said, and he thanked me and held out his hand.

We shook—again I felt a static discharge—and he repeated his invitation, that I was welcome to dinner any time. “I truly do appreciate you taking a look. That's not something you got a lot of in the city, I bet. Helpfulness and hospitality.”

“People *are* a lot warmer here,” I said.

“Oh yes. Certainly.”

Then I went home and forgot all about Withers and his insect problem. Lived my retired life, fixed up my old house to pass the hours. Until that time of year came around again—November, the month my wife died. I drove up to New York City to visit her grave, and in the sad loneliness of the drive back remembered Withers, Mrs Withers and the little ones, remembered family, and the next day called them to invite myself for dinner. It was a moment of weakness that, in my tough younger years, I would've been ashamed of, but I've learned since that there's no nobility to suffering on your own, and when people offer you help—you better take it. “How lovely to hear from you,” Mrs Withers said over the phone after I'd introduced myself. “Of course you can join us for a meal!”

That is how I arrived, for the second time, at the Withers household.

It was Mrs Withers who met me at the door this time. Withers himself was still changing out of his work clothes, she said, but would join us soon. The two children were already seated at the dining room table, plates of meat, potatoes and vegetables before them. I noticed, too, that Mrs Withers was wearing a beautiful white dress; but there was a dark spot on it. But before I could point it out—decide whether I *should* point it out—it disappeared. “Is anything wrong?” Mrs Withers asked.

“Oh no,” I said. “Just an older man fighting his eyesight.”

“I know how that can be. I used to get these spots in my peripheral vision. On my eyes, I mean. One minute, they'd be there. And, the next: gone!”

She laughed, and from the dining room the children laughed too.

“You don't get them anymore?” I asked.

“No, not anymore. It's all better now."

“Listen,” I said. “Would you mind if this old man used your bathroom?”

I could feel tension but not its cause, and I wanted to back away from it. When you're young, sometimes you crave that kind of stuff. When you get old, you realize it'll just cause trouble, and trouble is simply another word for an unnecessary effort.

“Please,” she said and pointed down the hall. “It's the door right next to the bedroom.”

I thanked her and walked slowly down the hall. I really did mean to use the Withers’ bathroom, if only to calm my nerves, which I blamed on the emotional time of year,  but the bedroom door was open—slightly ajar—and as I got to it I could hear, if faintly, a scraping and a pitter-patter, and so I gently pushed the door open and saw, laid upon the bed, like an article of clothing, Withers’ skin!

I would have screamed if I hadn't the instinct to stuff my fist into my mouth.

Instead, I bit hard into my hand and watched in horror as thousands-upon-thousands of blue bugs marched single file up the footboard of the bed and *into* Withers’ nearly flat, creaseless skin—filling, inflating it as they did, until he was ordinarily voluminous again, but less like a man and more like a balloon, and when his body suddenly sat up, I turned and ran into the bathroom, shut the door and wondered whether I had gone insane.

When I came out, the bedroom was empty, and I went into the dining room, where all four Withers were sitting at the table, smiling and waiting for me. “How wonderful to see you again,” Withers said to me.

“I'm grateful to be here,” I said and sat before my meal. But all I could think about was how soft Withers’ body looked—all of their bodies—soft and unstable, like waterbeds. Like jellyfish. “Did you ever get that infestation sorted out?” I asked.

“It turned out to be nothing,” he said, as a small blue bug emerged from behind one of Mrs Withers’ eyelids, crawled across her unblinking eyeball, and vanished behind her lower lid. “Resolved itself. No exterminator required.”

A few more bugs dropped from the youngest Withers’ nostril. Scurried across the table.

Her brother opened his mouth, and drooled—and on the end of that string of drool, dangling above his plate of food, was a bug.

“Well, that's the best. When the infestation resolves itself,” I said, *knowing that no infestation resolves itself.* It wasn't even cold enough yet for some of the bugs to have perished naturally.

The Withers said in unison: “We did find one other local exterminator, but we eliminated him. He wasn't doing any harm. Then again, isn't that just how you like it?”

I had fallen so deep into my seat now I was in danger of sliding off it, under the table. Their voices combined in such an abominable way. “Shall you imbibe of him with us?” they asked.

I swiped at the plate in front of me—sending it clattering against the far wall; forced myself up from my chair—and dashed for the front door: next down the front steps, tripping over my own feet as I did, and falling face-first but conscious against the cold exterior of my truck.

They watched from the dining room window as I pulled open the driver's side door, crawled shaking inside, turned the ignition and reversed out of the driveway onto the street. They may have even waved at me, and I could swear that from the inside of my own head, *you're welcome back any time,* they told me. *Any time at all.*

I didn't go home. I drove straight into the city. To its coldness and its anonymity. I rented a room and drank until I could hazily forget, even if only for a few hours, what I'd seen. I wanted to drink more, to drink so much that I passed out, but what prevented me was the most stabbing kind of stomachache I'd ever experienced.

I ran to the bathroom, collapsed onto the countertop and vomited into the sink. *Blood,* I thought, when I looked at what my body had expelled. But that was wrong. It wasn't blood at all—not red but dark blue—and moving, squirming: hundreds of little blue bugs, escaping down the sink drain and into the New York City sewer [system.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
