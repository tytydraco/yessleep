When I was young we lived in a poorer neighborhood and our across the street was some sort of group home. However it was very suspicious and I believe some sort of front for something as we would only see cars out there in the middle of the night, maybe 3 caretakers in total and had only seen one person man living there named Paul. Paul was a big overweight man, about 25 to 30 years old, with some sort of mental disorder like schizophrenia or autism.

One time at about 13 I was out for a walk when I passed by the home and was stopped by a small kittens.  It was huddled up along the fence and looked scared. Being that I'm a sucker for animals I picked up the kitten, just as I did Paul walked out. 

*Thats my cat. MINE! Don't touch him! ILL KILL YOU!* he yelled at me

He took the cat from me forcibly and stared. I was starting to get uncomfortable but reminded myself that Paul was handicapped and probably misunderstood my intentions with the kitten. Before I could explain the cat began to meow which upset Paul more.

*Shut up stupid kitty! Or I'll rip your fucking head off kitty*

My face turned white. At this point I was afaird. Paul was angry and he had me trapped between himself and the fence. He was still staring and getting closer, without hesitation I pushed him back and ran back to my house. I told my mom what happened and she told me to stay away from that house and that their was no way to help the kitten other then to tell Paul's caretakers. That was the last time I saw that kitten, I like to think that his care takers took the kitten and gave it up for adoption. I like to think that. 

Two weeks later my parents were out and my dogs needed to use the bathroom. It was December so it was already dark outside and very cold even though it was only 8. I hooked them up to the leash and opened the door. The dogs stopped dead outside the door and started barking. They looked afaird of something in the distance. I looked outside and their was Paul, standing naked in the street. He wasn't doing anything, just staring angerly at my house not moving. He seen me, turned to me, smiled, and started to walk my direction.

Terrified, I pulled my dogs into the house and locked all the doors. I called 911 as soon as I got inside. By the time they arrived Paul was gone. I told the cops what happened including the story about the cat and they went to the group home to check things out however, the lady in charge of the group home stated that this incident was just a misunderstanding.

*Paul is just a sweetheart. He wasn't outside but Paul sometimes forgets to put his clothes on after a bath so thats probably what happened.* 

They also said that they never seen a kitten living there nor had Paul ever mentioned having a kitten or threating anyone or anything. Clearly this wasn't the case and the group home was just trying to get rid of police as quick as possible. The group home was told to keep a watch on Paul and I was told once again to leave Paul and the group home alone. 

That was the last time I interacted with Paul or the group home again. I would still see the care takers outside interacting with cars in the middle of the night like I always did and I would see Paul from time to time walking around the yard or yelling various threats at the care takers but never went near him again. We moved out sometime later.
