I sit here looking at the blue painted walls with the same vintage movie posters I have had since I was 13. This room has been my comfort zone since I can remember, living in the basement I have always had a sense of independence even at early ages. 

I could customize it to my design, I never let my parents views bleed in here. I am a religious person but I don’t need a cross on every wall, proverbs on every mantel and paintings of Christ everywhere in between. 

Down here I had freedom, but now it seems like this will be my tomb. 

I write this not only to get out the raving anxieties eating at my insides like a starved tiger, but to perhaps rationalize what is the completely irrational. 

My parents are the he typical conservative Christian type, real republican poster children. Growing up my Sundays were completely haunted by 3 hour long morning sermons from a pastor with eyes that wandered to a disturbingly downward. You would think my moms eyes were on her chest if you even saw one conversation between the two.

The rest of my early childhood ends up being a blur of Sunday studies and so many prayers that when I even see a plate of food being set on a table (not that I have for a long time)  my hands reflexively go into a prayer without me even realizing it.

Once I got a little older around 16 I started to get sick of it, my friends would always post pictures of them at the beach on Sunday in bikinis that my mom would call an exorcist for if she ever saw me in.

Through months of rolling eyes and dirty looks during Sunday service my mom finally confronted me. 

“Are you questioning your faith?” She asked coming into my room unannounced one night a few months back.

“No mom, I still believe in him I just don’t know why I can’t have faith and do things my friends do at the same time.” I responded still hiding my true feelings.

“Honey, on the day of judgement we all must come to terms with our transgressions and make repent of our earthly sins. It is a fallen world after all, ever since the serpent tricked Eve in the garden we have had to learn to coexist with our natural born sin by…” she began.

I knew another sermon was coming, I needed an out.

“You’re right mom.” I said putting my hand on hers where she sat the end of my bed. 

“I was just falling into temptation, I won’t let it happen again trust me.” I said with my best fake smile I could muster.

“I trust you sweetheart, you know I was once young too believe it or not!” She said with a smile and a giggle before getting up to kiss me on the forehead and saying goodnight.

For the next few weeks I just tried to keep a low profile, do my best to put on a happy face around the creepy pastor but I slowly felt my faith slipping away. Service after service I became more and more detached and began to seriously question who exactly my parents consider as their faith. Do they really believe in god or is it just a helpful excuse to control my life further?

Last week I had enough, on Sunday night my friends texted me that they were going to a friends house to smoke weed and hang out. Sundays are lockdown days, I am absolutely not allowed to see any of my friends all day as it’s reserved entirely for family and prayer. 

However, living in the basement grants some privileges. Chief among which is my window, the screen door covers the window but can easily be popped out of place. So around 11pm after my parents were fast asleep I snuck out and bolted to my friends car waiting for me in the alley behind our house.

“Hey choir girl!” Ashley said as I jumped in the back seat like I was fleeing the scene of bank robbery.

“Drive, get me the fuck out of here!” I said tapping her shoulder relentlessly.

Once we pulled up to Ashley’s friend Megan’s house, she stopped, put the car in park and grabbed a baggie with a joint out of her back pack.  

“If I’m gonna be in the room with Josh now that he and Megan are dating I’m gonna need this.” She said fiddling with her lighter trying to get a spark before taking a puff and handing me the freshly lit joint. 

I have never smoked before, never even in the same room as someone who smoked cigarettes before. My immediate reaction was to say…

“No thank you” I said waving my hand in the air.

Ashley shrugged her shoulders, “suit yourself.” She said taking another hit.

We sat talking for a minute while she finished the joint. 

“Your parents still running a dictatorship?” Ashley asked after a brief moment of silence in the conversation.

“Ya the older I get the more they are convinced that whenever I’m out with friends I’m worshipping the devil or having orgies with every guy in town.” I responded rolling my eyes. 

“I mean not on Sundays at least” Ashley said before immediately bursting out laughing at her own joke. 

I laughed with her and once we both caught our breath, I stared at what little weed was left in her joint. 

“You know what? I’m dead if I get caught regardless.” I said holding my hand out to accept the joint. 

“Look at my choir girl go!” Ashley responded “you can finish it, my treat.” 

I took one puff and immediately thought I swallowed an ember. My throat burned like a building on fire and I coughed until my eyes watered and I was gasping for air like a drowning man. 

Ashley laughed and said “it’s okay you won’t have virgin lungs forever” 

After coughing my way through the rest of the joint we went inside. What little I remember mostly consisted of me being slumped on the couch like a weighted blanket was draped over me even though all I had was my hoodie and leggings on. 

When Ashley dropped me off a block from my house I got out and tried to smell every part of me to make sure the weed smell had stayed in the car.

As I turned the corner and saw the living room light on in my house I felt the ground fall from beneath me. My heart raced so fast I thought it would never stop.

I spent the next 10 minutes walking back and forth trying to think of what to do, until I decided that if I try to sneak back in through the window maybe they won’t notice. 

Walking to my backyard I caught a glimpse of my living room and my father was standing up in his pajamas walking back and forth talking on the phone, my mother was sitting on the couch with tears running down her cheeks, crouched over in prayer. 

At that moment I knew I was in trouble, my mom was in tears and my dad was rubbing his neck out of stress not looking far from tears either.

After sneaking back into my window I lay in my bed waiting to either fall asleep or be yelled at by my parents. I ended up falling asleep. 

Nothing too unusual happened during my sleep, I didn’t hear any strange noise or loud banging but when I woke up the stairs and door that led to the living room were gone. What was once my staircase and the only way out other than my window was just flat ground covered in the same hardwood my floor was. 

Jumping out of bed I ran to what now was solid ground trying to make any sense of the situation, how do my stairs just disappear? How did this happen over night? And how didn't I get woken up by it? 

An immediate sense of claustrophobia overtakes me, I feel the weight of a truck on my chest as I struggle for breath. 

I thought of my window and before the thought fully registered in my mind I had jumped on my bed and pulled on the window with every inch of my strength. 

It wouldn’t budge, and with a horror I can’t describe to this day I noticed, the window was welded shut.

I immediately grab any item in reach and throw it at my window, eventually picking up my entire wooden night stand and slamming it against the glass. It didn’t even crack. 

I got at this for what may have been hours, eventually I collapsed out of exhaustion. The only thing I can do now is scream. 

“MOM DAD! HELP ME! I’M TRAPPED!!” I shout until my voice breaks and tears fill my eyes like a bucket key in a hurricane. They didn't respond, no one came for me. 

My phone doesn’t have service or wifi, I have a tv and old classic dvds my dad owns but that’s it. No food, only water source is the sink in my bathroom.

I spend the rest of the day pacing back and forth, intermittently screaming out for help until I notice a figure walking past my window. 

I jump up to the window and start banging on the glass like a caged chimpanzee, it’s my mom. She’s sitting on our backyard furniture just staring into blank space, it looks like she has been crying for hours. Her eyes were blood red and tired, her face was puffy and downtrodden. I bang even harder on the glass, screaming at her.

“MOM I’M HERE PLEASE LET ME OUT!!” She doesn’t even move a muscle. What the fuck is happening? Is she ignoring me? Can she just not hear me? There’s no way she can’t hear me. I'm screaming as loud as I can and the windows aren’t that thick. 

Did they do this? Is that why she’s crying? What kind of twisted parents would do this to their own daughter? 

I remember laying in bed with these questions racing through my mind over and over. 

Once night fell I was still trapped, I laid in bed trying to sleep hoping it was just a bad dream or I would wake up and my stairs would be back and everything would be okay. They made their point, I won’t ever sneak out or touch weed again. 

With unimaginable dread the next morning I woke up and my stairs were still gone. 

I looked out my window again. Nothing, no one. Just the same patio furniture we have had since I was a toddler. I looked down and noticed all the clocks in my room and even on my phone had stopped. They all froze like a lake in the winter at 3:33 in the morning. 

The only way I could tell time now was through sundown and sunrise. 

I tried screaming again, I screamed and I screamed until my vocal cords were about to snap like old brake lines. 

I’ll never forget the panic, like coming out of a car crash. I knew I absolutely had to do something but I was fighting in a world I didn’t even understand. 

The threat I faced didn’t even have any direct attack, it stood ominously in front of me, I can’t quite describe it but just seeing that blank wall in the corner felt like a figure staring me down at the edge of my bed at every waking second. 

My panic quickly turned into a blind rage. Thoughts of the physical and emotional pain I would subject my parents for putting me here drove me as I picked up my battered night stand and flung it at the space my door used to be. 

Over and over with each crash against the wall the nightstand breaking into smaller and smaller pieces but the wall stood, not even a chip in the paint. 

I push my dresser over to the torturous space of nothing and start slamming the now scattered wooden pieces directly into the wall with all the strength I could muster. 

Nothing. 

I slumped down and caught my breath. There I sat, alone. Trapped in the place I once found comfort in but now see as a twisted prison cell playing tricks on my psyche.

For the rest of the day I just layed in bed and watched some of the old DVDs I had on my shelf. 

The next day I spent what I think was hours just looking out my window, it was fall now, when I became trapped it was the middle of summer.

How did it fast forward 2 months in a single night? My only perception of time was the daylight of my window. Had I really been in here that long? 

It seems every time I blink my eyes I lose days. But is it really a loss? What kind of life am I living if I’m just a rat in a lab being experimented on by some demented god?

From my perspective at the time of writing this I have been down here for 25430 sunsets. Not counting the first few nights I wasn’t keeping track. I’m not hungry, I’m not thirsty, and so much time has passed in my window that I don’t even know the people in my backyard anymore. My parents died years ago, but yesterday for me. 

I can’t ask for help. I know better now, I have shouted, cried, broken every piece of art and furniture in my room and the only change has been a chip in the paint size of my fingernail. 

This isn’t over me smoking weed, I don’t even know if this is my parents doing, how could it have been? Ever since the night my stairs vanished I haven’t heard a single creak from upstairs. 

People walk past every day, what would they say if they learned the suburban home they just walked past has had a girl in the basement for over 60 years?

For the first few nights I remember praying, but I now realize I was praying to my tormentor. If there is a god, he’s forgotten me.
