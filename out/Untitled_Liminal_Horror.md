What’s going on?

Where is everybody?

Why have the colors of the houses changed?

I know I am in my neighborhood. I am an exceptional navigator. The layout is the same. The houses are where they should be, but they are all a different color.

I know this should be my home. But it isn’t. All of my things are inside. The only thing I can’t seem to find is a bed or couch to lie or sit on. They are all gone.

The sun is gone. The clouds hide it, and while I know it is behind them, the clouds never cease their blockade.

The clouds are echoing. I hear trumpets. Trumpets playing strange music, dissonant chords, an eternal song of eeriness.

My pets are gone. Their collars lay on the floor of my non-home, but the tags are unengraved and the hair they once shed wildly is now sterily gone.

The grass is gray. Not dead, but not quite alive either. It’s as if something sucked the vitality out of them; yet, another something, or perhaps the same something, forces the grass to live on.

The phones are down. I tried calling someone with my cell phone, but I was greeted with the unending drone of a call that will never connect. I tried emergency services, but all they had to offer me was this:

“911, what is the location of your emergency?”

“I-I’m not sure. I think I’m lost?”

“Lost?”

“Yes, lost. Is there any way you can trace my call, or-”

“You are lost.”

“Yeah, lost, that’s what I said, so can you locate me or-”

“I am sorry to hear that. Goodbye.”

Then the phone hung up.

I tried calling them again - perhaps I would receive a different operator this time. Instead, I was greeted by the same droning tone that any other call resulted in.

I turned on the radio. The sound I heard was rather odd - it was the sound of a nasally, masculine voice simply going “aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa” until he ran out of breath. He would then inhale, and try again. I listened for hours, but all I heard was this, and it was broadcast to every channel, AM and FM.

Then I decided to retrace my steps. This all started when I got home from work. I should get in my car and go back.

The roads are smooth.

Really smooth, as if they were just paved and I get to try them out for the first time.

Traffic lights are all green. All of them, they are only green, even if it would mean a traffic conflict.

All the drivers are gone.

I am the only one on the road.

I still hear the trumpets.

No matter how loudly I play my music, the trumpets still play.

The parking lot of my workplace is empty. 

At least there’s a spot for me.

I have to go inside.

—

Abandoned.

It’s abandoned.

Where did everything go?

My coworkers, the customers, they were all here not a few hours ago, when I left.

Where could they have gone?

The shelves are empty and decrepit.

The once colorful advertisements littered about the store are now yellowed, smelly, and cracked.

I have to go back outside. There’s something just too strange for me to stay here.

—

The store sign is gone.

All that remains is the ghastly outline of the logo that you see after a store shuts down or moves out.

My car.

What happened to my car?

It was just here.

Now the parking lot is empty again.

Who is playing those trumpets?

Where are they coming from?

I don’t know where I am.

I don’t know how I got here.

I don’t know how to get home.

Perhaps the trumpeteers will know.

They are in the clouds.

I must climb to them.

I must build a tower and climb to them.

They will welcome me.
