Hey everybody, Alphabet man here.

Do you know what the best part about being back on this side of reality is?

I can actually ANSWER your questions!

So, to recap, Gale and Celene almost got snapped up miasma that appeared in my freaking house. So, we talked about it and came up with a plan of attack. Well, Gale wants to attack, anyway, so I agreed that it might be time to arm ourselves with something that would stop them if they came back. Like some of you suggested, we have kitted out the house for optimal dispersal of miasma. Every light bulb in the house has been upgraded to the highest wattage I can get and the biggest lumen count available. We've also added lights in places that don't seem to have enough lights. Every room has at least one new lamp or tap light in it, and it makes even the dreariest room shine like the sun. We also got some of those jog lights for ourselves, the ones that make light so people can see you at night. We even got one for Buddy, a collar that makes him look like a one-dog rave. We all have those deer spotting lights that can flag down plains, and we're working on changing our sleep schedules so we can stay vigilant all night. I've never been one for night shifts so that part has taken some getting used to.

If I sound a little crabby while writing this, that's why.

I suggested that it might be a good idea to reach out to people who knew more about this than we do, but Gale wouldn't hear of it.

"You want to let them know where we all are?" he said, sounding incredulous.

"Gale, they already know where we are," I said, trying to stay calm in the face of his mounting hysterics.

I hadn't known Gale long, even though we had been through a lot, but this seemed out of place for him. The Gale I had known in the DGB, at least the Gale I'd known before he had gone into the ceiling, had always been resourceful and not prone to letting his emotions get the better of him like this. Even when he was overwhelmed, he always seemed to keep it together and make a plan. This Gale seemed barely in control of himself, and his paranoia was at an all-time high.

Though, I suppose, if shadow creatures had come to grab me in the middle of the night, I might be a little paranoid too.

"I don't want them knowing a damn thing about us. They're in league with those things. Hell, they probably ARE those things. We tell them that we know what they're up to and we give away our advantage."

"What advantage is that?" I asked Gale, "They know we all live together in a house that I bought with the money they gave me? Come on, Gale. They probably know when we take a dump and how much it weighs. These guys aren't some Scooby Doo villain. These guys are organized, but if they think that we might blab to the wrong people, then they might leave us alone again."

Gale blew air out of his nose, sounding agitated.

"If you go to them, then I'm leaving."

A silence hung between us as the words sank in.

"Gale!" Celene said, but he cut her off.

"If you're going to lead them straight to us, then I'll just go ahead and take my chances on my own. I might be harder to find if I just keep moving."

I wanted to rail at him, I wanted to make him see reason, but after a moment of just staring at him, I put my hands up and sighed.

"Fine, I won't call them. But we need to figure out what's going to happen then because tonight it was pretty clear that we had no clue what we were doing."

That was when we made plans to set up the defenses I talked about earlier, and ultimately what brought us to this point. We've been staying up all night and sleeping most of the day for the past week. Poor Buddy is taking it the hardest. The poor pooch was made to be a night dog, and he seems confused anytime I tell him to go back to bed when the sun's out. Usually, I just let him run in the backyard, but I always end up getting up to let him back in during the heat of the day. I'm lucky to get four hours of continuous sleep most days, and it feels like I'm just taking a series of cat naps. Gale seems to be doing the best out of us. He sits awake all night like it's his duty to guard us, then sleeps like the dead all day. Celene is doing pretty well, but I've caught her snoozing a time or two. 

This would have probably been a lot easier if we had done it right after coming back from the Beyond. In the Beyond, you always slept with the lights on. In the Beyond, you always slept when you were too tired to go on. There was no night or day, there was just time, and you passed that time as best you could. We were used to it, but after a few months in the real world, we've gotten used to sleeping when the sun goes down and being awake when it comes up.

It's weird though.

When I dream, I almost always dream that I'm back in the Beyond.

I can hear the soft buzz of the overhead lights, the tinny music that plays on the speakers, and silence that seems to moan at you after a while.

In my dreams, I go back to the Beyond, but they aren't nightmares, not always. Sometimes I go back to that first store, the one I destroyed, and search through the rubble for something. I don't what it is, but I know that I need it. Whatever I'm looking for, I never find it. I sift through the rubble, looking and looking, but I never discover what I've lost. Sometimes I find little reminders of my store, however. One night I found a coloring book that I had done, the adult kind with lots of swirls and little pieces. I had to wipe coffee ground off it, the moisture having wrecked the picture, but even wet and saturated, it was still beautiful. I couldn't believe I had destroyed it in my anger, and as I flipped through the book, I noticed there were pages at the back that I hadn't finished. I didn't remember these pages, but that's because I don't think they existed when I was here. They showed a forest of terrible crystals, their beauty undeniable. Inside the crystals were people, and as I flipped, I could see them turning into dust inside. Big shadow creatures were moving around, and as beautiful as the crystals were, the creatures looked like crayon drawings next to their complexity. They were moving around the crystals, tending to them, and as I flipped, I saw them bring in someone new. I don't know how I knew, but I knew it was Gale. The book started flipping pages in my hand then, and the images moved like a picture book. As they set Gale into the crystal that would grow around him, they put something into him. It was...well, it was like the opposite of light but it still shone. 

I know that doesn't make any sense, but it's the best I can do. It was inside him before they sealed him up, and as the crystal grew around him, it shone out with a strange dark light. Eventually, I came along and smashed his crystal and pulled him out, but even as we escaped, I could see that shard of darkness glowing inside him.

I wanted to tell them about the dream, but I knew Gale would scoff at it and Celene would just say it was nerves. 

I don't think it was, but I never got a chance.

We were attacked on the fourth night if you can call it an attack.

My neighbors probably thought I was insane because you could see my house from down the street. On the third day, we had to go get thicker curtains after the little old lady next door nicely asked me to turn my lights down because it was keeping her awake. If it had been the Karen that lived two houses down, I would probably told her to eat me raw, but Mrs. Gorbetts is such a nice old lady that I felt bad for keeping her awake. 

We bought blackout curtains and that peel-and-stick stuff that blacks out your windows, and Mrs. Gorbetts told me she slept like a baby the next day when I went to get my mail.

We all sat in the living room at night, the TV on but none of us watching it. Buddy was asleep in his comfy bed by the couch, his snoring making me a little jealous. Celene and Gale were on the couch, Celene cuddled up next to Gale and Gale looking like one of those stuffed husbands you saw online for lonely women. I was in my Lazyboy, drinking coffee and yawning. We were watching an old black and white movie, that was really all that was worth watching that late at night, and I was just about to suggest we find something on Netflix when something touched down on the carpet hard enough to make the board creak above our heads. It was followed by a loud roar that made Buddy jump up and bark, but it was gone a moment later.

"What," I started, but Gale put a finger over his lips.

"They're testing our defenses," he whispered, and sure enough there was another one from my room a moment later. Same thump, same loud roar, and then silence. Celene sat up, looking nervous but ready, and Gale put his big ole flashlight in his lap like they might come out of the crevices of the couch after him. We all kept our lights close by, mine was on the end table, and as much as I doubted they could get us I still put a hand on mine.

"I think," but Gale stopped as something big and dark stepped out of the small shadow cast by the TV stand. 

It rose to fill the room, but there was only so much shadow left. The shadows that remained were there to act like bear traps, or so Gale thought. He said if we covered all the shadows, then they might get desperate. If we left a couple, and they tried them, then it would tell them that they couldn't get far, and it wasn't worth the effort. 

The miasma sent one huge hand out towards Gale, but it turned to nothing as it came into the ocean of light we were bathed in.

We put our flashlights on it and burned it to a crisp as it grumbled away to nothing.

That was all for that night's battle, but the war wasn't over. 

The next two nights were spent probing for weaknesses.

It was surprising what the miasma could manifest from, and shadows we hadn't even considered were suddenly vantage points for them to come through. Some of these we took care of, some of them we left but made note of, but it never did them any good. The light stopped them, it made them as intangible as weak spirits, and we began to settle into our nocturnal lifestyle. It was easy since we didn't have jobs, or anywhere to be. My parents were a little concerned about why I was staying up all night and sleeping all day, but I told them I had a third-shift job at a call center and they bought it. Gale and Celene didn't even have that to contend with. Gales's family was either dead, estranged, or refused to believe it was him when he reached out. Celene was an only child with divorced parents, both of whom were dead. The cousins she had tried to reach out to either didn't remember her, didn't care, or didn't believe her. She and Gale really just had each other, and me, which was probably why we had clung so close together. Even my parents didn't really understand what I had been through, though I didn't tell them more than they needed to know, and it had brought the three of us, four if you counted Buddy, into a found family built on shared trauma.

So, when Friday came we were all on high alert. We had been attacked three nights running, and we fully expected tonight to be the big one. This would be when they put all their knowledge together and launched something big. Despite his whining, we had turned Buddy's collar on and it was providing an eye-tearing show within the living room. We had our lights, we had our reflectors, and we had even created some new shadows for them to test out. We were ready, all of us were used to staying up now and sitting in a kind of self-imposed preparedness.

When the sun came up and nothing had happened, we were a little surprised.

When Saturday night came, we did the same, and again nothing happened.

"Maybe they've given up," said Celene.

"Maybe they're trying to lure us into a false sense of security," Gale said, not buying it.

Sunday we were all on pins and needles. We let Buddy sleep without his collar on, he really was having trouble sleeping with all the lights flashing, but we still donned our jogging lights, our headlamps, and our giant flashlights. We sat at the ready, sure that tonight would be the night, and we jumped at every little noise. Any noise, any creak, any groan of wood could be the miasma, and by midnight we were all standing up, not wanting to be too comfy. Buddy looked at us, annoyed at being kept awake by us, but we refused to let our guard down.

When they got here, we would be ready.

When morning came, and still nothing had happened, Celene started to laugh.

"They must be having laughing fits if they can see us. They got us to stay up for three nights running on high alert and then didn't even show up."

Gale looked like he wanted to be mad, but he started laughing too.

"I guess we must be pretty silly."

"It's a good thing we got those thick curtains," Celene chimed in, really cackling now, "or the neighbors would be having fits at the sight of us. We probably looked ridiculous, like we were waiting for vampires or something."

I couldn't help it, I started laughing too. 

She was right, we must look silly.

"Well, boys, we made it, I guess, and I think this calls for a celebration. What's say we all go get some breakfast before we turn in? I think I could eat about three stacks of pancakes at the Chuck House and a pound of bacon, what about you?" she asked, turning to Gale.

Gale was still chuckling a little, "I hope they have a horse, caught I imagine I could eat a deep-fried Clydesdale, with a side of hashbrowns."

That got me laughing again, and pretty soon Gale and I were hanging on each other in stitches.

We were sleep-deprived and running on the dregs of pure adrenaline, cut us some slack.

"Well then, let's get out of these reflectors and get some breakfast," Celene said, ditching the lights as she went to get her coat out of the hall closet. 

Buddy was barking as Gale and I finished up our laughter, and I thought it was because he was annoyed by us and all the noises we were making.

When Celene screamed, I realized my mistake.

We both went running into the foyer, but it was already too late. 

We had put tap lights in all the closets. We had changed out the weak bulbs for something that would fry cockroaches. We had been so careful to put as much light in every space imaginable, but we had forgotten about one spot.

The arm coming out of the coat closet in the foyer was as thick as a tree, and as it dragged Celene inside, she was screaming for Gale.

He jumped, trying to catch her hand, but he came up short.

She disappeared into the closet, her shriek abruptly cut off, and as Gale dug the flashlight out of his pocket, the little one that he always kept on him, we could both see by the narrow beam that that closet was empty.

That was around sunrise.

It's closer to noon now, and Gale is inconsolable. He's been opening the door to the closet, the closet that now has a new halogen bulb in it, for hours, but Celene is never inside. She's been taken, but we don't know where. We assume she's gone back to that monochrome area in the ceiling, the one Gale was trapped in, but we don't know. 

I made a phone call about an hour ago, a phone call I should have made from the start.

Gale can say what he likes, he can leave if that's what he wants, but I need answers.

I have a meeting with Agent Cash tomorrow at noon.

I will get to the bottom of this, and I will get Celene back.

Even if it means I have to plunge right back into the Beyond to do it.
