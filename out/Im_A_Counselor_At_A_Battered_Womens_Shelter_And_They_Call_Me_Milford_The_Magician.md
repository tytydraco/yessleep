For the last thirty years, I’ve bounced from one battered women’s shelter to the next as a counselor. Judge me if you want to, but they give me exactly what I need. 

Sustenance. 

It's how I survive. When you couple a strong moral compass like mine and an appetite as extreme as the one I have, pickens can be slim. But those shelters have never let me down.

They call me Milford the Magician down on 42nd because I work “miracles”. I wouldn’t call them miracles, I just get to make the world a better place in two different ways.

Suzy is sitting with me. Thirty two and she’s been beaten by the same man for sixteen of them. She’s been a hard one to crack. She’s feeling so many different emotions that she can’t even understand yet how strong she is by making the decision to leave.

I finally get her to open up during our third session. 

Her high school “sweetheart” is quite the rascal. She would have been a mother twice now if the brute hadn’t been so rough with her. She lost both pregnancies. She came to the shelter straight from the hospital after the final bout. She’s got her whole life ahead of her now.

She’s never going back, but all that pain is baggage that’s going to follow her forever. That’s where I come in. I’ve finally got her trust. I’ve reached out my hand to her before, and on the third attempt, she finally takes it. 

Her body goes rigid at my touch. She’s not going to remember any of this. I take it all in. All the pain. I’m not proud, I find it delicious, but it’s not the main course.

When I get everything I need, I let go of her hand. Her eyes are different. They always are. There’s a spark of life in them that hasn’t been there in a long time.

I can’t take away her memories, it doesn’t work that way, but I can put them behind a heavy fog.

If the past is any indication, Suzy will be gone within a week with a new lease on life without another thought of the man who stole everything from her. 

Her pain is mine. At least for a little while.

Two nights later, I’m standing outside of Suzy’s old house. 

I change my appearance. I don’t look like Milford. I look like Suzy.

Even if someone sees me now, Suzy’s been at the shelter the whole time. I asked security to keep an eye on her specifically. I always make sure the women can’t be implicated.

I knock and her husband opens the door. He lets me in. They always do. They’re always so repentant when they think their girls came back home. Moron.

As soon as the door is closed, I take him to the bathroom. I like doing my business in front of the mirror. I have him take off his clothes and face his reflection while I stand behind him. I put my hand on his shoulders and he goes rigid under my hands.

He feels all the beatings he gave her. He watches in panic as every bruise that he gave Suzy appears on himself. His arm breaks. His jaw cracks and goes crooked. Three of his ribs break. So many injuries. So much pain.

So delicious.

I change. I’m not Suzy anymore. I’m not Milford. 

I’m me.

He sees me for what I am. I’m staring at a monster, but now so is he. He shits himself from the fear. 

Fear really goes a long way towards proper digestion. It’s how I cook my dinner. Like a fly vomits on what it's about to eat.

Unless someone checks the toilet after my next boom boom, they’ll never find any trace of his body.

I’ve had food all over the world, but nothing compares to the menus at the shelters. After five hundred years, they’ve been the most guilt free food [source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/)
