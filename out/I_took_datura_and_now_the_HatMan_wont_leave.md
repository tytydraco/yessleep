They always say not to do it alone.
But I did.
And now he won’t leave.

It started as a joke, a dare really, something I told myself I’d do before I turned thirty, some kind of rite of passage, a step further into the void I’ve been dancing around since college. They say we don’t really know ourselves, but if there’s one thing I knew…

I was bored.

Psychedelics, lucid dreaming, sensory deprivation. I’ve chased altered states like someone looking for God in a mirror. But nothing, **nothing **, prepared me for Datura.

I’d read about it online. Angel’s trumpet. Jimsonweed. Devil’s weed. The forums were filled with dire warnings, red flags waving like banners on the mast of a pirate ship: *“This isn’t a trip, it’s a poisoning.” “You won’t know what’s real.” “You’ll talk to people who aren’t there, and it’ll feel normal.”* but of course, that only made it more appealing.

I brewed it at midnight, alone in my apartment. The dried seeds looked harmless in the mug, floating in boiling water like pepper flakes. I sipped it slow, with a glass of cheap whiskey nearby (you know, just to make sure). I really thought I was smart, dosing low. But Datura doesn’t play fair. It doesn’t warn you when you’ve gone too far.

The first few hours were unremarkable. My mouth went dry. My vision blurred like I was drunk. But then it began: shadows sliding just out of view, furniture shifting subtly in shape. I laughed… finally! A cure for my boredom!! But the laughter echoed weirdly as though it wasn’t coming from my throat anymore.

Then he appeared.

I didn’t notice him at first. He was just a tall silhouette in the hallway, backlit by the bathroom light. I figured it was a coat rack, or a trick of the dim lamp. But then he moved… Slow and deliberate as he stepped into the room.

He wore a wide-brimmed hat. Long trench coat. His face was completely shadowed, but his presence was suffocating. Cold rolled in with him, heavy and unnatural. I tried to speak, to ask who he was, but my mouth wouldn’t work right. My tongue felt swollen, like I’d bitten into cotton.

He didn’t say a word. He just watched.

I blinked, and he was closer. No footsteps. No sound. Just… closer.

I panicked. Threw my whiskey and bolted to the kitchen. But every time I looked away, even for a blink… he’d move. No matter where I ran, he was always one step behind. Always watching.

At some point, I must’ve passed out.

I woke up the next morning on my kitchen floor, surrounded by broken glass and overturned chairs. My head throbbed, my throat was raw, and my heart felt like it had run a marathon.

But I was alive.

For a moment, I thought it was over. Just a nightmare. A Datura delusion. That’s what they said in the forums, after all: *“You’ll see things. Hear voices. Talk to people who aren’t real.”*

But he was still there.

In the reflection of my microwave door. In the corner of my eye when I turned the lights out. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I’d wake up and find him standing at the foot of my bed, silent and unmoving.

He doesn’t disappear when I scream. Doesn’t fade in daylight. I’ve tried cleansing the apartment. Burning sage. Salt lines. Sleeping with the lights on. I even checked into a hotel for a week but he followed me there, too.

He’s not a hallucination. I’m clean now. No drugs, no drinking. I even went through a psych eval, and they found nothing. I’ve seen him in photos, blurry and indistinct, a smear of darkness in the background. My friend Matt caught a glimpse of him during a video call once. He thought I had someone standing behind me and I didn’t correct him.

That’s when I started reading about him.

The Hat-Man.

Apparently, I’m not the only one.

Thousands of reports. He shows up during sleep paralysis. During intense trauma. Shadow person lore ties him to other dimensions, demonic entities, even ancient gods of death. There’s even a Reddit forum called *No Sleep* that has stories about him. Some say he feeds on fear. Others claim he’s a harbinger, an omen. A few believe he’s not a single being at all, but a shared figure from the collective unconscious—a dream archetype that slips through cracks in reality when we tamper too deeply.

And Datura? Maybe it just opens those cracks.

Whatever the explanation, I can feel him getting closer. The longer he stays, the more real he becomes. I can hear his breathing now, slow and steady, like wind under a door. And when I turn my head fast enough, I catch glimpses of detail: gloves, boots, the suggestion of a face beneath the shadow.

But last night, he touched me.

It was just a brush—a single finger down my spine—but it burned. My skin blistered where he touched. I showed a doctor; he called it a “stress rash.” I didn’t argue.

I don’t sleep much anymore. I try, but he’s always there when I drift off. I feel him kneeling by my bed, whispering things I can’t understand. Sometimes I wake up screaming in languages I’ve never learned and once, I found a note in my handwriting that I don’t remember writing. It said: 

**”LET HIM IN.”**

I think he’s waiting for something.

Maybe for me to break. Maybe for me to accept him. Maybe for something worse.

All I know is this: I opened a door with that damned tea. And now I can’t close it.

So please, if you’re reading this because you’re curious about Datura, or chasing some transcendental truth… don’t.

The door only opens one way.
And once the Hat-Man steps through,
he never leaves.
