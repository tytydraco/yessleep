I never liked the basement. What young child would? Beyond my childhood fear, though, even teenage me never trusted it for some reason. Instinct, fight-or-flight, whatever it was, it gave off a bad energy. Coming back as an adult, I knew it wasn’t just me who felt it. My mother, even to this day, refuses to go down there, insisting my father grab everything they need instead. On the rare occasion when I’m over and they need help, no more than five minutes elapse on any given trip down there. Every time I ask about the basement, they always shrug me off, hoping nonchalant lies will be enough to dissuade me. That’s their solution to anything uncomfortable; shrug it off, minimize the impact, and hope it goes away. My nightmares never went away, though. Somewhere inside, I knew they still lived, tearing off chunks of my sanity. Nightmares of the echoing void, ringing like tinnitus from behind the shelves. That’s where they lived. So here I stand, the face from my nightmares staring back at me in the form of dusty railings and waterlogged steps, intent on getting my sanity back. 



I never liked the basement, and I was right to fear it.



\-------------------------------------



“Thomas! Grab another bag of cornmeal from the basement!”



I winced, slowly turning to Mom, her lithe fingers already holding the door open for me. The inky maw of the stairwell waited for me expectantly, like a Venus fly trap. My eyes flicked from her to the stairs, the solitary light bulb flickering at the entrance. She sighed, flashing me an apologetic grin.



“Sorry kiddo. There’s a flashlight on the shelf at the bottom of the stairs if that helps.”



I swallowed, lurching toward the door apprehensively. Sweat already clung to my fingers as I gripped the dusty railing, floorboards releasing achy moans as I stepped into the mouth of the beast. 



“I’ll leave the door open for you! Thank you again!”



I stared straight ahead, unblinking. Cub Scouts taught me that when faced with a wild animal, the first rule is to never take your eyes off it. Hoping that Scouts trained me well, I let out a weak, “L-love you, Mom,” before hobbling down the creaky steps. Slinking into the shadows, I willed my eyes to adjust to the void. The void won, though, sight never coming. Panic bubbling up, my arms tried to pick up the slack, flailing about for the shelf. They eventually found it, albeit brazenly. My wrist collided with the dilapidated wood, a hollow thud launching the flashlight into the abyss, the darkness swallowing it eagerly. I grabbed my throbbing arm, panic flowing out in full force as my flashlight – my lifeline –  rolled further into the blackness. 



Head whipping around, I stared into the center of the basement, seeing a dim light peeking out from the beyond. It caught in my pupils like a lanternfish, beckoning me further into its belly with a hopeful pearly hue. I shuffled toward it, arms outstretched and trembling like a newborn, backlit by the comforting light of the stairway. Dad had only ever taken me down here a few times, and every time I clung to his leg, burying my face in his pant leg. He was tall enough to reach the light on the ceiling, but each second we’d ever spent down here felt like a bitter cold, the air seeping into my skin. I jumped blindly in the dark, hoping I’d be lucky enough to feel the cord and save myself from this agony. I never found it, though, immediately aware of how much noise I had made. I froze, the hairs on my neck standing at attention, fixating on the light once more. *Fifteen, maybe ten feet away. No sweat.* Two more hesitant steps, then inhale. Two more steps. Exhale. Two steps. Inhale. Two steps–



A metallic scraping ripped me out of my rhythm, my foot colliding with some unseen mass. I yelped reflexively, the object skittering across the concrete toward the light in front of me. It came to rest near a large shelving unit, the faint outline resting next to discarded boxes and rows of woodworking tools. I knew my eyes were pretty bad, but I just got new glasses, so I knew what I was seeing.



I had kicked the flashlight, its batteries tumbling out next to it, dark and isolated. My face was pale, the white light in front of me offering little comfort. Trying to stop myself from fainting, a sudden echo from upstairs sent stars across my vision, Mom’s voice ringing out cheerfully.



“Find it? It should be tucked underneath the stairs!”



“Y-Yeah, one sec!”



I focused on my breathing, the stars receding as I blinked away the panic. A faint light was peeking out from behind the framework of the large shelving unit. Desperate to understand, I picked up the flashlight shakily, somehow able to tuck the batteries back into their spots. Flicking on the light, a porcelain lawn gnome greeted me eerily, his rosy cheeks reflecting the flashlight beams. I yelped again, nearly dropping the flashlight again. Keeping it in my periphery, I wormed my way into the shelf, pushing boxes out of my way with effort. The smooth, stone wall of the basement was all I could find, beads of moisture clinging to the cement. The light was still there, barely perceptible in the reflection of the metal where the wall met the floor. My fingers tried to find purchase, but only light was able to slip through the crack it seemed. Fear switched to intrigue, my brain working through the puzzling light as my mother's footsteps thundered upstairs.



“Thomaaaaas. Rocky is gonna starve. Need help?”



“S-Sorry! I got it, I got it,” I lied, scrambling to the stairs. Flashlight in hand, the journey back was far less intimidating, but fear wasn’t ever completely absent in the basement. I knew that much. Just as she said, a large canvas sack leaned beneath the stairs’ floorboards, a black “Fine Yellow Corn Meal” label emblazoned on the front. I stuffed the flashlight into my pocket, the lamp head barely sticking out as I two-handed the sack, just high enough to keep it from dragging. I methodically trudged up the stairs, placing it on the step above me as I went. The fear of the basement loomed large in my mind, but there was intrigue attached to it now, that mysterious light spooling countless theory threads in my mind. 



“Rocky is gonna starve, kiddo.”



No louder than a whisper, a woman’s voice drifted through the air, sourceless and blank. I blinked in confusion, the light of the main floor flooding my pupils.



“What did you say, Mom?”



She turned the corner, a spoonful of peanut butter dangling at her side, my dog trailing behind.

“Oh, good, you got it by yourself. I wasn’t sure, those bags are pretty heavy.” She flicked the spoon around aimlessly as she spoke, Rocky’s head bobbing along with it, determined to catch any stray globs. I cocked my head at her in confusion, her deft hands already wrapped around the cinch at the top of the sack. 



“Thanks Thomas!” As she walked off, humming to herself, I shut the basement door behind me carefully. I have to go back down there. If not tonight, then this weekend. But I’m gonna need backup.



\-------------------------------------



I yanked on the ceiling cord, the bulb humming as gray light illuminated the basement. Same gnome, same cornmeal, same fear. A fear tinged with adult nihilism; a fear with more meat on its bones. I swallowed hard, my dry throat foreshadowing the passage ahead of me. With a shaky breath, I yanked at the shelves, rust painting my fingers orange. It clattered to the ground, pieces of porcelain shrapnel flying in all directions at the impact. I hardened my stare, set my jaw, and crouched down next to where I knew the passage was – a personal tomb, taunting me, calling to me. White knuckled with determination, I drove the claw of my crowbar into the seam of the floor, forcing the slab of concrete upward. Just as I had done all those years ago. Like a rusted garage door, the slab swung open begrudgingly, the hidden passage’s inky maw beckoning me forward. The nightmares lived here, still festering. In solemn anticipation, I pulled out a coin from my pocket, turned it over in my fingers, and flicked it into the mouth of the passage. A shrill metallic ping greeted my ears a few moments later, the coin clattering to the floor. Not a moment later, the second ping echoed from inside, the cavernous interior reverberating the sound. Then, nothing. Silence once more. I waited, ears straining with bated breath. Still nothing. Right as I exhaled, my ear twitched in recognition, the color draining from my face. 



After a few moments, the ping echoed out again.
