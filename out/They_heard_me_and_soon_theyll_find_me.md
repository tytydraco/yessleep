I’ve been trying so hard to be quiet because of how afraid I am of them finding me. As far as I can tell there’s only two of them, sometimes three. I keep telling myself that I can take them but I’m just not ready yet. Time feels like it doesn’t exist, I don’t know how long I’ve been in the attic. It’s dusty, grimy, and full of clutter but at least if they poke around up here I have plenty of things to hide behind. 

In order to get by I’ve been eating the vermin that run around up here. It’s mostly bugs and mice, but sometimes a bird or a squirrel will find its way in. It’s disgusting but it’s all I have. 

It can take me several hours to catch something because of how slowly I have to move. The last thing I need is for them to hear me running after a mouse, then again they might also hear my stomach rumbling before that happens. 

During my free time I daydream about how life was before these “things” got here. Remembering it makes me think of my family and how they took them from me. I can still hear my father yelling at me to run and hide, right before they dissected him. I heard that’s what they do to us. When I’m not missing my family I dream about how I’ll take my sweet revenge. 

Sometimes when I feel extra courageous I’ll sort through the clutter, quietly. Photo albums, family heirlooms, mix tapes, and lots of old clothes.  It kicks up a lot of dust when I do it, but honestly it’s worth it. You learn a lot about these “things” through the useless things they keep in their attic. 

Today is the big day, I finally hit my fifth growth spurt. A family of raccoons had found its way into the attic and it was an absolute feast. I knew I was going to grow, however it was much larger and faster than I had expected. 

The growth was instant and I knocked several things over in the process, I’m nearly touching the top of the attic. I can hear them right under me, they sound concerned…afraid. They should be afraid, I’ve been very patient and I’m more than capable of taking them on now. 

After I deal with these two I’ll find my companions, I just know I’m not alone. We’ll take back our home and we won’t stop until those “things” have been completely erased from existence.

They’re pulling down the ladder now, I’m already drooling. Soon they’ll see me, and I’ll get to watch their petrified faces with all of my eyes as they realize how screwed they are. I’ll get to hear them scream as I separate the flesh from their bones. I’m going to try and keep them alive while I do it, and enjoy every second of it. I’m sure to hit my next growth spurt very soon.
