Isolation. Usually, either you die, or you thrive. For me, it did something entirely different. Some people can't handle loneliness. Waking up every day alone, then doing your job alone, and then going to bed alone. Others seem perfectly fine with isolation. The ability to self regulate and entertain oneself with books, or even just enjoying nature seems more and more rare these days. I didn't really have a choice. Ever since I took a job as a fire watch, I've been alone. Like, ALONE alone. 

The reason I took this job was twofold. Life seemed hell-bent on making me be alone. When I was 19, my mom passed away from a sudden heart attack. A couple years later, my dad died from a combination of a respiratory virus and heart failure. Then a year or so ago, I was involved in a head-on collision with a drunk driver. My wife Claire and son Jack were also in the car with me… They didn't make it… I gave in to the will of the. Universe and agreed that I should be alone. I used to play this Indie video game back in the day. It was pretty popular and it's what inspired me to take this job. The game was called Fire Watch. If you haven't played it, you definitely should. After everything was taken from me, it seemed only appropriate to seclude myself like the protagonist of that game. 

My day typically begins with the sunrise. The tower has windows on all sides, so the light of the rising sun is pretty oppressive. I'll grab a bite to eat, usually just some buttered toast. I turn the radio up to hear what's been going on in the world without me. I snag my binoculars and do a quick 360 scan and check for signs of smoke. If I see smoke, I radio my boss and check if there's a sanctioned camper in that area, if yes, then I ignore it unless the smoke becomes too thick. If not, then I go check out the area. Usually it's just some kids who snuck out there to party. Then I read them the riot act about fire safety, tell them to get approval for their camping, and have them dispose of any illicit substances that they may or may not have with them. Then I return to the tower. Wash, rinse, and repeat. On my lunch break, I like to take a nature walk with a sandwich or something. Then I return to the tower and look for smoke and read until it's time to go to sleep. 

I was stationed in a tower in one of the National Parks here in the UP. I was installed here in mid May to prepare for the fire season. There usually isn't the risk of a wild fire in these parts, but since the past couple years were unusually dry they were cracking down on unsanctioned campfires. The first few weeks were uneventful. Just a couple campfires that needed checking on. I put out a couple that had been left smoldering by the campers who had already packed up and left. The protocol for properly disposing of a campfire go…

1) Drown the fire/coals in water. 

2) Once the fire/coals were sufficiently drenched, place an X over the pit with sticks or logs. 

Although this is fairly simple, you'd be surprised at just how many people forget one or both of these steps. 

May came and went without any major hitches. Just a few teens every so often who thought they were slick by stealing their parents liquor and camping in the woods. It wasn't until June that things began to spiral. The downward descent began with a dream and a call. 

I was standing in a meadow. Everywhere I turned, there was nothing but a field. I began to run. Frantically looking for an exit from the endless serenity. The boundless beauty felt like it was some sort of trap. There was a low rumbling that I felt in my bones. It wasn't something I could hear, but it was an ever present oppressive presence that triggered my fight or flight response. The rumble morphed into a deep and ancient laugh. The ground beneath me began to shake and ripple like water in a cup during an earthquake. 

Water began to pool around my ankles. The vegetation in the meadow was drowning and dying under me. The water quickly overcame me. I was trying to swim up, but something was burrowed deep into the spot where my neck met my skull. I tried to pull at it, but my body was encased in some sort of suit. I could only witness what was unfolding before me. I watched as a submarine descended into some sort of chasm. An overwhelming sense of dread befell me. 

The ocean began to drain. I was back in the meadow, but it had been burnt to a crisp. Before, where there was once a vast field was now a grand chasm. It was deep. Very deep. I couldn't see the bottom. It just went deeper and deeper and deeper. Then the voice called out to me. 

The voice: “Draweth near to me boy. Free me from mine chains.”

When I awoke, there was frantic shouting coming from the HAM radio. I didn't understand what they were saying at first but when I finally came to, I realized that my boss was screaming about a fire that was raging about a mile away and that the Water Scooper was already on the scene. She informed me that even though the fire was under control, I should get as far away as I could as fast as I could. In my sleepy state, I managed to make my way to a lake that was near me. I untied the little flat bottom boat and rowed my way to the middle where I dropped anchor. 

After a long six hours, the fire had been put out. I went back to my tower and turned on the radio. 

Me: “Hey Cam, the fire is dead. Want me to check it out?”

Cam: “Not now. We've got some drone footage showing it's dead. Just try and get some rest and check it out in the morning. Glad to hear you're safe.”

And that's what I did. I was awoken around 10:00pm, the fire was put out at 4:00am. This would only give me a couple hours of sleep, but after such an eventful night, I was grateful for any Z’s I could catch. 

The next morning I went through my usual routine. The only thing I added to the monotony was checking out the burn site. It was bad. Although the fire had been extinguished rather quickly, the damage was immense. An area that was roughly 864000sqft was burnt to a crisp. All the trees, grass, and other foliage were completely wiped clean from the landscape. It would take decades and decades for nature to regrow this patch. The USFS decided that they would not be planting replacement foliage, but rather that nature knows best how to heal its injuries. 

While I was sifting through the ashes, I noticed a small schism. A boulder was now exposed, and a cleft underneath its lip was now visible. It was narrow, but even a hefty black bear could crush itself into it if it really wanted to. I consulted my map to see if this crevice was marked. It was not. I drew out my flashlight to take a look inside. I was curious to see if any pitiful animals crawled in for sanctuary. What my maglite illuminated was a beautiful cavern. Excitedly, I retreated to my tower to report my discovery to Cam. 

Me: “Cam? Cam! Cam come in!”

Cam: “What!? Can't this wait? I'm in the middle of a debrief with the firefighters.”

Me: “No it can't. You're gonna want to come see this. I found something incredible!”

It took until the next morning for Cam to come see me and my discovery. She was tied up with meetings and explanations and media statements. Although I wasn't a fan of her when I met her, it was an absolute joy to see a familiar face after so long. 

Cam: “This better be life changing Burt.”

Me: “Trust me, it is.”

The hike took us around 45min. On the way, I told her all about what the fire uncovered. I told her of the majesty of the cavern. How this could rival the Mammoth Cave system. How we could probably generate some serious revenue if we started selling tickets to tour the cave. But when we got to the boulder, the breach in the earth was gone. 

Me: “This can't be possible? It was here yesterday!”

Cam: “Burt… Did you really just drag me from my post, through the forest, have me tramp through all this lung damaging ash, just to show me some stupid boulder?”

Me: “It was here! I saw it! The dirt must've settled or something. Here, help me dig!”

Cam: “No Burt. I'm leaving.”

And with that, she left. The last familiar face I'd probably see for the rest of the season. I was confused. Angry. I frantically began to dig. Surely I hadn't made it up, but even I was beginning to doubt. There was nothing. Just a boulder and a hole dug by an unbalanced and disturbed man. I went back to my tower. I'd been digging for so long that the entire day had washed away. I was tired. After going through my nightly procedure, I glided off into sleep. 

I began to dream of the cavern. Of the beauty of this lonesome grotto. All of the stalagmites and stalactites glittering in the beam of my light. All of the heavenly speleothems casting shadows made the cave feel alive and ancient. The rhythmic dripping of water echoing, penetrating into my ears was both soothing and terrifying. The gentle echo became a monstrous roar. I felt the earth shake. The gap that allowed me into this sacred chamber closed up behind me and I heard it. 

The Voice: “Draw near to me.”

When I awoke, I found myself saturated in a combination of my own sweat and rain water. During the night, an unpredicted storm blew into my area. The skylight above my bed, that I'd insisted needed re-caulking for weeks now, began to leak like a sieve. Thunder, lighting, and winds buffeted the world around me. I tried to radio Cam, but all I heard back was silence with intermittent static and screeching. With every flash of lightning, faces illuminated the windows of my tower. Horribly gray and sunken faces stared back at me. They were speaking, but I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to tell me through the terrible tempest. Their gaunt faces were full of what I thought was anger, but I began to realize with each flash of lightning that it was terror. They were pleading with me. Slamming their ethereal fists upon the glass. With each blow of their fists, the wind threatened to shatter the windows. My radio began to crackle and hiss. Voices began to make their way through the speaker. Words like run, hide, and save yourself hissed their way through the wheezing radio. 

I turned back to the door to ensure that it was latched and locked properly when I saw him. A face that seemed so familiar to me. It was Easton, the fire watcher who was stationed here before me. Then he spoke. 

Easton: “You sleep where we slept. Do not creep where we crept.”

Me: “What do you mean? What are you talking about?”

Easton: “You sleep where we slept. Do not creep where we crept.”

Me: “I heard you the first time! Just tell me please!”

Easton: “You sleep where we slept. Do not creep where we crept.”

With the last streak of lightning, they all vanished. The wind and the rain slowly turned into a drizzle and then finally stopped. I wasn't entirely sure what Easton meant, but I had a suspicion that it had something to do with the chasm. For seven weeks I ignored the chasm. I fought every urge to go seeking for its beauty. I successfully resisted the chasm’s call until last night. 

I was having another dream. I was walking through the woods following someone. A woman. Her beautiful hair cascaded down her shoulders as an auburn waterfall. She was adorned in a pearly nightgown. The woman was carrying something in her arms, but I was unable to identify what the cargo was. She whispered for me to follow. Every so often she would turn around a bend and I'd lose her, but I would always find her in the distance with her back turned to me and giggling. I continued to follow her until I found myself standing at the crevice to the grotto. I watched her as she slowly turned to face me. It was my wife Claire. Just as beautiful as the day I lost her. She was holding Jack. Just as small as when that drunk took him from me. 

Claire: “Come to us. We're in the grotto. Come stay with us.”

I went to embrace them, but I snapped awake. I was standing in my T-shirt and gym shorts that I slept in. I wasn't in my tower. I was standing at the boulder. Where there was once no crevice, there was one again. A gentle orange glow emanated from within. As though there were an immense magnet and I was a paperclip, I was drawn in. On my hands and knees I squeezed myself through the gateway. It was just as grand as I remembered from my peek in. Like a cathedral formed and fashioned by Mother Nature herself. From where I stood, I couldn't see the back. So I began to trek forward. Whispers and echoes called to me. 

The Voice: “Draw near to me.”

The cathedral began to narrow. No more were there stalagmites and stalactites. Just a barren and ever warming tunnel. The glow increased in  intensity slowly and methodically. It was pulsating like a gargantuan heartbeat. I stumbled on what I supposed was loose gravel, but upon further investigation, were bones. Bones of those who came before me. I saw them. I saw the faces of previous fire watchers. Faces that were once only photographs to me but were now real and haggard. Easton spoke to me. 

Easton: “You creep where we crept. You shall sleep where we sleep.”

I pushed past him. The forces that drew me were stronger than my fear. 

The tunnel narrowed again. I had to crawl the rest of the way. My hands and my knees scraped and peeled against the stone floor. My wet and viscous blood tried to plead with me to turn back before it was too late. I pressed on through the pain for what felt like an eternity and an instant at the same time. The glow had become a great light. When I came to the mouth of the tunnel, I found another chamber. If the first was a cathedral, this one was a palace. It was brimming with greenery. Plants that I'd never seen before. Four immense waterfalls were bursting through the walls of this grand chasm. There was an enormous, intimidating, and ineffable orange light down in the bottom. It was pulsating and writhing. It  coagulated into a solid form. What appeared to me as a massive cross between an eyeless elephant, giraffe, blue whale, and a mountainous moose. It's incomprehensible form was always shifting and morphing so that I couldn't make out just what it looked like. Then it spoke to me. 

The Beast: “What dost thou want of me? Ask and I shall tell thee.”

Me: “Where's my family?”

The Beast: “They were not but an illusion used to calleth thee.”

Me: “What are you?”

The Beast: “I have been known by many titles. Katshituashku. Yakwawiak. Wakwawi. Mokele-mbembe. Bahamut. Kuyūthā. But thou may call me as Behemoth. I am the second oldest and most fearsome creation of God. One of those that hath been long forgotten.”

Me: “What do you want?”

Behemoth: “I want to destroy. I want to decimate. I want to devastate. I want to combat my oldest enemy. I want to bringeth an end to Leviathan.”

Me: “Why are all the others you called dead?”

Behemoth: “They were unfit for service of me.”

Me: “Why me? Why did you call to me?”

Behemoth: “To be my emissary.”

Me: “Will I see Claire and Jack again?”

Behemoth: “No my child. They are no more.”

I have nothing left in this world. It has done nothing but take and take from me. The end is nigh. Not just for me, but for you as well. Do not fight. Do not rebel. Behemoth is coming. He shall free us from this world. Embrace his freedom. Embrace the end.
