It's been a couple day's since my first encounter with, her.... or it? I'm not sure anymore my head has been swarming. Maybe I should talk to the old man or Ronnie? I feel kinda bad calling him "old man" but I'm kinda bad with names. I'm not even sure if I got that right, I should probably read back to figure that out. Anyway I'm gonna see what he has to say.

Ok I'm here, he let me in and offered me a coffee, I hate that stuff so, I politely declined. Anyway I asked if theres anything else I should know. Furrowing his eyebrows he thought for a moment. After a while I could visibly see a light switch turn on in his brain. He then spoke his expression shifting to something more serious.

"I forgot to mention this, but everynight she goes outside to the porch at 6:00 AM, if you see her there don't go outside, you don't want to make the same mistakes I did" 
Leaning in I say, "good advice but I want to know more about what she is in general"
The old man shrugs his shoulders looking as confused as I.

"How am I supposed to know, all I know is they're is something seriously wrong with that cabin and, the lady" seeing that he was useless I bid him farewell. As I turned to leave he told me to wait, I turn back and he says "take care" before passing me a sachet, "put this on your window and don't question it" so I did just that.

For a couple weeks after this she didn't come around until tonight that is. She was softly knocking this time, asking me to open the door and trying to tell me not to listen to Robert. That was his name! Damnit, this isn't the time to be relieved for such trivial things she's back! I was going to just ignore her but I was curious what would happen if I snapped a photo of her on the Polaroid camera.

Snapping the photo I shook it waiting for the picture to come through. Once it came through my eyes widened in horror to see her neck twisted in an unnatural way the bone protruding through her pale bloodied skin. Her hair was now tangled with chunks ripped out of her bleeding scalp, her eyes bloodshot red. I could hear the women laughing outside the door, before seeing the lady in the picture slowly begin to grin. I grabbed a lighter running to the concrete basement.

In my panicked state a began to hyperventilate as I tried to set the picture on fire. The flame kept going out, when I was sure it would burn, nothing..... Absolutely nothing! I began to panick more. "Fuck! Shit! Fuck what did I do?!" Placing the picture face down I waited for her to be gone. Once she was gone I got in my car, driving to the woods where I buried the God for saken photo. I'm back home now, I hope it's not to late to go back from that. Anyway if anything else happens I'll keep you guys updated.
