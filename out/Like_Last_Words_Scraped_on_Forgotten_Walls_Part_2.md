**CW: self-harm, cult abuse**

**\*\*\*\*\***

The woman - my rescuer, the night before - introduced herself as Alita.  She looked a bit older than me, thirty-something; curvy and brown-skinned, with corkscrew hair and a wide, dimpled smile.  In contrast to her otherworldly, earth-mama decor, Alita wore yoga pants and a blue SUNY sweater.  

“It was stupid,” I said, sipping my coffee.  “I took something last night… normally, I don’t pass out in strange bathrooms.”

Alita shrugged.  “I believe you.  It’s good I got you out of there, though.  Lemme guess: you found a totem in that bathroom.”

“A totem?” I asked, confused.  

She smiled.  “Words.  Glowing.  Disembodied hands…”

I blinked.  My brain couldn’t quite soak up her corroboration.

“Stinky girls, occasionally a guy?”  Alita continued.  “Call you sister?  Have you had the blackouts yet?”

I shook my head.  It was too much to process.  “They… they didn’t talk…”

Alita frowned knowingly.  “Ah.  They’re in their cutesy ‘follow me’ phase.”

“You… too?” I stuttered. 

Alita shook her head.  “No.  I just know stuff.”

My head began to throb.  I was hazy and confused and I’d passed out on a sticky bathroom floor in *Williamsburg*.  My reserve of patience had evaporated.

“You know stuff?”  I repeated.  “Great.  Start talking.  Because I want it to *stop*.”

Alita looked hard at me.  She stood, picked up her coffee pot, and poured us both a refill.  

“Cream or sugar?”

“Just talk.”

“Fine.”  Alita sat, leaned back and crossed her arms.  “Sixty-odd years ago, an Evangelical minister started gathering followers.  His name was Thomas Elliott.  The man was an ugly little troll, but he had charisma.  He led a popular congregation in the Hudson Valley - brilliant, but a complete psychopath.  And like most psychopaths, he started to believe he knew better than everyone else.  Including his superiors at the church.  He got into some scandal Upstate… he may have impregnated another pastor’s wife, or teenaged daughter… point is, he needed to get out of town, fast.  

“So he came down here with a coterie of female followers.  In the city, he picked up more.  Different races, different backgrounds, all young and beautiful.  Soon, Elliott had everything a small-dicked little megalomaniac could ever want.  Endless sex from labile young women who worshipped him, cooked and cleaned for him, and dutifully brought him money.  But, like the psychopath he was, he wanted more.  Survivors - women who left - said he got off on causing pain.  He pressured his followers into degrading, masochistic sex.  A few escaped, but most stayed.  They believed he was the Messiah.”

My dream.  W*omen in loose brown dresses, dirty, sobbing and terrified.*  

“He preached that eternal life didn’t come from worshipping God or living a Christian life,” Alita continued.  “It came from pain - pain, like Jesus experienced on the cross.  He made the girls believe that, if they went through enough pain and suffering, they would become immortal.”

*The stench of urine and rot.  The animalistic screams.*

“Well, eventually Elliott’s bullshit caught up with him.  He and his girls had been tossed out of even the floppiest of flop houses in Brooklyn.  So he took, maybe, twenty of his most devoted acolytes and disappeared.”

“Disappeared.”  I repeated.  

*The cold.  The aching bones.  The fear.* 

Alita shrugged.  “Disappeared.  Gone.  Never seen or heard from again.”

“Didn’t anyone look for them?” I asked.  

*The writhing.  The tiny teeth.  The blindness.  The gurgling sobs.*

“I’m sure the girls’ families did,” Alita said, “if they had families.  But there wasn’t much the authorities could do.  All of Elliot’s followers were adults - young adults, but adults nonetheless.  Sex workers, addicts, rootless seekers.  The sort of people who slip through the cracks all the time.”

I shuddered.  I thought about the blonde, eyeless wraith - not with fear, but pity.  She’d been one of them.  I’d experienced what she experienced.  The abuse, the control, the agony. 

“I… I see a girl,” I stammered weakly.  

Alita’s eyes widened.  She stood and rifled through a filing folder on her counter, extracting a thin photo album, which she handed to me.

“There’s not a lot of pictures of the Elliott cult,” she said.  “This is all we’ve managed to compile.”

*We*, I thought, as I paged through photographs of a balding, frog-mouthed man with defined jowls, then beautiful young women in flowing dresses with long, straight hair.  Then, I saw her.

“The… the blonde!” I exclaimed, pointing.  “Her!"

The young woman in the photo had clear skin, a delicate nose, and beautiful blue eyes - the polar opposite of the scarred, filthy zombie that kept appearing around New York.  But her waist-length, ice-blonde waves were unmistakeable.  Alita took the picture from my hand and read off the back.

“Nancy Strauss,” she told me.  “She was a poet and a folk singer.  She used to perform in small venues around the city.  She may have actually made something of herself if she hadn’t…”

“How do I make her go away?”

Alita fixed me with an odd stare.  I got the uncomfortable impression there was a whole lot more she’d purposefully kept from me.

“Ignore her,” she said.

\*\*\*\*\*

I tried ignoring Nancy.  I tried to forget the smelly, glowing people.  Then, the blackouts started.

They were never significant - a few minutes, here and there.  I’d be sitting at my desk at work, then zone out and come to in the soda room, drinking a diet coke.  It always felt longer, though; time passing as it does in a dream.  

In my blacked-out reveries, I was her.  I was Nancy Strauss.  And I remembered.

*Our bus, an old Metro Father saved from the junkyard, broke down along the side of a tree-lined highway.  So we’d walked, bags in hand, along cracked roads and boggy grassland.  Our legs ached.  Some of us had broken arms still in slings.  Our bruises throbbed, and the lashes down our backs stung, yet still, we sang.  Soon, we’d reach Revelation.  Revelation would be the promised land - the place our Father’s promise for us came to fruition.  We sang -* 

*I stand, blind and naked, at the world’s bloody end*

*All is dead, sadness is your only friend.*

*Then, the whistle of a train.  A steeple rising into the cloudless sky, bright sunlight catching a stained glass window, drenching our procession in color like God’s rainbow after the flood.  We’d arrived.  We were home.*  

The details blurred and disintegrated as soon as I was pulled back to reality.  I’d find myself twirling my finger impotently, surprised and disappointed to find I wasn’t playing with my long, blonde hair.  But one word remained scarred in my memory: Revelation.  

Revelation, the word scrawled on the note I’d found in the library.  It was the name of a place.  I Google’d around, looking for cities called Revelation, and had little luck - all I found was speculation about the seven towns mentioned in the Bible’s Book of Revelations.  There’s a couple Revelation Streets and Revelation Boulevards scattered around the country; I scrolled through images on Google Earth.  None felt right.  None felt familiar.  

On Monday, I didn’t have much to do at work.  We didn’t have any events scheduled until the weekend, so I distracted myself organizing the beer fridge, then marrying the liquor, then taking inventory of the walk-in freezer.  When I’d run out of my own tedious tasks, I found a stack of paper invoices on Adrienne’s desk.

Management was still in the process of interviewing potential sales managers, which meant Adrienne’s non-urgent job duties hadn’t been fulfilled.  I decided to scan the invoices and organize them into our digital file system.  It needed to be done, and I didn’t have anything better to do but obsess over a vanished cult and their mysterious settlement.

I’d ran two invoices through our ancient printer/fax/scanner when I found them, scrawled on the back of a duplicate.  

Words.  Phrases in green pen, Adrienne’s curly handwriting.  

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

Over and over.  And then: a string of numbers and letters.  Map coordinates.

*4X.X N, 7X.X W*

My pulse quickened.  I felt my feet sink into the ground.  My palms grew moist; icy-hot adrenaline crackled through me like electricity.  I was terrified.  But I knew - I knew, in the depths of the body no longer completely mine - that wherever those coordinates led, was where I was supposed to be.

\*\*\*\*\*

I offered my manager some excuse: headache, projectile vomiting, family emergency.  I routed myself to the nearest car rental place, threw down my credit card, pulled out of the lot in a 2019 Civic, and typed Adrienne’s coordinates into the GPS.  

*Our promised land had a name, once, but that name didn’t matter.  We were to call it Revelation.  It was where Father was born, where he’d lived with his family before the paper mill burned down and the whole town had been forced to abandon their homes and seek their fortunes elsewhere.  He called it Revelation because, there, God had revealed to him his holy purpose: bring Heaven’s immortality to an imperfect earth.*  

Pennsylvania.  Middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania.  

I looked for a town name.  I found nothing - as far as Google Maps was concerned, Adrienne’s coordinates pointed to an unincorporated grove of trees somewhere between Pittsburgh and Interstate 80, approximately six hours away.  

*Revelation felt lonely, especially in contrast to the constant bustle of Brooklyn.  I’d never experienced such emptiness.  But we accustomed ourselves to it.  We learned to take comfort in our sisterhood, in the nights Father called us to his bed, in the warm ache of sore muscles after a long day working the land.*  

I drove.  I cruised along the 80 for what felt like forever, then pulled onto a highway, which lead to a smaller highway, off which sprung a shabby two-lane road through a vast grassy plain and then a thick grove of oak trees.  Above the trees, I saw what had once been an elevated train track.  I was close.  

*The whistle of the Eastbound train - twice a day, at dawn and dusk - became a familiar friend.  We made other friends, unlikely friends.  Hunger, the constant colicky burn in our empty stomachs, as the beautiful country summer faded into an atypically cold fall.  The biting kiss of a whip as it struck our flesh over and over.  Father hurt us.  He made us hurt each other.*  

The woods broke; I approached a clearing.  My GPS chirped: I’d arrived.  The late-afternoon sun, warm and butter-yellow, broke into multicolored prisms.  A church appeared in front of me.  It had faux columns, a tall steeple, and a circular stained-glass window, depicting a haloed child and a lamb.  I’d seen that church before.  I’d seen it in the old architecture book dropped in front of me at the Brooklyn library: First Methodist Church.  But also, *I’d seen that church before*.  

*We weren’t worthy.  Our crops wouldn’t grow.  We had no food.  We had no blankets to warm us, so we nestled together on the splintering wooden floor, shivering in the icy air that transgressed the thin walls and seeped up, like a burrowing creature, from the maw of the pit.*  

On a small hill behind the church, the old paper factory loomed like the castle of a fantastical monster, burned out and left to the elements for generations.  I drove along narrow streets decimated by weeds, past rows of square houses with quaint porches and overgrown lawns.  Through a ghost town.  I kept on moving, up and down crumbling blocks reclaimed by nature, past a boarded-up Main Street where even the graffiti had faded to nothingness.  I loosened my grip on the wheel.  I loosened my grip on myself, on my own consciousness.  I let Nancy take control.

My foot, involuntarily, stomped on the break.  The car skidded to a stop, and I stared out the window.  The house in front of me had faded red paneling.  A collapsed porch.

It was the house from the video.  

\*\*\*\*\*

If the black door had once been locked, the lock had rusted to bronze dust years before.  I pushed through - and immediately froze, neurons paralyzed, desperately grasping at the reality on which I’d staked my entire earthly existence. 

I was standing in a charred-black, grime- and cobweb-covered living room.  *I’d sat cross-legged on the floor, once, hands raised to the sky, scent of urine on my nostrils and lips.*  Writing instruments - chalk and paint and spray cans and sharpies - littered the floor.  The walls were covered in words.

I gasped. 

*Killed your daughter.*

*Never loved wife.*

*Drug addicted loser.*

*Dirty red hair.*

*Three broken bottles.*

*Black car speeding.*  Green paint.  Curly cursive letters.  

**Black** *flowers smell like rot.  Train* **cars** *attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow,* **speeding** *is forever.*

Adrienne. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Adrienne and I bonded over grief, and guilt.  She and her sister had been on the way to their cousin’s birthday party; Adrienne was driving.  Something - she couldn’t remember what - distracted her, commanded her attention for a fraction of a second.  That fraction was all that was necessary for her to miss the speeding black car that ran the stop sign, slammed into Adrienne’s passenger side, and killed her twin on impact.  Adrienne never forgave herself.   

Like I could never forgive myself for ignoring Cyrus.  

Cyrus and I met in math class our first semester and became immediately inseparable.  We rented an apartment together the next year, transferred from junior college to the same university, graduated with matching hospitality management degrees.  We tried to maintain our friendship as we pursued our careers - me, as the assistant manager of a university cafeteria; him, running his own catering company.  But work was a lot, and I was distracted.  I knew he’d recently gotten into and out of an emotionally abusive relationship.  I’d been aware since we met he was estranged from his homophobic parents.  

I didn’t know just how dark things had become inside his head.

On a Tuesday, he called me.  I let it ring.  I was at work, between meetings; school started and my life became a blur of trainings and angry suppliers and confused new cashiers.  I told myself I’d call Cyrus back during my lunch break.  But I didn’t get a lunch break.  And after work, I forgot.

Cyrus’s roommate found him in the bathtub the next morning.  Cold, blue, and stiff.  An empty bottle of sleeping pills discarded by his side.  

I left Pasadena.  I left California.  I packed up everything and moved across the country, to a new place, where every street and every coffee shop and every dive bar didn’t remind me of Cyrus.  Where I wasn’t reminded, every day, that he was gone and it was all my fault.

I found a sharpie and uncapped it, then an untouched patch of wall.  

**Abandoned** *tunnels are best seen with dead, bloodshot eyes.*

*Sadness will become your only* **friend**\*.\*

*Open your mouth and eat your* **calling** *whole.* 

I wrote: ABANDONED FRIEND CALLING.  My best friend, dead because of me.  If I’d only picked up, if I hadn’t been a self-centered narcissist, if I’d come through for him like he’d come through for me, so many times… I stepped back.  The words sank into the wall and began to glow.  Sickly, green-yellow light.  I smelled rotting flesh, curdling blood, festering vomit and feces.  Then came the screams.  Screams, then gurgling, ragged breathing, lifeless sobs.  

I ran towards the screams.  Through a maze of wooden halls, past creeping cockroaches and patches of mold, until I found myself in a back room as large as the first.  The center of this room had fallen away, collapsed into a huge, open pit over what had once been the basement - at least twenty feet down.  I didn’t want to look.  I had to look.  

I peered over the edge of the pit, and I saw the girls.

Torn, bloody skin under blood- and piss-stained brown dresses.  Matted, filthy hair.  Whitish goo coagulating around festering sores.  Faces beaten black and blue, bare backs whipped raw.  Arms and legs bent the wrong way, bone jutting from mincemeat flesh.  Fearless rats chewing on open wounds.  Beautiful, ruined young women writhing and convulsing, mouths wide open, begging for mercy from an aloof God.  

\*\*\*\*\*

*It was the day, he told us.  The day we’d leave our weak, starving bodies behind and embrace the immortality that was our destiny.  He instructed us to meditate.  One by one, he took us from our sisters.*  

*He flung us into the pit.*  

*The lucky ones died on impact; the rest lingered.  We cried and screamed for days, while infections ravaged our skin and rats bit into us with their tiny, sharp teeth.  We became delirious.  We muttered nonsense words and phrases, the final disjointed processes of our failing minds.  Our Father watched, rapt.  Then, when the last of us became too weak to make any sound at all, he set his rotting childhood home aflame.*  

*He died by his own hand, instantly, with one bullet from his father’s gun.  We suffocated slowly, our lungs filling with black soot.*  

I woke up, on my back, in the living room with the writing on the walls.  It was night, hours later.  The coppery rot scent still hung in the air.  I turned on my phone’s flashlight and, with a daring that would’ve made me proud of myself under any other circumstances, made my way back through the collapsing house and to the edge of the pit.  

The bodies had long since decomposed.  Instead, I saw a lawn of dark green ivy, sickly pale saplings, and rotting planks colonized by mushrooms and crusty green mold.  The effect was eerie.  A terrarium for things that grow with no light.  Cautiously, very aware of where I was stepping, I walked the circumference of the crater-like depression.  At the far end, across from a bashed-in back door, I stumbled over something hard.  

I looked down.  I yelped.

A skeleton.  A hole through the side of the skull.  The rusting metal body of a revolver.  

Dust clouded my vision like smoke.  Anemic, yellow-green light, from the full moon outside, seeped in through the windows and the cracks in the collapsing ceiling and door and walls.  *Smoke and piss-yellow glow*, I thought.  *The last thing the girls saw as they lay dying.*

*\*\*\*\*\**

I’m not writing this down as a diary.  No.  This is my warning to the next innocent who, wandering the streets of New York City, finds themselves drawn to nonsensical words on an abandoned store front wall.

I don’t know who Alita is.  I have no idea how she found me on that bathroom floor, or why she’d come to the Butler Outfit in the first place, or what she wanted from me.  I don’t know how she knew so much about the Elliott Cult, or what I’d experienced at the hands of the glowing trio, or the blonde wraith.  Nancy.  I don’t know from where she got those pictures.  And I’m still wondering who, when she said *we*, was implied.  I don’t even think Alita is her real name.  I’ve tried to dig her up on social media.  She might as well be a ghost.

But I think I know what she kept from me, that day.

She didn’t tell me it was already too late.

I see more smelly, glowing, smoke-emitting strangers.  They’ve gotten braver, like wildlife in the park, used to being fed.  One walked right up to me outside a bagel shop.  “You’ve come back, sister!” she cried joyously.  My face must’ve hidden none of what I was thinking, because the girl - cute, Latina, with thick eyeliner and gentle curves - took an immediate, cowed step back.  

“Oh,” she said, frowning.  “I… I thought you were someone else.”

Right.  Someone else.

Everywhere I go, I see the words.  

*Laugh alone or cry until you’re dead*.  A sticker stuck to a trash can on 42nd Street.

*Ugly girls make better muppets*, scrawled across a bathroom stall.

*Never like you*.  Multicolored spray paint on the side of an abandoned truck, parked at a curb in Flatbush.

The words smoke and glow yellow-green.  If I get too close, I see inky black fingers reaching out for me.  Disembodied hands, blindly groping, searching for prey.

I think Thomas Elliott succeeded.  

I think the essence of his followers, the souls of the girls dead at the bottom of the pit, became immortal through their desperate, delirious last words: the orphaned monster-children of their endless pain.  I think those words embedded themselves all over the city.  Waiting, patiently, for a young man or woman to find them.  A special kind of young person - one suffering, guilty, and broken.  Like Adrienne, or like me.  One who’d bring the words home.  

One who’d give the dead girls’ disembodied spirits a new, warm, fleshy home.  

Adrienne knew what was coming.  She chose to die, rather than lose her body and mind to an invading parasite.  Me, I’m not so sure.  I see Nancy Strauss in my dreams.  When I allow my thoughts to wander, I’m inspired to hum a tune, or sing a rhyme to myself.  I feel her inside of me, burrowing into the folds of my brain, trying out my arms and legs, tasting delicious things with my tongue.  She doesn’t mind the unfamiliar genitalia - it feels natural, the body she was always meant to have.  My body.  Her body.  I think that piss-colored smoke wafts off me, and I might smell like blood and mold and rotting flesh.  But it’s okay.  No one will notice; no one except the chosen ones, the boy or girl imprinted upon by the words - the vessel for my next sister’s glorious resurrection.

*Down in a rotting, putrid hole, I see black flowers grow.*

*A weighted-down, dying soul - like filthy 4th Street snow.*

*I hold the flowers to the sun, they wither into dust.*

*Then they’re reborn, God has won!  All ripe and filled with lust.*
