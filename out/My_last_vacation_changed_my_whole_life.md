I had been working at job for a year and went on my first vacation. I live away from my hometown, working in the city.

It has been more than a year since I had last went to my hometown when I took the vacation. The vacation was 1.5 months long so I was really excited to go.

And so I went on vacation. My family welcomed me. They offered me a place to sleep, which was one of the rooms I used to sleep in. But I was kind of reluctant to sleep there because I have always had nightmares in that room.

But to my surprise, when I started sleeping at that room, I did not have nughtmares anymore. Once I had settled in there, one of my friends; a guy named David invited me to go for a late night swim one night.

I was always afraid of the sea, especially at night time. So I have never gone on to a late night swim before. After a bit of hesitation, I reluctantly said yes. I got into my swimming clothes and went with him on that night. The first few moments were actually fun. We swam freely, and it was so quiet.

But after like 5 or 15 minutes, I started hearing something. It sounded like a 6 year old little girl giggling. It was very subtle and I thought I was just hearing things so I brushed it off. It became a bit louder, to the point it became clear. The sound was coming from a thick patch of bushes that stuck out to the beach. We were in shallow waters, talking at the time. I asked David if he heard a little girl giggling and he said no.

The giggling sound stopped after a while. It was like 12 am when we went for the swim. The people living in my hometown keep their children inside at 10 am. It made no logical sense for a 6 year old little girl to be there. I was getting more and more afraid as time passed. To the point where I told David that I was going home.

"I am going home. I can't stay here any longer." I told David, shivering.

"Bro, you imagined it. I heard nothing the whole time. Can you stay a little bit longer?" David asked.

"No, I really can't stay here any longer." I told him.

As soon as I said that, I took off and went back home. I could not sleep that night at all. And because of that, I got a bad headache. But I still could not bring myself to sleep. I told a few people about this and everyone told me that I was probably just hearing things.

I struggled a lot and was finally able to sleep the next night. And since nothing of note had happpened to me, I wrote it off as a one time thing. I slept like a log and woke up the next day. David called me and asked me to join him for a cup of coffee. So I did just that. David asked me if I was interested in going for another late night swim after we were done talking about it. I told him that I would never go on a late night swim again. I told him that I don't like even imagining those things.

He seemed to give up after I said that. There was no way I could have gone back there again. Imagination or not, I would never like to hear things like that again in the night.

Days passed by after that. And one night, as I was walking down the street, I saw a woman who I haven't seen before (my town is quite small so everyone knows each other). I saw her coming up to me. She was wearing a black, long dress, which was a common outfit that women wore in my hometown.

She passed by me and she looked strangely tall to me. Ever since that night, I would frequently see her whenever I went outside at night. Usually on dimly lit streets. I had memorized her face at that point.

Fast forward to a show that was held. It was a music show, where people sang and danced. I was enjoying the show with my friends and then, I saw her watching the show. She stayed like a statue, completely focused on watching the stage. I looked at somewhere else for a few moments and looked at the place where she was. She was gone. She was nowhere to be found. When the show reached intermission, I went near the harbour area to watch the sea. There was a beach there. And then, I saw the woman on the sand, dancing with very strange moves. It creeped me out.

And then, I saw her legs when the dress unrevealed it due to her dancing moves. Her legs looked extremely unnatural. She had a bent leg with hioves. It looked like it was a goat leg. As soon as I saw it, I ran away to ny home. And ever since that, I have been having nightmares of her every now and then and I get mysterious scratches on my body.
