My parents have been acting strange lately. (chapter 1)

A few months ago my father went missing, My mother tells me that he ended his life. After some previous events I have been led to believe otherwise. Every night at exactly 11pm, my mom enters my room to make sure I am asleep, this has been going on since my father passed. She stands in my room watching me for half an hour, then she leaves my room. After this, she goes outside. She always leaves the front door open for some reason. A few days ago I made the mistake of deciding to try to see where she was going. I looked out of the window and saw a creature that looked like my father in the forest. It was not my father. This creature has no eyes or nose, and a huge grin. I saw my mother start to follow the creature into the woods, but the creature saw me. I panicked and closed the curtains, trying to fall asleep as fast as I could. Before I knew it, my mother stood above me, I couldn't hear her but I could tell she was there. After what seemed like forever she grabbed my arm and forcibly dragged me out of my room. Her claws were digging into my skin and making me bleed. She started making her way to the front door, the creature was now standing near the doorway. I don't remember anything after that, I woke up in my bed the next morning, I could not find my mom anywhere. I called the cops and told them my story, they didn't believe me, but they couldn't leave a minor alone without a parent or guardian so they sent an officer up to check on me. But when they checked the security footage, they saw exactly what I saw. A search team was sent out. It took hours but in the end they found my mother. She was dead.  Her limbs at been pulled apart, she didn't have any clothes on, and a smile had been permanently carved into her face. 

As I am writing this, I am fearing for my life. My father is coming for me, it is only a matter of time. I am currently living with my aunt, every night I have been hearing whispers from my window that appear to be my dad, telling me to let him in. The voices start whenever the sun goes down, they get more aggressive as the night goes on. Sometimes the creature trys to open the window itself, but I always keep it locked. It's only getting worse, my aunt is starting to hear things too. I'm afraid she might let it in, if she does, it'll get me too. I've begged her not to open her window, but recently she started acting like mom, she's been coming in my room late at night, and going into the woods, only to emerge at sunrise. She's far too gone to saved. I might just try to kill her tonight. I'm planning to run far away from here, where hopefully that "thing" won't get me. Wish me luck.
