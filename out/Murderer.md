Recently my family was murdered i was away with my friend jack friend When it happened.  
it was a gloomy night and i spent a long time walking i thought "why the hell did i refuse to be driven home? i am such an idiot" as i walked up the steps to my house and i went to turn the door handle, but the door just pushed open.  
i stepped inside and I went and felt for the light switch, it felt wet with something i thought it was weird but shrugged it off and then i finally found the switch and really wished i didn't. 
 
I went and flicked the switch to turn on the light and went pale. There was just so much blood it looked like someone threw a bucket of red paint and left it was up the walls, the floor, the couch, desk, carpet tv everywhere i was in shock at the horrifying scene i felt sick to my stomach my world just came down in one moment, the tears wouldn't stop flowing i knew i had to call the police and who ever did this could still be in here i thought my mind started racing thoughts flew through my head i couldn't stop shaking or crying and as i called the police i don't even know how the operator knew what i was saying.  
they said they were on the way they said 10 minutes but it felt like years i was sitting in the cold waiting for them to arrive but i couldn't feel the cold, tears streaming down my face, soon i heard the sirens and the police pulled in, then they told me to go to a friends house while they searched " do you have any friends you can go live with for the time being? "yea" i said "my friend jack i haven't seen him in a while.  
i checked every day for any update but they found nothing my house wasn't big just a one story but they looked for 2 months for anything but gave up even thought it was a small house nothing!?! i was so angry at the police and the murderer how could he get away Scott free and why did the police give up i never forgave them for that but the only good thing was i got to spend time with my best friend jack after a while.  
He was tall, blonde, with blue eyes, small ears and a grin that he never really took off also he was slightly built and was pretty athletic. He was 20 so was i.  
we went everywhere together the movies, golfing swimming, watched tv, played games went to the bar you name it we went everywhere.  
also his parents where so kind to me they let me stay after i thought they would kick me out but they didn't and they also asked if i was ok every day it was very nice of them i said every time though i said i was fine.  
At an earlier time i wanted to end it all because there was much pain but my family wouldn't want that so i forgot about that and everything that upset me.Then after playing games with jack all day till dark i went to go to sleep, i was just about to go to sleep after watching youtube on my phone but i heard footsteps and stuff opening and closing, know this was the first time this happened but i just thought "ah it is just jack or his parents getting a drink" but i felt the need to lock the door so i did.  
Later i heard the handle moving around it kinda woke me up a bit and wondered who was at the door. Thinking it was some kinda of joke i said out load"please stop man i am trying to sleep" but it wasn't jack and unfamiliar voice called yo uh wrong room sorry and footsteps hurried away.  
It took awhile but i fell asleep. In the morning i asked if anyone came over last night? jack said back to me "oh my friend richy went to get something and also he will be stay in my room for a small bit" i sighed and said that "i thought someone broke in and jack burst out laughing oh ya he told me he went to the wrong room. that is so funny oh man...  
(thinking oh man it was just a guy still i find it weird the door was locked why did he keep trying to open it? oh well no need to think about it).  
The next few days went by fast hanging out with richy and jack and i also got to know richy a little. we became friends after a bit.  
The three of us did i a few fun things together went to a party got hung over i felt like i was going to die, one time i woke up next to the toilet that was weird. went the the park, the movies couple of other things sometimes i felt like someone was watching me but i shook that off though eventually richy left it was a bummer but yea  
(side note richy was pale skinny with short jet black hair and a weird looking mustache)  
later on after eating dinner i went to go to sleep and i did (layout of jacks parents house it was a two story with an attic living and kitchen and guest room down stairs up stairs was jack and his parents rooms then the attic)  
i woke up too a loud "THUD" i jumped(thinking) (i heard it from the attic did i imagine it what is going on!?) i spent two hours awake listen for a noise but nothing so i thought i imagined it and went to sleep.  
right as i woke i went into the kitchen and asked if anyone heard anything last night but they said no so then i knew i imagined it or they are just really heavy sleepers.  
I preferred the first option and went on with my day after breakfast i went on a walk around town people said there condolences even after so long it made me happy to know they cared the police had asked me while ago to question me they wanted to ask me some more questions. police: so where were you the night of the lumbermans family murder? "i was out with my friend jack" they asked me some more questions then i left. after that i walked for another hour or so and after a small bit i felt someones eyes on me with a sinister feel behind them again i shrugged it off thinking it would pass.

It didn't.  it followed me all through the town i got scared i began to pick up the pace in to a brisk walk until i reached a  coffee shop i sat down a watched the entrance the waiter ask me   what i wanted i just said "a plain coffee would be nice thanks" and someone then followed shortly he looked out for someone that someone being me i hid myself in a corner and he didn't see me i knew this wouldn't buy long so i told the waiter i thought someone was following me.

They asked a couple questions like "how do you know" "are you sure you didn't imagine it?" and a few more and so they led me out the back entrance i ran home from there  i didn't tell them i didn't want to make them worry so i kept it back i was a fool for that the day was over in a flash.
after i got back it was already 2 pm and i just watched tv for the rest of the day then went to bed.
Late into the night i heard knocking on the door again then the door handle turned
my heart dropped i didn't lock the door and jack and his parents went to bed a while ago around 8 pm (they are going somewhere in the morning not included in this)
and richy had already left.
thoughts flew threw my head like a bullet train, "was it another one of jacks friends?, a guest i didn't know about?" non of them where right the door opened to a man with a knife in his hand, a bloody knife i went pale he had this sinister grin on his face blood all over his clothes.

he raised the knife and stabbed me the pain hit me like a truck i screamed a blood curtailing scream and stood up i kinda knew how to fight not to well thought i through myself at him the knife flew out of his hand i punched him so many times he was bleeding from his noise and lip he hit me in the gut and grabbed the knife i lunged at him and grabbed the knife from him he charged me and... i stabbed him in his heart i called the ambulance and the police and the ambulance took him away and the police asked me some questions.

soon i went to court and was tried for the murder of the of the lumberman family and  found guilty, i wondered where did i mess up?
