I tried talking to Cassie about what happened to Laundry Mom.  (yes this is basically naming her and I’m changing the name but what if what the devil said means she’s going to come back and what if we can change her)  Cassie’s response was “oh thank goodness” when I told her that she’s gone so I decided to end the conversation there and just bury my emotions inside.

Well, not entirely.  I’ve been crying myself to sleep.  I know I shouldn’t take this as hard as I am.  If I think about it logically, it’s not like she cared about me or I cared about her, right?  I was just a means to an end.  I got rid of the flickering man for her.  And I guess she thought I was able to get rid of the thing in the hallway too and that’s why she

dammit I’m crying again brb gonna go sob into my pillow like an idiot for a bit

Okay.  Better.  I think.

I couldn’t talk to Cassie about it.  I was at a loss on who I could talk to… so I called my mom.  And then, I don’t know, because I was feeling like someone else was gone and how I feel like it’s me, it’s all because of me, everyone that cares about me or that I care about is doomed to die.

I asked about dad.

If she thought that if he were still here and could do it all over again, knowing he could die out there in the fields, if he’d still do it to provide for his family.  For us.  Mom was silent for a long moment and then she told me, very quietly, that it wasn’t the money that kept him away from home.  That was part of it, of course, but it wasn’t the main reason.

He needed distance from mom.  After the affair he didn’t want to be around her because it hurt too much.  But neither did he want to divorce her, because of us, so this was the compromise he found.  He took a job that kept him away from home for months at a time and when he came home he was happy to see us, just us, the children, and he and mom tried to work on their issues.  Like starting the relationship over.  Small steps.

It wasn’t meant to be permanent.  Either they’d find a way to move forward after what she did or they’d figure out how to separate without traumatizing the youngest of the children.

Instead, he died, and there was no reconciliation, there was no closure, there was nothing.  Nothing but his absence.

I told mom I needed some time to work through what she just told me and then I hung up.  I screamed.  I threw things.  Cassie finally intervened and very calmly said it was okay to be upset but Titanosaur was hiding in her closet and I needed to find a healthier way to cope with this.  Cassie insisted that I put on gym clothes with her and we went running down the streets and sidewalks until I couldn’t breathe and then we ran some more.

It helped.  I don’t want to ever do it again though.  Then we sat down back at the apartment and I told her what my mom had said.

Cassie thinks that was a lot to dump on someone and that she shouldn’t have ruined the image I had of my dead father.  I think my mom is tired of keeping secrets and thinks I should be able to make up my own mind on how I feel about our family.  

I know what it’s like to carry secrets.  I feel much better now that I’m sharing most everything with Cassie.  

It’s kind of weird to realize your parents are just people too and are doing the best they can and they don’t have it all figured out either and they’re getting things wrong too.

I feel so numb right now.  Maybe it doesn’t matter.  We can’t go back and change things and we can’t get answers to the questions we have.  That’s just how it is.

I wish I could say that things get better.  For a short time, it seemed that they would.  I focused on my classes and tried to ignore everything else.  Rumors about the haunted English building were abundant and people were saying the right things, so at least it seemed unlikely that the thing in the hallway was going to claim another victim despite its increased activity.  That felt like all I could do.  The thing had killed Laundry Mom.  Not even the flickering man had managed that.  What could I possibly do against something like that?  It felt like I would be trying to stop a force of nature, like squaring off against a tornado and thinking that I, frail flesh and brittle bones, could stop its path of destruction.

I remember how I felt when I looked at it.  The despair and the hopelessness and just the utter loathing, like I was dissecting myself in my mind to uncover every flaw and fault inside.  I don’t want to feel like that again.

So for the past few weeks I’ve just been keeping my head down and going to class and going to work.

Yeah I’m still working at the dining hall.  Money.  It’s a thing.

But my manager was getting worse.  The incidents where he ate everything in the stockroom were getting more frequent, to the point where he started stocking food in the neighboring dorm’s dining hall and sending us over to fetch what we’d need every morning.  That was working out… until it stopped working.

I had the opening shift.  I hate being scheduled for mornings, but that’s what happens when you’re reliable I guess.  You get tapped for responsibilities that require reliability.  And sure I’m super fucking grumpy in the morning, but at least I’m present I guess.  

I even show up when it’s raining.  Because by now I know what a dangerous rain looks like and if it’s just a steady, normal rain, I grab an umbrella and hustle my ass over there.

So I showed up bright and annoyed with an umbrella still dripping rainwater onto the floor, reminding myself that this job was keeping me from surviving solely off ramen, and I found the kitchen silent and still.  This was unusual.  He got here before everyone and would start getting the oatmeal going at least before anyone else arrived.

Fearing the worst, I hurried to the stockroom.  It was raining, after all, and I think coffee boss’s talk with him about remembering to use his damn umbrella hadn’t sunk in yet.

We didn’t have much in there, but he’d eaten it all.  There wasn’t anything left.  Nothing.  He’d eaten all the boxes, the freezer door hung open and I could see the shelves were clear.  There was something unsettling about the barren stockroom too, something that took me a moment to place.

It wasn’t just the food that was gone.  Everything was gone.  The extra pots and pans.  The cleaning supplies.  The only thing left were the shelves and from the way they glistened moistly in the dim light of the single overhead bulb, I think he’d even licked the dust off of them.

He stared at me from the middle of the room, his jaw slack and his tongue hanging out like a dog.  It almost reached his belly button.  One shoulder drooped lower than the other and his head was tilted in the opposite direction.  His eyes were wide and hopeless and famished.

“I’m so hungry,” he whispered.

Drool dribbled down his cheek and fell to the ground in thick globs.  He shuffled a step towards me and I clamped down hard on my urge to panic.  I couldn’t freeze up.  I couldn’t run.  He needed help… and he needed to revert back to normal before any of the other employees showed up.

“Hey, I’m having trouble getting the oven to light,” I said casually, as if nothing was wrong.  “Could you take a look?”

Another step closer.  No response, other than a faint whisper, repeating that he was hungry.  So hungry.

“I think Susan called out,” I said, trying something else.  “Don’t we need to find someone else to come in so we’re not short-handed?”

Still nothing.  This wasn’t working anymore.  Normally he would have snapped out of it by now.  I hurriedly backed away, feeling that mounting panic trying to worm its way up out of my gut and into my chest.  I couldn’t let it.  I couldn’t let it pour ice into my veins and send me into paralysis as my manager shuffled ever closer, whispering about food.

“How about we try the next dormitory over?” I said in desperation.  “They’ve got food.”

He paused.  His head tilted further in one direction as he considered.  Then his gaze slid off me and towards the door.  I gasped in relief.  Okay.  This was better.  The only problem was, he was shuffling towards the exit that would take us downstairs and outside into the rain.  I had my umbrella on me, but I couldn’t cover both of us with it.  Given a choice I’d rather keep him out of the rain as much as possible, but I kind of don’t want to get myself in it either.  And not only that, but I didn’t want to be close to him, just in case he lost control.  I’d have to be right next to him to hold the umbrella.  Even then, it’s not going to keep the rain completely off.  It gets windy during storms.  I wasn’t sure what that would do to him and I really didn’t want to find out.

“Let’s try the steam tunnels,” I suggested.  “They connect directly to the next dorm over and we won’t go through the rain that way.”

The steam tunnels aren’t safe either.  Given the options though, I felt it was best to at least look and see if they were passable or not.  If not, I’d say we should risk the rain after all and try to keep him under an umbrella as much as possible.  I was formulating plans A, B, and C.

Plan C was running away.  Plan C is always running away.

He followed me down the stairs, swaying slightly back and forth with each step.  His breathing was labored and his stomach gurgled incessantly, a sharp counterpoint to his rasping lungs.  I hurried as much as I dared, afraid that if I went too fast he’d collapse and fall down the stairs and afraid if I went too slow he’d lose his inner battle for control and try to eat me right then and there.  My heart pounded and my palms were sweaty from anxiety by the time we got to the steam tunnels.  I hastily unlocked it with my copy of the master key and threw open the door.

I swore under my breath.  Roots.  They clogged the tunnel.  Of course they did.  It was raining and I always saw them when it was raining.

“Not that way,” I sighed, and I started to close the door.

There was a noise like stones grinding against each other.  Like the side of a mountain cleaving in two and sliding apart.  It was deafening.  I shrieked and stumbled backwards, throwing my hands up to cover my ears.  The ground wasn’t where I expected it to be.  My ankle rolled sideways and I fell hard.

I caught myself with my elbow.

Not a great thing to do on cement, let me tell you.

I lay there, gasping, as pain shot all the way up my arm and through my shoulder.  The ground continued to vibrate beneath my feet.  Then I looked up and over, my thoughts moving sluggishly about how I needed to get help for myself now, that I’d hurt myself, that I was bleeding because I could see the blood dripping off the tip of my elbow, and also do something about my manager but there was just me here and -

But there wasn’t just me anymore.

I stared up at the legs of the groundskeeper.  The floor of the basement had split in two, pulled apart by thick trunks of roots.  They bunched together and then split apart in groups of five.  Like fingers, I thought distantly.  Like hands holding the ground apart.

And the groundskeeper, his skin like flint, had a hand wrapped around the neck of my manager.  He didn’t struggle.  He just hung there limply, staring off into the distance with agonized tears running down his cheeks.

“I’m so hungry,” he whispered.

Then the groundskeeper stepped into the crevasse and the roots slithered back after him, the fingers digging gouges into the cement as they dragged the floor back together after them.

I was alone in the basement.

I staggered upstairs, sobbing and dripping blood all over my shirt and jeans.  The people at the front desk panicked briefly upon seeing me but one of them realized that it would just be faster to walk down the street to the medical center than to wait for an ambulance to be routed from the local hospital.  So that’s what we did.  They threw some paper towels at me to keep from dripping blood everywhere and then one of them escorted me there.  I got an x-ray that confirmed nothing was broken (thank goodness) and was sent home with a sling and some painkillers.

I didn’t go straight home.  (I desperately wanted to go home and take medicine and cry some more, but also I felt I had to do this)  I went to the coffee shop first.  

My former boss quickly ushered me into the office once an employee let her know that someone named Ashley was here to see her.  She eyed the sling my arm was in with alarm.

(I’m doing fine now, I only wore it for like two days)

“It’s fine,” I quickly told her.  “But he’s gone.”

And it took a while to tell her what happened, because I kept crying and once I started I couldn’t stop.  It’s all too much.  I feel like I’m drowning.

“Oh sweetie,” she sighed, coming around the desk so she could pat me on the back.  “I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have asked you to deal with that.”

“I shouldn’t have gone into the basement,” I blubbered.

“How were you supposed to know?  The groundskeeper has never left the cemetery to my knowledge.”

I went very still and blinked away tears.  I had to focus.  She knew about the groundskeeper.  Quietly, I asked her what, exactly, did she know about that thing?

It’s been here a long time, she said.  She found out about it from the person that trained her as manager when she first started working here.  It was just another one of those stories passed around campus except this one was mostly circulated among the staff.  The groundskeeper didn’t like anyone affiliated with the university, they said.  He’d tolerate their presence in the graveyard during visiting hours, but that was all.

But where did he come from, I asked.  She shrugged and said the oral tradition didn’t care much about that.  It was more interested in horrible, certain demise befalling staff members that strayed into the cemetery.

“But why did he go after my manager?” I asked.

“I have no idea,” she sighed.  “You ask too many questions.  That’s a bad habit around here.”

The flickering man wasn’t here to rip people’s tongues out anymore, but I didn’t know quite how to explain that to her.

“It’s rare, but we do lose staff on occasion,” she continued.  “He’s certainly not the first and he won’t be the last.  If the roots are spreading like you say they are, then perhaps there’s no reason other than he happened to be within reach.”

I have my own theory, but I stayed quiet.  She clearly wasn’t interested in speculating.  She just wanted to do her job, get paid, and stay alive.  She wouldn’t care that I wondered if he was getting worse, if he was changing more and more frequently, and that attracted the groundskeeper’s attention.  If the groundskeeper and the roots were hostile towards the university, then perhaps that hostility extended to the creatures it created.  My poor manager wasn’t the only creature I’d seen them eliminate.

“Besides,” she continued.  “Did you see him die?”

“He - the ground -”

“Did you see him die?”

No.  I didn’t.  He was pulled underground.  I was about to bolt out of there and, I don’t know, start digging up graves in the graveyard in the hopes he was inside one, still alive, but the manager’s friendly pat on the back turned into a firm grip on the shoulder.

“Let me deal with this,” she said.  “I’ve got friends in campus security.  We’ll see if we can find him.”

I’m starting to wonder if my life would be better right now if I’d told my former boss everything that was going on as soon as I met her.

“Why do you stay?” I demanded.  “This place isn’t worth it.”

She patted me on the shoulder.

“You’re close to graduation, you’ll get to find out what the job market is like first-hand soon enough.”

I had a horrible thought upon leaving her office.  We’ve figured out that the rain changes people so other than putting it in the rules, I haven’t given it much thought since then.  It was just another thing to worry about, but it was a distant problem.  Not something that directly affects me.

But what if it is?  

Those lapses in my memory?  What if it’s because I’m changing?  We’ve been so focused on the forgetter and Grayson that we’ve ignored the obvious explanation.  The rain changed Maria and she didn’t remember what happened to her.  So what if I’m changing too.  What if I’m me but not-me and that’s why people have seen me around campus in places I normally wouldn’t go.

It’s a horrifying thought.  But it makes sense.  The rain does change people.

It could change me.

It could have changed Grayson.

Because.  Well.

I think some of you are right about him.

I asked Professor Monotone if he had any photos of James.  My heart wasn’t really into the investigation, not after what happened to Laundry Mom and my late boss.  It was more like I was going through the motions and following up on the things I felt I should.  Just wrapping up another loose end and putting a face to James just like we’d put a face to the steam ghost.  Professor Monotone said he did have a photo.  James was part of a group he’d taken on a summer trip one year and they’d taken some group photos at the site.  He’d put them with the other.  He had a whole folder full of them, going back from when he first started teaching here.

Which is kind of sweetly sentimental but also very helpful for my purposes.  I followed him to his office and he rummaged through the folder for a while.  It wasn’t organized in any way.  Every now and then he’d toss a photo in my direction and ramble about what trip that was, where they went, what they did, and what the students involved did after graduation.  It felt a lot like looking through someone’s family photo album.

“Here it is,” he triumphantly proclaimed, holding aloft a photo.  “It wasn’t a big trip.  Just went out to dig up some fossils for a week.”

He handed it to me.

“James is second from the right,” he said.

I took the photo.  Then I quietly asked him to please confirm, second from the right, and that’s my right, correct?  It was.  There he was, a little shorter than the other students on the field trip, standing on tiptoes so that he could throw his arms around the shoulders of the two students standing to either side of him.  He stared at the camera, his hair messy and maybe a little dirty from messing around in the dirt all day, squinting in the bright sunlight.

I finally knew what James looked like.

I stared at the photo for a long time, until Professor Monotone asked me if everything was okay.  I burst into tears at the question and I sobbed so hard that I couldn’t even answer.  The professor just waited patiently, mutely handing me the box of tissues, and when I finally calmed down I only shook my head, handed him the photo, and told him I couldn’t talk about it right now.  That I needed some time.

Because the face that stared at me from the photo, smiling with his arms around his classmate’s shoulders, [was](https://alderrayne.com/) [Grayson.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
