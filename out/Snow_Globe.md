My warm breathe fogged my living room window as I peered out towards the majestic Winter landscape before me. Snow blanketed the changing terrains and danced rhythmically through the air. Knives of ice hung from trees and spread the cold to the frozen leaves. The warm moonlight reflected against every glistening surface and shone a comforting light to fight the darkness. I was entranced by it all. I felt as though I was trapped in a snow globe, confined to this space, helpless to every shake that would engulf my world in another frenzy of white.
                   
The shattering of a wine glass brought my attention back to the inside world. I turned to observe the commotion. My Mother was on her knees gathering up broken pieces of glass. A red puddle had accumulated on the white carpet floor. My Father cursed under his breathe and reluctantly left the room in search of a towel. 
                  
I watched him as he paced through the black hallway until he was absorbed by darkness and disappeared from view. 
                 
The fireplace sparked and crackled while violent flames sent shadows roaming the walls. 
                   
My mother came to her feet holding large pieces of glass. The sharp, jagged, ice like spikes poked at my anxiety. Intrusive thoughts penetrated my brain and metastasised to a near panic attack at the mere sight of these sharp objects. 

I had never been good with needles or knives for as long as I could remember. My heart would beat three times as fast while my breathe would grow shaky and my face would become flushed. My panic began to decline as my Mother exited the room into the darkness.
                 
I calmed myself while sitting in the living room alone, enjoying the peaceful sound of quiet, occasionally interrupted by the crackling from the fireplace. I turned my focus to the outside world. I noticed my hand prints still firmly imprinted on the window from where I was pressed up earlier. 
                 
Some time passed before I started to question where my parents were. It had been at least ten minutes since I had last seen them before they were engulfed by the darkness. 
                
The puddle of red on the carpet had seeped in through the fabric beyond the point of redemption. I became queasy just looking at it. 
                 
I came to my feet in attempt to look for my parents. Blood rushed to my head as black haze circled around my eyes and my legs became unsteady. 

I recollected myself and made my way to the living room door. I peered out into the darkness. The hallway was blacker than black. I gazed cautiously with eyes full of uncertainty. My instincts were drawing me away from the darkness of the hallway. 
                 
As I turned to retake my seat in front of the fire. I was chilled by the sound of my Mother calling my name. My ears perked up and I redirected my gaze to the darkness of the hallway. I called back to her but was met with no response. 
               
I ambled cautiously through the darkness with my arms outstretched in an attempt to get a feel for my surroundings. My fingers reached at nothing as I walked through the empty black void.

My arms eventually hit the kitchen door frame. I crept my fingers along the inside kitchen wall and patted around in search of the light switch. My fingers came to a stop on the switch box. I flipped the switch up to no avail. I reluctantly walked in further. 

My feet were met with a sudden sting, like stepping on Lego bricks, it sent a sudden jolt through my body. I was trapped in a world of darkness. 
              
I called out for my Mother and Father again. Once again I was met with no response. 
              
I was stood in the centre of a dark room with no awareness of my surroundings. I was drifting through a sea of black, with nothing to anchor me to this reality other than the warm sting of my feet. Light spilled into my vision along side a sudden match strike. 
               
My whole world suddenly brightened. The light from the match reflected around the room, revealing a black silhouette standing across the table. I screamed till my lungs were out of air.
               
The kitchen was noticeably different. The walls were covered in messy splatters of red that patterned every inch of interior. My stomach wrenched violently. I attempted to run from this nightmare. 

The first step I took made my whole body ache as I fell to the ground. My whole body was met with a sharp sensation that causes me to shriek. My heart sank and my blood ran cold upon ascertaining the reason for this unbearable pain. 
              
I examined the kitchen floor to see it was covered in broken glass. Tears rolled down my cheek and anxiety waved through my whole nervous system. 
            The fire from the match stick had burned to the end of the splint and once again my world went dark.
