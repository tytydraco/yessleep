Drain of Despair

When I stepped into the Richards' bathroom, I was hit by the usual smell of bleach mixed with coppery blood. It clung to the back of my throat, a sickly sweet perfume I had long grown accustomed to in my line of work. 

I have never properly introduced myself. My name's Claire. I'm a crime scene cleaner. I don't ask questions. I just scrub, bleach, and make nightmares disappear. 

And if you have followed my other entries, you will know those nightmares are all too real at times.

This one, though? This was different. Monsters don't phase me, but this one touched something personal.

Something as a woman I have been all too guilty of.

Mr. Jarod Richards had been murdered by his wife. Found in the bathtub, his throat slit. Infidelity was the motive, or so the cops said. But I wasn't here for gossip. I was here to clean.

Mrs. Richards kept screaming to anyone who would listen as they hauled her off that she was innocent. That she didn't even know he was cheating. 

Yeah, yeah. Our prison system is chock full of innocent people put there to protect them from the rest of us degenerates.

The bathroom was white- sterile, almost, and yet, everything felt grimy. The tiles were slick under my boots as I surveyed the scene. Blood clung to the grout lines, and the stench of death was thick. But it wasn't just the blood that unsettled me. There was something else.

 
Something crawling beneath my skin.

A smell. Old soap scum and rot.

I started with the shower drain. The cops had warned me it was clogged with... debris. I assumed hair, bits of skin-standard post-murder grime. What came out was worse.

As I pulled at the hair clog, it resisted. I yanked harder, and the glob of hair, soap scum, and skin cells came loose with a wet pop. It wasn't just a clump. It writhed.

My first thought was rats. Maybe they'd nested in the pipes. 

Can they even DO that?!

But then it moved-a slithering motion that made my stomach lurch.

The thing wasn't a rat. It was made of human hair. Long strands of blonde and black hair twisted with clumps of dead skin, forming sinewy tendrils. I dropped it, backing up against the sink.

Something about that blonde hair bothered me. But no time to ponder the mystery.

It rose.

I stood frozen as the thing shaped itself into something almost human, a torso-like mass, arms formed from strands of hair, fingers of knotted skin and keratin. Its eyes were hollow pits, but it looked at me.

"What... are you?" I whispered.

Yeah, not the most brilliant words I have ever spoken. But you face a gross hair drain monster and report back to me about the Shakespeare YOU rattled off.

It didn't answer. It lashed out instead, one sinewy arm slapping the cleaning supplies off the counter. Great! There went the good cleaner. No way was i turning my back on this thing to grab it!

Its movement was erratic, clumsy, but there was intent.

Malice.

And it spoke! A wet clogged sound. Like if a cat could speak and chose to do do with a hairball in its throat. 

"Jarod... leave... Jarod... alone..."

I looked arpund in desperation. I needed something. ANYTHING! When my eyes landed on a familiar pink bottle.

I grabbed the bottle of industrial-strength Nair.

Desperate, I twisted the cap off and squeezed it at the creature. The chemical splashed across its grotesque body, and the reaction was immediate.

The hair sizzled. The skin blistered. It thrashed violently, letting out a soundless scream as it disintegrated, chunks of it falling into the blood-streaked tub. I kept spraying, emptying the entire bottle until nothing remained but a stinking pile of burnt hair and skin.

Running to the back porch I hurled my cheap Chinese food lunch over the rail.

I am going to claim food poisoning. No way am I ready to admit a crime scene cleanup had shaken me up that badly.

I fell to my knees, gasping for air. My heart thundered in my chest as I tried to comprehend what had just happened. I'd seen death in countless forms, but nothing like that.

When the police came to check my work, I told them the drain was clear, the bathroom spotless. They never asked questions, and I wasn't about to explain. Some nightmares belong in the dark, where no one can see.

As I packed up my supplies, I noticed a single hair clinging to the edge of the sink. Blonde, twisted with black.

I used the last few drops of Nair to burn it. And then I left.

On my way to the store I realized what was wrong with the blonde hair. Carol and Jarod Richards. DINKs. No one else in house. Both faces splashed all over the news. Both faces with very black hair.

Maybe Mrs. Richards was innocent after all. Maybe even the gross drain monster wasn't even her hair. Or... not all of it.

But what could I do? No one was going to believe "Mistress's hair monster murders cheating boyfriend, frames wife."

At the store I grabbed 5 bottles of Nair and two bottles of Drano. I dumped them down every drain I owned.
