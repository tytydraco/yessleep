I got a Nespresso coffee machine recently. A little pricey, but it’s been worth it.

Sometimes I’m excited to go to sleep because I get to have a coffee when I wake up. Lately, it’s felt like the best part of my day. This morning I decided on a hazelnut pod, a personal favorite.

The first sip is heavenly, full bodied and just a teeny bit sweet. The second is interrupted. I pull one curly black hair from between my teeth. Ew. My boyfriend sheds like a Labrador.

I smile anyway, twirling the hair between my fingers. We moved in together a few months ago and it’s been amazing, despite his hair wiggling its way into my butt crack, collecting in swampy wads in the shower drain, swimming in my morning coffee…

I toss the hair in the garbage and draw in a third warm mouthful.

This time, a soggy tuft tickles my tongue. Oh god, ew. I swear, I can taste his conditioner.

I spatter it into the trash can, far less enchanted than the first strand. Did he toss his hair clippings into my mug?

I think about dumping the last gulp, but hey, it’s like $1.50 per pod. Down the hatch-

But my stomach hitches. Something other than coffee nearly slips down my throat. I spew it back into the cup.

A tooth. Root and all. A few wispy strands of tissue cling to its legs, drifting in the backwash.

My first thought: I lost a tooth.

I sprint to the bathroom and open wide in the mirror. Looks okay. Phew.

But then my brow breaks out in a prickly sweat. Who’s tooth is in my mug?

My boyfriend is not home, he leaves for work before I wake up, and I sleep like the dead. I call him, whispering silent prayers.

Then I hear his ringtone, Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. God, that’s such an old joke. I giggle at the ridiculousness before it sinks in. This is a bad thing. A very very bad thing.

It’s close and sounds canned and boxy, like it’s coming from…

The cabinets. I rip open one, two, and there it is in the third. Cracked and smeared in-

No, no, no, god no.

Blood, bright and shiny like a candy apple. I don’t know why, but I pick up my own call.

“Hello?”

“*Hello*?” I echo through the phone. The sound of my own voice makes me shiver.

“Oh no.”

“*Oh no*.” I sound panicked.

“Please god.”

“*Please god*.”

“Is he okay?”

“*He’s not okay*.” I answer.

I stop short. What? The hairs on my arms stand on end.

I’m just in shock. I need to find him. I hang up the phone.

“Baby?” I call out. “My love?”

I circle and search for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing. There’s nothing except a fucking tooth in my mug and my boyfriend’s phone in my pocket. The whiny voice of Rick Astley makes me jump.

I realize after answering that it’s my own phone calling.

“Hello!”“*Hello!*” I shout back.

“Motherfucker.” I reach to end the call, must’ve been a butt dial-

“*Watch your language*.” I warn.

My breath catches in my throat.

“What?”

“*What*?”

“April Fools?”

“*You wish.*”

My eye halts on a puddle of blood forming in our (decorative) fireplace.

“Oh my god.”

“*Oh god, yes*.”

I hang up and get on my knees. I take a shaky breath, then lean my head in.

Blood drip, drip, drips on my forehead, trickles into my tear ducts. My vision is dim and stained pink, but the sight is unmistakable.

The love of my life stares back at me, unblinking, sightless. His blue lips contort into a gaping maw. He looks scared, terrified actually. Sure enough, every tooth is gone, his gums ripped and weeping. His bare feet cradle the back of his bedhead. He was folded to fit up there, backwards.

I vomit. It reeks of hazelnut.

Never Gonna Give You Up jolts me upright. I clunk heads with his lifeless corpse.

It’s me calling, of course. I kick the cursed phone away from me.

Then my phone vibrates. My phone for the first time today. I pull it out of my pocket with dread. I’m calling myself. How is that possible?

I answer.

“Hello?”

“*Hello*.” I can hear the smile on my face.

“What did you do?”

“*What did you do*?”

I can’t breathe. I suck down jerky, heaving breaths, but I’m not getting any oxygen. My chest and arms tingle. This isn’t real. It can’t be.

I’m having a panic attack.

I rocket to my feet and grab my car keys. I don’t even bother slipping on shoes.

I’m in my car, speeding through a school zone. I inhale for 4. Hold for 7. Exhale for 8.

Anxiety does weird things to people. I’m sure it can cause hallucinations. The longer I drive, the more I’m convinced, none of that really happened.

My boyfriend went to work this morning. A tooth in my coffee? My own voice prank calling me? Doesn’t sound real.

My face feels tight, my eyes crusted, but it’s not blood. There’s sleep in my eyes. That’s all. I don’t check in the rearview mirror because I know that to be true.

I pull over and type it all out on my phone. By the end, I’m snickering. It’s so ridiculous, really. The tension in my jaw releases, my breathing settles.

Yes. It didn’t happen. I’m sure of it.

Then, my phone rings. My boyfriend's calling.

My heart jumps into my throat. My sticky fingers grip the steering wheel tighter.

It keeps buzzing, tickling my eardrums like a bug I'd like to crush.

I should answer. Prove to myself that I'm right. That he's just at work checking in. That the worst thing I found this morning was a cute little hair in my coffee.

But I don't. I let it buzz.

Finally, merciful silence. I let out the breath I'd been holding.

Then, my phone lights up. One new voicemail.

I can't listen now. I think I'll just keep driving.
