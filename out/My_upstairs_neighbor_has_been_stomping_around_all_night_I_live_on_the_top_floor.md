I moved into Unit 4C about three months ago.

Top floor. Old brick building. Nothing fancy, but it’s quiet. Cheap, too. It’s just me up here. No roommates. No pets. The apartment above mine was supposed to be empty — there’s no fifth floor. Just the roof.

So when I heard footsteps above me, I figured I was wrong. The first time it happened, it was 2 a.m.
Heavy footsteps, pacing across the ceiling. Back and forth, back and forth. Then a dragging sound. Then quiet.

I figured it was the pipes. Or the wind. You can convince yourself of anything when you’re tired. But then it happened again the next night. And again the night after that. Always around 2 a.m. Always heavy. Always dragging something.

I went down to the lobby and asked the super, Mr. Delaney, about it. “You sure it’s not coming from next door?” he asked. “No,” I said. “It’s from above.” He frowned. “There’s nothing above you. Just the roof. It’s locked.” Then he added, after a pause:
“Don’t try to go up there.”

A few nights later, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing them. The steps. The dragging. And something new—scraping. Like furniture being pulled across a wooden floor, over and over again. I went into the hallway, looked at the stairwell. The door to the roof was shut. Chained.

But as I got closer… I heard something on the other side. Breathing. Slow. Heavy. Right on the other side of the door. I backed away and didn’t sleep that night.

I started asking the other tenants. Most of them looked uncomfortable. One guy, in 2A, pulled me aside and whispered, “You hear it too?” I nodded. He glanced up at the ceiling, then said, “Don’t listen too hard. That’s how they notice you.”

Last Thursday, the sound changed. No more dragging. Now it sounded like… tapping. Like someone running their nails along the ceiling, just above my bed. Faster. Then slower. Then suddenly, three hard knocks. Directly above me. I stared up at the ceiling.

And I swear to God — it knocked back. Three times. Perfectly timed. That night, I had a dream. I was walking up the stairwell to the roof. The door was open. The chain had been snapped.I stepped inside.

The room was too big. Too wrong. The roof stretched on forever, filled with old furniture — rocking chairs, dressers, beds with the sheets still made. And people stood beside each one. Motionless. Facing the floor.

Their skin was stretched too tight. Their eyes were just dark pits. They didn’t move… until I turned around. Then they all looked up. At the same time. And one of them smiled.

When I woke up, my door was open. Just barely. Like someone had left, or come in. I checked the lock — nothing broken. Nothing tampered with. But there were footprints. Bare. Wet. Leading away from my bed and stopping at the door. Just one set. Mine were dry.

I don’t sleep much anymore. The ceiling creaks constantly now. Sometimes I hear voices. Sometimes I see shadows pass over the floor, like someone’s walking above — blocking out the light.

Once, I looked out my peephole and saw someone standing at the end of the hall. Not moving. Just facing my door. Yesterday, I got brave. Stupid. I went up to the roof.

The chain was still there. The lock, too. But the door was warm. And someone had carved something into it: “SOMEONE MOVED OUT. I NEED A NEW FLOOR.”

Now when I lie in bed, I hear scratching inside the walls. Like something is crawling down toward me. Like a new floor is being built. Not above. Below.
