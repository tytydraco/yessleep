I'm a college student working part time at my local fast food chain to pay off my education loan. My days are filled with the same tedious tasks- Bag the fries, write the college assignments, pass the classes, try to sleep in a house that has walls as thin as paper. I indulge in very little because I'm always paranoid about the next expense. Every spare moment I get, I'm consuming content about makeup. It's my guilty pleasure and it's the one thing in my life that I look forward to.

I have this one channel I've absolutely adored since I was a little girl. Yesterday after finishing up all my tasks, I sat on my cot and followed the usual routine- opened the app and clicked on her latest upload.  
But... something was different. I doubt it was immediately noticeable to anyone, but me, who had been watching her for months. Every smile was a little out of place, every hair tuck was a little too choreographed, every word was enunciated to the T. No fallacies, not a single imperfection. This didn't feel like the girl I had watched for years at all.

But, I told myself I was making it up. I had to be making it up. She's still in the same room, recommending the same kind of products, with the same voice, whatever difference I was feeling, I was probably making it up.

I snapped back into focus, I wanted to see what I could get my hands on this month.  
"So guys, this is my latest find- it is a beautiful gloss from F-"  
and then she stopped. Her eyes stared into the camera, widening. Not from fear, but like something had just snapped inside her.  
Her eyes didn't stop widening. Her eyeballs were almost popping out, her lips were streching beyond human recognition.

"So. You noticed something off, hmm?"  
*What the fuck? Who is she talking to?*

"Why do you watch me so closely?"  
"What?" I said out loud, as if her question was directed towards me.  
"Yes you. Does it give you an escape from your pathetic life?"  
Her eyes were this shade of red that made my skin crawl. She didn't blink she didn't stir. I couldn't move.

"Don't be scared angel, everyone needs an escape. Does the makeup make you feel better? This makes *me* feel better." She said before pulling a chunk of her hair out. I gulped down my vomit.  
"I'm telling you. It's a real cure, the products will make you feel better... for a bit. But this is the real cure. It'll hurt but trust me. Do it. Do it now. Do it right now."

I found some semblence of strength in me to shut the laptop off, and waddled my way into my bathroom, throwing my guts up. I didn't know what to do. Call the police? Call my mom? Call my friends?

I settled for the last option. I phoned my best friend who was in my apartment within minutes.

"Dude. You sound insane." were the first words out of her mouth after I explained the entire incident.  
"I KNOW. But trust me, it was real. She isn't human she's like some, some possessed or deeply ill, I don't know but I'm not lying."

"Z. I think you need to see someone. You really cannot be looking into videos for escapes and working yourself to the bone- look at what it's doing to you."  
I sighed. She was right. I didn't even recognise myself anymore.

Then she said something that made my stomach turn.  
"Why are you smiling? It's creeping me out."

I turned towards her, confused. "I'm not smiling."

Her cheeks sunk, her mouth opened like she was whispering a prayer, terror was etched all over her face.

"Why the fuck do you have a bald patch on your head."  
"What the fuck are you talking about?"  
"Stop smiling. I swear to God this is not funny."  
"I'm not smiling!" I yelled at her.

She was crying now. Crawling on the floor away from me.  
"Aria what the hell is going on what the fuck are you doing?"  
"Z. Stay the fuck away from me I have a gun. I don't know what game you're playing but if you don't stop RIGHT now."

"I'm not doing anything!" I yelled. But I realised. My mouth didn't move.  
I thought I was saying something all this while, but I hadn't. I hadn't said anything. My lips were dry, my eyes were burning. *Blink,* I told myself, *Speak,* I willed myself. But I couldn't. I couldn't move. Every part of me felt paralysed.

That's all I remember.  
I woke up inside a hospital the next day. Aria isn't doing too well is all I keep hearing. I beg for her to meet me but I'm blocked on every possible platform. I explain the whole ordeal over and over again- to the police, to customer support, to my friends, to my mom, to my psychiatrist. Nobody believes me. I do not know what happened that night, but I do know I am not crazy. Everybody "wants to help me" but the truth is nobody wants to be around me anymore. Nobody *is* actually helping. And as much as I try, I think it will remain this way.
