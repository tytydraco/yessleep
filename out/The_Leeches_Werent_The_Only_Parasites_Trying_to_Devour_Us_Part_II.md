[PART I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mz8lcm/the_leeches_werent_the_only_parasites_trying_to/)

I slowly turned. To my left, there was a man covered in tattoos. To my right, another. Both armed with Glocks, staring through me like I was already a body in a ditch as they held handguns to me.

Then I saw who I could only presume was Diego, standing by the wall with Isabella in his arms. His tattoo-covered hand was wrapped over her mouth, holding her still. Her tiny face was blotchy from crying. The little girl’s eyes locked on mine, confused and terrified.

Behind him, the third man cinched zip ties around Rosa’s wrists, pulling her arms behind her back. She didn’t resist. She didn’t even flinch.

Diego smiled. That sick, smug smile I remembered from the photos Rosa kept hidden in drawers.

“Well, well,” he said, bouncing Isabella lightly like she was just fussy, not terrified, hand clamped over her mouth. “Didn’t think you’d make it, white boy. Thought the ground might open and swallow you on the way here.”

I clenched my jaw. “Let her go.”

He chuckled a laugh that was deep and cruel. “You come into my home, and start with demands? You’ve got some nerve.”

I didn’t answer. I looked at Rosa instead. Her mouth was trembling. The gangbanger behind her finished the zip ties and stepped back. Diego turned, handed Isabella off like a grocery bag, and walked slowly toward Rosa. His hand slid along her shoulder, down her arm. She tensed, shivered, but stayed silent.

“You see this?” he said, gesturing to Rosa and the baby. “This is my house. My girl. My blood.”

I stepped forward, but the barrel against my head pushed me back.

“Take me instead.” I said, voice low. “Whatever this is? You want revenge? Fine. Let them go.”

Diego scoffed, amusement flickering in his eyes. “Take you instead?” he echoed.

He laughed like I’d told a joke. The gang members laughed too. Their tone was low and ugly.

“What position are you in to make demands, gringo? You walk in here with no gun, no gang, no plan, and you want to bargain?” He leaned close, inches from my face and let off a big toothy grin.

“I’m going to take you both.”

Then he turned back to Rosa, grabbed her arm, and yanked her toward the front door. She stumbled but didn’t fall.

“First,” he said, “I’m getting remarried to the beautiful mother of my child. We’re going to say our vows, today.”

“I’d rather die!” Rosa hissed, teeth bared.

He slapped her so hard her head snapped sideways. She staggered, knees buckling, but stayed upright.

The room went dead silent.

He raised the Glock and pressed it against Isabella’s tiny temple. The baby whimpered.

“You think you’re in a bargaining position, chica?” Diego hissed. “You want to say no? Say no again, and your little brat won’t see manana!”

Rosa’s whole body shook. But she said nothing. Then Diego slowly tuned back toward me as the Glock stayed trained on Isabella.

“Crazy times, huh?” Diego said, like we were chatting over drinks. “Whole city sinking into the dirt. Guess God’s finally cashing in.”

I nodded, slow. “Yeah. Been a mess out there. I’m surprised you got in.”

He grinned. “Oh, I got in just fine. Took the boat in through the docks. While the coast guard's busy playing ferry service for all the little rats trying to run, we slip under the pier. Real quiet-like.”

Then it hit me. He says he came here from the docks. Worms hated water. True they were leech-like. But they weren’t full leeches. They had some earthworm in them.

Diego lowered the weapon and leaned back against the wall; arms crossed like a man already victorious. “Didn’t even lose any homies. Ain’t that something?”

I kept my voice neutral, trying carefully not to reveal what I saw. “Smart move.”

Good thing this gangbanger didn’t read up on arachnids, insects and annelids like I, the class nerd, did.

He squinted at me, then smirked. “Where you think we should do it?”

I tilted my head. “The wedding?”

He laughed. “Yeah. I’m asking the class nerd who looks like he knows more about geology than I do. Gotta be somewhere fitting.”

“Inside’s dangerous.” I said carefully. “You’ve seen the tremors. Any building could come down on us. Out in the open's safer. Stable. We’re not far from the edge of the old tarmac, near the collapsed metro. It’s flat ground—clean sightlines.”

He glared at me. “You trying to tell me where to marry my wife, güero?”

I shrugged, holding his gaze. “You asked my opinion. The ground’s been unstable everywhere, but typically during an earthquake, the safest place to be is outside.”

Diego thought about it. Then nodded slowly. Good thing he didn’t see the same things I did.

Isabella whimpered in the other gang member’s arms, her little legs kicking. Rosa’s eyes were locked on her baby like a laser.

“She’s hungry.” Rosa said suddenly. “She’s tired. You zip-tied me. I’m the only one who can calm her down.”

Diego waved a hand. “She’ll deal.”

“She won’t!” Rosa snapped. “You want her quiet for your big day? Let me hold her.”

Diego stared, then reached for Rosa’s wrists. “Try anything,” he hissed as he cut the zip ties with a pocket blade, “and I put her in the ground. You understand me?”

Rosa nodded once. “Clear as day.”

As soon as her arms were free, Isabella squirmed loose and flung herself into her mother’s chest, sobbing into Rosa’s collarbone.

I didn’t breathe for a moment. None of us did.

Then Diego clapped once, loud and sharp. “Let’s go. Outside. Wedding time.”

The gangbanger behind me jammed the barrel of the Glock into my shoulder. “You first. Out the door. Stay ahead of us gringo. No sudden moves.”

I stepped out, slow and measured. Behind me, the gang moved in a loose triangle. Diego at the point, Rosa with the baby behind him, the other two flanking her. Their boots scraped against the cracked walkway as we approached the stretch of open tarmac as I walked several feet ahead of them.

I hope this works. The way I see it, Diego is going to kill me one way or the other. And I think Rosa would rather die than go back with Diego.

The wind was law. The sky, weirdly still. The ground beneath us shook. At first, it was subtle. Like a truck rolling by underground. Then it intensified. A ripple passed through the tarmac like something alive was swimming just below the surface.

We all froze.

“Qué carajo…” one of the soldiers muttered.

Slithering, writhing and muffled churning could be heard. There was something massive beneath us.

Isabella started crying again. Babies just know. And Diego, for the first time, looked genuinely scared. I slowly turned around to face the gang as the rumbling started getting worse. They were right on top of it now. The pavement beneath her and Diego buckled.

Diego, the other three gangbangers, Rosa and Isabelle all looked down, panic deluging over their faces. As a loud, slithering slurping sound hissed immediately below them.

“ROSA! JUMP FORWARD! NOW!” I screamed at the top of my lungs as I quickly turned around to face her.

Everything happened in an instant:

The two gangbangers trained their weapons on me as Diego and the remaining gangbanger turned their attention to Rosa and her baby girl. But before they could make another move, the road split open like a zipper, and something slithered upward with unnatural speed. But it stopped as it was trying to force it’s mouth, filled with countless needle-like teeth through the pavement. It seemed to be stuck as it slowly got through.

“What the fu-!” one of his goons screamed before falling into the mouth of that monstrous giant worm along with another man. The worm bit down on them both hard, causing them to scream out in terror and agony, their top halves flailing.

Rosa however managed to leap away from the collapsing hole just in time and already tried to run with Isabelle. But she tripped on a section of road pushed up by the worm. She banged her knee against the tarmac cushioning Isabelle’s fall. I yelled for her to kick it up, but her knee was sprained, locked or worse

More of the pavement below the four of them collapsed and they all fell into the leech’s mouth. The first two gangbangers fell in and were stabbed and skewered by the creature’s large jaws. They fired their guns haphazardly into the air. I ducked into a prone position to avoid getting shot.

Diego and the remaining gangbanger, however, got caught in the thing’s mouth. Diego looked to the remaining gangbanger, and gave him a hard kick to the head, shoving him headfirst into the worm’s massive, gaping jaws.

“TAKE HIM!”

The gangbanger had just enough time to scream before the creature clamped down and dragged him, his arms flailed into the air like a drowning swimmer before they went limp in a brutal crunch\*\*.\*\*

Diego went for the handgun on the ground.

I lunged, driving my elbow into his temple, sending the Glock flying.

The man whirled, dazed, but I slammed a knife hand into the soft tissue just behind the thug’s neck. But he blocked with his right hand. He looked at me and smirked.

“He’s a kickboxer!” Rosa yelled, clutching Isabelle.

Diego smirked at me. "I’m going to beat you within an inch of your life, homie!"

Diego rushed in with his guard up, throwing a heavy jab-cross combo that forced me to backpedal fast. The guy was strong, fast, and knew how to throw! His stance was tight, feet planted well even as the ground shook beneath us. But I wasn’t aiming to win with fists.

I ducked under a wild hook and slipped in.

“Means nothing!” I grunted, ducking low and wrapping my arms around his waist, “if you’re a grappler!”

His size and strength meant nothing on the ground.

I dropped my level and drove forward, catching Diego off balance. We crashed to the ground, me in top half guard. Then I transitioned into side control. He bucked hard, trying to scramble up, but I’d already isolated an arm. I quickly went into full mount, placed a knee under his left shoulder, and cranked a hard kimura.

He thrashed wild and angry as he fought the pain. I bet he wasn’t anticipating I knew how to grapple, but that was the thing about street fighters and boxers: they hated being on their backs. They weren’t used to it. It broke them.

I then cranked harder. And heard a loud CRUNCH.

He yelped out in abject pain. He held his arm to his shoulder as he writhed on the ground in agony. I looked over to Rosa as a smile enveloped over her face. It may have been a fraction of the agony he caused when he abused her, but she must have been ecstatic to see him get his just desserts.

It wasn’t long before cracked pavement gave way. The tarmac below him collapsed, and I rolled backwards to escape. Diego screams echoed as he fell into the hole. But I didn’t see any worms. It was just a regular sinkhole.

Rosa dropped to her knees, pulling Isabella tight against her chest, crying silently. I stood over the fresh sinkhole. The ground was still breathing beneath their feet.

But Diego was gone. I took the Glock from the ground, hands shaking.

“We need to go,” i said, voice hoarse. “We have to get out of this city and get to safety.”

Rosa nodded, already pulling herself to her feet.

We were still breathing. That was the first thing I noticed. There were no more cracks. No more screeches or slithers. The air was filled with the sounds of me, Rosa, and baby Isabelle breathing heavily.

I turned to Rosa slowly, my limbs shook nervously, adrenaline was still pumping through me. Her arms were wrapped tight around Isabelle, but her eyes were on me. Wide. Angry. Grateful. Overflowing. Then she stepped forward and pressed her forehead to mine. For a moment, we just held there, breathing the same fractured air.

She whispered, "*Gracias a Dios...*"

I wrapped my arms around both her and the baby. We just stood like that. One half-second longer than what the world usually allowed.

Then, Rosa slapped me. Her hand hit my cheek hard. Not cruel. Not angry. Just desperate.

“Don’t you ever do that again, Martin.” Her voice cracked. “Don’t you ever put yourself in danger like that. Damn it, I-I-” She cut herself off as her lips quivered. “I care about you too much for that.”

It wasn’t quiet anymore. Not in my chest. I felt her heartbeat too.

I opened my mouth, tried to say something, anything, but her arms were already around me again, holding tight. Isabelle pressed between us like a fragile little heartbeat.

But then, I felt a loud crunch beneath my feet.

I looked down, and my eyes shot open to realize we were still on the tarmac. Rosa’s gaze followed mine. “Move. Now.”

I grabbed her hand, and she gripped Isabelle tight to her chest. We didn’t wait to find out if the worms were done. We bolted across the lot, past the cracked sidewalk, and towards the storefront at the other end. We ran swiftly across spiderwebbed fissures and concrete sinking under the pressure of the shaking world. The storefront was half-collapsed but standing. Its front window was shattered but the inside was dark as dark could get.

We dove inside just as the ground shuddered again, one last low groan echoed from the pavement behind us. I braced the broken automatic doors behind us with a fallen shelf. The impact slightly cracked the tile. Rosa sank to the floor, clutching Isabelle, rocking slightly. I slumped down and sat beside them. My legs were jello, and my heart was still hammering in my chest.

I took a minute to catch my breath before hauling myself up and heading over to the window. It was quiet. No rumbling was felt, and no slithering or writhing sound could be heard either.  
Rosa held Isabella close to her chest, her arms trembling from adrenaline and raw survival as she walked over to me. From the edge of the window, we canvassed the parking lot, sinks

The apartment block was behind us, the road ahead winding down through busted streetlights and collapsed storefronts. Smoke hung low, curling over the cracked sidewalk like ghost fingers.

“Martin!” Rosa gasped, pointing a finger out the window.

Across the street, maybe thirty yards away, half-shadowed in the smoke and red dusk.

“Diego!” Rosa exclaimed, eyes widened. He was staggering, but the son of a bitch was still alive. He was clutching his arm, shoulder twisted, face slack and smeared with dirt. He hauled himself up and out of the sinkhole like a broken puppet. But he didn’t look so good.

Thankfully me and Rosa were out of sight. We watched him collapse once more on the pavement.

“We have to move! Come on!” I said grabbing her hand and leading her out the back of the store.

We slipped away, vanishing behind a row of shattered vending machines. We traveled a few more blocks south before we made it to another smaller storefront. No power. No people. Just moldy clothing tables, empty racks, and several mannequins with no face.

Rosa changed Isabella’s diaper in a dusty corner while I stood by the cracked window with my phone out. I checked the signal.

There was only one bar. Then I got one final text from Claudia.

“I heard what’s happening. I’m still in town. I’m at the airport. I have a way out! But you have to be quick or you won’t make it!”

I stared at the screen. I simply did not know what to do or what to make of this.

Claudia. The girl who bullied me with sugar-coated cruelty. The girl who pushed me to the edge, told me I was nothing without her. Who laughed when I cried and called it “emotional manipulation.”

Now, she was offering a way out. But I think I knew better coming from the woman who spent months treating me horribly.

I just stared at my phone with my expression blank and my stare vacant. My eyes now fixed in the distance, maybe half a mile out

Diego was gone. But now we had a whole new issue. Rosa walked over to me, holding Isabelle. She looked up at me with anxious, yet terrified eyes wide as saucers.

“What are we going to do?”

A heavy silence fell over us as we looked out into the city. We could faintly hear people screaming out in the distance. Sirens blared and echoed over us as we peeked out the window, feeling the occasional light rumble slither through the ground below us. More screams echoed far off. A horn blared, then abruptly cut out.

I walked over one of the empty tables and placed down the handgun. between them and daylight fading fast, Martin laid down the stolen handgun. His hands trembled only slightly now. Rosa pulled a half-empty water bottle from their bag, gave Isabella a sip, then drank the rest herself.

“We need to leave,” I said. “We may not get another miracle.” I then turned to her with a cold stare. “We have to get out of the city by any means necessary. There’s nothing else to it.” I then turned my attention to the store, and back to my work clothes and formal wear.

“But first, I think we should change into something more practical. Not sure if I want to be trying to survive in dress shoes during the zombie apocalypse.

The store was dim, still quiet. Dust floated like static in the fading light. Rosa moved like a shadow, focused and fast. She set Isabelle down gently on a folded towel she’d found in the corner, then sifted through a box of scattered clothes.

She nodded and didn’t hesitate. She put on a pair of black yoga shorts, snug but easy to move in. A faded maroon tank top, tight against her chest. She tied her long brown hair back with a rubber band snapped off a crumpled bag of chips. Her eyes were wide and dark but still glinting with that survivor’s edge. She scanned me as I changed into a white tee and sweatpants.

It was quiet except for the sound of a can opener struggling through old metal. We ate quickly but sparingly. Cold beans. Dry granola bars. Water sips for Isabelle. The baby clung to Rosa’s chest, her tiny body twitching softly in her sleep.

I hesitated, and then sighed deeply, loudly. “There’s something I haven’t told you.”

Rosa looked up slowly, her expression neutral but unreadable.

“It’s my ex, Claudia, she’s-she’s-” I said with a slight stutter, trying to get the words out. “-At the airport. She’s offered a way out. She is a flight attendant for private planes.”

Or so she says.

Rosa narrowed her eyes. “Offered?”

I nodded. “Y-yes, but…” my voice trailed off. “…Something seemed off about her tone. It didn’t seem like her normal tone she used when she last spoke to me.”

“Rosa winced, tilting her head. “Like it wasn’t laced with the usual venom?”

I nodded. “That’s the weird part. She messaged again. Just now. Tone was... different. Desperate, almost. Said the situation changed fast. Said if we don’t get to her soon, we won’t get out at all.”

Rosa stared at me for a long, tense moment. “Do you trust her?”

I exhaled. “I-I don’t know.”

She scoffed. “That says it all. She’s only desperate now because things aren’t in her control anymore.” Her voice then hardened. “That’s what people like her do. They don’t *change*. They *adapt* when the world stops listening to them.”

I didn’t say anything.

Rosa shook her head. “She reminds me of Diego. When the threats didn’t work, he’d cry. Beg. Whisper promises. That’s when he was *most* dangerous.”

She made solid eye contact with me

“I’m not going near another person like that. Not with Isabelle. Not ever again.” She said holding her daughter close, pacifier in her mouth.

I swallowed. “Even if it’s our only way out?”

Rosa sighed, shaking her head. “No. If we go there, we go *for us*. Not for her. Not to beg. Not to trust.” She held Isabelle tighter to her chest. “If she gets us out, good. If she tries to control us...” Her voice dropped. “I’ll put a bullet through her throat myself.”

Silence settled again, thick and sure. There was no fear in Rosa’s voice. Only clarity.

I nodded slowly. “Then we go prepared.”

The sky was dying into a rust-colored haze as the sun slipped beneath the smoke-draped skyline. The air tasted like ash and dust. In the distance, sirens still howled, but fainter now, swallowed by the decay of a city coming undone. I adjusted the strap of the backpack slung over my shoulder, but my other hand was pressed to my forehead, fingers gripping my temple like I was trying to keep something from breaking loose. Rosa tilted her head and shot me a puzzled glance.

She stood a few paces away, Isabelle cradled in one arm, bouncing her gently. Her eyes scanned me, lingering on the sweatpants, the sneakers, the plain white shirt that hung off me like a man stripped bare. And not just for clothes.

“Hey,” she said softly. “Are you okay papi?”

I didn’t answer. Not for a long moment. Not until the sound of a distant horn echoing off collapsed walls forced me to speak.

“…Yeah. I s-should be.” I stammered, trying to reassure myself. But who was I kidding? With months of trauma behind me? The damage was already done.

Rosa shook her head, not in anger, but in clarity.

“No,” she said, voice soft. “There’s no way in hell we can go back there.”

I blinked, turning to her slowly, tone not angry but curious. “Why?”

She didn’t answer right away. She just canvassed me from head to toe. My shirt was stained with sweat, and not the kind of sweat normally obtained through a six mile run or standing in the sun for two hours. She noticed the twitch in my jaw and the haunted, gaunt look in my eyes. The heaviness in my voice. And it wasn’t just physical exhaustion either.

“I can see it.” she said finally, sitting down on a table nearby, rocking Isabelle. “In your eyes.”

I didn’t protest. In fact, I didn’t say a word as she continued.

“She ruined you, I can see it.” Rosa’s said, her tone soft. Calm. Cold. True. “You were willing to sleep on benches. You gave up your apartment, your job, everything just to get away from her.”

Her words, no her truth, landed on my head like a ten-ton anvil.

“Whatever hell Claudia’s living in right now, she earned it.” Rosa went on. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not going back into her fire just to escape our own. There’s no way in hell I’m trusting her.” She then looked down at Isabelle, who looked up at her with big, pleading eyes, pacifier still in her mouth. “I barely escaped Diego. WE barely escaped. It’s nothing short of a miracle that the three of us are unharmed.” She then held her close. “I’ll take my chances with the oversized leeches. And I personally would rather be eaten alive than let that asshole lay a finger on me, or my baby.”

She shook her head again, slower now, eyes flicking toward the distant airport tower barely visible beyond the haze. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not rolling the dice again.”

I finally nodded, slowly.

Martin crouched down near the curb, tugging the backpack straps tighter across his chest. He was staring past the buildings, where the orange haze bled into shadows and broken rooftops.

“If the airport’s off the table,” I said finally, voice low and measured, “then there’s only two ways out.”

Rosa adjusted Isabelle on her hip, eyes narrowing. “Go on.”

Martin pointed east, toward the shattered skyline. “We can go the long way. On foot. Cut through the city—move wide around the docks.”

Her brow furrowed. “The docks? Out of the question. Diego said he came from there. If he’s still alive, and I think he is, he’s not stupid. He’ll assume we’ll head for a boat or military checkpoint. And right now the closest one is near the docks. It’s the obvious escape. That’s where he’ll wait. And this time... he won’t be careless,” Rosa finished.

Martin nodded.

“Which leaves us the city,” she muttered. “And the worms.”

I nodded, “Yeah.”

“The coast guard’s by the water,” I went on, his tone sharpening with logic now, pacing slightly. “But if *they’re* there, then the *National Guard* has to be further out. Inland. On the city’s edge, maybe north or northwest—where the highways used to lead.”

“And between us and them...”

He nodded again.

“Collapsed roads. Fires. Buildings ready to fall over. Worms the size of buses, slithering under cracked asphalt. They’re movement sensitive. We stay off tarmac, avoid flint and soft soil, we’ll have a better shot.”

Rosa exhaled slowly, staring out at the grid of buildings and collapsed rooftops ahead.

“How much longer will that take?”

“Three times as long. Maybe more. And we’ll have to move slow. Quiet. No running. No sudden footsteps. Always carry Isabelle.”
