I thought my cat was opening my door at night, but it was something else.

I have three cats, Beans (the oldest), Echo (the youngest female), and Alpha who isn’t important in this. 

My cat Echo has recently had babies and they are almost two months old now. Her kittens are like little demons, they shit and piss on everything, so we had to put them in a smaller space right in front of my bedroom.

My other cat Beans only likes me out of all my family. She spends most of her time in my room with me. Ever since we moved the babies I have been waking up to Echo and her babies in my room. I had thought that Echo found out how to open my door but she can’t even reach my door handle since she is a runt, so my suspicions went to Beans who can open my door but Beans doesn’t like the babies. She just hisses at them and runs away. I got extremely frustrated with waking up to a bunch of cats in my room at 9-10am. So I decided to place an order for a security camera to put outside of my room.

The camera finally came so I decided to put it up outside of my door.

The first night I didn’t wake up to any cats in my room. Maybe it was Beans since I took her out of my room.

The second night I found something absolutely terrifying. There was a black figure standing outside of my door. Wtf. It stood there for 3 minutes completely still, then it opened my door and went inside. Holy shit what the hell just came into my room? 

I went online to purchase another camera to put inside my room to see whatever it was doing inside my room.

The other camera came and I set it up almost immediately. Time to see what it’s going to do tonight.

I check the cameras and see that the black figure was standing there again. But this time it was staring right into the camera. Oh. My. God. It had big white eyes staring into my soul. It stood like that for 7 minutes this time then entered my room. I switch over to the camera inside my room. The figure walked over to my bed and stood there leaning over to staring at me. It stood like that for 10 minutes just staring. Then it walked over to my closet and went inside. What the hell do I do? It’s just sitting there in my closet.

I walk over to my closet and take a peak in it. I see the black figure sitting there with its back turned towards me. It looks like it’s crying. All of a sudden it slowly turns it’s head to look directly at me. It gives me a bone chilling smile, it has so many sharp teeth in rows like a shark. It opens its mouth and let’s out an ear piercing high pitched scream. I quickly cover my ears and run out of my room.

Whatever that thing is I think it’s trying to kill me. I’m home alone today and I keep seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye. I’m locked inside the bathroom and I can hear knocking and that thing trying to open the door. I don’t think I can finish this in time. I just hope that someone will come help me. Oh no it’s unlocked the door.
