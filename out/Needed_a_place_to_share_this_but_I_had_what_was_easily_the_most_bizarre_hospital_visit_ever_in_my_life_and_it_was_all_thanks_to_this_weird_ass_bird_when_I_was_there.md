Hello everyone. Before I begin, I do want to put everyone at ease that I am doing just fine! I did have a bit of a scare recently thanks to a pretty nasty slip on some ice a week ago, but while I was admitted in the ER, I experienced something strange and I just want to tell someone because no one else really believes me about it.

Let's start from the beginning. It's been pretty rough out here on the east coast. Lots of surprise snow falls and freezing rain. If you live out here you know exactly what I mean. It's been rough. Anyways, I been letting it slack in terms of keeping up my driveway. Normally,  I snow blow, shovel, the whole shebang, right when it first snow falls because it's a pretty big driveway. I didn't keep up on it, and about two weeks ago? Well, I slipped.

Hit my head hard, really hard. It was the sort of fall where everything feels slow, and when you try to move your limbs, everything feels like you are in slow motion, or under water, and  you feel as if you are floating in the air indefinitely. Long story short for those who know, it was a concussion. Pretty gnarly one. When I was finally able to regain my composure and was able to get back to my feet, I just walked back inside and told my wife. She recommended I call the ambulance, get looked at.

Some nice folks did come look at me, and they recommend that I go with them. I said no, can't remember why. But I decided to just stay at home and my wife was at the ready in case I dozed off to wake me up.

So anyways, it's all a bit foggy as I recall this, nearly three weeks ago, but I ended up waking up in the passenger seat of our car, my wife roughly shaking me, saying I need to stay awake and we are going to the ER cause she is getting concerned. after arriving there, I was seen surprisingly fast. Had a room before I even realized it.

This is where things get a bit weird. Bear with me, it's been about a month ago at this point.

Yesterday, as of a month ago, I was visited by this strange bird. I struggle to even call it a bird. It looked like a bird, acted like a bird, but it didn't sound like a bird. Right outside my window, it would sing it's song, but it's song wasn't anything like I heard before. It was sort of pretty, but it would penetrate through, and it only ever happened when I would close my eyes. If I did try to get some rest, the song echoed at it's loudest, and bounced around my head.

If I tried to persist with my rest, I would feel nauseous. If I remained stubborn to rest, the nausea would fade away to an ear splitting groan and gasping sigh. I would open my eyes, and time felt stilted. Sort of like when you watch a clock and a minute feels like it's an hour. So needless to say, about two months ago, I just didn't get much sleep. The doctor would come in after a week to check on me. Ask me some questions about coherence. I would bring up the bird, the doctor would comment about how audio hallucinations are quite normal for those who suffer delusions after head trauma, predominantly after a TBI.

I would of course ask him the details of my stay, he said I would be there for another week at least, to monitor. I asked how bad the concussion was, I couldn't hear him over the song. I asked him if he heard it, and he told me that I was going to be admitted for another hour more for every time I brought up the bird.

I would of course point to it, and he would acknowledge that it was in fact there, but that was impolite to talk over him when he was analyzing. It was all so weird.

I did of course think I was losing it, that I was stuck in one of those long sleeps and long dreams, but the birds song groaned, and the sighing increasing in pace and duration, and the twittering and cooing of the sounds became a constant fixation for me as my energy began to dwindle.

That was of course yesterday, or a few days ago. I do remember that the doctor would joke and say that they almost lost me. Over a concussion, of all things, which is silly, I have fallen a few times before and functioned just ok. I was more concerned why no one would address my concerns about the bird. Even after I showed them the bird, they would just brush it off as saying that those always come to that tree, but then I asked them if they ever had other patients complain about the noises they would make and they said no.

So after trying to sleep for a few days while I was in the hospital, it eventually was time for me to leave, got a clean bill of health except for the scare, and that they told me to avoid ice for a little while. Kind of mean, slips happen from time to time, but it will be nice to get some sleep for a change. I am totally fine, nothing a little sleep won't solve. I haven't heard anything like that before, that wailing song.

Anyways, that's my story. It's a lot to take in, but after the day I had yesterday, I am hoping I got everything accounted for.
