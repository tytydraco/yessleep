There's two things I can tell. The first is that it's there. The second is that it's doing its best to make sure I don't know that it's there.

It's quiet, is what I mean. So quiet that I keep second-guessing myself in the night. In the day too, even as I'm writing this. But I'm positive something is there. It's small things, just frequent. Consistent. Something scratching against the hardwood floor. The sheets at the far corner, the ones hanging off the edge of my bed, sliding as something goes past them underneath. I leave clothes on my desk chair a lot, I hear those too.

See, it sounds like when I used to have a pet cat, the way something small and nocturnal does moving around your space in the middle of the night. Aware that you're there. But I haven't had a cat in years, and never in this apartment.

I live with a few roommates in this weird kind of place. Not spooky weird, but it's an old house that got converted into apartments by putting walls in weird places, so I have this closet that's underneath the next door apartment's staircase. The ceiling of my closet is diagonal and it stretches really far back once you go inside. We filled it up with boxes and extra things that didn't have a place yet when we moved in and haven't gotten around to unpacking, so it's kind of a maze, right there in my bedroom. 

I'm pretty sure that's where it goes during the day. I haven't checked too deep since I'm honestly worried about finding it.

You're asking why I don't sleep on the couch or move altogether. Last night was the first night I felt sure it was there. Like I said, it's so on the line of being nothing that I kept dismissing it. It's just the house settling. Winter heating causing expansion or something. You know when you throw a sweater on the back of a chair and it takes an hour to fall to the ground and make a noise, even though nothing's touching it? I kept dismissing it as that kind of thing. There's always a plausible explanation. Maybe that's how it gets by.

The suspicion's been growing for a while. Last night made me sure. I've been having more trouble falling asleep. Usually fall asleep to a video playing, white noise or something. Last night, my phone died, my charger was across the room, I didn't feel like getting up since it was 1 am or something. So I just lay there in the dark, eyes closed, trying to make myself fall asleep. I can't get to sleep, but I guess enough time went by that it seemed like I was sleeping.

I start to hear it again. Just barely. You know when you have to focus to hear something, otherwise you'll miss it? Tapping on the floor from my open closet door. Softer padding when it gets to a carpet. It brushed up against the blanket hanging off my bed, I could feel it there.

I heard it breathing and that was it. It's low to the ground, which is why I was thinking of a pet or something earlier. Who knows, maybe it's a rat or rodent or something, that's a plausible explanation. But this sounded like human breathing. Kind of high and wheezing. I could hear that its mouth was open. 

My eyes opened, I couldn't help it. Maybe my body tensed. I heard the breathing stop. Like it could tell. For whatever reason, my instinct was to close my eyes and pretend I was asleep. You know how sometimes you'd be up late as a kid, you'd hear your parents and you'd know to pretend to be asleep a second before they walked in? I felt like that, except cold all over. 

I could hear it walking again, so softly and carefully. I could feel it get closer and closer to my face. I could feel the presence of it even with my eyes closed, the sense that something was there, the body heat of it or something. I knew if I opened my eyes, I'd be face to face with it. Part of me wanted to just so that I could know, but I couldn't do it.

The worst part was that it just stayed there. That close to me. Unmoving, but breathing quietly. It didn't do anything, didn't touch me, didn't go anywhere else, but just stayed there for hours. And I mean hours. I didn't sleep the whole night. At some point, I felt it leave and minutes later, I felt sunlight hitting my closed eyes. It was dawn. 7 in the morning.

That was this morning. It's almost night again. I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't sleep here tonight. But I don't want to leave it alone with the people I live with and I know I'm going to sound crazy if I try to explain what I experienced. But I know what I know. 

I know that it's there.
