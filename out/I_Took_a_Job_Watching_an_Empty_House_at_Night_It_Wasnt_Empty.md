I should have known something was wrong when the job listing only had a phone number. No company name, no details—just “Overnight house-sitting. Pays well. Call if interested.”

I was desperate. Rent was due, my student loan payments were piling up, and my grocery budget had been reduced to instant noodles and gas station sandwiches. So, I called.

A man answered on the first ring. His voice was slow, measured.

“Do you scare easy?”

I let out a nervous laugh, thinking it was a joke. “Uh, no, not really.”

“Good,” he said. “Show up at 10 PM. The address will be texted. No guests. No leaving before sunrise. Payment will be on the counter when you arrive.”

Then he hung up.

No pleasantries. No discussion.

The text arrived seconds later—an address on the outskirts of town. A house I had never seen before, even though I had driven that way plenty of times.

I should have walked away. But a thousand bucks for one night? That was too good to pass up.

10:03 PM – The House on the Hill

The house was massive. Old, but well-maintained, like something out of a Victorian ghost story. It sat alone on a hill, overlooking a stretch of dark, empty woods.

No cars in the driveway. No sign of life inside. Just an old, black iron gate creaking in the wind.

I parked and hesitated before stepping out. The air was thick, humid, but beneath it was something else—a faint, decaying odor, like meat left out too long.

I shook it off and approached the front door. The key was under the mat, just as the text said it would be.

Inside, the house was dimly lit by old-fashioned lanterns, casting long shadows across the furniture. Everything was covered in white sheets. The air was still, stale.

And on the kitchen counter, right where he said it would be, was a stack of crisp hundred-dollar bills.

Beneath it, a single sheet of paper.

Instructions:
	•	Do not open any doors except the one you entered through.
	•	Do not respond to voices.
	•	Do not, under any circumstances, acknowledge the man in the corner.

My stomach twisted.

I scanned the room quickly—nothing seemed out of place. No sign of a “man in the corner.”

This had to be some kind of weird joke. A rich guy with a twisted sense of humor messing with desperate people.

But money was money.

I stuffed the bills into my pocket, grabbed a chair from the dining room, and parked myself in the center of the living room, where I could see everything.

The only thing I had to do was wait until morning.

12:47 AM – The First Voice

The first few hours passed in silence.

I scrolled my phone, checked the time obsessively, and listened to the old house creak with age.

And then—just as I was starting to doze off—I heard it.

A voice.

A woman’s voice, soft and strained, muffled through a door down the hall.

“Hello? Is someone there?”

I sat up straight, my breath catching in my throat.

The instructions burned in my mind. Do not respond to voices.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

“Please… please help me.”

Something slammed against the door.

I nearly fell out of my chair.

The sound echoed through the empty house—loud, desperate. I forced myself to look away, squeezing my hands into fists.

The voice whimpered. “He’s coming. Please, don’t let him in.”

My pulse pounded in my ears.

And then, from somewhere deeper in the house, another voice.

This one wasn’t pleading.

It was low. Hollow.

And it said, “He already has.”

1:00 AM – The Man in the Corner

I shot to my feet.

And that’s when I saw him.

The man in the corner.

He hadn’t been there before.

Tall, thin, his limbs too long, his face obscured by shadow.

He stood perfectly still, just inches from the wall, like a mannequin someone had forgotten to put away.

The air in the room shifted, suddenly colder.

Do not acknowledge the man in the corner.

I clamped my mouth shut. My skin crawled.

The house settled around me, the silence stretching too thin.

Then—slowly—his head turned.

Not all at once, but in clicks. Like something mechanical, something broken.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

“He sees you.”

The voice came from behind the door down the hall.

I wasn’t sure who it was talking to.

The man.

Or me.

2:13 AM – The Door That Shouldn’t Be There

I didn’t move for over an hour.

I forced myself to sit. To stare at my phone. To pretend that if I didn’t acknowledge him, he wasn’t real.

But then, I heard it.

A creaking sound. Wood against wood.

I looked up.

The door I had come through—the only door I was allowed to use—was gone.

Not shut. Not blocked.

Just… gone.

I felt a cold weight in my stomach, like the ground had dropped beneath me.

In its place, an old wooden staircase spiraled down into darkness.

Something was standing at the top of the stairs.

Smiling.

I didn’t see its eyes. But I felt them.

4:00 AM – The False Hope

The whispers stopped.

The man in the corner was still.

The air, once thick with something wrong, felt… empty.

For a moment, I thought—maybe it’s over.

Then my phone vibrated.

A single new message.

“Don’t look.”

Too late.

5:00 AM – The Final Hour

The whispers never stopped.

They called my name.

They called it in my own voice.

They laughed.

And the man in the corner… he was closer now.

Inches from my chair.

I could feel his breath against the back of my neck.

The smell of rotting flowers and something deeper, something wrong.

Then—click-click-click-click-click-click.

His fingers, or something like fingers, tapped against my chair leg.

I stayed perfectly still.

Until the first light of dawn.

And when I looked again—

The house was empty.

The front door was back.

The stack of money was still on the counter.

But I didn’t take it.

I didn’t even stop to close the door behind me.

I never went back. But the house is still there.

Sometimes, at night, I hear whispers outside my window.

They say my name.

They say, He already has.
