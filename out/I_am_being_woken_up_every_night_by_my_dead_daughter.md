I moved into a lonely house by the side of the road with my husband, Mark and my daughter Elisha. Everything was going well and I used to love the view of the road. Something about seeing all the cars go by. Also it is easy to get to places. But everything changed when Elisha was ran over. Obviously like every normal family we mourned her loss. It was a great tragedy. Elisha was the sweetest soul and we missed her so much. 

But one night at 3:33am we heard a knock on our door. No one had ever done this before. We decided to not answer whether it was someone in danger or not because it was terrifying. And then the next night at the exact same time. The knocking came. And at the exact same time for 2 weeks it happened. Someone wasn’t in danger at this point, something weird was going on. 

But one night it didn’t happen at 3:33am, it happened at 3:59am and somehow the time went to 3:60am and 3:61am. The knocking was still going. The minutes went. Not changing to 4am. Me and Mark were completely creeped out by this. I made the brave choice to look out the window. And i couldn’t believe it. From what I saw it was Elisha. But, she died? I told Mark and he didnt believe me and he quietly crept to the window and he gasped, we just stared at eachother awkwardly. Silent. All of a sudden there was a sudden change in pace and strength of the knocking. And for the first time. What we thought was Elisha spoke, she shouted “Let me in please”. 

Absolutely no way we were letting anyone in at a time that doesnt really exist banging on our door. We just sat there and let it happen. Eventually. We moved to a window where the view of the front was better. And after long consideration. It definitely was Elisha, somehow, someway. She was unscathed and looked exactly like how she was before she died. But that was impossible. Completely impossible. She was dead. Mark had had enough and he told me he was going to deal with it. He went outside and through that window I saw Mark and Elisha leave. All of a sudden the natural time resumed. 3:59am went to 4:00 yet Mark didn’t return. And the knocking was gone. 

It is now 7pm and no sign of Mark or “Elisha”. I am scared that something bad has happened to Mark. I really couldn’t bare losing Mark after losing Elisha. I just hope they’re spending some quality time together and its not what i think it is. Because I need Mark. Him and Me going through it together, is what keeps me from losing it. It makes me feel im not alone. I have to go to work tomorrow. 

I hope that tonight Mark will actually be in bed or that when i return from work tomorrow. Mark will be there. No way I am living in this house alone. I no longer enjoy the sight of the road. All this house gives me is misery and terrible memories and whatever has happened these past few nights.
