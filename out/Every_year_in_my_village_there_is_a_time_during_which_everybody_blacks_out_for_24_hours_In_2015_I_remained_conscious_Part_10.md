The time of my return had come. I stepped inside the house, setting my foot into the darkness that befitted the uncertainty I was getting into. The red sky illuminated the whole village and allowed me to partially see in the house despite the darkness. There were massive holes in some of the walls, all the belongings of the family were scattered around the house and there was some blood on some parts of the floor.

"This way kiddo!" I heard suddenly from the living room. "You better hurry up, will be 9 soon. Right?" The intruder added.

I took out my two weapons and with batons in hands, I crept to the living room only to see Carla or should I say Razor seated on a sofa, and waiting for me while playing with a knife. My heart started to race as what I feared seemed set to materialize sooner or later.

"Well Terrence, looks like we back to square one after all." Razor said looking around. "No more fucking running?" He asked, but I remained silent. "No? Well, why would you run kid? Your shit started here, and it will end here too." He added while standing up.

"You don't have to do this, there's no need to— hurt each other." I said, desperately trying to avoid the impending confrontation.

"Oh you right, but that depends on your choice kid. You know what you got to do if you don't wanna get hurt." He said while walking around in the living room. "What you got to do to save Mom and Dad, big sis." He added. "And cute little sis!" He added with a big smile while placing his hands under his chin and looking at me. He then passed in front of a large piece of the big mirror from the bathroom and I caught a glimpse of his real appearance, especially his massive and scarred muscular arms. "I'm also a pacifist you know, I love peace, I really do. But there's only one way to peace and many other ways to pieces. So Terrence, which way it's going to be?" He asked, turning to me as he stopped walking. "Terrence. What the— Is it the only fucking name your parents could come up with? I just couldn't believe it when the master told me." He spoke.

"Somebody told me yours sounds cliché and stupid!" I retorted.

"Wow! What a clap back! The old man also told me that about you." He revealed. "He told me a lot about you and your family you know, all the juicy details. I mean look at you! The Outlander himself! Can't believe you kicked the hybrid's ass, even Nadia's. Not Flavio's though, that one's a speedster, and a big problem. Left him locked up there by the way, never liked him, you should thank me for that." He spoke while I kept on taking furtive looks around, trying to determine the quickest way out of his reach and to my mother's workshop: the only room in the house my sisters and I were forbidden to go to.

"Edlynn told me you a bloody freak. But I just want you to leave my sister's body alone." I spoke.

"Edlynn? Well, did she tell you about this?" He said, before lifting his hands up.

All the objects around him rose from the floor and started floating, rotating in the air and in front of him. I froze, surprised and defeated while he sent a chair in my direction with a simple gesture. I ducked at the last second to avoid the hit and stood back up only to be struck on the back by the chair as Razor pulled it back towards him. I fell on the floor and started crawling towards the workshop.

"Come on Outlander! Show me what you got!" He shouted.

I stood up and ran towards the workshop. Razor followed behind, random objects still rotating in front of him like a hurricane, some of them enlarging the door frames he passed through. I reached the workshop door and tried to gain entrance in vain as it was locked and I turned around to see Razor stop his telekinesis to talk to me for a moment. I seized the opportunity to check the watch and read 8:38 pm.

"Do you even know the purpose of these altars?" He questioned, approaching me with confidence.

"Don't get close Razor!" I warned. "Just get out of my sister!" I growled, raising one of my weapons and ready to strike.

"Oh you know the name? I'm fucking flattered kid. But seriously, what will you do with your two salty sticks? Hum?" He asked, still approaching. Razor stopped right in front of me and looked straight into my eyes as I trembled in nervousness and hesitation. "Will you just kill your sister?" He calmly asked.

"No, I'll just kill you." I growled, panting and trembling, before I lowered my right hand to hit him on the head but stopped a few inches away from my sister's forehead, on the verge of tears again, finding myself in a dilemma that would surely mean the end for me.

"Weak coward." Razor whispered, understanding that between me and my younger sister, I could not prioritize my own survival. He then chuckled and with a little hand gesture sent my two weapons flying before jumping and kicking me in the chest so hard that I passed through the door.

He walked in while I shook my head to chase away the dizziness. I looked up and found myself in a museum of horrors. It was unbelievable that my mother's beautiful paintings, appreciated in the whole village, could be born at such a place. Skulls decorated the walls as well as the altar, with the eeriness of the room amplified by the dim red light from outside coming through its always closed and curtained window, making it seem like blood covered the whole space.

"Look at it Terrence! Look at its splendor!" Razor said. "How do you think things ran so smoothly for all of you all these years? You guys are happy, nobody comes here to steal from you, you all prosper, there's nobody struggling in your community, your lands are fertile like nowhere else on this planet. The altars protect you. The only price you have to pay is a little blood, just like in ancient times, during what you call the blackout. Is it such a paradise you want to destroy? Really kid? Really?"

"Your master trying to wipe out everyone— and everything." I managed to say, while trying to get back up in pain.

"You a fucking idiot for believing some mumbo-jumbo out of that witch mouth. Adelaide was loyal but straight crazy. Even crazier than Nadia. What Redeye is trying to offer us all is a second chance to life, and maybe a third one after that. Imagine having the power to live three consecutive lifetimes. Do you understand?" He asked. "Not only for deceased or souls like us, but only for people like you when your time comes. He's the Shepherd of souls remember! Don't you get it?" He questioned.

"No!" I replied.

Razor sighed in disappointment. On the watch I read 8:45 pm and stood to give the mission my last shots. I did not go through all of that for nothing but could not bring myself to hurt my nine years old sister. I was instead ready to go down by her unconscious hand. Razor stood between me and the altar, smiling at me maliciously.

"The old man was right about you. You could have been great if only you were one of us." He spoke. "Let's play a little game like Nadia would, before we end this, you know." He suggested. "Let's see if you can get to the altar before it's too late." He spoke before sitting on the floor in front of me.

What kind of sick things did he have in mind? I wondered. The moment I stepped forward, something from outside the room flew through the entrance and crashed in front of me. That was the sick game Razor had in mind. I looked around to consider any option but could only see skulls. 8:50 pm, I did not know what to do while Razor kept smiling at me. 8:55 pm, I tried stepping forward again and he moved a table from the workshop and placed it before me. 8:57 pm, I started losing my breath at the realization that I was about to fail. Distress, sadness, anger, anxiety and fear culminated inside me until I stopped caring and dashed towards the altar. Razor sent several objects in my direction, including the table. Not knowing what else to do, I just placed my hands forward with the strong will of just shield myself and maybe just push them back. At that instant, the wall behind Razor and the West Altar crumbled and got pushed, along with the objects he sent towards me. He himself was pushed at least one meter away while I stood immobile and confused.

"Blood— blood resonance." Razor quietly said, while I recognized my sister's fearful facial expression.

I ran towards the altar and jumped over Razor who curled up in defense. I landed in front of the objective and looked at the time, right when the minute hand hit the number 12, then I touched the evil object to destroy it. While looking at the light, I could hear Razor prepare something behind me but for some reason, I focused on the altar until it was completely destroyed.

"Shit got real huh? Let's see what you got Outlander!" I heard behind me.

Numerous objects were already in front of him when I turned around, and with one swift hand movement, he attacked. I once again put my hands forward but that time I could only slow down the projectiles.

"That was just blood resonance kid. You may be the Outlander, but you not a soul like us. You still no match for me." He spoke.

Among the projectiles, Razor's sharp knife slowly made its way towards my left hand, progressing until the blade tore a little hole in my palm. At the sight of blood, he pulled back his knife, caught it with one hand, and let all the other objects fall on the floor.

"Redeye was right, there's life in blood." Razor said just like Nadia earlier, contemplating the blood on the knife tip. When he noticed me looking at him, he smiled before he raised his hand towards the window, making it shatter in pieces. With one jump from where he stood, he escaped through the opening.

In an attempt to catch up with him, I ran towards the window but stopped in my track when I realized what awaited for me outside. All the souls had gathered all around the house, armed with various weapons, from pistols to axes.

"I'm done playing with him guys. Party's over. End him." Razor said, before escaping with the bloody knife.

One of the souls who held a flame torch dropped it in front of him and a trail of fire was born, making its way towards the house. In a few seconds, I heard and saw flames rise all around the residence. I tried to control objects again, even the flames just in case, but I soon realized that I had lost any kind of telekinesis that I had briefly acquired earlier. Between the raging fire making its way inside, and the souls waiting for me outside, it seemed to me that there was no escaping a painful death that time. However, an unexpected help arrived, in a form neither the souls outside nor myself could imagine.
