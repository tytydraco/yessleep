Smelling the barbecue reminded me of the desert. Suddenly all those months at Western State meant nothing. I fell over, convulsing and crawling under the wooden picnic table, my voice raised in panic as I scrambled. I realized I'd done this and crawled back out, avoiding looking at everyone.

I walked back to the ride, but without keys. I just sat on the parking curb and waited to be rescued. My sister took her time, but only because she stopped to say whatever to everyone. Then we went home.

I could recall all of it. The nightmare, the diabolical ravings of Professor Frenzy, some kind of captain cannibal. Nobody believes me, I am just some fringe heretic of the world of amateur geologists and too good-looking in a straightjacket for the UFO people.

Being a summer student, in the afterglow of graduation, made me feel like I was Indiana Jones as the girl. Cool stuff, but not popular. That's me, with eyeglasses so thick that Anthony Hopkins could pluck them off my face and start a campfire by popping out a lens and using it as a magnifying glass. Then he'd have me with Favah beans. I'd have laughed at that at one time, but now it makes me unable to eat.

Having written a thesis on the formation of clastic pipes, how they billow out through the cracks in the earth during earthquakes and other similar formations, the invitation was extended to me. Clastic pipes are made from sediments and are squeezed through the cracks of harder stone around them, even if that stone happens to be shale, which erodes much more rapidly than sandstone. They look bloomed out at the top, and the shale could erode away and so could the blossom. Then mud could pour around this wall-like formation and harden, which was the theory as to how our walls formed. Purely geologic.

Doctor Amantis was there explaining how the cracks had formed to look like bricks, an expert on such a process. None of us entertained the notion that these were manmade. The wall of petrified concrete 'bricks' was nearly thirteen million years old. If it was made by anything, it wasn't human. And we were confident we had explained how it could have formed naturally, although I had some questions still.

One of those questions was how the mud had become elevated and flowed over the sandstone wall in a geological event that had left the fragile exposed wall undamaged. Where there was no hardened petrified mud, the wall was eroded from the hundreds of thousands of years since it became exposed from the adjacent hillside, where further formations supported our estimate of the age and process of the rock wall formation. Everything looked good, except that one little detail.

It occurred to me that if this rare composite of sandstone were a deliberately mixed concrete, that long ago it could have stood freely, and even formed the base of a much larger structure. This was problematic, because it was supported by the fact that the cracks, when we mapped them out, were a little too long and straight and began to look more and more like an urban sprawl than the kind of jagged geysers most clastic pipes emerge as. I pointed this out to Doctor Amantis, who justified it by saying we were looking at a unique scale. Eventually, the emergence of the pattern formed by the clastic pipes would appear more familiar, and more natural. I just wasn't seeing it yet.

Walking along the wall I noticed soot markings, the occasional tallied chisel marks and even a few arch ways. All of it was circumstantial, as these formations had stood exposed throughout all of human history. I stopped when I found a piece of petrified charcoal embedded between two bricks where the hill had eroded from the base. When I pried it out the rock split, revealing a long porcelain fang. I held it to the sunlight, noting its warmth and translucence.

Sarah and Rachel took the tooth from me and began dating it. I've never dated a tooth, but I went out with a dentist once, she looked like Doctor Garcia from the *Crest*Â commercial and actually showed up in her dental hygienist's uniform. This tooth though, we quickly determined was artificial and came from no animal. Its preservation was due partially to its glass-like composition, although it proved to be as hard as any ballistic laminate material, scratching copper with ease.

"This appears to be a prosthetic tooth, and it appears to be the age of the stone it was encased in, some thirteen to thirteen and a quarter million years ago. Give or take a hundred thousand years, our method in the field is less precise." Sarah said. I pointed out the method was the same, only our confidence was different. How could we believe our results?

After we had spent days testing the tooth Doctor Amantis and Professor Frenzy found us, and they were very excited about what they had discovered. Apparently, they had excavated the foundation of one of the corners of our wall and had found proof it was all an archaeological discovery.

"We came here as geologists." Doctor Amantis kept saying weirdly.

"Aren't you fascinated, Ruth?" Professor Frenzy asked me.

They opened champagne and someone found everyone's phones and put them in a locked glove compartment. We were under radio silence until help could arrive. Some kind of joke, I guessed. Nobody had service out there anyway, at Rend Vista.

I like to think about Marius Ranch, as where I returned to the real world. I suppose it was actually just a state of mind. Nothing was real, out there in the desert. Without reality, things become a nightmare in broad daylight. Ever see a nightmare walking around under bright sunlight? You'll never feel safe again.

I took a walk, tired of Doctor Amantis continuing to point out we were all geologists. I was tired of watching Sarah and Rachel making up for spending college nights doing homework instead of partying. Champagne gives me a headache.

Something was already wrong with Professor Frenzy. His smile was wrong, his eyes were wrong. The way he folded his hands and watched everyone was wrong. Something was wrong, I just didn't know how to make it clear in my own mind, let alone say or do anything about his wrongness.

I remember the first real feelings of fear creeping up along my back, like a slug of cold sweat. Staring at Professor Frenzy in the moonlight of the desert as he jerkily danced and cackled. He was holding a bottle, so I assumed he was drunk. Then he threw the bottle against the stone wall violently and suddenly his head swiveled and his moonlit eyes shone on me with predatory intensity. I instinctively took a step back.

I don't recall the exchange. I must have said something like "Are you alright?" and then he started making noises. I got very frightened very fast by the growling and grunting he was doing, and his attempt to speak in raspberry syllables was like a demonic Daffy Duck impression. I think I was laughing for a moment, the high from the champagne making me slightly unsure if I was scared or not for about one instant. Then the terror set in and I had turned and started to run away.

When I realized he was pursuing me, I screamed. My voice was cut short as I was close-lined in the throat by Doctor Amantis. I flipped with my feet still pumping air and my head going towards the packed sand. The impact knocked the sense out of me for long enough that I missed what happened next.

I sat up to an uncomfortable silence. Somehow, I had dreamed of horror and screaming and the sounds of things ripping and splashing and gurgling. The after-silence in the camp had somehow brought me awake. My head was throbbing and I wanted to go find something to ease my migraine. I felt dizzy, and realized I was probably concussed.

Hours must have gone by before my shocked body had reduced the acetylcholine levels to a steady and conscious pulse. I was blinking a lot and trembling, but I seemed to be intact. I slowly got to my feet, shaking and worried that Professor Frenzy had gone berserk and killed everyone for no apparent reason. I began shuffling slowly through the camp, leaving a trail like I was on skis when I went with my parents that one year.

I looked at my ski marks in the sand and heard a howl. It came to me like a wind that was actually a bucket of icy cold water on a hot day poured over me without warning. I was certainly reacting exactly the same way, my body posed like a Venus pudica and breathing like I was about to give birth. The howl was a man's howl, a man who had become like an animal, and the note wasn't mournful or resonant like the noble wolf or the wise coyote, but rather depraved and homicidal, like the maniac madman.

When I was in the hospital, there was a boy who would howl all the time. It did not remind me of Professor Frenzy, but the doctors thought it did. It didn't remind me and I didn't mind him howling, it didn't bother me. I can see how someone would worry that a different crazy person howling would trigger those awful memories, but it is scent that floods my thoughts with flashbacks, not sound.

Doctor Amantis had tried to catch me, seeing me running in a panic. Professor Frenzy must have gotten to Doctor Amantis and made a tackle. Strangulation was next. I don't know how I know, I was in and out, my eyes fluttering open, things barely registering. I just have this one thought of Professor Frenzy atop Doctor Amantis and throttling them.

Sarah and Rachel must have reacted, but drunk and having no idea of the severity of Professor Frenzy until he'd stabbed Rachel between her neck and shoulder using a broken protractor. Rachel hurried off somewhere, holding her neck at intervals and letting it spray out with the kind of consistency of the mist they use on the fresh vegetables at your favorite grocery store whenever she let go of the hole. She collapsed not far from where Sarah was being mauled by Professor Frenzy.

Was I lying on the ground unconscious or was I witnessing these atrocities? This is how I am unsure of my memories. I know I saw those things, but I don't know when I saw them. Maybe I got knocked out more than once. It would explain the gash on my forehead, if I was struck upon the head later and fell down. I'm doing my best to find what I lost out there.

Somewhere in my memories I know I heard Professor Frenzy speak. What he said made perfect sense. It was so profound and so well articulated that I knew it was the ultimate truth. I was happy to hear it, and I was sure that all that he did was necessary and right. It was a weird feeling, and I cannot recall a single word he said or what it might have contained, just how I felt about it. If I could go back to that moment and hear what he said, I know I could forget this whole thing and heal and have a life ahead of me.

I had looked up from where I was kneeling in prayer, and seen something rising from within the red glow, the tumbling cloud of white dust, the black sky of the starless night, just before dawn. As Professor Frenzy prayed to the rising god, I saw its limbs, its eyes, its teeth, its gemstones and paint upon its gnarled and twisted thorny muscles. I was in awe of the living nightmare, and as the sun bathed it in the light of our world it was born again, anew. We had done a great thing to call it forth from slumber, or so it said, somehow. I cannot describe the words it spoke into our minds, like an echo of an emotion, a law of nature written in our blood.

Plenty of blood was on the sand.

Professor Frenzy had hanged Sarah and let her drip over the god's bed. Rachel had lost her head, making me laugh and sing, some part of my mind shattering outward, unable to withstand the pressure of so much hideous carnage all around me. Doctor Amantis had run through the camp on fire, setting everything ablaze. The black-brown smoke and ash washed over me, calming me like a beehive. My mind stopped swarming all around me and focused on survival.

I'd laughed and sang and welcomed Professor Frenzy's nightmare into the morning of reality. I had no choice, I am not strong enough to resist the will of such creatures. When they accepted me as part of their choir, I was not in any danger. My temporary insanity had saved me.

During the nightmare feast, while the chewing and devouring was going on, I stood and began my journey out into the desert on foot. The god and its apostle were eating the dead, and if I was offered a morsel I'd have eaten as well. Perhaps I did, and my body remembers something that my mind refuses to acknowledge.

Charred and disturbed, I took our god's image with me across the desert, swearing to remember my way home. I was not meaning my childhood home. I felt the ruined temple of the old god was my home, until I reached Marius Ranch.

The dog was barking and frothing, and the man was nervous and alarmed. My appearance, my smell, the look on my face - these things had warned everyone that I wore signs of terrible horror. Where is Professor Frenzy?

Whatever the sheriff decided to do with me, I ended up in a hospital back home. Whatever I said to them changed nothing. Everyone was dead, cooked and eaten by some kind of ancient desert thing that had made a puppet out of Professor Frenzy. That's probably what I told them - and I'm sure the information was about as useful to them as it would be to anyone who didn't believe what I was saying to be entirely accurate.

How can I be sure of anything, when this is all I am left with?

I tried to get away, but I was so afraid I had no idea how to escape. I went through the camp, and I am unsure of the sequence of my memories, but I have specific memories I cannot forget. In my mind, I've learned to revisit that night and continue to search for the way out. I will find it someday. If I do not, and these events become the history I was part of, then history shall repeat itself, and in this way, another might follow my tracks in the sand and leave the same desert behind.
