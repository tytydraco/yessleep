There's something to be said working in a place that by all accounts really shouldn't exist. The feeling of complete isolation. There are guests that come through, not a single one seems to be from my town. The traffic that comes through feels really absurd for the simple fact that we are so far removed from any real civilization.

It feels like I've parted with reality, this hotel sitting just outside what SHOULD BE, into a very fucked up "what is".

Those are my thoughts as I sit behind this desk, an alarming number of energy drinks coursing through my system and half of a finance report spreadsheet filled out. I mentioned before that I haven't seen Isaac since my orientation, and that's not a total lie. He still communicates to me through sticky notes that seem to appear out of nowhere and emails that for some reason don't have a sender's address attached to them. They're mostly shitty 2010's-era LOLCATS memes, "Hang in There" with that cat hanging off a branch, "Keep Calm and Carry On" with a crown and a red background, things like that. It's bizarre to say the least.

There were a couple of guidelines I was given during my orientation, and it was the first time I'd seen Isaac stop smiling. Those guidelines are as follows, in his own words:

* The doors to the hotel MUST be locked by 11PM
* You NEED to remain fully in uniform, do not even adjust your tie.
* Your security personnel will come through every two hours. Do not distract them, do not hold them up from doing their rounds.
* You cannot leave the premises until 7 AM. You may step directly out front to smoke a cigarette, but that is absolutely it.
* If you encounter a problem you cannot solve: Your computer stops working, the doors get stuck open on their own, the temperature drops rapidly for no evident reason? Call the number taped to the back of the desk phone.

These seemed simple enough. if not a little bit strange. That last one stood out to me...

"Who's number was this?" I asked, furrowing my brow just a bit, seeing as it was only 5-digits.

"Last rule, DO NOT QUESTION THESE RULES. They're here for a very good reason. Are we clear"

Crystal.

"Am I the only member of staff here? Like for front desk, I haven't seen anybody aside from you."

It was a fair question, I thought. Isaac, however, didn't take too kindly to it.

"That doesn't fucking matter, what matters is that you do YOUR job. This hotel is now your baby, you must take EXTREMELY good care of her"

Isaac's uncharacteristic aggression really threw me off, especially taking into account his excessively cheery demeanor when I first met the man.

That was the extent of my orientation. I was shown how to use the property management system, given a tour of the premises, and then Isaac left. I haven't physically seen him since. I just made myself at home to my new job for the foreseeable future. The work is monotonous, and so far, I had yet to violate any of the rules laid out by Isaac.

Until tonight that is... I'm currently writing following the aftermath of what I thought was a small fuck-up, but boy oh boy, when that phone rang...

Security had come through. An incredibly large man, easily 6'8", 290lbs and not a single percentage of that weight was fat, I'm almost certain of it. All I said when he came into my lobby... "hey! be safe."

He stopped walking for a moment and just stared at me. Well, I say AT me, but honestly, it felt like it was THROUGH me. Something about the way this man looked at me set off my fight or flight, and I was certain he was going to steal my soul if I maintained eye contact. He kept walking, and I thought that was it, until I heard a crash come from down the hallway, followed by the most HORRIFIC screech. It was as if someone grabbed a squirrel and fed it tail-first into the world's dullest blender. I got up from my desk and rounded the corner to find the hallway coated floor to ceiling in blood. There was nobody there, no corpses, nothing even resembling meat, almost as though someone just took buckets full and splashed them in the hallway. The pristine white of the walls and floor replaced by the sickly sweet smell of lavender mixed with the pennies you'd find in your cars cupholder after a year of constant drinks covering them.

I confess, I threw up, a lot. As soon as I was able to gather myself I sprinted to the desk and called the number on the back of the phone. 1-7-9-4-3.

There was a long pause, and the voice that answered sounded sickly... like a hospice patient. They simply croaked the words "What may I help with?", in a panic, I just screamed "There's so much fucking blood in the hallway! And that noise, oh god that fucking noise--"

"stop talking." the voice croaked. "blood in hallway, noise. you spoke with the security?"

"I said three words!" I exclaimed, in the full throughs of a panic attack unlike any I've ever felt.

"I'll call housekeeping. Was there a body?" they asked, completely unphased.

"NO??? Should there have been a body?!" I yelled in response.

"be thankful there isn't, boy. We really do not wish to have to find ANOTHER employee"

Click. They hung up. I still have zero context as to what the fuck just happened, and before I could even begin to gather my thoughts, the phone rang.

"Are you fucking kidding me? Three months, that's how long it took you to break arguably the EASIEST fucking rule?! You're lucky I don't fire you. So I'll reiterate since apparently you have a hard time remember the simplest of things. DON'T FUCKING TALK TO SECURITY. NOT EVEN A HELLO. You're lucky he left YOU alone."

"why--"

"What did I say about ASKING QUESTIONS?! Are you dense? Did you hit your head at that shit-brick grocery store you fucking worked at before?"

"I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again" I muttered softly, bordering on tears.

"I should think so, if you value both employment and continued breathing", he said coldly, before hanging up.

Tonight was rough, between being berated for speaking to a coworker, seeing more blood in a mere moment than I'd ever seen in my entire life, and the weird, ominous, and passive aggressive threats to my life. But the question still lingered in my head...

What exactly DID happen? I went back over the hallway, preparing myself to witness a scene straight out of an 80's samurai film. When I rounded the corner, however, the blood was completely gone. The walls and floors back to their eerie sterilized white they usually were, except for one thing: a single wet floor sign, bright yellow, like any I'd seen before, except there was a security patch, bloodied, laying directly in front of it.

The time reached 12:00AM. I'd only been here two hours and they were so unbelievably fucked. A different security guard came through. They were built like drywall, maybe 100lbs soaking wet, I wanted to question why they were working security, I wanted to say hey. But I know better now. I said nothing, and let him go on his way.

A guest had come downstairs to ask for a towel, a simple enough task. I couldn't help but notice the large black jacket they were wearing. It was almost a smock on them, with a tear on the front right part of their chest... where a patch should have been.

I didn't deign to question it. I just grabbed her the towel that she requested and she went on her way.

I'm tired... unusually so. I have an almost lethal level of caffeine in my system and yet I feel I'm on the verge of passing out. I slam the rest of my energy drink and get back to typing.

I'm ready to go home... for now, I'll leave off here. I have so much more to do, and so much more to say.

My name is JC, and our story is not over yet.
