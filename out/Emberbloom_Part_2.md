Waking up on Day 2 of Emberbloom was like surfacing into a weird, sun-drenched dream. Chloe was already up, sitting cross-legged outside her tent, facing the rising sun. She wasn't just serene anymore; she had this… luminous quality, like she'd been plugged into some invisible cosmic charger. She was humming that damn tune again, the one that seemed to echo the festival's underlying thrum.



"Morning, sunshine," I grunted, my mouth tasting like the bottom of a birdcage. "Sleep well?"



Chloe turned, and her smile was wide, beatific, and just a fraction too intense. "Oh, Liam, I didn't sleep. I meditated on the Elder's words. Anya said that sleep is just a shadow, but the true light is found in continuous awareness of the Bloom."



"Hmm, yes," with a slight sardonic tone. "Well, this shadow needs coffee. And maybe a new brain."



Eddy emerged from his tent looking like he'd been run over by a herd of particularly grumpy deer. "Dude," he groaned, clutching his head. "My hoodie. My favorite one? Gone. Definitely those Jackal scumbags." 



He then recounted a messed-up dream where he was standing outside our tents watching the giant effigy burn, silhouetting a dark figure, just standing there, staring back with ‘eyes like lit coals'. "Freaky stuff, man. Must've been that dodgy falafel I ate last night."



"Or maybe it's the '*continuous awareness of the Bloom*' getting to you," Maya quipped, already packing her camera bag. She shot me a look that said, Chloe's getting weirder. I nodded subtly.



Chloe, of course, was already rallying us for the "intimate acoustic sunrise meditation" with Aetheric Echoes. "You guys have to come," she pleaded, her eyes shining. "Silas's music isn't just… music. It's a key. They say their songs can unlock parts of your soul you didn't even know were there! Silas believes we're all trapped in these tiny, societal cages, and their music helps us see the bars so we can finally break free and connect, really connect, to the earth and each other."



"Sounds… intense," I said. "You think they'll play any covers?"



Chloe just gave me a pitying look.



The glade was already packed with devotees, many wearing those spiral amulets and that same look of rapt attention I was starting to recognize. Silas, in flowing white, was captivating, no doubt about it. Their voice was hypnotic, and the lyrics, when you actually listened, were all about shedding ego, embracing the void, and becoming one with some all-encompassing natural force. It was heady stuff, especially on an empty stomach. 



During one song, Silas's gaze found Chloe in the crowd and just… stayed there. It wasn't a performer-to-fan glance; it was deeper, more focused, like a collector admiring a prized specimen. Chloe positively glowed, her eyes fixated on Silas, her lips slightly parted. I saw the spiral tattoo on Silas's wrist again, glinting in the dappled sunlight. It felt less like branding now and more like a mark of ownership.



One of the saffron-dress girls from the Welcoming committee drifted by, offering small cups of herbal tea. She paused by Chloe, her hand lingering on Chloe's shoulder for just a second too long. "Your aura is so vibrant today, sister," she murmured, her eyes doing a slow scan of Chloe from head to toe. It wasn't overtly sexual, not really, but there was an intensity to it, a kind of… appraisal, that made my skin crawl. Chloe, naturally, beamed. The girl then turned to Maya. "And you, sister, your focus is so strong. The Bloom calls to those with clear vision." She reached out as if to touch Maya's arm.



Maya, bless her, didn't even blink. "My vision's telling me I need more red bull and less unsolicited aura commentary," she said, her voice pleasant but firm. 



The girl's smile didn't falter, but her eyes hardened for a split second before she drifted away.



"Man, I wish someone would creep on *my* aura like that," Eddy whispered to me later, completely missing the undercurrent. "Maybe I'd get some free tea. Or, you know, a cute cult girl's number."



"Eddy, I don't think they're after phone numbers," I said, but he was already distracted by a passing food vendor.



Walking back through the festival grounds, I found myself staring at the Ember Heart effigy again. It dominated the skyline, a stark silhouette against the bright morning sky. From a distance, you could kind of make out a bird-like shape, a phoenix maybe.



But the closer I got, the more unsettling it became. It wasn't just a random collection of branches and driftwood. The pieces were woven and lashed together in a way that felt… deliberate. Anatomical. I could see shapes that looked disturbingly like long, contorted limbs, tangled and wrapped around each other the way fibers of muscle look. Some of the larger burls of wood resembled … faces? Their wooden 'mouths' open to the sky. It was probably just a trick of the light, my brain looking for patterns - we like to see faces in everything, so I get it. But I couldn't shake the image of a great, writhing mass of humanity, petrified in wood, forever reaching for something just out of their grasp.



That unsettling image was still in my head when we got back to the tents and found our main water carrier slashed open, the Jackal wolf-head glyph chalked big and ugly on our tent. "Okay, now I'm officially pissed," Maya declared, scooping up an empty water bottle like a hawk snatching a fish. "My expensive trail mix yesterday, now our water? This is targeted harassment!"



Eddy piped up, "I saw some of them hanging around the communal water tap … thing … place."



Maya paused for a moment, looking down at her bottle, "Sure would be a shame if something were to happen to one of them while I was filling this up!" She narrowed her eyes scanning the grounds, "It's so slippery out there in the mud."



"Let's go take a little look-see," Eddy gleefully volunteered with a slight look of mischief.



Me, being the diplomat, "Guys guys, it's only our second day, I don't think we need to start a civil war," but also not wanting to be a stick-in-the-mud, "however, if something does by chance happen, holler for me - you know I gotchu."



That afternoon, the amulet-wearers were out in force, practically singing hymns about the "Unity Feast." Free food, a "traditional Emberbloom recipe to connect us all to the loving heart of the festival."



"Free stew?" Eddy's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. "Liam, my man, we are so there."



I had a bad feeling, but trying to stop Eddy when free food was involved was like trying to stop a tidal wave with a teaspoon.



While Eddy was off at the feast, I'd had enough. I managed to corner one of the older amulet-wearers, feigning a simple-minded interest in cool festival art, I went into "aw-shucks" mode and asked about the spiral symbol again. 



"Hey, that spiral thing is awesome," I said, pointing to her necklace. "What's it mean?" 



"It is the sacred mark of the first bloom, child," she said, her voice raspy, her eyes scanning me but also looking through me. "It shows the path inward, to the heart of all things, and outward, to the great embrace."



This time, her description triggered a sleepy moment from a World Cultures elective I'd almost dropped from boredom. The "first bloom," the "great embrace"… those phrases were uncomfortably close to terminology used by a nature-worshipping cult in the 1800s rumored to practice some pretty gnarly forms of sacrifice to ensure "renewal of the land." My stomach did a slow, cold flip.



Maya, meanwhile, had been meticulously going through her photos from the Aetheric Echoes set. "Liam, come here," she hissed. "Look at their faces," she whispered. "The ones closest to the stage, especially Chloe… their pupils are hugely dilated, even in the bright morning light." She zoomed in on a few other faces. She was right. They looked… consumed.



Later that evening, after the effects of whatever was in that "Unity Feast" stew had settled in, Eddy wasn't doing so well. He became lethargic and strangely suggestible. He wandered off again while Maya and I were debating the merits of packing up and bailing.



We found him near one of those bizarre wicker sculptures on the festival's edge. He was dazed, blinking slowly, his eyes unfocused. And on his forearm was a fresh mark. It was about the size of a quarter, perfectly shaped like a single, dark red flower petal. The skin around it was raised, unnaturally smooth, and an angry, inflamed red.



"Whoa, what the hell is that?" Maya breathed, leaning in.



Eddy touched it gingerly, a flicker of confusion in his eyes. "Oh. Silas… Silas found me. I was just… walking. Feeling a bit floaty. Silas said I looked like I needed… grounding." He smiled then, a faint, dopey grin that didn't reach his eyes. "They said it was a gift. A mark of connection. Said I was… receptive to the Emberbloom's energy."



Chloe, who'd drifted over, clasped her hands together. "Oh, Eddy, that's wonderful! Silas has recognized your potential! You're opening up to the true spirit!"



I just stared at the mark. It looked less like a gift and more like a brand. 



That night, Eddy was a mess – he was restless and feverish, constantly scratching at the petal-shaped burn. He complained that it itched like fire, a weird, painful throbbing deep under his skin, like something was trying to push its way out. He kept twitching in his sleep, mumbling about "roots" and "cultivation."



The next morning, before the sun even thought about gracing Emberbloom with its presence, Eddy was gone from his sleeping bag.



"Where the hell is Eddy?" I growled, already on my feet.



Chloe sat up, her expression serene, almost beatific in the pre-dawn gloom. "Silas came for him," she said, her voice soft. "He said Eddy was ready. They've gone to a special pre-dawn tai chi session? … or yoga … or something like that. Silas said Eddy is ready to truly understand the Bloom, to open up and become part of its song."



My heart plummeted. I lunged for Eddy's sleeping bag, fumbling for his phone. It was there. I flicked it on, my fingers clumsy. An email, open, unsent. To his sister.



"Guys, somthing's not rightthey dogs keep whispring bout the great broom. The stew… I think …"



And that's where it stopped.



The stew. The mark. Silas's special attention. Chloe's vacant devotion. The effigy of twisted bodies.



This wasn't just a weird festival anymore. This was a nightmare, and we were hippie-deep in it.
