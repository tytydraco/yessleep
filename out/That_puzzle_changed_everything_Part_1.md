It was one of those days of absolute boredom, when you have nothing to do and end up lying in bed watching a boring series. After hours like this, a strange restlessness came over me. I felt a sudden urge to walk, to leave the house, to breathe. I put on my running clothes, put on my sneakers, filled my bottle and headed towards the park in my city. It was already around 4pm.

On the way, something caught my attention. Near the park there was a little shop that looked straight out of Pinterest: pastel-colored walls, aged wooden door, antique decorations carefully arranged. The sign said Antiquário Flu. I felt an immediate curiosity — almost a calling — and I entered.

Inside, it was even more fascinating. Walls covered in works of art, dark wood furniture, old and worn pieces, jewelry, vintage clothes… It was as if I had stepped into another time. I completely lost track of the time. When I looked on my cell phone, it was already 7pm.

I decided to buy a puzzle that had enchanted me from the moment I saw it: a bucolic landscape, with a country house, animals, flowers… It seemed to convey peace. A thousand pieces. I didn't mind — I was on vacation, and it would keep me busy. At the checkout, a very kind man handed me my change and wished me a good night, but there was something strange about the way he held the box covering the back and gave me a strange smile before handing it to me and wishing me a Good Night. But I didn't think much of it, it must have just been me being neurotic. 

I only noticed the detail when I got home. On the back of the package there were strange symbols, drawings I had never seen before and a phrase written in an unknown language, accompanied by a warning symbol. I thought it was just instructions about keeping away from moisture or small children. I ignored it.

As it was late, I made my dinner, took a shower and sat down on the living room floor to open the box. The pieces were yellowed, almost as if they had been stored for decades in some damp and forgotten place. I placed them all with the drawing facing up and started assembling.

Two hours passed and I had only fitted about ten pieces together. As I tried to find connections, I started to feel a strange pressure on my back. A cold weight, as if someone was resting their hands there. My vision started to darken around the edges, but I thought it was just fatigue. Until… when some pieces started to form a small fragment of the design, something changed.

The atmosphere in my apartment became heavy. The air felt thick, difficult to breathe. An abnormal silence took over the room. I felt a strong dizziness and, before I could react, I was taken by a sudden, almost forced sleep, as if someone had erased my consciousness with the snap of a finger.

I woke up the next day, completely disoriented. My cell phone showed that I had slept 18 hours straight. I didn't know how that was possible. And the puzzle… was still exactly where I had left it. But something about him seemed different.
