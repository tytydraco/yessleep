“Just break it.  I honestly couldn’t blame you.”  The words rang in my ears as if I just told him to kill himself and he actually did it.  Which isn’t a very good analogy, cause that’s pretty much exactly what I did.  I may as well have told the guy to hang himself.  His blood was on my hands all the same.  It was practically like I was tryna advertise the option to him.  “Oh, don’t worry Truman.  Ya see, there’s an easy way out of your problems, and it’s called ‘fucking killing yourself’.”  Even though those weren’t my literally words, I could hardly sleep at night any better.  And without that, I was gonna face a similar fate.  A fate that, by then, I probably deserved.  

That night, I didn’t even bother attempting to sleep.  I didn’t have to sleep that night.  I still had two more nights to go.  Technically, I had until 10:30 AM on Sunday morning.  After, all, 10:30 was when I had woken up that morning.  Which raised an all-new question.  What if it was a school day?  Like, let’s say I sleep in on Saturday and I wake up at like noon?  What happens at noon 3 days later?  Does The Sandman track me down at school and take me out over there?  I guess it isn’t impossible.  After all, saying his name, even at school, still seemed to summon him.

Even though I was making more of a conscious effort to stay up, it almost felt a bit tempting to try drifting off.  Maybe trying to stay awake just made going to sleep all the more easy.  Maybe that was the secret the whole time.  Maybe I was just getting in my own way by trying to sleep.  Maybe what I should’ve been doing all along was trying to stay up as long as possible.  After all, trying to do a thing always makes it seem more difficult to you.  If it wasn’t difficult, then why would you have to try?  That was the reason it had been so hard for me to stay awake during school:  I had been trying to do it.

But the more likely reason was the one that Anastasia gave when I talked to her during class the day before: the phase of the moon determines how hard it is to go to sleep when playing Sleep Points.  Since it was the last day of February, it was gonna be a new month tomorrow.  And the new month aligns with the new moon.  Or at least, it’s supposed to.  The new moon still hadn’t come yet.  It wouldn’t arrive until March 6th.  Which was still almost a week away.  

But, from what Anastasia said, it didn’t seem like it HAD to be the new moon.  As long as we were getting close, I’d still find it easier than normal to get some sleep.  She made it sound like the more moon in the sky there was, the harder it was gonna be to sleep.  So, by that logic, the less moon the sky, the less trouble I would have getting to sleep.  And since, as she had said, the moon was waning, it should be getting easier by the night to go to bed.  So the fact that I was feeling a bit more drowsy than the past three nights, even without the melatonin, made total sense.  I was still obsessing over the guilt of getting Truman involved in Sleep Points, but it didn’t feel like it was keeping me up as much as it used to.  And I couldn’t really come up with any other reason why, other than that I had the slowly waning moon to thank.

Even though it did ultimately feel a bit easier to go to sleep, I just didn’t feel like making the effort.  Those past 3 nights had been torture, and the moon was only gonna keep waning for the next 3 nights.  Maybe I wouldn’t even need any melatonin by the time Saturday night came.  But then I thought about what that meant about my meet-up with Anastasia.

She was obviously gonna wanna meet Saturday night, just like how she had confirmed she wanted to see me on Friday night.  She was so concerned about getting me prepared for Stage Three and for the full moon that she had even suggested I spend an extra hour with her each night on weekends.  Losing an entire night like that could be catastrophic.  I obviously wasn't gonna have time to see her if I needed to spend all of Saturday night trying to get 90 minutes of sleep in a row.

But then I remembered that unlike on Wednesday when I had to go to school, I would have Saturday off.  I’d have the whole day to get the sleep that I needed to stave off The Sandman.  Even if I didn’t get sleep on Friday or Saturday NIGHT, that didn’t stop me from getting sleep on Saturday morning, or afternoon.  I mean sure, my sleep schedule would probably get a bit outta whack, but I WAAAY bigger issues to worry about.

Eventually though, I broke down and tried, if nothing else, having a short nap just to get me ready for the school day, even if it didn’t end up meeting the 90-minute standard.  But it was no use.  I did end up getting about 20 minutes or so of sleep.  Which was a lot better than my first night of Stage Two back on Monday.  But I still wasn’t close to 90.  And I still wasn’t feeling anywhere near as refreshed and ready for my Friday as I was hoping to be.  But luckily it was only Friday.  Soon enough it'd be the weekend, and I wouldn’t have to worry about my insomnia making my days at school utterly miserable.

I won’t go through my day at school since not much interesting happened and I don’t honestly remember very much about it except for when I had left for the bus and was once again confronted with Truman.  Needless to say, I was pretty cautious towards him since, for one, he was gonna die soon, two, it was all because of me, and three, he fucking knew it.  I was pretty damn scared.  I tried not even acknowledging his existence.  But he acknowledged mine.

He didn’t seem too upset with me, though.  Yet.  Much like yesterday, he seemed pretty pleased with me for helping him get rid of The Sandman.  But that wasn’t exactly gonna last.  Ya see, sorta like with how he broke up with Anastasia, Truman had a bit of an impulsive streak.  He would do all sorts of things that felt good in the moment.  Things that maybe even felt good for the next day to two.  But in the long run, and by that, I mean usually within like the first week, he would come to pretty seriously regret what he did.  And breaking the clock would be no different.  Sure, no Sandman was fun for the first night or two.  But a week with no sleep at all really does end up doing something to a person, as Truman and I both would soon find out.

“’Ey Stanley,” he said.

“Uh, yeah.  Hey, Truman.  How have you uh…”, I trailed off.  I didn’t wanna look at him.  He already looked so horribly off the day before.  I couldn’t imagine how hollowed out and soulless he must’ve looked by then.  By he didn’t look much different.  Not that that meant a whole lot.  He still looked just as horrible as before.  But I guess I should’ve been glad that he at least didn’t look too much worse.  Maybe slightly worse, but not by any hugely noticeable degree.  
“How have you been holding up?” I asked.  

“Oh me?”, he asked, as if he was trying to sound surprised by that question.  “Oh, I’m all good man.  Yup.  All good with me,” he said, like totally convincingly.

“Well, are you, uh…” I started again.  “Are you sure about that?  I’m just sayin’ you don’t look too good these days is all,” I said.

“Oh,” he said, sounding almost a bit discouraged.  “I mean, uh, whatever it looks like, I’m still all good though,” he said, sounding like he was trying to convince himself more than even me.   

“Well… if you say so,” I said.  “But look, I mean I DID warn you… “, I said, trying to defend myself.

“Uh yeah.  I know that.  I KNOW you warned me.  Look.  Stanley.  I did what I REALLY wanted to do.  I know what you told me.  But this IS what I wanted.  So don’t even TRY feeling bad for me.  Because I KNOW this was what I should’ve done all along,” he said, getting defense.  It almost sounded like he was getting mad at me for being concerned for him.  So I figured that was probably a good place to leave things off at.

“Okay.  I guess I just wanted to make sure that this really WAS what YOU had wanted,” I said, trying to sound assured by what he had said.  But, of course, this wasn’t gonna last for too much longer.  And I knew damn well it wouldn’t.  I had no idea what I was gonna do about Truman come Monday.  Maybe I could talk to Anastasia about it tonight.

And, speaking of that night, before I knew it it was time for me to head out over to Anastasia’s place once again.  Since I now had to be there at 1:05 instead of 2:05, that meant I had to leave an hour early.  Where I had left at about 12:45 AM the previous week, I was gonna have to leave at 11:45 THIS week.  And I would have to make sure I took dad’s truck.  I did NOT wanna have Anastasia laying into me over not taking my dad’s truck for a SECOND time.

Which reminded me of another thing:  she had told me I was supposed to sneak one of my parents’ two phones in order to make my way to her house this week now that Stage Two had started, and my sense of direction was gonna start taking a hit.  Sure, the moon was waning, so the effect would be less pronounced, but she had still demanded that I do it anyway, and I just didn’t wanna waste any more time having to argue with her over a buncha useless things like that.

When I snuck into their room, my first order of business though, was to make sure that my phone was on the charger as it was supposed to be.  I HAD to keep it charged.  Thankfully, it still was.  I checked for the phone on the other charger.  It was Dad’s.  I carefully crept the phone into my pocket, trying not to make any noise.  And thankfully I didn’t.

Next step was to look for Dad’s keys.  Thankfully THIS time they were on the kitchen table like usual, which meant I didn’t have to worry about THAT scare again.  By 11:55, I was on my way.  A little behind schedule, but she was only 4 miles away.  I could creep along the road at only 4 miles per hour and still make it to her place with time to spare.  

It was already 1:00 by the time I had made it to her house.  Granted, I probably could’ve been a little earlier, but I was so scared of having another run-in with Ezra on my way up that I just couldn’t help but to take things as slow as possible.  I saw the red light glowing again outside of Anastasia’s window.  So, The Sandman came to visit even at 1 AM for her too.  And 2AM.  And probably 3 AM.  Anyway, I waited for all that mess to die down before waiting outside her backdoor.  And then, right on time, at 1:05 she was outside to see me.

“Hello, Mr. Stanley,” she said, looking pretty visibly upset with me, for some reason.  I really couldn’t pick out why.  I mean, I had showed up to her house on time AND I came in my dad’s truck just like she had asked.  I had even remembered to use his phone to navigate my way over to her house.  I had done everything right.  And instead of being please with any of that, she was looking even MORE mad than when I had showed up WITHOUT the truck.  It was honestly more than a little unnerving.  So, like, what did I do?  What was her deal?  Because whatever it was, it must’ve been pretty bad.

Well, as it turned out, what exactly her “deal” was become pretty clear after what she said next: “I suppose it will have come as no surprise whatsoever to you that he has visited me in these past few minutes.  Seeing as how you had peered through my window to watch that very event take place on of your previous visits…” she said, pretty threateningly, I gotta say.

“You should know, Mr. Stanley, that I do not take kindly to such breaches of my privacy.  You should consider yourself fortunate that I know better than to suspect you of any perverse motive for such an inexcusable act, or else you would, at this precise moment, be lying dead where you stand,” in a voice quite a bit more seriously than I had ever heard her use before.  Which was really saying something, because she had said plenty of things pretty seriously to me in the past already, but never quite like this.  Which I guess made sense.  After all, it’s just like I said:  You’re not exactly supposed to watch people while they sleep.  I was afraid she was gonna find out about that.  She always had her ways.

But, in my defense, it’s not as if the POINT of what I did was to watch her sleep.  I wasn’t trying to stalk her or do anything creepy like that.  And I figured there was no point in explaining that.  She already said she knew better than to think I would do something like that.  Otherwise, she would’ve already shot me in the chest with one of her dad’s firearms or something by then.  And that obviously hadn’t happened yet.

“Sit,” she said, once we made it to her room.

“Why did you investigate the light?  Why did you come close?  As frustrated as I am with you for violating my privacy, I also know that you did not do what you did with any intention of deriving sexual pleasure.  Which is, of course, the sole reason you remain conscious and breathing,” she said casually.  “Instead, you wanted to see The Sandman first-hand, did you not?” she asked.  I could see The Sandman’s face through the blanket she was using to hide her clock, just like the week before.

“I suppose you expected me to be hiding The Sandman from you,” she said, as the same thing happened all over again.  “I knew well that you could see him when I referenced him during our previous meetings.  I hide the clock such that I might hide the time from myself.  Did you genuinely believe that I rushed you out of my room before 3 AM to hide the clock from YOU?” she asked.  
I tried to walk things back and explain myself.  “Well, I guess I just thought that-“ I said, before she cut me off.

“But you did.  I know that the same way I know that you peered through my window last weekend and why:  This game tells me things.  And it can tell YOU things as well, if you pay the appropriate price.  The price, of course, being in sleep points.  A price you can only pay once Ezra has led you to The Sandman’s Sanctuary,” she explained.  “I say all of this, because you spoke to me of a dream after 6th period on Thursday.  If you have already followed Ezra to The Sacred Space, then you can already begin to spend sleep points,” she said.

“Right, but I actually woke up before I got to that part in my dream.  My dad woke me up since I was already like 3 hours late for school,” I said.

“I see,” she said.  “And so, when you open up the app, you do not yet see the sleep points store?” she asked.

“Well, honestly, I haven’t checked.  Y’see, I told my dad all about how I had snuck in some time with my phone while I was grounded for what had happened between me and Truman on my first day of Sleep Points.  So now I’m grounded from my phone for another week,” I explained.  I was a bit worried that she’d be upset with me for putting the fate of my phone in the hands of my parents, who would’ve had no idea about anything we were talking about.  But she wasn’t mad about that at all.

“You have done well by confessing to your parents, Morgan,” she said.  “A clean conscience is of utmost importance in achieving the sleep you so greatly require,” she explained.  “Which is why I must ask why you did not previously confess to me that which you had done by watching The Sandman break out from my clock while I slept,” she said.

“Oh… well… I guess I just didn’t…” I tried.  “I guess I just didn’t really know how to uh…” I trailed off yet again.  “How to broach the subject, y’know?” I said.  “I knew what it would look like, and I knew I would have to, y’know, SERIOUSLY explain myself and everything…” I said.

“Then why did you not simply explain yourself?  Why did you not recount to me that which you had done with a full explanation of what the nature of your motives had truly been?” she asked.

“I guess I just didn’t know if you’d believe me,” I said.  “I mean you already talked about how you’d knock my lights out if you thought I had done that for the wrong reasons,” I explained.

“And yet I have not done that.  I know better than to suspect any such thing of you.  I know to trust you.  And it is because you do not yet know to trust me that you have kept secrets from me.  I hope our future interactions will help you to know better.  I do not wish to be forced to find out any more information such as this without you having told me yourself,” she said.  “I have you arrive 5 minutes after the hour specifically because I do NOT want you anywhere near The Sandman when he re-immerges.  That, above all else, is why I am upset with what you have done.  That, and the fact that you did not tell me,” She finished.

“Okay, look, I’m sorry I looked through your window when I know I wasn’t supposed to and how I had put myself in so much danger like that.  But I didn’t want you to worry.  That was another reason I thought it might be a good idea to keep quiet about it,” I explained.

“If you did not wish to worry me, then you should have stayed away,” she said.

“Well, yeah, I know THAT.  But like, after I had already done it, there wasn’t much I could do to help calm your nerves aside from not telling you about it at all,” I said.

“If you had told me, then I would be at ease in the knowledge that I could trust you tell me important information such as that.  If it is true that you had wished to avoid worrying me with what you had done, then I must say, you have done a rather poor job of doing so,” she said.

“But I just don’t get it,” I responded.

“What do you fail to understand, Morgan?” she asked.

“You keep secrets from me all the time.” 

“And when have I ever done that?”

“Well, let’s see: the first time I asked you about how to spend sleep points you wouldn’t tell me.  And when I asked you where you had gotten the special blanket from, you wouldn’t tell me that either,” I said.  “And that’s not even to MENTION all the aspects of later Sleep Points stages that you STILL haven’t told me ANYTHING about,” I fumed.

“While it is true that I have, indeed, withheld that information to you, I did, nonetheless, inform you full well that I would not be expounding further upon any of those aforementioned subject matters.  This means that you never had to find out for yourself that I hadn’t told you something as I, for my part, have had to do on numerous occasions by this point, between finding out you had gotten yourself lost after your first visit to my home, in conjunction with the fact that you had looked through my window as The Sandman escaped my clock,” she said.  

“I believe the context that you had been freely told that I must conscientiously withhold information from you with your best interest in mind makes a great deal of difference.  I believe the rationale behind my actions has been much more well substantiated and vastly less self-serving than your motives have been,” she concluded.

“Well, then why didn’t you tell me about how to spend sleep points?” I asked.  “All that had to happen was for me to have a simple dream.  That isn’t too much to give away, is it?”

“Given that you were already so curious about how to spend them, I had suspected that you would wish to hear further details about the dream, which would necessarily entail information of how awful and unbearable experiencing the dream would ultimately prove to be,” she responded.  “Now be frank with me Morgan, was that particular dream of following Ezra to The Sanctuary not perhaps one of the most dreadful nightmares you have ever experienced?” she asked.

I couldn’t really argue with that.  It really had been a pretty terrible dream, and I probably would’ve been scared half to death to go to sleep again after having heard about it, which certainly wouldn’t’ve done much to motivate me to take the melatonin that she had given me, for example.  If she had told me about what had to happen in order for me to spend sleep points, I probably would’ve gotten myself killed right and then there, on Thursday morning at 6 AM, just by being too afraid to sleep.

But that whole excuse kinda broke down when I realized that I actually STILL didn’t have access to the Sleep Points store.  I still hadn’t made it to The Sanctuary OR The Sacred Space for that matter.  Why had she told me all of this NOW, all while I STILL couldn’t access the store and she KNEW that?  So, I asked her about it.

“If you’re so worried about me, then why bother telling me about how spending sleep points works while I STILL can’t even DO it?” I asked, accusingly.

“Morgan, did Ezra not already tell you in your dream?  I have had the dream myself.  I already knew for a fact that he will have made some snide allusion to The Sacred Space regarding how one is meant to go about spending sleep points.  Given what I already happen to know about the dream from my own personal experience, I could already quite confidently tell that Ezra had already given you the information that I had attempted to conceal from you, and that your knowledge of spending sleep points had already been supplied to you by him, regardless of whatever information on the matter I, myself, happened to relinquish,” she explained.

“Well okay, sure.  But for all either one of us knew, that dream still could’ve been a long time away.  What made you think I was gonna have that dream any time soon?” I asked.

“Because, Morgan, Ezra always comes to you on your first night asleep at the start of Stage Two.  Perhaps he will come back the next time you should achieve a dreamful slumber, or perhaps not.  You cannot expect a great deal of consistency from him beyond that which I have already described.  I was, in fact, quite shocked to hear of the consistency with which Ezra appears to players on their first night asleep during Stage Two.  I would have never predicted such predictability from that fellow,” she mused.  

“Though, of course, that which I have discussed only takes place AFTER one has successfully spent 90 minutes asleep.  That will explain why he hadn’t come to you in a dream while you had slept the previous 2 nights: you hadn’t spent 90 consecutive minutes asleep yet.  Ezra cannot access your dreams until you have slept long enough to have had any dreams in the first place.  For one to dream, it is required for one to achieve REM sleep.  That requires the completion of at least 1 sleep cycle: a process which takes approximately 90 minutes,“ she finished.

“So, once I get to The Sacred Space, does he stop showing up in my dreams, or does he keep doing it just to be a dick?” I asked.

“While I am quite certain that he would continue to do so if he were able, upon entry to The Sandman’s Sanctuary and his Sacred Space, Ezra no longer has the power to do any such thing,” she said.  “The dreadful dream will no longer come to you once you have attained entry to both of the aforementioned destinations,” she said.

“Well, that’s a relief,” I said.  “But honestly, the worst part about it might not’ve even been getting hunted down by The Sandman," remembering how genuinely horrifying the dream had been.  "There was also this red smoke clogging up the sky coming out of my chimney that just gave me this overwhelming dread that I can't even begin to describe to you,” I said.

“Hell’s Mist is perhaps the most dreadful sight of all,” she said darkly.  “And I do not say it lightly,” she continued.  “The ineffable horror it inspires is perhaps that dream’s most loathsome aspect of all,” she finished.

Well, that did not sound good.  With how foreboding her talk of this "Hell's Mist" was, I got the feeling I should maybe ask a bit further.  “So, uhh..." I started, a bit timidly.  "...what did it mean when I saw it on my walk home from your place early Sunday Morning?” I asked, scared out of my mind what the answer to that question was about to be.  And y’know what?  Maybe I still wasn’t frightened ENOUGH.  

Instead of looking like she was about to have a heart attack, a stroke, or some lethal combination of both, she did something even more distressing: she actually broke down and CRIED.  Whatever happened early Sunday Morning before sunrise was obviously so much more gruesomely awful than anything I could have ever POSSIBLY imagined, at first.  My brain went to worst-case scenarios.  And what I landed on ended up being pretty much right.  Wendy Peterson no longer played Sleep Points.
