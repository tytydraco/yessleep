"Hey, you wanna dance, Kat?" I looked in the direction I thought her voice was coming from. Jenna was smiling at me. Crooning to me. God, I'd wanted this chance for fucking *years.*

"Y-Yeah..." I straightened up and then with a little more confidence shouted, "Hell yeah!" I got up and walked over to her, putting on the color-coded headphones. I took her hand and she led me out to the middle of the dance floor. There, I gave a thumbs-up to the designated DJ to crank our music up. We got the blue DJ, the good one, so me, her, and about 3 other people were shaking and rocking out to Combichrist and a few other technometal artists while everyone else were listening to God only knew, or cared, what.

30 seconds. Half a minute. That's how long my little taste of heaven lasted.

About 10 seconds after, I remember hearing a faint screaming noise. Actually, *multiple* screams would be accurate. Still, faint being the key word, which meant I easily swept it off to keep dancing with Jenna. That lasted *almost* another 15 seconds before I noticed that everyone stopped dancing. Everyone was now looking toward the back of the dance room toward the hall. The music was still playing in the headphones, so I took them off to immediately be met with screams and gasps and \*"Oh my God"\*s.

Jenna had taken hers off now at this point and I looked at her. I was about to ask if she knew anything about what the hell was going on, but the bewildered look on her face took care of that for me. She was craning her neck to look out and over the throng of people to see the hallway. I did the same, with no luck from me either. Jenna started moving closer to the crowd. I tried staying behind her, but we were quickly separated only about a quarter of the way through the crowd.

Trying to wade through the crowd was like trying to wade through an audience at a rock concert, maybe even made all the worse here because of the apparent hysteria. "J-Jenna!" I called out, trying desperately to spot her again. I couldn't see her anywhere.

A little way further through the crowd, I heard one of the girls up ahead shriek at the top of their lungs, damn near killing me right then and there of a heart attack. Right then, I was stuck between just freezing up where I was and wanting to push and fight my way further through the crowd. I was terrified of what I'd find ahead, but more so of course about what might've happened to Jenna. With that, I ended up electing the latter -- something *far* easier said than done.

By luck or sheer willpower though, I actually managed to get myself close enough to the front of the crowd to start seeing what was going on. I couldn't see much, with a lot of the taller people there standing right at the front, but I could see that someone was on the ground, twitching and twisting spasmodically. Heart racing, I manage to spot Jenna just to my right and I go to her. "What's going on, who is that?"

Her head snapped suddenly to me, wide and startled, before exchanging glances between me and the person on the ground ahead. "I... I-I don't know..." Our gaze returned to the guy on the floor. I could hear choked sort of gurgling noises, almost like he was trying to talk, but was being choked while doing so. He had one hand clawing at his throat with the other clawing his eyes, so much so I could faintly see streams of blood running down his face.

"Oh my God, I think he's choking!" I cried. No one moved. "Here, move." I violently shoved my way past the two gorillas in front of me to rush to the guy's side. As bad as he was flopping around on the ground, I had a hell of a time trying to lift him up to a sitting position so I could try giving him the Heimlich maneuver. "Sir," I called to him, "Sir, my name's Katherine Danvers, I'm going to give you the Heimlich maneuver, okay, just try to hold still for me."

He continued bucking wildly against me. "Sir, please." I called out again. Nothing. I saw then that his headphones were still on. After a second of readjusting, I managed to pull his headphones off. "Sir, my name is--"

I was cut off when his body abruptly seized, followed by him blasting out the most horrific, most startling, and just the single most *unnatural* scream I'd ever heard in my life and/or ever could hear. I instantly let go of him and he dropped to the ground, stiff as a board. His scream lasted for almost a full 30 seconds, long enough for it to be forever seared into my memory. Even after he'd stopped -- well, at least when I was *pretty sure* it wasn't him -- the scream itself still lingered in the air like a foul smell, passing itself through everyone else gathered around as well. The guy laid now on the ground in front of me, lifeless and frozen in this weird, freakish looking upward thrust with his back bent off the ground, stomach facing the ceiling.

My own body froze as well, stuck with my knees huddled to my chest almost in a fetal position, shaking. For a moment, time seemed really to freeze all throughout the club. Each set of eyes from the crowd was fixed on me, mouths hanging halfway to the floor. Finally, someone managed to break the stupor by pulling out their phone and calling the cops.

Everyone else then started filing out in an unorganized, utterly manic manner. Not me, though. I couldn't even force myself to try and make any part of me move. I couldn't even take my eyes off of the guy's body, either. My eyes were fixed on his, with his staring back at me, blank and soulless.

His scream, despite having died out everywhere else in the club building, continued echoing in my own head. I couldn't place it at that moment, but I knew something about it wasn't natural. Something about it was... I don't know, just *wrong!*

I stayed in entropy like this until I was shaken back to the real world by Jenna shaking my shoulder. "Kat." she called out, rocking me gently. "Kat, you okay, babe?" My head snapped to her, then again one last time to the body, then back to her before absently nodding yes. "Come on, let's get out of here."

She helped me up and the two of us joined the rest outside. Everyone was asking each other frantically what they all thought was going on.  Jenna and I just stood waiting for the authorities to arrive. It was only another minute or so before they did. The crowd was then divided and questioned individually. I refused to leave Jenna's side.

Jenna and I were pulled to the side and asked for our side of the story. I had no idea what the hell any of the other people were saying about me but judging from the rather suspicious looks on their faces, I could tell something was being spun against me. The both of us did our damnedest to emphasize the fact that I was there *only* to help the guy, that he'd been seizing even before I touched him. I could see though that this did about as much to convince them as if I'd just stayed silent. In either case, Jenna and I were still good to go home.

I was about to walk to my car when Jenna stopped me, offering to give me a ride back with her. "There's no way I'm letting you go home by yourself after that." she declared. I'd have protested but I'd known by that point, having already been good friends with her for at least 2 years by that time, that when she put her foot down like she was here, it was wise not to question or refuse unless you were willing to risk your ass being the next place her foot went. That was admittedly one of the reasons I wanted to be more with her. Always the more headstrong of the two of us while I was the more calculated one.

Of course, this also meant that I'd get to bunk overnight at her place -- an even bigger plus, even if neither me nor her were in any mood to fool around. The ride was silent, almost suffocatingly so. I could tell both of us wanted to say something about it, but then, what? What really *could* be said other than that it was the single most horrifying thing either of us had witnessed in our lives.

It wasn't until we got back to her place that either one of us spoke to the other. "Hey, you okay?" she asked me. I looked at her, my face probably shaking and obviously anxious. She started toward me. I held my hands up.

"I-I'll be okay, it's just..." I looked down to the floor then to the TV. My body was sort of on autopilot while my brain ran amuck.

"Just what?" My attention snapped back to her.

"I don't know, just so crazy. I mean, what *was* that?"

"Hell if I'd know, honey." She threw off her jacket before heading to her kitchen. I stood where I was, losing my focus to the TV again. "Hey, You want a cold one?" she asked.

Without taking my eyes away again, I replied, "Yeah, sure." She told me to take a load off on the couch so I trudged over and plopped down in the center cushion. She joined me five seconds later with a six pack of Millers and a bottle of Harwood Canadian, ever since we were a couple of Freshmen girls. It was our favorite little combo for when it was the two of us. "Here, Kitty Kat, this'll take the edge off."

I offered her a weak half-smile before taking and downing a decent swig of the Miller. For about the next minute and a half, the two of us drank in silence until finally, having gotten herself a nice little buzz going, she looked at me and asked, "Hey, you still wanna dance, Kitty Kat?"

I rolled my head to her. By that point, I was well under, though not enough to get blacked out. A grin stretched across my face. "Fffuck yeah!" I slurred excitedly.

"I've had a new CD I've wanted you to check out. You remember that little band we used to listen to, *Seraphim*, right?" I nodded my head. How could I forget, the band her, me, and a couple other friends originally only listened to see if its little supposed "curse" was real. I even noticed she still had a few of their CDs. She pulled out her phone then and held up her music playlist to me.

She pointed to one of the songs at the top of the list and said, "Check it." The song was titled something weird, **"6\_G\_O\_D-6\_C\_R\_I\_E\_S-6"**. Briefly scanning a couple of the other songs below it, I saw that they were all titled like this, all of them looking like a serial code or something. "They're this techno group called '[Ghostwhispers.io](https://Ghostwhisperers.io)'."

"Huh, cool." I continued looking at the track. The album art was a sort of sloppily drawn skeleton wearing headphones. That was it.

"Yeah, you'll *love* it, I promise." She downed another swallow of her drink before going over and connecting her Bluetooth surround sound speakers to her phone. "You ready?" She hit the play button on the song.

I was confused for a second when nothing happened. I looked at Jenna, who held her finger up, winking. Eventually, I began to hear it. It sounded like a low sort of rumbling noise that very, very slowly built in pitch and tempo. Imagine the stomping footsteps of an elephant approaching you, it was a lot like that if the footsteps also got higher on pitch the closer they came.

Several wavelike sounds then came from the speakers that, at first, made me think the opening riff was about to queue, except it wasn't. Instead, two or three more of them passed through the room. Following this was a weird sort of heartbeat sound that, after a few more passing waves, the two sounds synchronized with one another. I looked at Jenna again. She had her eyes closed, bopping her neck back and forth.

I couldn't understand because, not only was there no music (at least, nothing *I'd* have considered music), but her head bops weren't even in rhythm with the actual sounds themselves. The rhythm stayed the same, steadily growing higher and higher in pitch, yet her bopping was much more erratic by comparison. Then, when I'd say the rhythm from the song reached about a mid-range sound, I started to notice something about the wave sounds. Or rather I should say, *sobbing* sounds.

I don't know how best to describe the sound other than what you'd think of if you imagined two or three whales simultaneously crying deep underwater. It was low and incoherent, yet all the same, I could somewhat *feel* this cloud of overwhelming sadness, as well as a sense of ominous dread coming from it. When it started getting louder and louder, so too did the bass blasting from the speakers, causing my entire body to vibrate inside and out.

Jenna still wasn't bothered by this, though. I started to wonder if somehow, we were listening to a different song altogether. Then I heard a noise like an extremely deep voice come from the speaker saying, *"By man's will, the almighty weeps..."* As garbled as it was, that's really only my best guess as to what I heard.

Whatever it was though was immediately followed by this high-pitched squeal, sort of like a guitar trill that almost immediately broke my eardrums, literally to a point where, even to this day, I actually still have a hard time really hearing anything. I looked over to Jenna, who had her face contorted in a silent sort of scream, kinda like when you're listening to a heavy song and you react by screaming like the vocalist is, it was like that only she was perfectly still.

In fact, so was everything else. It took a second, but I actually noticed that the speakers weren't vibrating anymore like they were earlier. As well as this, my own body wasn't vibrating anymore, even though the bass was still blasting from the speakers. I tried to look around the room, but I couldn't move my head, only my eyes and even *that* was more of a struggle than it should've been.

I noticed too that the room was turning greyscale. The LED lights Jenna had around her living room now weren't colored or glowing. Jenna herself even looked like this. The screeching noise by now was a sort of droning ambience in the background. I started hearing more voices coming through the speakers, mixing and distorting as they came closer toward me. I couldn't make out anything they were saying, except for one thing, screamed at me in another language.

**"Deus sumus, et flemus a te. Parasitus es et finiendus es."**

This, too, then dispersed into a multitude of other crying voices. They were all mxied, too. Some were men's voices, some women, some of them were even *children's* voices! They were mixed languages, too, like the one from earlier. All of them were saying different things at the same time, none of which I could understand, but whatever it was, it was done so out of fright.

I would almost be willing to swear this carried on for hours, but as I found out only a second later, only three minutes passed since this all began. Eventually, the music ended and I saw everything normally again. I came to and saw Jenna grinning at me. "So, whatcha think?"

I didn't reply. Her face fell into one of concern. "Kitty Kat? Yoo-Hoo, anyone home?" I didn't answer. The world felt normal again, but I still couldn't make myself move. Not even out of shock or anything either, but like something was actually holding me perfectly still. "Kat!"

She came over and started shaking me. In my mind, I could almost feel my lungs tearing from how much I was screaming out to her, but no sound actually came out. "Kat! Kat, come on, baby. Katherine!"

I heard her voice start to jumble like the ones from the beat earlier. My name started to twist and morph into other words in her distorted voice, words I couldn't understand except for this phrase, **"Hominum flebit..."** repeating over and over. Jenna began slapping me to wake up, but I couldn't even feel it, or anything for that matter. My body was essentially a vegetable, only *really* conscious inside my own head.

I could see and hear, but not move or feel. It wasn't until long afterward that I *knew* that I wasn't dreaming any of this, or dead, when I watched and heard Jenna call 911, who showed up about 15 minutes later and took me to the hospital where I "woke up" so to speak. During all of this, My mind was screaming, along with the other million, hundred million, possibly *billion*, other voices I was hearing screaming those two words to me.

When it all stopped finally at the hospital, I found Jenna asleep in the chair next to my bed. Her hand held mine gently. I moved my hand, my head to look around, and even wiggled my toes. I could move my body again. I was back. Jenna stirred awake soon after.

"Well good morning, Kitty Kat." she said with a groaning, sort of early morning chuckle. I looked at her, my face a mix of confusion and exhaustion. "Oh good, you're actually moving, too."

"J-Jenna..." I said groggy, "What the hell happened, why am I here?"

She scoffed dryly and replied, "I was kind of hoping you'd tell me, sugar." I just kept staring at her. "You don't remember last night?"

I squinted my eyes, rubbing my head, which was pounding like crazy for some reason. "Um... I... I-I don't..."

"How're you doing this morning?" Jenna and I both looked to see the doctor entering the room. I exchanged glances between him and Jenna before answering, still groggy, that I was fine. He had me then sit up and start going through all the regular check-up routines before tapping my knees with a mallet. My reflexes were fine, but when he attempted to check my hearing, something weird happened. Whenever he hit the button to trigger the beep in the headphones I was wearing, I didn't hear the beep, but instead the phrase from before, **"Hominum flebit"**.

I still raised my hand when I heard it for the first few times, but then, after about the 7th or 8th time, I felt my body go stiff again. This time, along with the abandonment of my senses, I could feel something heavy sort of stuff itself inside my head like it was a glass jar. You know how when you eat too much, your body feels like a giant brick of lead has replaced your organs? This was like that, only it was all inside my head, nowhere else, and instead of food -- instead of something *tangible* \-- it was filled with the low, deep sobbing noise from the song.

The pressure alone made my head prone to explode. The sounds in it got louder and louder as well, silencing the world around me. I couldn't take it anymore, but when I opened my mouth to scream, I couldn't make any sort of sound. At all. Not even a whimper or gasping or wheezing, nothing. I could barely even *breathe*, in fact.

One of the worst parts about this was, thanks to my mind being as infested as it was, I couldn't even internally scream "What the fuck" like I wanted to. I couldn't form *any* of my own thoughts. My mind was as empty as my body this time. The only sign this time that I was still alive was my sight. I could see Jenna and the doctor calling out to me and shaking me again, but now couldn't feel OR hear them.

I remember being wheeled out of that room and back into the O.R. Another thing that scared me about this was just how *slow* time seemed to move. I mean, I couldn't have been in the audiology room for any more than ten or twenty minutes, yet, I could almost also swear that I was in that room for 2 *hours.* The same with when they wheeled me down the hallway to the O.R., the hallway stretched for a frickin' eternity, despite being only a couple rooms away from the Audiologists.

In the O.R., I watched figures all around me scrambling with various surgical implements. I could tell from body languages that they were all panicking, though about what exactly, I couldn't really tell except that it was to revive me. I must've been in critical condition, I thought. *I'm gonna die.*

The whole time, all I *could* hear was the sobbing and crying in my head. Even my screams were silenced by them, too. Imagine for a moment that you're a dummy, a wooden puppet, and you KNOW you're a puppet, and you're forced to watch the world around you while someone else is talking for you. You want to scream out with your own voice, but you can't because you essentially have no voice of your own. That's exactly what this was, save for the fact that ONLY I could hear the voice that wasn't mine.

This time, I have no idea how much time had actually passed before I came out of this spell because it was a while before it even registered that I actually WAS back. A sort of delayed effect, you know, like it all stopped, but you don't even realize it because of just how overstimulated your brain was to it? Eventually though, I did come out of it to find myself in the hospital room I was in before. I couldn't tell where I was at first because of the way everything was happening so fast, feeling like the 9th acid trip I never had (cleaned myself up after the 8th), that it also hadn't registered to me that I'd been moved here.

It was dark, the clock beside me reading 10:30 P.M. I picked my head up as much as I could and tried looking around the room. "J-Jenna?" No one answered. I was alone in the room.

My head fell back down, and I just stared back at the ceiling. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't move, not much anyways. Just lay in bed and stare at the fuckin' ceiling. Ironically, I feel like the quiet was just as detrimental to me mentally as the voices screaming in my head were. At least with that, *something* was happening -- God only knew *what*, but it was *something*. Now though, I was all alone.

My thoughts were mine, sure, but that was far from consoling. All I could think was that I was starting to lose my mind, and there was no fathomable reason as to why. I don't have any history of mental illness, I've been clean from drugs like I mentioned before for over 3 years now, and I knew that I wasn't making any of this shit up, despite how much I actually wished to God that I was.

The only thing I could connect any of this shit to was that song. That made me start thinking a little bit.  The song itself was called "God Cries" and the track sounded like someone was crying, not to mention the words themselves that kept repeating in my head, which I was starting to realize sounded like Latin. What was said, though, I had no idea at the time. I couldn't look it up yet, either, because I didn't have my phone with me.

The next morning, a nurse came in and went through the routine check-up. Just like before, my reflexes were slower than they should've been, even *more* so than the previous day in fact, not to mention my body feeling even more still than before as well. Each movement of any of my muscles ached like crazy. Afterwards, though, I still asked if I could have my phone brought to me. She agreed, somewhat reluctantly for some reason, and brought it to me.

After she left, the first thing I did was to check my messages to see if Jenna may've said anything, maybe a *"Hey, I'm worried to death about you, call or text me when you get this to let me know shit's okay, love you"* or some shit like that. Sadly, There was no such message, or any message at all, from her. Next, I opened Google to search the meaning for the phrase "Hominum Flebit" and the other phrases from the music. Before I even got that far, an article from my newsfeed caught my eye. It was the club from two nights ago with a headline reading **"Owner of nightclub sued for soliciting illegally** [pirated](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101vkdd/ghostwhispersio_final/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **music and the death of patron"**.
