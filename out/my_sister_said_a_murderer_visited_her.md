I have this story my sister told me when we were a lot younger that just randomly resurfaced when I was talking to a friend, and I feel like I should have made a bigger deal about it as a kid. 

When I was around 12, I was talking with my sister who was about 7 at the time about the scary staircase that was in a house we used to live in. At night, my parents would turn off all the lights downstairs before heading to bed, but we kept the upstairs hallway light on, so the stairs basically plunged into pure darkness. My sister had nightmares a lot as a kid, so it wasn't completely unheard of for her to head down the stairs to our parents' room in the middle of the night. I remember saying something to her like, "Yeah, I always used to get scared someone would be down there at night or something," to which my sister casually nodded and said, "Well, a man used to visit me down there." I felt a chill go down my body and I just remember feeling so unsettled by how calmly she had admitted it. I asked her more about it, to which she went into full detail about the man. He came in through our back sliding glass door and wore a black cloak with a mask over his mouth and nose. My sister said she remembered him telling her not to be scared. He had a knife that he showed her, which she described as 'looked like it needed to be cleaned.' Then he'd just slip back out and leave. He'd shown up multiple nights, according to her, and went further into the house every time, closer to the stairs, waiting for her. We moved a couple months after she claimed it all happened, so if something were to have happened, I guess I'll never know. I'd immediately squashed the fire after she'd told me, basically demanding for my own peace of mind that it was just a dream or that she was only trying to scare me, but she was so adamant that it really had happened. 

She wasn't really an imaginative kid and she was notorious for only ever telling the truth (getting me in trouble more times than I'd like to admit), so I really feel irked that this could be real. Our back door lock was really tedious, so it makes sense that that's how the alleged 'man' was coming inside. Our dog and cat slept in my parents' room, so it's not like we had a good alert, and we lived off of an old highway so cars were driving by at every hour of the day. But then there's the other side. She was infamous for having nightmares a lot, so it easily could have just been some kind of recurring dream. And I never understood why she was just so chill about it all. I never will.
