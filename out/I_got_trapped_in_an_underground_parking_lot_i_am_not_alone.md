Me (18M) and my mother (46F) recently found out that my grandpa who died 5 years ago owned a parking lot in an underground area. 

Yesterday, my mother decided that it was time to take advantage of the parking lot since it was located near the city center and finding a place to park during Christmas isn't easy. We drove toghether to my grandparent's house to get the keys. My grandmother was there since she barely leaves the house, only for local events. She is keeping all my grandpa's items, inculing the key from the parking lot in a drawer, inside his old room. We took the keys and headed our way to the parking lot which was pretty close, just three blocks away. Even though it was near the city center, the whole neighborhood was old and kind of abandoned. I could tell there was something odd in the atmosphere but I ignored it thinking my mind was messing with me.

We opened the main garage door. An extremely disgusting smell came out and I asked my mother to reconsider going in there since I had a creepy feeling. She said that I'm watching too many scary movies and that everything is fine so we kept on going while it was getting darker and darker. I was eventually forced to open my phone's flashlight. I pulled it out and looked at the battery percentage. 

10%

Shit, we are gonna have to do this quick!

My mother claimed to have "forgotten" her phone at the car when I asked her. 

Thats weird.  I thought to myself because i thought i had seen her using it before we had opened the main garage gate.

We went down a floor from some brick stairs and got to the first level. Newspapers from the 80's and broken beer bottles where all over the stairs. This whole thing was really odd to me but there was nothing to be afraid of, since I had my mother and phone with me.

We kept on moving, going down some more rusty stairs. We were at the last floor, almost reaching our parking lot number. I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible but after all, we were just there to inspect and clean our space, it was a matter of a few more minutes. The smell and atmosphere had me convinced this garage was abandoned.

- "I doubt anyone has been here the last year." I said.

My mother didn't reply. I froze. Where was my mother? All these thoughts had kept me distracted for a while.

-"Mum!?" I said in a louder tone.

-"MUM?" I started shouting now

Still no answer. I started running back to the stairs in hopes of finding her but she was nowhere. I was stressing out and still yelling to find her. I tried going back to the entrance of the parking but to my surprise i couldn't find it?! I swear I followed the exact path from where we had come. My mind was messing with me. I sat down and closed my flashlight to save up some battery. I opened my phone and saw the battery had fallen to 7%. I tried calling 911 and my girlfriend but there was no signal. I tried calming down in order to think clearly but I eventually ended up crying. After 15 hopeless minutes I was about to get up when I heard a creepy "crack". It sounded like glass shattering into pieces. My heart almost stopped. I froze. Thinking it was my mother I opened my flashlight and run towards the sound. Then I saw it. A dark, short figure with round eyes looking through my soul. 

WHAT THE HELL???

I closed my eyes in hopes of this being an illusion. 7 disgusting seconds later, it was still there. Its head wasnt clearly visible, making it seem like its white eyes were floating. I realized how serious this was and started running. The awkward silence broke with its deep voice. However I have no idea what it said since i started shouting as loud as I could the moment its big creepy mouth opened.

I was hopelessly running to random directions while screaming at the top of my voice in terror. I glimpsed at it crawling towards me. In a matter of seconds I had reached a dead end. Too afraid to start running again I have been standing in a corner for the last couple of minutes. My flashlight has turned off the moment my phone got to 5%. I am writing this in hopes of someone seeing it and helping me. However i advise you not to come here. You really don't want to encounter it.
