The headlines broadcasted across every news network read like a proverb:

DON’T EAT GUILT-FREE MEAT.

The Hearty Harvest Corporation’s so-called “humane” meat was hailed as a global breakthrough in ethical science. The media frenzy was ravenous, and the public’s reception was universally positive.

Guilt-free. Cruelty-free. Pain-free. 

At least, that’s how it was sold.

It came in cans. It came in packs. It came sizzling off fast-food grills.

No animals harmed. No blood spilled.

Just clean, cultured protein — “Eat with a conscience” — was the tagline plastered across billboards as you sat in traffic, morning and night.

Their influence was inescapable. Everywhere you turned, someone was talking about it. And the world, quite literally, ate it up.

But like all things floured in benevolence, there was a catch.
Or maybe just a controversy waiting to boil over.

And boil over it did.

It started quietly — with strange cravings. Online forums lit up with users claiming they’d lost their appetite for anything but Hearty Harvest’s so-called guilt-free meat. Vegetables, fruits, even traditional meats — none of it satisfied.

Only the Hearty Harvest meat could.

The craving soon turned into obsession.
Then something deeper. Something primal. Was unleashed upon the masses.

Doctors began to sound the alarm. The symptoms were eerily similar to high-dose opioid addiction:
Sweats. Tremors. Hallucinations.
Night terrors.
People reported vivid dreams of harming their loved ones — and worse, waking with the urge still gnawing at the edges of their psyche.

The headlines started turning against the company and the controversies stacked higher.
Viral videos emerged: people smashing into supermarkets and storming malls — not for electronics or money, but for cans, packs, patties of that damned meat.

Others broke into homes.
Held neighbors hostage.
Whole apartment buildings barricaded and brutalized.
All for a bite.
The world was set ablaze, and all those who never even sampled the meat got caught in the fire.

Eventually, the Hearty Harvest Corp. was forced to pull the product from shelves worldwide.
But it was already far, far too late.

What remained became black-market gold.

The meat sold in back alleys like it was the new sacred compound.

People quit jobs. Quit speaking. Quit living.
Only the hunger remained.
They changed — not into beasts with fangs and claws, but something far worse.

A species without empathy.

Driven by a bottomless, insatiable hunger.
And when the last of the meat was gone…

They turned to other sources.

Animals, devoured alive.
Pets. Neighbors. Family.
Bit by bit.
Everything that walked, breathed, or begged for mercy — became sustenance. Anything to cater to the hollow void within them. Hoping to receive a temporary full. 

The world Hearty Harvest promised — one free of cruelty — birthed something infinitely more inhuman.
And far more...

... Cruel.

I’ve been in hiding for the last twenty months.
Surviving. Broadcasting.
Avoiding the Mawlers — that’s what we call them now. Those infected by the meat’s curse.
They’re not mindless. Not exactly. Their thoughts are still there, buried under waves of instinct, hunger, and need for survival. Their human spirit trampled under the heavy feet of their addiction.

I operate under the alias Bugfeed, transmitting on radio frequency 11.1.
But for those who knew me before this nightmare — my name is Rachel Neugard.

My mission?

To reach whatever's left of the public.
To document this collapse.
To stitch together a narrative from the madness.
And maybe — just maybe — cradle the last flickers of our humanity, with hopes of birthing a new dawn.

I broadcast daily from my makeshift station.
If you’re out there — if you have answers — come forward.
Tell us how this happened.
Tell us how to fix it - and we can make it possible.

…..

Over time, survivors have offered theories. Some plausible. Some… not so much.
“The meat was laced with cocaine or an addictive synthetic.”
But no traces were ever found.
“The meat came from off-world bipedal hominoids.”
That one exploded. Spread by word of mouth, but yet died just as fast.
“”The meat contains the spirit of the anti-christ.” I will not go over the possibilities of this one. As I am sure it’s in the realms of the impossible.
Then came the whistleblower.

…..

Attempting to blow the top off of this organization, and the secrets they've withheld.
He contacted me directly — live on air — on April 18th, 2027.
Nineteen months after the first shipment of Guilt-Free meats went out.
According to him, only five people knew the true formula, he dubbed them "The Feeding Hand".
Each one carried a part of the code.
The full recipe was rumored to be written down — not stored on a drive, not encrypted in the cloud, but written. Locked away in a vault said to be strong enough to withstand even the wrath of nuclear weaponry.
But the material it was written on? Far less impressive on the defense scale:

Paper.

Fragile. Flammable. Destroyable.
Deliberately chosen for the mentioned reasons. If anyone ever tried to steal it, tamper with it, or force it out of hiding — It would ignite and burn. Reduced to embers in seconds. Its recipe — and with it, the only known antidote to this widespread disease — could vanish in an instant. One careless move, one wrong set of hands, and humanity’s last hope would be lost forever.

The vault could only be opened if all five came together.
But now? Their locations are unknown. Scattered like torn paper tossed to the wind.

They might be hiding - In the skeletons of urban cities, or the boneyards of the rotting countryside.
Perhaps they’re  infected.
Or worse — they’ve fallen victims to the very hunger they helped unleash.
If even one is gone…
The secret dies with them.

Now, The Feeding Hand are being hunted  by anyone desperate enough to follow their footsteps. Tales and rumors swirl across the fractured nations - whispers of people claiming to hold the passcode, or to be one of the legendary five. 

Some even swear they’ve found the actual vault. But the coordinates always lead to the same deadends:
Ruins. Traps. Empty buildings. Bones. But never the impenetrable vault. Like a ghost you can only hear, but never see. 

Yet still, I continue to search.
Because I have to.
Because if an answer exists — it’s our only shot at survival.

This is Bugfeed.
Signing off… for now.

Be safe while treading the hostile surface of our lost planet. And if you’re hearing this —

If you know anything —
Find me. 

You just may just be the one to resurrect what’s left of the fallen world.
