I’m writing this because I’m not sure if I’ll make it out. The air is heavy, and I can feel the weight of what happened in this room pressing against my chest. It’s over. I think it’s over, but it doesn’t feel that way. I should feel relief, but all I feel is dread.

Father Matthias finished the exorcism an hour ago. The demon—it’s gone, I’m sure of it. The boy, Samuel, slumped forward in his chair, his body limp, eyes closed. There was nothing left but the sound of his shallow breathing. I thought I’d seen it all—his convulsions, his screams, the strange, guttural voice that wasn't his own. It was like watching a soul being torn apart, and the demon clung to him until the last possible moment. But it’s done, right?

Samuel isn’t moving anymore. He looks peaceful now, too peaceful for a child who had been possessed just moments before. But there’s something off, something wrong with the stillness in the air.

I reach for my phone, trying to calm myself by documenting everything that’s happened. I need to write it down. I need to hold onto some kind of proof that this is real—that this nightmare isn’t just in my head.

The room is quiet, but not the kind of silence that brings peace. It’s the kind of quiet that holds its breath, waiting for something to happen. And then, I hear it. A small, barely audible giggle.

I freeze, my hand hovering above the phone screen. It came from Samuel.

I turn to look at him, and his head snaps up. His eyes—his eyes—are black. The kind of black that holds no reflection, no soul. His lips curl into a smile that’s too wide, too unnatural.

“No…” I whisper to myself, but it’s too late.

The boy's voice—no, the thing in his body—speaks, and it sends a chill down my spine. “You really thought it was over?”

My heart races as I scramble to my feet. “I-I just… I just finished the exorcism,” I stammer. “You can’t be…”

Samuel tilts his head, his grin growing wider, impossible. “The demon never leaves. Not really.”

The room seems to close in around me. The walls feel too tight, as if they’re shifting. I look at my phone again, but the time has reset. It’s only 9:03 PM, the exact time we started the exorcism. My hands tremble as I check it. The phone is glitching, flashing back to the beginning.

I hear a familiar voice—Father Matthias. “The exorcism isn’t over. It’s never over.”

The door slams shut, and I’m trapped. The room is small, suffocating.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. The air is colder than before, but my breath doesn’t fog. The walls close in again, the same dark presence filling every corner of the room. Samuel stands, his body jerking in movements too unnatural for a living being.

I hear the laugh again, echoing through my mind as the thing that wore Samuel’s skin moves toward me.

“You’re part of it now,” it whispers. “We’re all trapped in the same loop.”

I know this feeling. It’s the same as before. The same whisper, the same chilling laugh. The same cold breath against my neck.

And I know, with complete certainty, I’m writing this again. It hasn’t stopped. It won’t.

I can hear the voice of the demon in my mind. It’s only a matter of time before I hear it again, for the loop to start all over. The exorcism is never truly over.

I’ve been writing for too long. The room is starting to close in again. I hear the voice now, so clear in my mind, and I know what’s coming next. It’s going to happen again, just like before. The doors will slam. The boy will rise. The darkness will swallow me whole.

I’m trapped. And I’m never getting out.
