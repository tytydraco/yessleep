My friends Oscar, Otavio, Beto, and I are biologists and passionate about animals. We decided to take a boat expedition along the rivers of the Amazon rainforest to observe some local animal species up close.

We arrived and began the expedition in the early afternoon. Everything was going smoothly until we reached a certain area where the boat suddenly stopped. At the same moment, we all lost signal. The pilot couldn’t contact anyone, and our cell phones were completely without reception.

We were stuck on the boat for hours, trying unsuccessfully to reach someone. As the sky began to darken, the boat suddenly started to shake. Panic spread among us. Just as abruptly, the shaking stopped, but moments later, we heard a loud удар in the water, which until then had been completely silent.

Oscar began to have a panic attack. Beto and Reginald tried to calm him down while I spoke with the pilot. He told me the boat was starting to sink, that he didn’t know what had caused it, and that we needed to abandon it immediately.

I warned my friends, and after a few minutes of desperate discussion, we decided to jump off the boat. We were terrified. We had no idea what might be in the water, but we had no other option.

We jumped in and swam as fast as we could until we crossed the river. We reached the other side without any immediate problems. Once on solid ground, we could only watch as the boat sank faster than expected, and in a way that felt wrong. We were frozen, completely helpless.

Oscar was terrified because we were lost in the Amazon. The pilot was in disbelief that the boat had sunk for no apparent reason and that no one had come looking for us after the signal disappeared. Reginald, Otavio, and I focused on one thing: how to survive until someone found us.

We managed to start a campfire, and we still had food in our backpacks—enough to last for some time. Even so, none of us felt hungry after everything that had happened. We decided to sleep on the same riverbank where the boat had been, hoping that someone might have noticed its signal before it sank.

I was the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake up. When I opened my eyes, it was still deep into the night. Everything was dark. The only light came from the moon and my phone’s flashlight.

I looked toward the river and saw that the boat had completely disappeared beneath the water. At that exact moment, I felt like I was being watched. My stomach dropped. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and scanned the area.

That’s when I saw it.

A humanoid-shaped shadow, unnaturally tall, standing near the water. Its eyes glowed a bright, unnatural red. I have never felt fear like I did in that moment.

I immediately woke my friends and pointed toward the figure. It didn’t move. It just stood there, watching us. We all stared at it in silence until Reginald finally shouted, “Who are you?”

The creature didn’t respond. It remained completely still. Then we heard laughter—low, distorted, and deeply unsettling—coming from where it stood. Slowly, it began to walk away, disappearing into the jungle as if it had never been there.

I was shaking. I begged everyone to leave that area as soon as possible. We woke the pilot and told him everything we had seen, but he didn’t believe us. He said we were exhausted, scared, and imagining things.

While we were still trying to convince him to leave, we saw a light approaching from the river. It was a rescue boat. We almost cried with relief. We boarded it as fast as we could and immediately begged the pilot to take us away from that place.

To this day, Oscar, Beto, Reginald, and I still question what we saw, and what really caused our boat to sink. But more than anything, we feel a deep and unsettling relief that we’re still alive.
