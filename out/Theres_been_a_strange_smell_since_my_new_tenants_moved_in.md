I graduated college a few years ago with a bachelor's degree in computer science and got offered an internship at a very competitive technology company outside of my hometown. I was a little hesitant at first seeing how I was in my early 20s and taking this job would land me a good 8 hours away from my friends and family but there weren’t any decent job opportunities in my area that tied into my field, so I gladly accepted the offer. Don’t get me wrong, I loved my hometown, but the blue-collar life just wasn’t for me. I aspired to grow, become a man, and provide for my family in ways my father could not.

My father God bless his heart was an honest man, a worker in the steel mills of our little town of Blues Burrow, Georgia just like his father before him. I remember my childhood just like it was just the other day, my father would wake up at 4:00 am and I normally wouldn’t see him again until that night, sometimes not at all if he had picked up an additional shift but the old man worked his hands to the bone to give me the best HeadStart in life he possibly could. My mother, was a homemaker, always helping me with my studies, trying her best to help my father in the ways that he couldn’t.

It was an early Monday morning, and my father, after a long bickering session with my mother, finally convinced her to cut the cord and let me go. He had bought a Toyota Camry for me as a graduation present since other than my scholarship, he had paid my tuition.My father against my mother's will had unbeknownst to her landed me an apartment just a couple of blocks from my new job and had actually covered half a year's rent ( With a little help from an early deduction from his 401K ) until I got settled in.

6 months down the road things were going well, I had a little place of my own, made some friends, and got offered a full-time position at the company with a nice sign-on bonus. Before I knew it, I had purchased my first home on the outskirts of the city and started to become your average Suburban-Nite-slob, then a semiconductor shortage hit and with me being among the group of lowest seniority, I was let go.

With mortgage payments, utilities, gas, and groceries it didn’t take long for my savings to dwindle down to nothing, and the unemployment checks barely enough to keep the house in my name I was resorting to almost anything. Your typical food delivery services and taxi services, I tried them all but with the wear and tear on my vehicle and gas, I barely broke even. During the interviews, I had landed among the few thousand other people who were laid off I never thought I would hear the words “Over-Qualified “at a post-interview. I had too much pride to ask my parents for a handout considering the amount of cash they spent on getting me established, I was almost out of options until one of my former colleagues suggested I use my unused space as an Airbnb.

At an initial glance, I was a tad bit uncomfortable with this idea but I was in a situation where beggars can’t really be choosers.My dwelling itself was a 2500 square feet Victorian-style home equipped with a two-car garage, entering through the red mahogany doors you would be standing in the living room, and adjacent to it was the kitchen with a separate door leading into the garage and on the other side of the living room was a den with sliding doors leading to the back yard, taking the stairs from the living room was three bedrooms one which I converted to an office and two full baths. The backyard also had a storage building which at some point in time had been converted into an apartment complete with power and running water.

All of this sat in a modest neighborhood surrounded by neighboring houses with equal curb appeal, about a 10-minute drive to the city and airport and walking distance to the local shopping center. I’ll admit, I may have gone over budget slightly to purchase this place but at the time I was at a very crucial point in my life, I was doing good, Mother and Father were proud and I was adventuring off into the dating scene with hopes of laying down roots eventually and starting my own family but the one most important piece of advice my father gave me “ Don’t live beyond your means. “I failed miserably at.

I decided to put an ad up online, $900/m or $150 a night for the backyard apartment, $1000/m for the third bedroom, all amenities included, or $400 a night. If I could at least get them rented out monthly or keep a steady stream of guests, I could almost cover the mortgage.Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve watched and read all of the horror stories about renting your space out through apps and ads online but really what are the chances of it really happening, I never once had a bad experience driving for Uber or Door Dash so it couldn’t never happen to me. A couple weeks went by, and I received a text here and a phone call there but only a small handful came to actually look at the dwelling.

After around three weeks, I got my first guests, they had decided on the guest bedroom. They were a couple around their late 60s, Thomas and Mary Chaplain. They had just moved across the country looking for a change of scenery, they gave me a very heartfelt story of their two children moving out and starting their own life but didn’t anticipate grandchildren, and seeing the house they raised the family in was much too large, it was time for a change.

“Times just aren’t what they used to be anymore. I remember when I bought our place back in “59 our payment was about 30 bucks.” Thomas said.

“Now Thomas, you got to remember, we’re just a couple of old birds living in a young generation's world. “Mary said in a comforting tone.

They considered the place for a few moments but ultimately decided with the outrageous rent prices and abysmal choice of decent places they decided on a 6-month contract. It was different with them living with me, Thomas always had a story to tell about the old days and Mary began to show me the culinary arts which I was very thankful for, the takeout and microwave food did get old after a while.

It was about a week later, it was a rainy day, and a nice thunderstorm had pushed its way from the south being that it was hurricane season, I was sitting on the couch enjoying a cup of coffee putting some applications when a knock came to the door.

“ Who in the hell would be knocking on the door in this weather? “I said aloud as I got up and put my slippers on.

I opened the door, gripping the handle tight as the wind tried to force it open.

There stood a young couple, neatly dressed. The man fashioned a fresh haircut that was slicked back with a short beard that was trimmed with precision, he wore a white button-down shirt tucked into khaki dress pants that had been recently ironed wearing a pair of exotic leather dress shoes.The female was just as extravagant with freshly permed hair and pools of radiant blue that formed her eyes and a white sundress with sky blue florals stitched in.

I raised an eyebrow as I studied them for a brief moment, thinking that they may have been some members of the 7th Day Adventist church on the other side of the neighborhood.

“ I’m not really interested in where my soul is going at this time but I appreciate your thoughts, “ I said to them.

They both looked at one another and began to burst into laughter. The man held his finger up to my face signaling me to give him a moment as he began to wipe tears from his eyes.

“ I’m sorry, I’m sorry…oh god, no pun intended. “He said as he released his hands from his knees and raised up.

He looked at the female, smiling and still chuckling.

“Oh, this guy, yeah. This guy is great. “He regained his composure and stuck his hand out in a gesture to shake my hand which I obliged.

“ Jason Hodge I presume? My name is Dustin Hayes my fine sir and this lovely enchantress next to me is the jewel of my life, Marilyn Hayes. “He said as he held on to his suspenders.

Standing there in confusion, not being able to make heads or tails of the situation, she caressed my face.

“ That’s Misses Hayes to you, big boy. “She said whilst giving a wink to me.

I finally snapped back into reality after being bewildered for a moment. He explained that they were artists traveling the country in constant search of inspiration, and our little town just happened to catch their eye and they had found that my listing online was intriguing with it being short term.

“ Okay, well if you would like to come back when the weather is a tad more convenient I would be more than happy to show you the building. “I suggested.

“ That won’t be necessary, I’m sure your humble abode is more than sufficient for our needs, how about we sweeten the deal? Six months of rent paid upfront. And of course, you would need a security deposit equal to the first month's rent so by my calculations that would come out $6300. “He said as he pulled a leather wallet from his back pocket.

“ I…. well. “I started before he cut me off.

“ Let’s just make it an even $7000, there’s nothing more tragic in this world than oddities. “ He said as he placed the cash in my hands.

Everything about this situation was bizarre, who pays six months upfront for an apartment and doesn’t even care to look at it I was desperate and with that lump sum upfront on top of the couple renting out the bedroom I would be set until I could find another job so against my better judgment, I accepted it.

A few days went by and they finally arrived with an old van, it was loaded down with all different sorts of Knick knacks, air-up mattresses, a portable shower, and a few easels and canvases. They had everything moved within a couple of hours and they were settled in.

Everything appeared normal at first, they would leave every so often for a few hours and return home. They were quiet, and just like the couple in the spare bedroom I never really noticed them. I was in the restroom one early morning doing my daily routine, I had just stepped out of the shower, the fall weather had settled in, and it was brisk in the house. The shower I took, which was hotter than normal had caused quite a bit of condensation on the mirror and window. I cracked open the window to let some air level everything out and after brushing my teeth and going to close the window I saw her.

Marilyn was outside in the portable shower, not a care in the world of the weather nor her decency, soap suds running down every curve of her body. I never laid eyes on such a fine specimen, standing there looking like a Greek goddess, a modern-day Aphrodite. Now I realized I had been observing too long in the heat of the moment, she made eye contact with me, I ducked below the window and moved to the side trying to get out of sight but when I peeked back through the window she was still standing there looking, smiling, motioning for me to come. I noticed Thomas from the window of the apartment painting Marylin.

I quickly pulled the curtains in place and immediately went to the sink and splashed water onto my face to wash away the combination of embarrassment and filth, the filth of feeling like a pervert. I didn’t know what the hell was wrong with me, I had never had a desire to even consider being a peeping tom but at the same time, I tried to reassure myself it was ok because she wasn’t embarrassed by being caught but instead excited.

Feeling disgusted with myself, I dressed myself and made my way out the back door to the apartment to send my apologies hoping they would see this as a misunderstanding. I attempted to knock on the door, but Dustin answered before I could knock. I almost immediately expected him to either curse me for looking at her in that manner or even yet punch me square in the jaw but what I did not expect was his relaxed demeanor after the events.

“ Ah Mr. Hodge, and to what honor do I have with you delighting us with your presence on this fine evening? “He said while tugging on his suspenders.

As much as I tried to gather the words in my head that I had practiced since morning, every single syllable just vanished leaving me as a babbling idiot.

“ Yeah. About this morning, it uh…. well? The words completely left me.

Dustin raised an eyebrow before he began to laugh, soon after Marilyn came to the door dressed in a luxurious shower robe and both began laughing hysterically as if I was jesting them.

“ Oh Mr. Hodge, as I’ve said before, you are just too much. We were clearly in the wrong, you see, as what we like to call Gypsy Ways may be seen as primitive. We owe an apology to you. “He said as he went back inside and began to shuffle around searching for something.

“ Ah, here it is. Nice and dry. “ he said as he carried a painting to the door.

“ Our most sincere apologies are not quite sufficient enough which I why we made you a painting, while your house is lovely your walls are quite boorish and desolate, if I may say so without overstepping any boundaries.”He handed the painting over to me and I just stood there looking like an idiot more so than before.

 I gave my farewell and went back inside and set the painting on the bed. It was quite extravagant.It was an odd color palette consisting of vibrant shades of red and black but still blended into a beautiful scene of Maryline nude, every single line and curve was painted in the most professional manner, and not a single detail was left out but as I looked at the painting the more, I felt at unease. The attention to detail was far beyond anyone I had ever seen and something else that had disturbed me, how did they know I had no artwork or pictures on the walls? They never toured the house.

2 months later———

I sat at the dining room table staring into the vastness of the paintings Dustin & Marylin had artistically conjured up for me in the past 2 months, my house now resembled an art gallery, haunted by paintings of Marylin, Dustin, and an old couple standing outside they're dwelling.Over the course of time leading up to now, they had crept and crawled their way into my life, intentionally bathing outside for my eyes to see, making gestures for me to join them. Every time I threw a painting outside, they would just paint another. Strange but familiar smells coming from the paint, coming from outside. They’re leaving throughout the day and the constant smoke rises from the building. I had to do something about them, they had paid upfront but I could return that money and have law enforcement evict them seeing how everyone was uncomfortable with them.

A creak of the staircase snapped me out of my thoughts, as I looked up as Thomas and Mary came down the stairs. Mary had a distraught scene painted on her face as Thomas approached me standing with his arms crossed in a stern manner.

“ I think we’re going to find a local motel for the time being until we find another place of residence. “He said.

“ For what reason? I thought my housing was sufficient, I’ve not had a single complaint!? “I said, confused as to why they would just up and leave.

Thomas sighed.

“ Don’t get me wrong, you’ve been a good landlord but honestly, those people living in the apartment out back are just weird. “Thomas said.

“ We don’t feel comfortable with them. The indecent exposure, coming and going all hours of the day and that strange smell outside, it’s just best if we part ways. “He said as he pulled Mary into his arms and made his way to the door.

I had bit off more than I could chew. I was in my mid-20s, and my professional development did not give me any leverage to deal with people outside of four corporate walls. At that moment I realized that I was gullible, and it was a price that I had to pay. The Chaplin’s left and I was once again posting an ad online for a space to rent.

Being tired of the depressing state I was in I decided it would be best to clean out anything left behind from the previous tenants, it would look very foul on my end to show to room to a potential tenant only for it to be left in disarray. I gathered up my cleaning supplies and made my way up the staircase feeling ever so watched by the paintings making their way up the walls. I sat the materials down and opened the door, what I saw shocked me.The room was in the same state as they left it in. I knew they were in a rush to leave but they didn’t take a single belonging with them. They’re suitcases in the process of being packed, they’re odds and ends exactly in the same locations as always, then I started to think about the things Thomas was telling me most importantly “ That Smell “.

 I decided to take matters into my own hands and investigate these accusations, I made my way back down the stairs and to the back door.As I made my way outside, the Hayes were once again out and about so I began to walk around outside. Concentrating I began to take deep sniffs of the air around me, hints of rosemary, freshly cut grass, the neighbor's lavender garden, and one peculiar aroma caught my attention. I couldn’t quite place what it was other than I had smelt it at one time that was for certain but before I could pinpoint it, I heard a vehicle pull into the driveway.

The minivan pulled into the back of the house and of course, it was no other the The Hayes. They got out of the van laughing and joking when they caught me in, their eyesight. I waved as I tried to play it off as if I was checking on things around the house as I approached them. Dustin greeted me with a normal smile as he grabbed his suspenders.

“ Ah, and a good afternoon to you Mr. Hodge. Can we help you with anything? “I furrowed my brows as I shook my head.

“ No sir. I was just checking in on everything and since I have a vacancy now, I was making sure everything was in order inside and outside the house. “Dustin locked his arm into Marylin's arm as they began to walk to the apartment.

“ Splendid, as our mother always said “Cleanliness is next to Godliness “, bless her soul. “He said as he drew the outline of a cross on his chest.

“ You’re a mother? So, she is your sister?” I said

“ Of course. You didn’t think we were a couple, did you? Our apologies, I suppose we never really started our relationship. Not that it’s any of your business. “He said, this time his demeanor shifting darker.

“ No, not at all. I just assumed; you know what? Forget it. It doesn’t matter. “I said as I threw my hands up.

Walking back inside I could feel they’re eyes peering right through me, closing the door behind me I glanced out the window and they still stood there motionless watching me how a predator watches it prey. Later that night I was beginning the feel the pangs of hunger, I opened the fridge but sadly the combination of old Chinese takeout and frozen pizzas didn’t appeal to me so I took a trip to the supermarket right down the road and decided it was time to use the stove to cook something other than ramen.

After bringing the groceries into the house I began to take different vegetables and herbs out of the bags and before long my kitchen resembled something between a landfill and 5 star kitchen. I smiled and shrugged as it was the first actual meal, I had cooked for myself and deep down inside I regretted not learning this sooner, especially after being laid off from work. I remembered the teachings of my mother, clean while you cook, as I tidied up the kitchen while pots came to a boil, and before I knew I was placing a succulent steak on the stovetop griddle.

The aromas of sage and rosemary filled the kitchen with a pleasant smell, as well as peppermint brewing in the kettle as I prepared my cup for a hot tea. This moment of tranquility didn’t last long as the sounds of cracking and popping emitted from the stove as the buttered steak began to burn violently. Frantically I panicked as I turned the stove off and tried to maneuver the steak onto a plate which I failed miserably. The steak slipped from the tongs, as I tried to catch my expensive cut of meat my arm landed on the griddle sending a surge of pain up my arm as my flesh became cooked itself. The smells of rosemary and sage were soon replaced by my seared flesh.

As the aroma entered my nostrils the pain quickly subsided as my mind began to process everything like puzzle pieces finally being put together. The smell from outside, the smell from my now roasted arm. The similarities were not just coincidence. My stomach quickly turned upside down as my mind finally absorbed this horrid realization that something was terribly wrong.

I rose up from my slumped state in hopes of administering some form of first aid on my arm but everything slipped into the deepest shade of black as a sharp pain bolted up the back of my head and I slipped out of consciousness.

The sound of drips of water and the flexing of pipes entered my ears as I slowly awoke, light flares entered my eyes as I slowly adjusted to my surroundings. The dimly lit room became visible in small increments as I soon realized I was in my basement, I tried to move but my arms did nothing as my line of sight shifted upwards to the ceiling as the chair, I soon realized I began to move towards the staircase leading up with my ears being haunted in a peal of familiar laughter. Further up I went traversing the staircase leading to the light illuminating the entryway to the door.

I found myself in my dining room, the table sat with an array of fine China that I didn’t own. A golden candle sat in the middle of the table lit with the lights dimmed and an assortment of leafy greens and fruits laid out in an orderly fashion. Pivoting my head in all directions gathering my surroundings the truth sat in.

I was in one of the nightmares I read about. 

Dustin and Marylin sat at the table one across from the other, their heads slumped over with trails of blood running from their ear. I tried to move but a jolt of pain shot through my neck, I noticed not only had I been tied to my dining room chair but my left arm was missing from the elbow down, small fillets of skin missing from my right as well, and that horrid laughter from the kitchen.

Thomas emerged from the kitchen wearing an apron which sported“ Kiss The Chef “ with a cartoon Italian chef whilst sharpening a knife. Mary walks in soon after holding a serving tray containing an assortment of dipping sauces, both of their faces in a haggard state consisting of lesions and festering wounds like that you would see from an individual struggling with a meth addiction. I struggled more and more as they approached the table with every twist and turn sending shocks of pain throughout my body as I soon became aware they had tied me to a chair with razor wire.

Gazing at me with those cold dead eyes, he made his way to me and laid his hand on my shoulder.

“ I learned a long time ago that the razor wire brings the struggle to a bare minimum.“Thomas said as he began to grin.

Mary grabbed my jaw and jerked my head towards her as she grinned showing her rotting teeth while shoving a spoonful of meat into my mouth, gagging and trying to spit it back out Thomas pinched my nose shut as Mary covered my mouth, then another spoonful and another until I was belching and regurgitating what appeared to be my own arm.

Thomas approached Dustin with the knife and patted him on the face as he slowly opened his eyes and raised his head. His eyes didn’t show fear but disappointment and for what I was unsure of. He pulled channel locks from his pocket and raised the knife up to Dustin’s face as he pinched his tongue and began to pull it out, bringing the knife closer.

Mary interrupted soon after, in a fit of rage she knocked the knife from his hand and spoke five words that made my soul tremble with fear.

“ Cleanliness is next to Godliness “ she screamed at him.

Thomas grabbed her by the hair and drove her face into the table knocking over the various sauces she had brought out prior.

“ Fucking shit woman, it's always something with you. We’ve been living in this hole for months, helping buy this slab of meats and groceries trying to fatten em up only to have those two impatient leeches we call kids fuck it up. For the love of God, I'm hungry. “He shouted as he picked the knife up.

Thomas stormed into the kitchen cursing under his breath.

“ Nobody ever appreciates what I try to do for this family. “She sobbed as she ran off into a separate part of the house.

I turned my head back towards the table, Dustin fixed his gaze on me as Marylin who was now awake from the commotion looked at me smiling.Dustin began to rock his chair from side to side as the chair tilted over busting to pieces. Soon he was unrestrained and released his sister from her bonds. As they approached me, I closed my eyes waiting for my demise.

“ I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. “she said into my ear.

“ You’ve seen me, you’ve watched me. Do you not find me sexy. “ she whispered seductively.

Pain bolted up through my neck as she bit onto my ear lobe, the sounds of popping and flesh being rent following the warm sensation of blood running down my neck, she climbed into my lap thrusting her genitalia into my crotch as she became aroused from my torment.Soon after Dustin lifted my arm and began to feast upon the exposed muscle and meat from my elbow, I could hear the moans and him slurping.

Marylin grabbed my hair yanking my head back and licking me from my neck to my forehead, her tongue drenched in my blood.

I felt like one of the animals would watch online slowly being devoured by a pack of hungry hyenas, trying inevitably to escape their doom. She began slinging her hair around, screaming and moaning. Dustin arose and went into the kitchen retrieving a knife, the dull blade drove into my bicep as he pulled the knife down, the sounds of my own flesh being lacerated as more muscle tissue became visible. Everything began to fade as my body went into shock from blood loss, but I soon raised my head back up as two hands grabbed Marylin and she was thrown off of me.

As I looked up, I could see Thomas as he kicked Dustin in the face, teeth fragments peppering my face as he fell to the floor cursing at his father.

Marylin jumped onto her father's back scratching and screaming as she tried to bring the man down, in their scuffling my chair was knocked over. The bloodied shirt ripped as the razor wire dug into my skin and the chair fell apart, I lay there screaming in agony as Mary rushed into the dining room, her face bruised and bloodied from Thomas’s previous assault, raising her shirt, a pistol of high caliber was holstered, she took aim and with a deafening bang shot Thomas in the leg.

“ If y’all don’t stop acting like animals I swear, I’ll shoot you all like dogs. “Mary said.

“ You crazy old bitch. “Thomas yelled back while holding his leg.

His demeanor made it apparent that this wasn’t the first time. The room grew quiet as everyone was frozen.

“ Been killing random people, cookin' em up without any common sense, anyone and everyone could smell it, hell, even been feeding your daddy here while I’ve been holding out trying to fatten up the cattle and the first sign of fresh blood y’all go feral like it's your first time. “she said, crossing her arms and shaking her head.

Their eyes became fixated on me.

“ What about him? We’ve never left a live one before. “Dustin asked.

Thomas snorted.

“ I’d say just let bleed out. “Thomas said.

“ Now now boys, he’s seen our faces. He’d just go to the police but if our little aphrodisiac here was’t to have a little automobile accident then I’m sure the authorities would claim it as just a dream fueled by alcohol. “ Mary laughed as the others pulled me up.

The next few hours were a complete blank to me, the last thing I remember before passing out was the grisly waves of laughter of the family before the sounds of my skull cracked against a blunt object.

I woke up on the side of the road, my car behind me lay in a heap of fiery metal and rubber, fueled by pure adrenaline I managed to rise up with my only good arm and began walking into the dark.

Soon after I was flagged down by local law enforcement officials not far from the crash and I was inbound to the hospital by ambulance. The medical staff claimed despite the state of my wounds that I should count my blessings to be alive, they found my arm in the wreck but were unable to save it and my right ear was nothing but a bloody pulp, but I would still have some hearing from that side.

The toxicology report showed that I was well over the legal limit, and I was just another depressed individual who had a few too many and decided to take a drive.

I’ve not eaten in days since I’ve been here, this food, brings a miasma of foulness to my nostrils, a feeling of thousands of hornets laying a barrage of stings to my stomach. Reaching for my mouth I gag as the stomach acid bursts through my throat like a geyser as I read the lunch menu. Salisbury Steak with onions. I asked the nurse if they take special requests.

I won't forget the look on my face when I asked her to inform the kitchen to serve my steak raw.
