I know he’s out there. He has to be out there. I just know he is out there waiting for me to leave this house, but I can’t. I can’t face him. I don’t want to face him. He waits for me day and night, and honestly, at this point, I don’t know when day or night begins or ends.

The only clue I have now is my old wall clock… it ticks endlessly but it doesn’t tell me if the time outside is AM or PM nor does it tell me the date or season. I don’t know how long it’s been… a week? Maybe two. Maybe it's been a month or three. 

Days run into one another, and weeks too. I have enough food to last me a month, maybe two. I prepared for this day. I prepared for the day when I’d be trapped in here trying to avoid… him.

Maybe it’s not even a him. Maybe it’s a her. Or an it. I can’t be sure. It just stands out there in my front yard, watching, waiting, biding its time. Waiting for me to open the door… and then… it’ll all be over for me.

The police have come. More than once. They come, bang on the door, ask to speak to me, but I never come out. They want me to open that door, but I can’t. 

What if IT is pretending to be them? It would be the perfect opportunity for IT to finally get what IT wants from me. My life… my money… my soul even? I don’t know what IT wants, but IT seems to never leave me.

The thing is from a nightmare. It has the blackest eyes. The devil’s eyes. Maybe it’s the devil himself, but he cannot get in here with me as long as I keep that door locked, bolted, and barricaded. I made sure to install enough security that God himself would have trouble making that door move. 

Only a bullet or a bomb might be able to open it… but I’m far ahead of IT. The windows are covered with blackout curtains, the lights never turn on, the stove is never used, not even the microwave because I know that IT will hear me and know where I am inside.

It torments me. I cannot sleep, I can barely eat. I’ve lost at least 35 pounds this month alone, in fear of it hearing me chewing my food or spitting it out as the cold ravioli I’ve saved up has gone stale—or at least it tastes that way straight out of the can. It just tastes like cold, dead mush. Fleshy, saucy, thick mush.

I must remain quiet. I don’t want it to hear me. The smell of the house is musty, the floorboards are cool, and the air is damp with humidity. I haven’t showered in at least a week. That would be the perfect time for IT to come in here with me and stab me in the shower, just like Norma Bates from \*Psycho\*. It would be the perfect end for IT. The first slasher movie ever made being the perfect ending to my story.

I could be the real-life Janet Lee, but at this point, I have forgotten who I am. I haven’t seen my reflection in what feels like months in fear that IT will be staring back at me from the mirror… nor have I heard my voice. 

Am I a man? A woman? Or am I something else entirely? Its been so long since I’ve seen or heard myself that I am starting to question what I AM. What IT IS matters less than what I AM now but I can’t find out what I AM without making IT hear or see me inside…

The only light I keep with me is a small candle. Surely IT cannot see the candlelight behind the blackout curtains.

I can hear the door knocking again… I’m not going to open it. Not now… not ever… the only problem is it’s coming from inside the house now. I guess IT finally got what IT wanted… Maybe now I will have answers. Maybe now I will finally understand why IT came and why IT will never leave…
