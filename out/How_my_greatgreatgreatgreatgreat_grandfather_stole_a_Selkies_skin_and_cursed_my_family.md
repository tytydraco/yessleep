Like a monster peeking from out underneath the bed, I could see a storm coming on the horizon. It was right where the churning sea met the slate-grey sky, as if it was merely using the pads of its fingers, slowly pulling itself upwards from the depths of Hell. 

Because that’s what this tempest was coming from. Hell. 

“We’re in for a wild one,” local news anchors were shrieking, warning us to button our hatches and pull the sheep into the barn. They’d been reporting on the storm for the past week, their broadcasts increasing in concern by the day. This was a once-in-a-century storm, they were predicting.

Standing by the open window; I took a deep breath in, the heavy air thick with salt. I winced, as the brine collided harshly with the shop’s cloying perfume. I was at the local bridal shop with my mother, with wedding dresses stacked practically to the ceiling. After I threw the cloak into the sea, I found my way back to Donal, and he’d welcomed me without question. His patience had been a balm for my frayed soul, and now, in a week’s time, we were to be married.

I frowned. Unless this storm had anything to say about it. I frowned deeper. Or my mama. 

After generations of my family’s unlucky dance with the devil and death, Donal and I’s engagement was a ray of hope for my mother. She became a whirlpool of her own, sucking me deeper into this… mess.

I rested my hands on the windowsill, my gaze fixed on the sea just beyond the edge of town. Its roar rose and fell like a heartbeat, steady and relentless, cutting through the storm of emotions swirling inside me: the anxiety, uncertainty, and the heavy weight of everything ahead. Lately, I’d found myself staring at the water more often, its constant hum weaving through my thoughts like an anchor. 

“You’re going to let the storm blow you away if you stand there much longer,” Donal’s voice broke through my thoughts. I turned to see him leaning against the doorway, his arms crossed and a faint smile tugging at his lips. 

“Hey!” I squealed. “It’s bad luck for you to see the dress!” But I let him pull me into his arms, his warmth steading me, my mind drifting like flotsam on white-capped waves. 

*The curse was broken… wasn’t it?* There it was again, that seed of doubt. I’d pulled that brine-soaked cloak from the chest; I’d thrown it back to the sea. But through my tangled thoughts, I felt my granny’s voice drift to the surface. “The sea doesn’t forget, Aoife. And neither do the selkies.”

\*\*

Seamus O’Sullivan and the damned Selkie’s curse. He haunted me; like he’d haunted every fairytale, every warning, every lesson told in my family over the past hundred years. His soul was chained to this earthly plane, from the weight from my family member’s accusations heaped upon it. 

It began, as Granny always said, on a fog-drenched morning at Banba’s Crown, where the cliffs rose like jagged teeth above the restless sea. Seamus was young, no more than twenty, and his family had been decimated by the potato famine. When his mama, the last of his kin, finally succumbed, something inside him cracked. He was alone in the world, battered by grief and desperation, when the storm brought her to him.

The selkie.

The wind had howled through the village that night, tearing at rooftops and sending waves crashing higher than anyone had ever seen. Seamus had been out in his boat, inviting death from the merciless waves, when he saw her. She was cast ashore by the fury of the waves, her dark hair tangled with seaweed, her pale body shivering against the rocks. Beside her lay a seal’s skin, slick and gleaming in the moonlight.

Seamus knew what she was. The tales his mother had whispered to him as a boy came rushing back: selkies, the sea folk, who shed their skins to walk on land. Their beauty was said to be otherworldly, but their hearts belonged to the ocean. Without her skin, she could never return to the water.

In a moment of weakness - or madness - he took it. He clutched the skin to his chest and carried her back to his cottage, ignoring the way her wide, dark eyes filled with terror. He told himself it was for love, but deep down, he knew it was something else entirely. Loneliness. Grief. The need to hold onto something, someone, in a world that had taken everything from him.

The villagers whispered about her. She was beautiful, but strange. A foreigner on land. She couldn’t speak their language at first, and her cries at night were like nothing they’d ever heard- low, mournful keens that seemed to come from the depths of the ocean itself. Seamus tried to love her, but her silence became a mirror for his own despair. He took to haunting the edge of the cliffs that bordered their small village, drowning himself in drink while she haunted their marital bed, staring out the window at the waves.

The years passed, and the selkie bore him eight children. The villagers marveled at them, their dark eyes and hair unlike any seen in the village before. But the selkie woman grew thinner, paler, her spirit eroding with each passing day. Seamus buried the seal skin deep beneath the floorboards, but he knew it wouldn’t matter. She was slipping away, piece by piece.

The storm that claimed her came without warning. A once-in-a-century storm, the stories all say. The winds tore through the village, rattling windows and uprooting trees. That night, as the children huddled together, the selkie woman stood at the window, her gaze fixed on the raging sea. Something broke inside her. She threw open the door and walked into the storm, her cries rising above the howl of the wind.

Seamus followed her to the cliffs, his steps unsteady from drink. She stood at the edge, her hair wild and her arms outstretched, the ocean roaring beneath her. He called to her, begged her to come back, but she didn’t turn.

“You stole my skin and called it love.” She cried, her foreign voice cutting through the storm. “But love cannot cage the sea, and I will not drown here on land.”

And with that, she leapt. The waves swallowed her whole, and the storm seemed to scream in triumph. When it finally passed, the villagers found Seamus alone on the cliffs, his face whipped raw from the wind.

\*\*

I shivered as I imagined the height of the waves that had carried the Selkie woman back home. Could one man’s greed have rippled through time like that? Or was it just a story we told ourselves to explain why tragedy seemed to haunt us?

“You’re quiet again,” Donal said, brushing a strand of hair from my face. “What’s on your mind?”

“Granny’s stories,” I admitted. “Seamus and the selkie. What came after.”

“And do you think it’s over?” he asked, his brow furrowing slightly. 

I hesitated, the seal’s gaze from that day flashing in my mind. Its dark, knowing eyes. The forgiveness they seemed to offer. But forgiveness wasn’t forgetting. “I want to believe it is,” I said finally.

Donal smiled, pulling me closer. “Then believe it, Aoife. We deserve to be happy.”

I leaned into him, letting his warmth anchor me. But as the first drops of rain began to fall, I couldn’t help but glance back at the sea, its waves rising higher and higher. The storm was coming, and with it, a question I wasn’t sure I wanted the answer to. Would the tide let us go, or was it simply waiting to claim its due?
