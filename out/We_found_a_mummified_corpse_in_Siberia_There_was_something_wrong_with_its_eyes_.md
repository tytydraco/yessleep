It wasn’t human.



I came face-to-face with the relic first. I was plucked from reality in an instant; one moment, above, the next, below. I’d been Promethean in my hubris when I stepped onto the ice, pestering the others for being too careful. My foot landed on a weak spot, and I slipped silently down beneath the surface into a small system of snow-laden caves. A spotlight of sun illuminated the place where I landed. The walls, rough-hewn and iced over, glittered gently around me. It was quiet. Stale air. I must have been the first human to set foot in those caves in thousands of years.



My ankle radiated pain.



Dr. Carter’s pale face blotted out the sun above me, drenching me in cold shadow. “Christ Almighty, Ava! You alive down there?”



“Yes!” I called out. “But, *fuck!* I hurt my ankle!”



“You shouldn’t have gone out so carelessly.” This quip, delivered in monotone, preceded the face of Dr. Sokolov. Even from several yards below, I could feel the heat of his glare. “Now we have to waste time getting you out of there.”



Dr. Carter grinned. “Maybe you can find us an extinct species down there while you wait!”



Voices crescendoed above me while they organized my rescue effort. There were five of us out there in Siberia, a land I found beyond my comprehension. I learned the true meaning of *isolation* in that place. Did you know there are towns blocked in by snow year-round? The temperatures drop to unfathomable negatives. Cold so cold it’s *deadly.* And that’s just everyday life. Sitting alone under the ice, I couldn’t imagine the same Me that had jumped for joy when asked to come on this trip. I never dreamed of sprained ankles and claustrophobia; I dreamed of superhero archaeologists discovering mammoth remains and ancient tools.

 

I found something much older than mammoths and cavemen.



I got to my feet with great difficulty; pressure on my right ankle echoed a sharp pain up my leg. I leaned on the wall for support. Another team member, Dr. Bennett, bent over the hole I’d left in the ice. “Hey Collins, this might take a while. The ice isn’t stable enough for us to just toss a rope down there for you. We’re sending Kuznetsova back for a ladder or something. Hang tight.”



“Not much else I can do,” I said.



She frowned. “Sorry. Shout if you’re getting too cold. We have extra blankets in the truck.” With that, Dr. Bennett disappeared.



It would take Dr. Kuznetsova at least an hour to get to our camp and back with a ladder. For most of that period, I waited. Sat back down. Stared into the darkness. Tucked myself tight and shivered. 



Then: a glint of light, deeper in the cave.



It was unmistakable. I hadn’t moved, so something else must have. I stared into the space where the light originated, but there was nothing more. I mulled it over. Replayed that little speck of reflected light in my mind until I was sure it *had* happened. There was ice on these walls. Of course it would glitter and shift. Perhaps it was melting ever-so-slowly due to my intrusion of light and heat. 



Still, I hastily got to my feet and pulled out my flashlight. Walking was difficult, so I dragged one gloved hand along the wall and limped deeper inside the chasm. Once I aimed my beam of light forward, I could see that I was in more of a tunnel than a cave, one that carried on long out of sight. 



I don’t know what compelled me forward: supernatural pull or natural curiosity? Out in the Siberian landscape, my senses were dulled. I was unstimulated. I craved discovery, and more so, I wanted all the glory of being first. So I carried on into the tunnel, hand on the wall for support, in search of the mysterious glint.



I stopped to catch my breath and rest my ankle. When the worst passed, I centered myself again to continue my journey. It was then I noticed my hand, the one I used to balance against the wall, was warm. 



I shone my flashlight on the wall, and two eyes reflected back at me.



In an instant I flattened to the ground, shoving myself to the opposite wall to get away. Incoherent thoughts swarmed in my skull, but I couldn’t conjure a face and body to go along with the terrible fear. What had I seen? Eyes, yes, but anything more? I was so frightened that the image became obscured by my panic. My back hit the cold rock. All I could do was utter a pathetic wheeze. Fear so sharp you’re struck mute.



Nothing came leaping out of the darkness at me. If there was any noise, it couldn’t be heard over the sound of my own heart’s violent dance within my chest. I gripped the flashlight and brought the beam up to face my supposed attacker, and the light struck its eyes once more.



It wasn’t human. Not anymore, at least.



I was nearly unable to control my own body at the sight of it. It took great strength to keep the light steady. I knew it was dead because it was partially fused with the rock wall. Almost as if it had always been in that rock, but millennia of erosion had slowly revealed it. I stared up at a *person*—mummified and shriveled and ancient. The sort of leathery age that predates written language. Its browned skin was taught, making its eyes appear half-gorged out of their sockets. The cadaver was lipless and perpetually grinned; teeth chipped and blackened. It was half in and half out of the wall of the cave. Frozen in eternal motion. My hand had been right over its face. 



The eyes frightened me more than anything. They were certainly the propellent of my journey deeper, but they defied logic. Anything this old and dead wouldn’t have eyes. The cold must have preserved them; yet, they didn’t show the same wrinkled wear-and-tear of the rest of the thing’s body. It was like someone had plucked their eyes out yesterday and set them inside the corpse’s empty sockets. The irises were deep blue like the ocean at night; my flashlight, the moon bouncing over bottomless water. 



“Dr. Collins?”



At my origin point, a ladder slid down from the heavens. 



“Dr. Collins! Can you climb?”



I remained for a moment, watching the corpse. Its eyes watched me back. Then I scrambled to my feet and limped back to my colleagues.



\*\*\*



“It’s real,” Dr. Kuznetsova announced. She dragged herself out of the hole and onto the ice. “My friends, say goodbye to obscurity. We’re going to be famous.”



Dr. Carter pumped a fist in the air. “*Yes!* God, Ava, I’m so fucking glad you fell down that hole. Ahem. I mean… Well, that came out wrong. You know what I mean.”



I looked away from him. Eyes glued to the hole.



“Man,” Dr. Bennett gushed. “Forget Otzi the Iceman. This thing’s *gotta* be older than him!”



Whether it was the shock of the strange corpse or my fall, I was numb to their excitement. Dr. Sokolov was the only one who shared my lack of enthusiasm. He climbed down into the hole last, viewing the corpse alone. He was down there for nearly twenty minutes, and when he came up, he was silent. As I sat on a pack and nursed my ankle, Dr. Sokolov paced back and forth by the truck, casting glances over his shoulder. He seemed indifferent, yet impatient. 



“We’ll have to find a way to extract him from the rock,” Dr. Carter went on. “And *carefully.* He may already be thawing. We don’t want to rip him to pieces. We need the pneumatic drill. Did anyone bring it?"



“It’s at camp, but we’ll come back here in the morning.” Dr. Kuznetsova clapped her hands together. “Not a moment to waste! This might be the most important discovery of the 21st century, people!”



“*No.*”



We all turned. Dr. Sokolov looked sour. “*No,*” he repeated. “We cannot remove that *thing* from the rock.”



“We have the tools,” Dr. Carter argued. “We’re experts, Alexei. We know what we’re doing.”



“I don’t doubt anyone’s skill or knowledge. I’m telling you it’s a bad idea.”



With the aid of a ski pole retrieved from the truck, I stood and faced him. “Is it because of the eyes?”



Dr. Sokolov stared at me for a moment, then he nodded.



“Oh, geez,” Dr. Bennet sighed. “You guys! It’s a preserved mummy. Don’t get all superstitious on us.”



Dr. Kuznetsova had the final say: “I’m in charge here, and we’re going to excavate the specimen. I don’t know what has happened to your scientific curiosity, but make sure it’s back by the morning. Let’s head to camp.”



The camp was a squat, concrete building many miles away from the nearest town, previously used by researchers and archaeologists such as ourselves. We had amenities; there was no ‘roughing it’ or ‘making things work.’ None of us were Indiana Jones. We were college-educated assholes poking around in ancient ice. People where people shouldn’t be. 



The Arctic Circle was an alien landscape to me. In the summer, the sun lingers over the Earth, prolonging sunsets by hours. On the Summer Solstice, there’s a phenomenon called Midnight Sun. It hangs above the horizon for 24 hours straight. No respite. The Summer Solstice was only one day away when I slipped into that subterranean chamber and discovered the corpse. The extended sunlight gave me the disorienting impression that I’d been living the same day for weeks—when it didn’t set at all, I thought we’d all go a little insane.



That last night, I dreamed about the corpse in the cave.



The dream followed the same events that had happened earlier that day; me, walking around ignorantly on thin ice, me falling, me trailing my hand along the wall until it came to rest over the corpse’s face. That terrible, unnatural warmth I’d felt. It spread up my arm and into my shoulder and throughout my chest until…nothing. Darkness. When  I awoke, I sat up straight and found I was drenched in sweat despite the cool temperature. What lingered in the absence of sleep was a feeling rather than a memory: loneliness. *Isolation.* 



In the morning, when we convened, I noticed it instantly: the four of them looked exhausted. Food went untouched, coffee unpoured. No one wanted to eat breakfast before launching into what could be the biggest day of our lives.



“You’re looking pretty rough, Bennett,” Dr. Carter teased.



She rolled her eyes. “*I’m* looking rough? You look terrible, too! In fact, all of us look pretty fucking sorry.”



There was a heavy silence that vacuumed around us as we studied each other’s pale, hung faces. We looked like victims of government torture.



“Did anyone else have a nightmare?” I asked.



Four faces lit up at me. Grateful, almost, that I’d been the one to say it. Rather unexpectedly, Dr. Kuznetsova nodded and spoke next: “Yes, but I can’t recall what it was about. It just left me feeling… I don’t know the right word. Empty.”



“Alone,” Dr. Carter said.



Dr. Bennett hummed in agreement. “Yeah, I… I felt that, too. Not *just* lonely…*deserted*. Like you’d all left me here by myself or something, and I knew I’d never see anyone again.”



Dr. Sokolov said: “It’s because of that *thing* you found, Dr. Collins.” 



My jaw unclenched to speak—to *defend* myself—but I couldn’t. I agreed with him. I agreed with everyone. I could feel the presence of something all around us; whether it was group psychosis or supernatural, the corpse was affecting us. My hand felt warm again.



“Look, we all had nightmares,” Dr. Kuznetsova said. “Big deal. You all can cower inside, or you can make a name for yourselves. Let’s be reasonable.”



So we went. Would you do any different? Cynicism tends to override all other emotions, especially in the academic community. We wouldn’t have all this marvelous technology and knowledge if others had let fear outweigh curiosity. Even if I trembled and my heart beat irregularly as we approached the cave, I would go in. I would have no choice.



We came again with tools and other equipment to make the excavation. We hoped to have it out by sunset, giving us around fifteen hours to work. As the truck broke through the trees and out into the iced area where I’d fallen, my chest tightened. I felt like I was being pushed toward an unknowable oblivion. 



We stood in a circle around the hole in the ice, looking down into the cave. 



“Well, Ava,” Dr. Carter said, gesturing in my direction. “It’s your crime scene.”



I peered inside. “I don’t think I can climb down there first. Not with my ankle.”



For a moment, we all stood around, not moving. It occurred to me that no one wanted to be the first to go inside. Even Dr. Kuznetsova, our supposed leader, didn’t make a move toward the ladder. She swirled at the ice with the toe of her boot, apparently fascinated by the motion. Dr. Bennett looked behind us at the tree line. Dr. Sokolov stood with his eyes closed.



Dr. Carter just stared at me.



“Well?” I said.



“Okay, I guess I can go first,” he said. He hesitated, looking around at all of us once again. He wanted someone else to volunteer. No one met his eye, so he bent, gripped the ladder, and started to descend below the ice.



“No, I’ll go first.”



Dr. Carter reversed his trajectory. He was up and out in an instant, making way for Dr. Sokolov to climb down first. I watched the man’s face as he moved toward the hole. He was perspiring. Even in this cold, he was *perspiring.* I could almost smell it on him as he passed by me—the sharpness of his adrenaline. 



There’s a story everyone hears when they’re introduced to Dr. Alexei Sokolov. Picture this: a young Alexei, fresh from university with the degree of his dreams, deep in the wilderness north of St. Petersburg. He’s gone there to camp because that’s what he does on his vacations. He roughs it. One morning he’s gathering firewood—then a bear attacks. Take one guess at who came out of that battle alive. 



This same man looked as scared as a child when he descended into the hole. 



He moved slowly and checked over his shoulder several times. Each footstep was gentle, hardly causing any noise on the rusty metal rungs. When Dr. Sokolov finally reached the bottom, the ladder disappeared from view.



“Alexei!” we cried at once, getting on our knees to look inside. There was no trace of him. The light illuminated an empty circle of snow. To me, it almost looked as if there had never been a ladder or a professor there. There was silence in the wake of our desperate pleas for his attention. 



Then Alexei Sokolov stepped into the spotlight and turned his face up at us. “I will not allow you to remove it from the rock. If you want to come down, you cannot bring the drills.”



Dr. Kuznetsova practically spit on him. “What! What the fuck are you talking about, Alexei?”



“No drills,” he repeated. “We cannot release it from the rock.”



“You’re being crazy, man!” Dr. Carter said.



“Am I?” He paused for a moment, turning around to look deeper into the cave. Toward the corpse. Dr. Sokolov stared down that passage for an awkward amount of time before returning his attention to us. “Dr. Collins?”



I felt my jaw trembling. Eyes turned toward me. To go with my instinct, or to appease the majority in the name of discovery? We all had a lot riding on this expedition; published papers meant good money. No one could deny that. Not to mention the sort of fame that would come with this discovery. We’d be in magazines, on talk shows, perhaps even in museums. But we hadn't told anyone of the discovery yet. Nor would we ever. 



Dr. Sokolov’s pleading glare rendered me speechless. This was the same man who faced a bear and survived. Superstitious? I don’t think so. 



“I think you’re right, Dr. Sokolov.”



Dr. Kuznetsova pushed me away from the hole. “I think perhaps Ava hit her *head* as well as her ankle. Alexei, we’re coming down with the tools. Put the damn ladder back, will you? You’re just embarrassing yourself.”



“No. You’ll have to jump if you intend to bring those tools.”



“For God’s sake! Did anyone bring a spare ladder?”



Dr. Bennett shook her head. “No, that’s it. There’s no sense in arguing here, Dr. Kuznetsova. Let’s just go down without the tools and do what we can.” She said it loud so Dr. Sokolov could hear. What he *couldn’t* hear was Bennett handing a drill to Carter, which he quietly tucked inside his backpack.



I grabbed his arm and lowered my voice to a whisper. “I hope you don’t intend to use that.”



“Can’t hurt to have it just in case you nutcases change your minds,” he replied, wrenching his arm free. “Come on, Ava. Be an adult.”



When Dr. Sokolov put the ladder back, I was the last to climb. Dr. Bennett aided me during the latter half of the journey, ensuring I wouldn’t have to put too much pressure down on my twisted ankle. She put her arm around me, and I leaned on her as we made our journey down the tunnel. 



The air grew warmer as we approached. By the time we reached the corpse, Dr. Carter had removed his thick outer coat and deposited it on the cave floor. As the space became illuminated by our lanterns, we saw clearly that the snow had melted in a semi-circle around the corpse. It was radiating heat.



“That’s impossible,” Dr. Bennett noted. “It’s so *warm.*”



Dr. Carter placed his hand flat on the wall next to the corpse’s head. “Maybe there’s volcanic activity here, and the air is coming from deeper underground. I mean, *that’s* possible, right?” 



“It’s not likely,” Dr. Kuznetsova said.



Dr. Sokolov met my eye. He stood as far away from the corpse as possible in the small space, his back touching the opposite wall. I’d been in that spot the previous day when I first encountered the thing. He said: “How can you all still deny this? Volcanic activity… that’s *stupid*.”



“Well, if you’re so fucking scared,” Dr. Carter said, approaching him in a threatening manner, “Why don’t you go wait in the truck, huh?”



Dr. Sokolov glared. “You’re nothing more than an insolent child, and your ignorance is going to get you killed.”



“Oh, Jesus! He’s proselytizing! Someone *stop* him.” Dr. Carter stuck out his tongue, then took off his backpack and let it drop to the ground. “Listen, Dr. Sokolov, I respect you a lot, but we can’t let superstition get in the way of this discovery. It’s just a dead body. It’s not going to hurt you.”



“Dr. Carter is right,” Dr. Kuznetsova said. “Let’s do what we can, shall we? No more wasting time on petty arguments. We’re a team. Let’s act like one.”



Dr. Carter backed away from Dr. Sokolov. The air was still fraught with tension, but we turned our attention instead to the corpse in the wall. It was wet, as if it too had started to perspire in the heat. Logic told me it was melting ice, which meant we had a limited amount of time to do what we needed before the body lost its integrity.



I faced the thing and met its impossible eyes. They glistened in our lamplight, the melted ice giving the otherwise dead face a lively look. Like it was crying.



We all stood, staring, not speaking. 



Hypnotized.



After a while Dr. Carter chuckled, dispelling the thick silence. “God, that thing *is* creepy, isn’t it?” He looked around at us. “We’re really wasting our time here.”



“Well put,” Dr. Kuznetsova said, digging in her bag. She retrieved a digital camera, and she turned it on. Flicked on the flash. Held it up, aimed, and an explosion of light momentarily blinded us as she took the photo.



The corpse’s eyes snapped in her direction.



“*Fuck!”* she cried, stumbling backward. The rest of us similarly pressed ourselves up against the opposite wall, shouting incoherently over one another. 



It didn’t move again.



“See!” Dr. Sokolov shouted, flinging an accusatory finger out at the rest of the team. “Do you see it now?!”



Dr. Carter peeled himself from the wall of the cave. He took a moment to smooth out his coat and hair. “Yeah, *freaky.* But there's an explanation. The ice around it is melting, so… maybe the eyes are slipping out of their sockets.”



“No. It finally *noticed* us.”



Dr. Kuznetsova looked down at her camera, then up at Dr. Carter. She repeated this gesture a few times, her face contorting. She looked at the corpse. At the camera. At Dr. Carter. Finally, she said: “Perhaps there *is* something strange about the eyes.”



“It’s not normal,” I replied. It had been difficult to find my voice in the presence of the corpse. It felt wrong to speak ill of it when it was *right there.* “Its eyes should be gone. Not even mummification could preserve them like this. I think we should leave!”



“*Leave!”* Dr. Carter roared. “My *God!* What the hell is wrong with you four? Ava, you had the privilege of being the one to discover this, and what? You’re too much of a baby to do anything with it?” He paused and glared at each one of us, shaking his head. “Well, if you’re all so scared, then why don’t I just do it myself?”



“Don’t,” I pleaded. “Please don’t touch it.”



Dr. Carter grinned. “You’re all going to see how ridiculous this is.” He reached into his backpack and removed the drill.



Dr. Sokolov was on him in an instant. He thrust Dr. Carter against the wall and pinned him there, the drill clattering to the floor between them. Dr. Bennett ran forward to intervene, but a wild swing from Dr. Carter connected with her face and sent her stumbling back. She cradled her jaw, cursing at them. I stepped forward, unsure if I could retrieve the drill before anyone could stop me. My ankle screamed with pain. I stayed back, helpless to do anything but watch their struggle.



“STOP!” Dr. Kuznetsova shouted. “ENOUGH! Get *away* from each other!”



Dr. Sokolov landed a hard punch into Dr. Carter’s stomach. The latter doubled over, moaning. He sank to his knees, head hung. Dr. Sokolov kicked the drill down the tunnel, where it cascaded into a pile of snow, out of sight. Anxious breaths filled the air.



“We’re leaving now,” Dr. Sokolov commanded. “And we are *not* coming back.”



Dr. Bennett drew herself to her feet. Blood smeared from a cut on her lip. “Fuck you guys! I can’t believe we’re going to let this go to waste.”



“We *can’t*,” Dr. Kuznetsova argued.



Dr. Sokolov pointed at the corpse. “Are you going to touch it, then? Hm?”



She stared at it, then slowly, she shook her head. She tucked the camera back into her bag and zipped up her coat. Frowned. “We’ll discuss this somewhere else. Let’s go.”



He did it when we started to move for the ladder. Just as I had turned my back, I heard two wet *ssshhhhllllleeeeepppps.* The sound of Dr. Carter digging out the corpse’s eyes with his bare hands. His gloves were deposited at his feet, and he was knuckle-deep in the corpse’s left eye socket. He turned and held them aloft. “Look. No harm done.”



Blood began to pour from the corpse’s empty eye sockets, and its arm shot out of the wall and latched onto Dr. Carter’s wrist.



I ran.



\*\*\*



My ankle made it difficult to move. In the chaos, I’d run deeper into the tunnel. I collapsed against the wall, choking on the cold air. Pain throbbed up and down my affected leg. I couldn't go on—if I were being chased, it was over. Yet once my heart settled and my breathing steadied, I greeted nothing but silence. There was no tearing of flesh, agonized screaming, or sounds of a struggle. 



I cursed my cowardice. If only I stayed. If only I ran for the ladder instead. If only I could have prevented all this by not venturing too far out onto the ice. If only I’d died in that first fall instead of living long enough to discover the terrible corpse.



Outside, the sun would not set. I imagined the blazing red orb lingering above the horizon, bathing all beneath it in an ethereal fire. The Summer Solstice. The Midnight Sun. Here I was, trapped beneath the ice. Not sure of what awaited me on either end of the tunnel. Should I continue forward, potentially becoming lost in a labyrinth of ice until my eventual death? Isolation—it struck me deeply. I’d die underground, alone. Far from anything I’d ever known. 



Or I could move forward and face what awaited me. The devil you know.



I drew myself to my feet and limped back the way I came.



\*\*\*



The watery reflections of the ice danced on the floor of the alcove. It was mesmerizing. The Midnight Sun beamed down heavenly shades of red and orange into the hole where I’d first fallen, blanketing the tunnel in a bloody hue. 



I was frozen in place as I surveyed the carnage. They were fused into the wall. Three of them. Dr. Kuznetsova’s back faced me, her face entirely engulfed by the rock. Dr. Bennett must have been on her knees when it happened, and she too was awkwardly frozen, halfway in and halfway out. Finally, Dr. Sokolov. He looked as if he’d put up no fight this time. It was no bear he faced. He was merely standing when it happened, his arms at his sides. The look on his face was stoic. Defeated. 



The corpse remained, its wall no longer empty but decorated with the bodies of my colleagues. A glint of red sunlight reflected off its eyes. Green ones, not blue ones.



Dr. Carter was lying on his back before it, eyes missing. Body discarded to the side as if it were not needed any longer.



The corpse turned its new eyes toward me.



No longer alone.
