Nothing but flickering light poles rising out of the fog. Was this the right theater? I sat in my car, taking another look at the flyer. 

**Come one, come all! Don't miss the premiere of The Burning Woman - the horror film critics are calling "the scariest thing you'll see all year." This Friday, October 3rd. Be a witness. Be a believer.**

"110 Willow Creek Drive," I mumbled, reading the address on the bottom right -- precisely where the GPS brought me. The neon sign burned blue and purple, drawing me in like a moth to a flame. I stepped out, a soft mist pooled around my feet, the sky painted with moonlight. 

To say this theater was trapped in the nineties was an understatement. The teal, purple, and pink geometric shapes on the wall was straight out of Saved by the Bell, and muffled synthwave played from the speakers. I stepped inside, smells of buttery popcorn wafting in the air, whirrs flowing out of the arcade. 

"Hi. One for The Burning Woman, please." I smiled at the guy behind the booth, a droopy-eyed employee bored out of his wits. 

"That'll be 18.50." 

*Seriously?* I pursed my lips and slid him the money. This was the premiere, after all. Which begged the question: "Where is everyone?" I asked. "This is 110 Willow Creek, isn't it?" 

A rippp sliced through the air as he swiped the ticket from the printer. "That's right. You're just a bit early." I glanced at my watch: Eleven-thirty PM, half an hour before showtime. 

"And the other showings?" 

"We're only showing this tonight." A lopsided smile swept across his lips, accentuating a crescent scar on his right cheek. "It's a very special screening." 

"I see." 

The man asked, "Are you waiting on anyone?" 

I shook my head. "I just moved here from Denver. I was out hiking at Flat Iron yesterday, and I saw the flyer on the trail. Since I have nothing better to do..." I shrugged. "Here I am." 

The truth was, I needed something, *anything* to take my mind off of what happened. Her scream; that shrill, blood-curdling cry for help was seared into my brain. Red aspen. Steep cliffs. Red aspen. Steep cli-- 

I shook the memory away. 

"Denver?" He whistled. "You're a long way from home. Tell me, how does Copper Creek compare to the big city?" 

A couple strolled inside, a blonde in a pink designer coat and a muscled man with sunglasses on who seemed more like a bodyguard than her boyfriend. 

"Well, um. I love the outdoors," I said. "It's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle." 

"Isn't that wonderful. Well, Auditorium Twelve is to your left." He stuck his hand out, but when I went to grab my ticket, he clamped down and said, "You know what happened in there, don't you?" 

"In where?" 

"Auditorium Twelve." 

My eyes narrowed. "No. What?" 

He scoffed, empty chasms for eyes, then released his grip. 

"Enjoy the show," he said. 

*What the hell?*

Before I could question him further, the couple shoved me aside and ordered their tickets. The girl leered her eyes my way. Heat bubbled in my upper chest, and if I were the old Autumn, this Insta-perfect couple would've gotten a verbal lashing. New-and-improved me, however, chose to grit my teeth and walk away. 

I headed toward the snack bar. The rattling of a popcorn machine greeted me---pop, pop, popping, while a slushie machine whirled beside it. Out of nowhere, it began to sputter
and leak blue goop on the floor, spilling out profusely with no end. 

A wiry, frizzy-haired employee ran to the scene. Armed with a bucket and mop, he cleaned up the mess while huffing, "Shit, shit, shit!" 

I suppressed a laugh. "Need a hand?" 

"Nope, I'm good!" He nearly slipped as he battled the phantom slush machine, blue staining his Century Cinemas t-shirt. This seemed to be a regular occurrence, judging by the way he finessed switches in the back. With a final gurgle, the leak stopped. 

"See?" He heaved a sigh. "Nothing to worry about." 

"Does that happen a lot?" 

"You'd be surprised." He wiped blue dots from his already-freckled face. For a skittish little dweeb, he was actually pretty cute. "So, what can I get for you?" 

I tapped my chin. 

"I'll have a Fanta and a box of Raisinets." 

"A woman of culture," he quipped. While pouring the soda, he asked, "Have we met before?" 

"I don't think so." 

"Hmm, you're probably right. I pride myself in knowing most of the folks that come through those doors. Small town and all. You must be new here, I'd definitely remember your face." 

I blushed. "Guilty. I moved here last week." 

"Let me guess, you go to Willow Barr Institute?" 

Two for two. 

"Is it that obvious?" I said. 

Despite being a small town of five thousand with only a handful of traffic lights, Copper Creek was home to a notable art school founded by Willow Barr, a local artist whose works became world-renowned. The institute drew in students from around the nation, and apparently, with my oval glasses, floral
shirt, and corduroy pants, I stood out as one. 

"In a good way." He slid my order over. "My name's Jonathan." 

"Autumn. Nice to meet you." I shook his hand, sticky from the slurpie attack. 

"Sorry about that." He wiped his palm. 

"Can I ask you something?" 

"Shoot." 

"Auditorium Twelve," I said. Instantly, the shine on his face faded. "What's wrong with it?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"The guy at the ticket booth. He, um, said something happened in there." 

"Who, Larry?" He gave a dismissive pssh. "The guy just likes to mess with people. You know, rile them up before a horror movie. I wouldn't worry about it." 

"Really?" 

"Hand to God." He gestured. "One time, he told people not to eat from the popcorn machine 'cause flesh eating amoebas were going around. This was during the screening of Cabin Fever in Space." 

I held in another laugh. 

"Ahem." An irked voice hit the nape of my neck. I turned to see the couple, their arms crossed. The girl said, "You two gonna chit chat all night?" 

The fervor returned to my chest, but I pushed it down and said, "Sorry. I'll get out of your way." 

She made a shooing motion with her hand. "You do that." Her boyfriend swung his arm around her, a proud look on his face. I sipped my Fanta and walked away, hearing them sound off their order. Mr. and Mrs. Plastic weren't worth it. Having been around similar types, I learned not to let their brand of misery drag me down. 

LED lights in the hall buzzed and flickered. I looked at my ticket: Auditorium Twelve. I could still picture his face, the guy at the booth. The way his cheek twitched upon saying "Enjoy your show." I rubbed my forearms and exhaled. "It's just a pre-movie prank," I thought. Get it together, Autumn. 

After rounding the corner, the auditorium came into view. I walked in and exited the tunnel, and curiously, someone was already there. The person sat in the furthest row in the back, wearing a gray hoodie, head tilted down. The dimmed lights made it hard to see their face. I walked up the stairs, finding my seat in a lower section. 

I could've sworn there were no other cars when I pulled up. Wasn't I the first one here? The urge to turn around hit me, but I resisted. 

I shoved some Raisinets in my mouth, watching local ads pop up on-screen. "Need to decorate your cabin? Call Bo's Taxidermy. We have deer, wolves, bobcats, you name it!" "Looking for artisan carvings? Look no further than Wynn Woodworks. From hand-crafted furniture to stylish decor, your home will win -- with Wynn Woodworks." 

A wave of goosebumps flared on my neck. An icy, bitter chill, alerting me that I was being watched. *He's watching you,* my intuition warned. *The guy in the hoodie.* I was moments from turning around, when a large countdown appeared on-screen, buzzing with static. 

**FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO...**

There was a scene of a quiet forest, red and gold aspens in the background. I sat up, eyes wide. A gust of wind swayed the autumn canopy like a maestro conducting an orchestra. Hypnotic. Familiar. Then, a hiker with brown curls appeared, trekking by herself. 

My stomach twisted. It wasn't just any hiker, it was me. My Highlander backpack, striped leggings, purple water bottle. There was no mistaking it. I was watching myself on-screen as if someone had recorded me from afar, skulking between the trees, zooming into my face. 

I rubbed my eyes. 

"What the f--" 

The snobby couple walked in, breaking my gaze. And when I looked up, the local ads had returned, leaving no trace of the inexplicable scene. My cheeks were red hot, my pulse going into overdrive. 

Did I imagine all of that? 

The couple sat a row ahead of me, and a minute later, three more moviegoers entered, boys no older than sixteen. They were throwing popcorn at each other and filling the gloomy auditorium with their banter. They were in the same row as the couple, and before they sat down, one of them---a gym shirt-wearing jock with shaggy TikTok hair---sent a cheeky wink in my direction. 

I nearly barfed my Fanta. It was hard to believe that only three years ago, I was one of them -- a teenager. I looked back on my high-school days like a war vet reminisced about combat. TikTok guy sat down, snickering with his friends. As  he did, I focused on a moon-shaped scar on his neck, similar to the one Larry had. 

Jonathan, the messy-haired dweeb from the snack bar, walked in with a bucket of popcorn. 

"Hey." He sat beside me. "You forgot this." 

"Uh, I didn't order that." 

"You didn't?" He placed it on my lap. "Oh well. It's yours now." 

My shoulders tensed. Responding to flirty gestures was never my strong suit. "Shouldn't you be out there?" I said. 

"Meh, it's a slow night. Plus, I wanted to say sorry about," he nodded at the couple and muttered, "*them.* They were being total wank stains." 

"Wank stains?" 

"Mhmm. Total butt munches." 

I chuckled. "It's not your fault." 

"You see, that's Sydney Barr and her boyfriend. They walk around like they own the joint. Well, technically, her family does own the theater, along with everything else in town." 

"Hang on. Barr? As in Willow Barr?" 

Jonathan nodded. "That's her grandfather. The Barrs live in that huge mansion in Lakeview Forest. Nice to know where your tuition ended up, huh?" 

Many rumors surrounded Willow, the prolific artist turned philanthropist. Everything from the Illuminati to Faustian bargains to achieve his fame and glory. I, for one, believed Willow's artwork spoke for itself. 

"Listen." I looked up at the screen, a shiver rippling through me. "Something happened before you came in. Something strange." 

"What?" 

"This is gonna sound insane, but I saw myself on-screen. It was me, hiking at Flat Iron yesterday. Same clothes, trekking gear, everything." 

His brows furrowed. "You saw this just now?" 

"Yes. I swear I'm not crazy. Could someone be messing with the reels?" 

"That's not possible." 

"Why not?" I asked. 

"We switched over to digital a few years ago, and everything is computer-controlled. We just let the program run by itself." He nodded his head at the projection booth, a beam of light shooting out. 

"There's no one up there?" 

"Nope." 

I rubbed my temples in frustration. "I... I guess I could have been seeing things. It just felt so real." 

"Look, is this about what Larry said?" Jonathan asked. "Don't let him get to you, there's nothing wrong with this auditorium. Just sit back and enjoy the movie." His calming tone pacified my nerves. "Anyways, I better get back before Larry sees that I'm gone. Meet me in the lobby after?" 

"Okay." 

He slinked out just as two people entered; an elderly woman with a cane, lumbering with ginger steps, and a middle-aged  brunette in a wool shawl. The boys snickered as the old lady passed by, mocking her hunchedback walk, muttering snarky comments.

"Come on, mom. We're almost at our seat," said the brunette, helping her mother along. Moments after they sat down, the auditorium darkened and the previews rolled. I zipped up my coat after a draft kissed my neck, an icy chill creeping along my skin. A jumpscare-filled trailer about a killer at a Catholic boarding school had the teens riled up, one of them cupping their hands and shouting, "Get that bitch!" 

His friends cackled. 

The blonde was hiding in the crook of her boyfriend's arm, shielding her face from the screen. Surprisingly, the mother-daughter duo hardly flinched like they were watching a tame Hallmark original. As for me? *Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.* My heart drummed inside my chest, shortening my gulps of air. Not from the previews, but from the dread I had after seeing myself on-screen. 

Was it all in my head? If someone was actually recording me yesterday, that also meant they saw what I did. They must've heard the screams... echoing in the forest. Red aspen. Steep cliffs. Red aspen. Steep-- 

"Pssst," said a voice. 

I tried to ignore him at first. The TikTok guy. But no matter how much I slurped my soda and faced forward, the 'psst' kept coming. "Hey." He added a wave. "You here all alone?" 

Turn around, Broccoli Head. 

He waved again. "I know you see me." 

I sighed. "Yes." 

"You know, you could sit with us if you want." He swung his arm on the back of the seat, a smirk on his lips. "I'll be your protector." 

"I'm good." 

He leaned closer. "What's your name?" 

"Shh!" The couple hissed. 

TikTok guy flipped them off. "My name's River." 

Of course it is. 

"Look," I said. "I know you're trying to win some popularity points with your friends, but I'm here to watch the movie." 

His buddies snorted at my response. "For sure. That's what we're all here for," said River. "I just heard this movie is really scary. Like, shit-your-pants terrifying. If you need someone's hand to hold, mine is available." 

"Hey, kid. You mind shutting the hell up?" said the blonde's boyfriend. 

River sneered. "Mind your own business, asshole." 

The man stood up, towering over him. "Either shut up, or I'll make you shut up." 

The teens let out sarcastic *ooohs.*

"Someone's late for their 'roid injections," River replied. His friends roared in laughter. 

"Last chance." 

"Look, dumbass. The film hasn't even started yet. Why don't you worry about that bitch of yours and leave us alone?" 

Sydney Barr, the 'bitch' in question, looked daggers at him. "Excuse me?" 

"Let me handle this, babe." Her bodyguard boyfriend lunged at River and picked him up by the collar. The auditorium fell into outright pandemonium as the other teenagers stepped in, fending him off three-on-one. I sank in my seat, watching popcorn and profanities being hurled. The mother-daughter duo--sitting one section over--shook their heads at the utter lunacy. 

"Kick their asses, baby!" Sydney yelled. 

Unbelievable. When I asked for a distraction tonight, I didn't mean *this.* I thought the further away I moved from Denver, the less nutjobs I'd encounter. 

Amidst the brawl, someone walking to my right caught my attention; a man in a gray hoodie with his head tilted down. He walked from the top section to the center of the theater, lumbering with odd, stuttering steps, as though he was in a stop motion film. A knot formed in my throat and I slicked it down like glass. 

When he reached the front of the auditorium, he turned to us and smiled. "You're all going to die." 

The boys stopped their fighting. The previews were suddenly replaced by a white screen, illuminating the hooded stranger. 

"Each and every one of you." Laughs escaped his chapped lips, his eyes red with thick blood vessels. A spine-tingling silence fell on the room. 

Sydney scoffed. "Who let this druggie in the theater?" 

"Red aspen," the man whispered, globs of saliva on his chin. "Steep cliffs." 

"I-I think that young man needs help," said the old lady. "Can someone call an attendant?" 

"The guy needs a rehab center," said Sydney. "Wait until my grandfather hears about this." 

Before any of us could react, he shimmied his hoodie off, revealing veiny skin stretched over a bony frame. What made the whole room gasp, however, were the red welts all over his torso -- big, round pustules the size of golfballs. Pustules that were twitching, like something was trying to burrow out of his
skin. I gagged, smelling what could only be described as foul, rancid meat. 

"Red aspen," he continued, but struggled to get the following words out. "Steep..." He began to retch, bending forward like he was about to hurl. "Steep--" 

My face fell. 

The man reached into his mouth and took out a small pistol, covered in chunky pulp. Cries of disgust rang throughout the auditorium. "What the fuck?" River yelled, echoing all of our thoughts at that moment. A flurry of frenzied words flooded my brain. I needed to get out. Run. Scream. Find Jonathan.

And yet, we all stood still. Prisoners to the terrifying scene before us. And as his lips parted into another smile, I knew our nightmare was only beginning. He vomited his final words, looking directly at me. "This is the only way out." He aimed the gun at his temple. 

Then, red. 

All I saw was red.
