Folks who visit me invariably ask about how dark my apartment is.  I’ll flip on the overhead lights to ease their minds, but rarely ever explain the truth to them.  I’ll just say, “I’m sensitive to light” or “I’ve always enjoyed the dark more than the light.”  They drop it, but already their words have brought to mind the scariest five years of my life.  

I was dating at the time and, as expected, she made passing comments about how dark my apartment was.  My response at the time was a quick joke about secretly being a vampire and we laughed.  For the random nights she spent at my place, this darkness was fine.  When I slept over at her apartment, I would have the hardest time drifting to sleep; her nightlight’s dim light creeping around the floor attracted my eyes in ways that I wasn’t used to.  I would wake up from restless sleeps and, when pressed, I told her it was the light.  “My parents raised me to enjoy the dark, so the light distracts me and keeps my mind working overtime.” 

She said the same thing about the darkness in my apartment. If we were going to make this work, one of us would need to give in.  Eventually I was the one who worked on making those changes.  I started at my place by leaving a light on a few rooms away … letting just a sliver of light dance into my room at night.  The longer I practiced, the closer I could bring the light until finally there was a nightlight in my room and another just down the hall.  Further helping me, I made sure they were nightlights sensitive to the dark; that is, there was a sensor that would control how much light they gave off depending on how dark the area immediately around them was.  This allowed for ambient moonlight to keep the nightlight from full intensity.  

She noticed the light and that was when the plans for living together took shape.  It only took a couple months before she moved in.  Her nightlight (with a slight cover as a compromise to limit its brightness) was placed in the bedroom.  My two nightlights were placed in the bathroom just beside our bedroom and the hallway.  With this setup, she fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow and I could follow within a half-hour.  On the darkest nights, when my nightlights would be shining their brightest, I learned that throwing in an earpod and putting on some dark rainy sounds was all I needed.  

It took two years before we noticed anything strange happening with my lights, though neither of us were sure nothing happened during those first two years.  Just one morning, my girlfriend said over breakfast, “your light was acting weird last night.”

“In what way?”

“I had to get up for some water and as I walked by, it got brighter - you know, my shadow - but as I passed it didn’t dim immediately.  And then as I came back to bed, it brightened before I would have gotten to it … I don’t know.  Maybe it’s just oversensitive?”

“I’ll keep an eye on it?  Wake me if it happens again.”

“You like your sleep.” 

“For you, I will wake up.”  

She smiled.  It was a good time in our relationship.

Two nights later she woke me up.  “It’s still bright.” 

Groggily I sat up and looked to the hall.  The light seemed too bright for what normally comes in through the windows, “Maybe a cloud is passing over the moon or something,” I said while getting out of bed.

Of course, as soon as I stood up the nightlight returned to its more normal level.  “See, just cloud cover or something.”

For the rest of that year, that’s all we thought it was.  Just clouds covering the lights at weird moments.

By year 3, though, it was happening in the bathroom as well.  

We kept that door mostly closed, but there was very little to mess with the light-sensor for that nightlight.  Even so, we saw it fluctuating.  After the first night of it, I changed lightbulbs, thinking maybe that was finally giving out.  That night, though, the light fluttered like crazy.  As if someone was passing their hand over the sensor bar and making it pitch black, then returning to ambient light, then back to black and so on and so forth.  Finally the light stopped fluttering … but just about 30 second later - the time it takes to move from the bathroom to the hall - the hall nightlight brightened.  We stared at each other.  “What does this mean?”  “Is there someone in the house?”  “I didn’t see anyone.”  “Should we call someone?”  “Who would we call?” … 

Whether it was nerves or just an automatic response, we looked at each other and said, “Ghostbusters?” and giggled.  The tension was cut for that evening.  

A couple of nights later the same thing happened.  We stared at the brightening light, watched it dim, watched the hall nightlight brighten, and held the blanket up to our chins.  We shivered the rest of the night despite the sweat from the warm blankets.  

The night after, we started to expect the weird phenomenon to occur again.  The return to normalcy distracting us more than the weird fluctuations we expected to see.  A flutter of a nightlight had one of us poking at the other and pointing, but nothing like the night before.   

Over breakfast, bleary-eyed, we wondered if this was limited to those two lights; a defect of sorts.  My girlfriend thought getting more could solve that problem, “And also, maybe, show us if it’s only those two locations where this happens.” 

I was less certain, “Dop you want to invite this phenomenon further into the house?  It’s already in our bathroom and hallway.”

“We don’t know that.  Those are just the only places we’ve seen it.”

“And that’s enough for me.” 

Despite my protests, with a week power strips were daisy chained throughout the hallway with multiple light sensitive nightlights plugged in.  

As if called, we saw something the very night these strips were plugged in.  

I was on the couch angry at the addition of the nightlights.  My head was turned as far from the hallway as I could get it, but even so I could still tell when the hallway brightened.  It started from the area closest to me and walked down to the bedroom.  “Did you see that?” my girlfriend yelled and then, “it’s in the bathroom.”  Her voice was at that line between frightened and excited.  I couldn’t speak.  “It just left,” but she didn’t need to say anything, because I could see the nightlights in the hallway begin to brighten.  Exactly as if something was walking.

Because of how she set up the lights, we saw something we hadn’t seen before.  Whatever was casting the shadow paused halfway down the hall.  The lights wavered; the thing was swaying back and forth as if deciding which way it wanted to move.  I had sat up by this point to see the full hallway.  From the reflection of the lights, I could catch a glimpse of my girlfriend’s eyes.  We watched the show in front of us … and then all of the lights dimmed before flickering back to “normal.”  Whatever it was left the hallway? Disappeared? The two of us never fully figured out the best way to describe this vanishing act of something that we couldn’t see in the first place.  

We stared down the hallway for what felt like minutes.  Whether we were willing the reappearance or the continued absence is debatable (and possibly different between the two of us), but there was some energy traveling down the hall between us through our eyelines.  I shivered despite the sweat beading up along my forehead.  I assumed the same was happening to her, but neither of us dared go down that hallway that night.  Whether the thing was there or not, we were too scared to tempt fate.  

Instead, we stared down the hallway until the sun rose.  

Nothing happened during the next couple of nights.  I thought that was worse, she was happy to know that nothing moved down the hall and into our bathroom.  Eventually she bought more of the light sensitive nightlights and put them throughout the apartment.  Just walking through what had been my home was now a lightshow.  I took to wearing sunglasses inside to deal with all the changing lights.  My girlfriend was happy with the increased light.  She had told me too often that I liked the dark too much and needed more light in the apartment. 

By the time two weeks passed with no incident, she had started talking as if she wanted the phenomenon or the entity (whatever it truly was) to return.  She stayed up in anticipation, I stayed up in a light-flooded haze of dread.  I started seeing light fluctuations during the day, but that could have been my own sleep deprivation playing tricks on me.  I knew not to trust my eyes.  Just walking down the street I would see the sun brighten and dim, then the traffic lights would brighten and dim, then my own dashboard would brighten and dim.  

My girlfriend’s wish eventually came true.  

We were both in bed, but I was not asleep.  I saw the nightlights in the hallway brighten and knew what was coming.  Through the hallway, into the room, paused by the bed (her side, as if it knew who was summoning it) then to the bathroom.  By the time it made it to the bathroom, my girlfriend had woken up and there was a strange smile crossing her face.  I didn’t know what scared me more, her smile or the lights signaling something walking the apartment.  The bathroom nightlight faded, and again the bedroom lights started brightening; more importantly, the lights by her side of the bed brightened.  Her eyes turned full black, as if something was blocking her irises from the lights.  

She gasped.

I shot out of bed and over her into the empty space between her and the brightening nightlights.  All I felt was intense cold; so intense that I fell to the ground with my muscles cramped.  

She gasped again.

Then the lights moved out of the bedroom and down the hall.  I could feel the ambient heat returning to my body by the time the last nightlights in the hall brightened.  Then all the lights returned to normal.  

By the time we lived there for four years, the visits were happening weekly.  They always had a lingering presence along whatever side of the bed she was sleeping on.  The rare nights that I slept through the visit (and very rare those nights were), I would wake with scratch marks along my arms and blood stains on the bed.  Those days she woke happier than usual.  

As we approached what would be our last year together, I started sleeping less.  Partially for health - my arms were so scratched from the nights I crashed that I wondered how many folks assumed they were track marks - and partially wondering what my  girlfriend was getting from this entity.  By this point, light sensitive nightlights had been placed throughout the house.  I flinched when a cloud covered the sun at the change in light.  Flashing lights at street signals started to paralyze me.  Moving through the apartment was a cavalcade of bright and dim and bright and dim and the pattern burned into my retinas so deeply that I continued to see it outside the apartment.  

With the difference in sleep patterns, of course our relationship was on the rocks.  I started blaming the nightlights and her fascination with this thing she seemed to be inviting to our living space.  Things came to a head when one night I waited until she was asleep before unplugging all the nightlights and plunging the apartment back to glorious darkness.  The immense weight of stress and exhaustion hit me as I pulled the last power strip of lights out and I just crashed to the floor and slept the soundest I ever slept.  

She was furious the next morning.  

We started taking turns sleeping in other people’s houses.  When  we both slept together, the nightlights would be on, but I would wear a sleep mask.  As a compromise, she did at least remove some of the nightlights.  On the nights that I was at other people’s houses, I would “see” a nightlight flickering in a hallway.  “That’s just so you can find your way to the bathroom if you need to get up in the middle of the night,” the hosts would say.  I would stare at that light all night long.  Sometimes I swear it brightened even if there was no light sensor on it.  I was always cold when the light shifted in intensity.

Our last night together still haunts me.

I can sense the events happening right now as I think about it.

We were at a full moon, with a cloudless night that revealed more stars than usual.  Even without the nightlights on, we could clearly see the room and hallway.  This illumination just made our first revelation that much clearer.  For we saw power strips being plugged in.  And we heard the extra nightlights that we had taken away being plugged in.  And we saw those same lights brighten.  But this time, there were two sections.  Had there always been two?  The few times I’ve let myself think about it, I could never come to a clear conclusion.  But that night, there were definitely two entities working together.  They plugged in more lights, eventually, plugging in nightlights around our bed which immediately brightened.  

She gasped, the same mixture of fear and pleasure I had heard for the last two years.  I felt a grip around my arms.  I was being pinned down and despite what I knew had to be bright lights all around the room, all I could see was intense darkness.  An intense cold enveloped my body, emanating from the grips on my arms.  As the grips tightened, the darkness took shape.  

To describe the indescribable is an exercise in futility.  I’ve tried multiple times to remember the specific shape, but it shifts in my memory, fluidly shifting from humanoid to insect to bird to rock to amorphous blob.  All I knew was, I was staring at a shadow.  

The shadow of whatever it was that had triggered all the lights in my house.  

Puncture marks appeared on my arms, poked open by the nails or claws of this shadow.  The cold coming from the grip seeped through the puncture marks and froze my muscles.  I was unable to move, even my eyes frozen to the ever-shifting shadow in front of me.  I knew there had to be light in this room; I could hear the buzzing of the nightlight bulbs as they fought to shine through the darkness.  Whatever I knew, my eyes only saw that pure absence of light.  In this trance of frozen space, there was no sense of self, no sense of time, no sense of boundaries.

I liked it. 

Infinite darkness.

Eventually I was let go.  

The darkness dissipated.

Power strips were pulled out and the apartment felt empty again. I must have gasped because my girlfriend turned to me and said, “You too?”

My eyes adjusted to the nightlights around me.  Dancing shadows floated throughout our room.  I watched them as they merged and split, reminding me of videos of amoebas surrounding and engulfing prey then splitting into two.  All of these shadows carried a horrendousness about them.  The sight of monsters forever fighting around us was now open to our eyes.  “Aren’t they beautiful?” she said.  And the floating monsters around her face transformed her visage to a sight that only reappears in nightmares.  No amount of darkness can erase that image.  No amount of darkness is worth seeing in the light.

I left the next morning and within the week wrote over the rental agreement to her name, eventually finding a smaller studio with few outlets.  Of course I left the nightlights with her.  I am adamant whenever anyone comes over that lights stay off at night.  And while I have felt the presence of something lurking in the studio apartment, the cold no longer comes with it.  The grips no longer come with it.  That darkness no longer comes with it.  Most importantly, the sight of those floating monsters no longer comes with it.

If we meet and you come to my house, eventually you’ll ask me why it’s so dark in my house.  I may say I’m sensitive to light or that I’ve always enjoyed the darkness, but if you mention this post, then I will give you the truth.

It’s easier to sleep with the possibility of monsters in the dark, than lie awake staring at their shadows in the lights.
