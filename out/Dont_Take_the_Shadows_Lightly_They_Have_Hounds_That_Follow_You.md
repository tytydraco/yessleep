My name is Caleb Wexley, name changed for privacy,

I grew up in the heart of the Mountain West. The Rockys during the winter were... Beautiful... Even moreso in the spring when the snow melted and the greenery sprang forth like a tsunami of color and fresh fragrance.

I've since moved out east, but I've always carried the experiences from my hometown in the back of my mind. Some of you might think these are fabrications, but I assure you that they are, unfortunately, very real. I grew up around Skinwalker Ridge, a famous place known for its supernatural residents.

Sure, Skinwalkers were commonplace in the forests and mountains, but they mostly kept to themselves. It was the Others that really made the area dangerous. Mostly at night. Some people called them group hallucinations, or tricks of the light. In 30 years, I've seen them far too many times for it to be such a simple explanation.

I'll tell you, first, about the Shadows that haunt the gullys and ridges around the Rocky Mountains.

They aren't particularly malevolent, but they aren't friendly by any means. They don't try to hide their presence in the corner of your eye. No... They will confront you right in front of your eyes where the shadows are darker. The way to identify a Shadow is that they have a darkness that even makes pitch black seem light in comparison. They watch, they wait, and they follow you for the rest of your life.

I can't be certain, but they seem to be harbingers of bad omens. Each time I see one, and I've seen three in my life, something bad happens to my friends or family.

The easiest way to identify a Shadow is by the base of their feet. There is a discernable circle of pitch black, almost more than what you think black could be. They're typically accompanied by what looks like a hound of some sort. Probably in the form of a large Rotweiler or Great Dane. It's hard to tell due to them being coated in the same pitch darker than midnight.

First time I saw one my friend went missing. He was a sweet kid. Always friendly, a little quirky, his tourettes didn't help his situation in school. However, at some point something changed. He began to... I don't know how to describe hit...  He'd always have this dark look in his eyes, and he always was looking over my shoulder. It was unsettling, to say the least, but I never questioned it.

One night we were having a sleepover and everything seemed normal. Pok√©mon cards were played and we watched some videos on VHS that we'd found at some flea markets. It was about 2AM when we were winding down that he started to really act differently. His skin went pale and his eyes were pinpoints despite being in the dark. He was sweating and breathing in short bursts. I followed his gaze and I saw it.

The Shadow

Seeing a black silhouette in the dark is a jarring thing. It's wrong. Your mind doesn't seem to be able to comprehend it even though it's right in front of you. It just stood there! Not saying or doing anything. At its feet was what looked like a void of even deeper black that was trying to swallow it up.

Not even a week later, my friend Brennen, went missing from his room. I've searched even 20 years later for him and found nothing. All I've been able to find is his missing person's report from that day.

The second time that I saw a Shadow I was in high school. The moment I saw it I knew what was going to happen, but I wasn't the only person that saw it. Every one of us did. We were near the Capital Building that wrapped around a gully and into a forest. We immediately fled from the scene and rarely spoke about it.

Not speaking about it didn't stop it though... Three days later our friend, Jared who was with us at the time vanished without a trace. His body was found in the gully... His limbs twisted into unnatural positions and a rictus scream locked on his face. The fluid that was crusted on his face from his eyes was black and unnatural.

I was the one that found his body while camping in the area. Since then I KNEW that I was the Shadow's target...

The Hound

Two years later, Junior year of high school I was at a friend's house. We were playing PC games in the basement for several hours. Nothing important. Maybe some STALKER and Morrowind. Lighthearted stuff, in our eyes, you know?

As we were leaving, I heard a low growl. They only had an elderly cat that stayed upstairs and hissed at me every time I tried to pet him. I love animals, I thought I got along with them. He didn't like me though.

When I heard the growl I turned my head and saw something that didn't belong. In a small crawlspace used for storage was a dog. Easily 5 feet long and jet black with bloody gouges in its hairless skin. I tried to run, I almost made it to the top of the steps, but I felt a tug and some kind of pain that wasn't superficial.

I believe I've been marked. I've moved from state to state since then ever since I graduated. I'm running from the Shadow and its Hound. I don't know how much longer I have... But I can feel those eyes seeking me from the darkness.

I've only survived this long because I think I found a deterrent!

1. Keep your room cold, they are prone to mid to high temperatures
2. Get a cat. They are averse to cats as I think they can see them and ward against them
3. For some reason, and I don't know why, they hate incense. You'd think something that looks like it's from hell is okay with smoke and doesn't care about it... They just keep their distance and watch me now as long as I have incense or a cigarette going
