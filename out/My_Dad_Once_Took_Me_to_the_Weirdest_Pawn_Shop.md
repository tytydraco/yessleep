When I was really little, something nasty got into my blood. Daddy took me to every hospital he could, until he’d run out of money.

Auntie said we should all just pray harder.

Daddy said “God let my child get leukemia. I’ll take my chances with the Devil.”

I’ve never figured out how Daddy first came across the business card. All it said was “A. Kindly,” and a phone number. No address for where the shop was, or what hours it stayed opened.

Daddy had to call to get that information. He said the voice on the other end was a woman’s.

There was no sign out front. The building wasn’t so much small as it was narrow, impossibly squeezed between a chiropractor clinic and an empty ice cream shop.

That whole part of town was sketchy. Every store window had metal bars on it, except for the pawnshop. As if the owner wasn’t scared about being robbed.

Upon stepping inside, it became clear there wasn’t much worth stealing. Maybe I’d spent more time in pawnshops than a lot of kids my age, but in my experience, shelves were usually stocked with jewelry and guns.

In this one, however, shelves were full of jars. Jars filled with formaldehyde, with bits of body parts floated inside. I could have imagined they’d come from animals, like the kind my cousins dissected in their science classes. Then I saw the jar full of fingers, and my imagination failed me.

But even that wasn’t the weirdest thing about the store. A bell rang when me and Daddy entered. A man came out from the back room to stand behind the counter. He had this black mask on—with a long bird beak. The kind of thing you’d see at a masquerade ball (or an orgy, I guess).

He wore a black top hat as well, but the rest of his outfit was colorful. Loud shades of purples and reds, like he’d taken the ends of a rainbow and crushed them together. His lips were just barely visible under his mask. He smiled. “Salutations! I’m Mr. Kindly.”

“I spoke with your assistant over the phone,” Daddy said.

“I…have no assistant,” Mr. Kindly breathed in, a sound like a crow cawing.

“There was a girl,” Daddy insisted.

“It’s just me working here.” Mr. Kindly bent his head so the whites of his eyes stood out. The way a dog looks when it’s begging or in trouble.

Daddy made a noncommittal grunt.

“What’s going on with this place?” I asked.

Daddy tried shushing me, but Mr. Kindly chuckled. “You see, child, every person in this world has something they want to get rid of, but can’t. A physical ailment, an addiction, a personality flaw, a mental compulsion, a bad memory, unwanted responsibilities, guilt, a cursed object…

“Everyone has their reason for coming here. It’s not my place to ask why. I’m merely the individual who takes away the thing that a person wants gone. All questions are answered there.” Mr. Kindly pointed to a sign on the adjacent wall.

Though I only saw the list of rules once, every word is still burnt into my memory. I doubt I’ll ever be able to forget. They went:

1.      The mission of the franchise is to cause pain and spread fear. This must be explicitly stated to all potential customers. It will be known to the public.

2.      More than one franchise may operate in the same jurisdiction. Cordiality is expected in any interactions that may occur between said franchises. The junior establishment will show deference to the senior. No employee may harm another employee, or else.

3.      The franchise’s rules are not set by any manager, worker, nor customer. Rules exist outside chronology, and thus are beyond alteration.

4.      Potential customers are encouraged to attempt to find loopholes in the franchise house rules, as it is highly entertaining to see them fail.

5.      Potential customers may phrase their offers as creatively as they wilt. No matter the syntax, however, the franchise is unable to give, only to take.

6.      There is no limit to what the franchise can take from a customer. Physical, abstract, esoteric—all are fair game.

7.      Whatever is sold to the franchise must be the solely owned property of the customer.

8.      Keep your soul to yourself. The franchise had no use for that wretched thing.

9.      Prices charged by the franchise are not set by the franchiser. They are determined by how much distress they cause the customer. Consequently, price will naturally vary from customer to customer. There is no use trying to bargain or barter over the price.

10.  Sales are nontransferable. The one making the sale must be the one to pay. Altruistic self-sacrifice on behalf of another is contrary to the previously stated goals of the franchise.

11.  All sales are final. Nothing that is removed can be returned, as it is not kept, but obliterated.

12.  All sales are confidential. No one except the seller may recall the previous state of affairs, not even the franchiser involved in the sale.

13.  The franchise ALWAYS takes its pound of flesh.

“Pain and fear?” Daddy breathed deeply. “Fine. As long as you can take away what you claim to, I’m ready to make my deal with the Devil.” There wasn’t any fear in his voice. His even tone never wavered.

“Not the Devil, actually.” Mr. Kindly put a hand to his breast. Aghast at the suggestion. “I’ve always tried to stay out of politics. I’m but a mere pawnbroker. Now, the store doesn’t take money, nor gold, nor cowry shells. Only flesh…and in return, we take something undesirable off your hands, permanently.”

“How do you stay in business?” Daddy asked.

“When the landlord comes to kick me out, I’ll disappear,” Mr. Kindly said brightly.

“Why are you wearing that mask?” I blurted out.

“Oh, I was having a party downstairs.”

“A costume party?” Daddy asked.

“Sure.”

“You’re lying,” I said.

“I’m joking,” Mr. Kindly responded. “That’s a whole other beast. The truth is somewhat embarrassing, but if it will sate your simian-like curiosity, I’ll tell you: they say dress for the job you want, not the job you have. And whoever ‘they’ are, I agree with them. And it just so happens, I love carnivals.”

“You want to work in a circus?” I asked.

“A carnival,” he corrected. “I’ve wanted to have my own since I was a boy. And that was a long time ago.”

“How long?” I asked. Before Mr. Kindly could answer, Daddy pressed ahead.

“I’ll do anything to make my baby healthy again!” Daddy’s hands came together in a gesture half prayer, half groveling. “A pound of flesh, I know what that means. Just tell me where you want it from!”

Mr. Kindly tapped his finger on Rule 7 and Rule 10. “All sales are non-transferrable. I don’t make the rules. I didn’t make this shop. *You* did. All of *you*. And I can’t leave until I’ve collected enough pounds to buy my own carnival. Little girl, it’s you who will be cured, so it’s you who must pay.”

I nodded hesitantly. “Pay what?”

“Oh, if you were a musician or painter, I might take your hands.” Mr. Kindly bent over the counter. “If you were a singer, I might take your vocal cords.” He was already tall and skinny, but the way he moved, it seemed like he didn’t have a spine. He contorted himself until his beak tapped my nose. “If you were a gourmand, I might take your tongue…”

Daddy moved between me and Mr. Kindly. “Not happening!”

“Oh, those were just hypothetical scenarios.” Mr. Kindly waved dismissively. “The franchise itself will decide the price to get clean out her blood.”

‘Franchise,’ I thought. I’d never heard the word before. ‘What does it mean?’

“The franchise refers to the store itself,” Mr. Kindly said, like he’d read my mind. He pushed open the counter’s half-door. He walked out into the main store.

I noticed that Mr. Kindly was barefoot. His toenails were long and black.

Mr. Kindly tossed aside a sheet I’d mistaken for a window curtain. Instead of a view outside, there was a mirror, from floor to ceiling. The glass was clean, but it glowed green.

“Uranium glass,” Mr. Kindly said. “Perfectly harmless, unless you eat it.” From his belt, he took out a measuring tape. Instead of numbers, there were odd shapes. Like pictures. I was later told they were hieroglyphics. “Stand here, Miss.”

I looked to Daddy. His expression was usually easy to read. Now I had no idea. He seemed frozen in place, hands shoved into his pockets.

I trotted over to the mirror. Mr. Kindly clicked his tongue as he measured the size of my head, my height, my width, all while never touching.

“Mm-hmm!” Mr. Kindly sounded happy. “Stand before the mirror.”

He stepped aside. I stared into the mirror. Something was wrong! I turned my head, then back. I hadn’t been mistaken, the mirror only reflected me, not the background.

“Don’t blink.” Mr. Kindly had sounded friendly since I’d met him. But his voice suddenly turned cold. Those two words were a stern order.

I widened my eyes, trying hard not to blink. I stood there for a minute, then two.

Mr. Kindly clapped, tucking away his tape measure. “All done.”

“What happened?” I asked.

“The franchise has decided,” Mr. Kindly said, as if that meant anything to us. “Follow me.” He led Daddy and me to the front door.

We exited the shop. Mr. Kindly looked up. His eyes scanned the sky. Like he was expecting an asteroid or plane to crash down at any moment. “All clear! I can go this far, at least.”

He led us to the ice cream parlor. It had a CLOSED sign out front. Mr. Kindly had no key. He tapped his fingernail—black and curved, like his toenails—against the key hole. The door swung open.

The insides were coated in dust. The place had no power. But Mr. Kindly came out of a freezer with a barrel of ice cream half his size. He plopped it down on the counter. “How about a treat before we make the sale? At no extra charge, naturally!” There were no cones, but he fished out some bowls from under the counter.

Mr. Kindly scooped out one bowl for me, and one for Daddy. The ice cream was Neapolitan. He hung around while we ate, sort of perching on the counter. “I’m on a liquid diet,” he explained why he didn’t make his own bowl.

I didn’t realize how hungry I felt. Something sugary really hit the spot. Mr. Kindly gave me a second helping, then washing the ice cream scoop in the sink.

Daddy’s ice cream melted. He wouldn’t eat. Mr. Kindly snatched the bowl and drank from it.

Daddy crossed his arms. “What’s going to happen?”

Mr. Kindly punched him across the face. Blood shot out of Daddy’s nose. The cartilage was broken! He fell on the cold tiles. Mr. Kindly stepped over him.

He still held the ice cream scoop. “I’m sorry to say, Miss, but this will hurt a lot. Eyes are a popular choice. But at least your father will never know. I won’t be leaving any receipts…”

Mr. Kindly grabbed me. He was strong enough to carry the ice cream tub, and to knock out Daddy with a single strike. So, he was strong enough to lift me in the air one-handed. Before he took the ice cream scoop to my eyes, Mr. Kindly tore off his mask…

To think, that horrible face was the last thing I ever saw! It was scarred, and blistered, and rotted. But worst of all—it wasn’t human.

The feel of cold metal, reaching past my eyelid to get at my corneas. Optic nerve pulled out until they finally *snapped*. And then having to experience the process all over again. All the while biting, hitting, kicking, and crying. Trying and failing to escape this demon.

Then my ears popped, and I was lying on my bed. It was morning, and Daddy was making breakfast. I smelled the bacon.

I stumbled around my bedroom. It was like I was still asleep. Everything was dark, but whenever I tried opening my eyes, it didn’t work.

According to Daddy, when I finally found him, I was born blind. But that didn’t make any sense.

“I could *too* see, Daddy!” I pouted. “The man had a suit, all red and purple, and a big top hat, and his face was covered by a black bird mask.”

“How could you know what color is?” Daddy chuckled nervously. “Did Auntie tell you about them?”

I went to the same school, but was in an entirely different class. When I was there, I tried to tell the other kids what had happened. One of the boys believed me, but everyone else just laughed. I finally stopped mentioning the pawnshop when Tyler started bullying me.

I shut down for years. For decades, I wouldn’t talk about it, or even write about it! It was about survival. A story like mine would get you sent to the funny farm. But I thought about it. Oh, every day I’ve thought about that Mr. Kindly. Every day I think about what was under that bird mask.

New experiences still prove hard for me. But when I watch a video I’d seen before making the sale, I can *almost* picture the movie in my head. Like the skin across my face were its own black screen.

I can describe exactly what’s happening on the screen to anyone watching with me. They think it’s a trick. That I have no idea what color the heroine’s gown was. They say someone sighted told me that.

Colors. That’s what I miss most about having eyes. It’s true what they say about getting blinded: your other senses enhance. Maybe I enjoy food and music more than the average person. Getting around took some years, but I’ve mastered it. In fact, I picked up a little bit of echolocation. If you happen to see me on the street, tap-tapping my cane, don’t try to help me. It’s embarrassing.

At least I don’t have gross empty eye sockets. In this new world that Mr. Kindly and I created, there’s a flap of skin over the place where my eyes would be. Daddy and Auntie insist that I was born with it.

The skin over my eyes itches most of the time. Reminding me that things used to different, though I have no proof except my memories. Memories of a world that was destroyed and restarted, every detail of the new world playing out the same, save for me not getting leukemia.

In case you’re wondering, the pawnshop isn’t there anymore. I’ve taken car rides to where I’m certain it used to be. But there’s no space between the chiropractor’s office and the ice cream parlor. I’ve felt the shared wall with my hands.

Off in the distance that day, I heard a mass of cawing. Just crows, obviously. But I was reminded of Mr. Kindly’s tortured breathing.

Okay, fine, maybe it’s the wrong spot! There’s got to be other places where a chiropractor’s office and ice cream parlor are next to each other.

But that’s not what I think. I think the pawnshop’s still somewhere out in the world. Maybe Mr. Kindly’s still running it. Maybe my eyes were the last thing he needed to buy his carnival, and some other demon’s working the franchise.

And while we’re talking about maybes, maybe you’ll stumble into a weird store one of these days. An unnamed pawnshop with organs suspended in jars, a list of bizarre rules, and a promise to remove anything from you that you can’t get rid of.

And maybe the price that’s asked will be worth it for you. Who am I to judge? I’ve lived longer blind than I would have with cancer. That being said, my price was comparatively light. Still have four perfectly working senses, and my balance.

I also had my history changed very early in my life. Imagine being an adult, and suddenly having a whole other life. There’s no guarantee your family, your friends, your spouse, or your kids would still be the same, if they even exist at all.

Not only have you lost flesh and blood, you now have to fake any interaction you have from then on. Inside jokes you don’t get. Grudges held with complete strangers. Major milestones you cannot remember. Better hope your alternate self took a lot of photos! From survivors of the franchise, it could feel less like being free of a curse, and more like suddenly stepping into the life of someone else, who just so happened to share your face…

Makes sense that lots of people couldn’t handle the change. Blindness isn’t the worst thing, but it definitely puts distance between you and others. I spend a lot of time with darkness, just wondering. And I’m sure that our mental asylums host some who paid their pounds of flesh, couldn’t keep up with the new lie, and now rant and rave in rubber rooms because they’re the only ones who can remember how the world *used to be*.

How many different jars did I see in the pawn store? At least a hundred. Each removed organ a different person who changed the world, and had the old one destroyed. Hundreds, thousands, maybe millions.

With all that eternal darkness, you’d think I would sleep better. But I stay up at night. Worrying about cosmic deeds I’ve got no control over. So, I’m breaking my silence. Telling my story. Putting out the word that if you ever happen to see a man in a black bird mask, and he offers to take something heavy off your soul, or a monkey on your back, be really, really sure your burden truly is something you can’t go on living with.

You’ve been warned.

 

P.S., I’d like to thank my friend Aaron, who listened without judgement while I dictated and typed down the words. Without him, I couldn’t share my story with you here, on the only place on the internet I think people might believe the truth. Online, the barriers of skepticism and irony people publicly build up IRL because they don’t want to be made fun of come down. The mind opens up a bit. Sometimes it gets a little too open…
