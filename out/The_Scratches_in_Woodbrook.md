Have you ever had some childhood memories that you can't quite explain? Or memories that you'd prefer to forget? Now, I know that this sounds cliche, but I have some. And I am writing this instead of writing out my college essay but, I have like a month, so I say it is pretty reasonable for me to procrastinate on it. Anyways, so, I grew up in a small little town in southern Iowa called Woodbrook. I'll split my memories up using bold headers, if you can call them headers.

**May 25-27th 2013**

I was 8 years old at this time and had just gotten off of school, I was pretty excited for the summer, which meant ice cream and playing on my ipad. Of course, my parents would be trying to drag me out of the house to go do stuff, but I really didn't want to do any of that, because from what I could remember from my reasoning, I didn't like ticks. For, what I think was, hours after school, I just watched Youtube and played games on my ipad.

By the time the sun was setting, my mom called my name for dinner, and I ran downstairs to quickly eat dinner, what transpired was my mom trying to get me to eat all my foods. As I ate, I kept looking into the forest for some reason, I don't exactly remember why, maybe I saw something or maybe I just felt compelled. Nevertheless, after eating dinner, my mom made me brush my teeth, take a bath, and then for another hour or so, I think, I played on my ipad and eventually I went to sleep.

Now, the main weird, unexplainable part of this was my dream, even now I could still remember it, as if it was just a regular memory. I was in a treehouse, speaking with my friends and an older woman. She looked to be around the age of the college students I would see throw rocks into the old creek. She just kept saying stuff to me, but I didn't understand them, she kept saying gibberish. We were all looking at a weird scratch in the floor of the treehouse, which wasn't even built back then, it looked like a trident crossed with those native American homecoming symbols. And then, I could understand what she said... It was four simple words.

*Do not trust them*

Now, I did not know what that understood, and when I had told my mom about that dream, she told me it was just that, a dream.

**October 31st 2017**

Now, I always loved Halloween and planned to trick or treat until I was 18 (If you were wondering, yes, I did trick or treat until I was 18, don't make fun of me, it was free candy, can't really argue with that), I got a costume and everything. I forgot the exact order of how this happened, it was either I went to the library first and then we got by trick-or-treat basket, or the other way around. Well, the trick-or-treat basket part is not important, so I'll omit that, at the library, I spoke to the librarian, Mr. Harburrow. Me and him had a pretty good relationship, we'd talk about stuff, I'd talk to him about school, he'd talk to me about when he was younger and used to hunt the local wildlife.

He'd always fondly mention hunting the, as he put it, "human-like racoons". I always found this weird; because, "shockingly", I have never seen a human-like racoon before. Always saw it as Mr. Harburrow's old age getting to him. He told me to be safe while trick-or-treating, citing the recent missing kids. I ignored this, yes, I know I was an absolute idiot as a kid and went to go look at some books. 

I was in a book aisle when the books started randomly falling, now, from what I could remember, the titles of the books did not spell out anything, they just fell. I then saw, now I could be remembering this wrong, but a shadow at the end of aisle, it just warped and fizzled out. I did what any reasonable kid would do and took a book, checked it out, and just left.

**November 2nd 2017**

It was Thursday, history class, and I was getting ready for the weekend. I was talking to my best friend, Ryan (To this day, we are still good friends), about all the stuff I was gonna do over the weekend. My history teacher walked up to me and told me something along the lines of, "Mike, could you take these laptops to Mr. Lewis, we're done with using them." I obliged and began walking to the computer teacher's office, which was at the end of some long hallway. On the way there, I could swear I was being followed, when I stopped, it just made the feeling worse. I looked behind me, no one.

It got to the point where I began shaking uncontrollably for reasons I don't know. The intercom turned on and began playing the same tone, an ear-piercing beep. I stopped right at his door, I couldn't go further, and then the door opened. The computer teacher looked at me and took the computers, thanking me. I asked him if he is hearing the intercom, which I vividly remember was still going off. He shook his head and asked me if I was okay. I just gave him a very shaky thumbs-up and walked back to my classroom.

**December 25th 2017**

Christmas! I was helping my mom prepare the feast. We heard something fall in the living room, and my mom told me to go check it out. I went into the living room and found that the angel we put at the top of our Christmas tree had fallen and was face down. Oh well, I'll just put it back, I pick it up, and screamed as I saw its face, carved into it was that trident-homecoming symbol thing. It was a clear carving. My mom came into the living room and saw it and assumed that I did it.... Okay fair, I did have a history of ruining stuff. 

I tried to convince my mom that I didn't do it, and she eventually saw how genuine I was being, so she just let it go, but told me to go to one of the only open stores to get a new one. She gave me some money, I got my coat on, and then I was off. While walking there, I slipped on some ice and nearly fell on my face, but I was caught by some older woman, looked to be around college age. I looked at her and said, "Thank you."

She said, "You're welcome."

Now, I had never seen her before, Woodbrook was small enough that you at least knew what everyone looked like, and I even said, "Who even are you, never seen you here before?"

Little harsh, I know, but she responded something along the lines of, "Oh, I just moved here for college, I'm Alecia, by the way, or if you want, you can call me Ale or Zia."

Don't know where she got the Zia from, but I digress, I'll just refer to her as Zia for the rest of the story. She walked with me to the little corner store, asked me a bunch of questions, never really personal, but I just got some otherworldly vibe from her, don't know how to explain it.

**March 12th 2018**

It was Spring Break, which meant no school, and me and my friends could hangout more. Now, my friend group consisted of me, Maya, Ryan, James, and Evan. We had sort of incorporated Zia in our group as well. She was present at our meetings sometimes. When she was present, she took us down to the creek to toss rocks into with the other college students. They didn't seem to mind. 

Now, that night, when all the other college students had left, we prepared to leave when I saw something on the other side of the creek, it was a racoon, standing on its hind legs, but its limbs looked wrong, they were stretched, longer, and it was smiling, like full toothy smile. I immediately pointed this out to my friends, they looked, and Zia threw a rock at it, causing it to run away. I immediately said that was a Skinwalker, yes, I was very uninformed back then. Then, more of the creatures seemed to come back, they grabbed rocks and began to hurl them at us.

Of course, we defended ourselves, hurling rocks at them. What began was a rock fight between us and these creatures, the creatures laughed like jackals. The only one who didn't hurl rocks at them was Zia, who was actually looking pissed. I could swear I could hear her mutter, "Of course...." 

One of the creatures dashed into the creek and ran towards us. We fled because frankly, I didn't know if that thing had rabies or some other disease. We reached a sidewalk and a missing poster flew into my face, and I was forced to stop and look at it. It was a younger kid, Sofia Campbell, she was four years old and was last seen near the old creek, but what caught my attention was what was drawn on the missing poster, that damn trident-homecoming symbol.

My friends slowed to a stop, and I showed them the missing poster. We all found that weird, but then we realized, Zia was not with us. My friends looked behind me and told me to "look out", suddenly, I was tackled to the floor by one of those things, it was as tall as me. It hugged me, while still laughing, and the damn thing felt like wet cloth and dirt. I found it super uncomfortable, and Zia ran over and tried to pry it off of me. My friends helped, and we got it off. Zia yelled for it to get lost, and it laughed and ran off. I rubbed my elbow; I had scraped it because getting tackled onto concrete is not a fun thing to do. Zia pulled a bandage out of her backpack, and bandaged me up, I thanked her. 

Now, we all assumed that the symbol was some cult symbol and thought of this horrifying thing that this cult was kidnapping kids to do human sacrif- Okay, to be fair, if you saw some weird symbol on a missing poster, there were kids going missing in general, and you were like 13-14, you'd naturally assume that part.

**March 16-17th 2018**

I went to library and told Mr. Harburrow about the incident at the creek. He adjusted his glasses and told me that one time, those things broke into his house and thought it would be really funny to put his infant son on the roof. He had left the door unlocked, so they just waltzed in, took his son from his crib, made enough noise to wave him and his wife up. 

I asked him what he did to them, and he said he pumped one of them full of lead, they seemed to decide to cut their losses and grab the wounded one and leave. I then asked him if these things were normal and Mr. Harburrow said something along the lines of, "Look, I've lived here for 40 years, it's normal."

Okay? I just thanked him and left, that was most certainly weird. I biked home and found a huge stack of mail on the porch. I brought it inside and decided to be nosy and look through it. A lot of it was random stuff that wasn't really important, but I remember one vividly, it was an envelope addressed directly to me. I opened it and found polaroid photos of the creek and then my treehouse. 

Naturally, I assumed it was a prank, but just to be safe. I assembled my friends together (And Zia) and we went to my treehouse and climbed on in. Inside, on the floor, we found that DAMN trident-homecoming symbol again. It was a large carving. We began to talk about what it could be.

"The cult is marking you!" Maya suggested.

We did not know what to make of it, but Zia pointed out that it wasn't even a trident, it was a Greek letter, the "psi". I didn't know what that meant, and then she knelt down, stating that this town had both Greek and Native American influence. She rubbed her hand across the symbol, giving herself a splinter. She kept speaking to me, about those racoon things, how they were pests and how they were weird. She then said that there were other things in this town, and then she said four simple words, same ones from my dream.

*Do not trust them*

I asked her what that meant, and Zia said, and I remember this vividly, "They tend to want something from they; they just want to really lead you astray."

The sky started to get overcast, and Zia stood up. Now, I was scared, besides those things, I scared of what my dad would say when he saw the symbol, it took him weeks to build that treehouse, and he got pretty expensive wood, if he found out it was scratched, I would be in so much trouble.

Luckily, Ryan had an idea, we snuck to the garage and took paint buckets to paint the inside of the treehouse. My dad had wanted to get that done and was too busy, we could kill two birds with one stone, cover the symbol and make my dad happy. It took us a few hours, but we finally finished painting the inside of the treehouse and called it a day. 

That night, I tried to get some sleep, but I kept waking up and looking at the closet. At first, I didn't know why, I just felt compelled to look at the closet. But then, as the night stretched on, it stretched as well.... There was someone or something in my closet, and it seemed to grow. I decided to be brave (Or incredibly stupid) and get up to open my closet. I opened it and there was nothing inside. I looked outside my window and saw it, some man wearing a top hat, which shifted to a crown, which then shifted to wearing nothing, he slipped away and I just stared, before realizing, I was on the second floor.

The next day, I went to the arcade to hang out with my friends, everyone was there, except for Zia, figures, and......... Evan. He was gone. We all came up with rational explanations, maybe he got grounded, maybe he was busy.

**April 2nd 2018**

The only thing that remained of Evan was a poster with his face on it. His mom had told the police that Evan did not leave his own house that night, he just vanished from his room, no sign of leaving, no sign of entry or leaving. Without much to work with, the cops could do nothing. Zia offered our friend group her condolences. James suggested we look for him. I brought up the obvious, WHERE WOULD WE START!

Ryan brought up the old creek, maybe they could start there. We agreed, Evan was a close friend of ours for years, we had to at least try to find him. We went down to the old creek, and I decided to take another stupid risk and get into the water, trudged over to the other side where those damn racoon creatures came from. My friends followed, and so did Zia. I made it to the other side first and helped the others onto the dry land. We pressed forward, obviously with caution. Ryan led the way as we pushed through the brush of the forest.

Zia looked around, stating that this was stupid. Ryan states that she didn't know Evan like he did, Maya pointed out the scratches on the trees. They were formless scratches, but they looked to be artificial, what I mean by artificial is that it looked like they were made with knives and axes. Now, this seemed to confirm our cult hypothesis, but Zia brought up something. Those racoon things were smart enough to get into a rock fight with them, what's to say they use tools?

Okay, that was fair, but we looked up and saw that the leaves were rustling, rapidly. There was barely any wind. Zia told us to get down and not look. We complied and some massive shadow came over us, and suddenly, dead leaves fell. Zia let us look up and...... The leaves were still on the trees and were still green. We looked down, dead leaves, crunchy and beige. 

Suddenly, I felt weird, like we were being watched, followed, studied. I began to shake uncontrollably, so much that my legs gave way. Then Maya began to shake uncontrollably, then her legs gave way. And then the same thing happened to James, then Ryan. Only one who didn't collapse was Zia. She was breathing heavily though. Wind rushed through the trees, so much so that it sounded like whistling. But we couldn't get up, like physically could not get up or move. Then, everything went silent. Zia stepped back and told me that she can't carry us all at once, she'll need to carry us back to the other side of the creek one by one. 

My heard dropped, I felt an unbelievable wave of fear, I knew that if she does this, there would be a moment where only one of us would be alone, vulnerable. Zia sighed and picked out an order of who she'll carry back to safety........ I was last. One by one, she slung my friends over her shoulder and walked off. Then, finally, I was alone. I vividly remember tearing up, I was scared, what person wouldn't? Not only that, but I heard something in the trees, whether it was those racoon creatures or something else. But then, I felt myself getting slung over a shoulder, Zia had come back. I was relieved. We crossed the creek, and she put me down. I could finally stand up again.

**May 27th 2018**

With finals finally finished, we could finally relax. All of us had accepted that Evan was gone. There was nothing we could do. We could not go further and Zia was "busy". I went to the creek for the final time, and looked over to the other side, to the tree line. I saw him, Evan, he looked disturbed, traumatized. He just gave me a blank stare, from the trees behind him, I saw a shadowed hand emerged and grab him by the neck. I blinked and he was gone. Never again, never would I go to that creek. Never would I forget what happened.

**December 7th 2025, Modern Day**

Now, I'm writing these memories down today because, Zia reached out to me, by letter. She explained that something was forgotten from the town, and it really did not appreciate being forgotten. I don't want to return to that creek; I don't want to find out what this thing is. If anyone has any ideas of what I should do, please let me know, but for now, this is it for me. I thank every God out there that I moved out of Woodbrook.
