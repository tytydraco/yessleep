I lived in a really small town about two hours away from the Appalachian mountains, like the kinda town where nothing ever happens. As a teenager I was always jealous of the fact that there were never any concerts, any comedy shows, festivals, really anything except the county fair once a year. 

So when my friend told me about a music festival happening up in the mountains I was ecstatic. I would finally get the chance to feel like a normal teenager. The whole vibe was supposed to be a mix of Woodstock and a Ren faire, which was a little weird but I wasn’t in a position to complain. I was about 17 so I still had to ask my parents, they said no. Looking back i understand, their 17 year old daughter wanted to drive two hours away to attend a hippy like music festival with her friend and no adults, i wouldn’t let my kid go either. 

But I was a little shit in my teen years, since there was never anything to do me and my friends had to make our own fun, needless to say this wasn’t my first time sneaking out. It was around 6 pm when my friend messaged me telling me she parked down the street, so I grabbed my things and climbed out of my window, it was a ranch style home so it was was to just climb in and out of my window. 

Once I got in her car we started driving out to the mountains, we actually made it there in only an hour because we didn’t exactly obey traffic laws or speed limits the whole time. We parked about a mile away, so we had to walk through the woods for a while, it was the summer time so it wasn’t dark yet. 

We eventually made it and noticed pretty fast this wasn’t really a professionally set up thing, there wasn’t even any security, we were able to walk right in. We walked around for a bit, hopping from one area to another. The stages were made with cinder blocks and ply wood, but what was even more strange was everyone else there. 

Remember how I said it was a small town? Well the surrounding areas weren’t any bigger, and it wasn’t exactly Coachella so how was it packed full of people? I noticed how everyone else seemed totally zoned out, how we were the only ones moving, talking, and even dressed to fit the loose theme. Everyone else were all dressed like they were from different points in history, some looked like they were from the 80s while some looked like a pilgrim. The whole thing was just strange from the moment we got there.

Me and my friend hadn’t really been listening to much to the lyrics of the music, but once we started it only made the unsettling feeling we had ten times worse. Themes of “run” and “get out”, phrases like “save yourself”. 

We decided all of it was just way too weird, so we turned around to start to leave and suddenly, it was an empty feild again, like there was never any music festival at all. We knew we had to leave, whatever was happening wasn’t right. 

We began walking back to the car, it was still light out but yet we kept seeing a human like shadow lurking behind trees. We could only see it out the corner of our eyes, when we would look at it, it disappeared.  After a few times of seeing this thing we started running.

It was only a mile, which wouldn’t take that long especially if you were running as fast as we were. Next thing we knew it was suddenly dark, like we had been there for hours. 

We both felt like there was something following us, and we could feel it getting closer. Looking back, my legs were burning, but in that moment i couldn’t feel anything but fear. 

After what felt like years we suddenly found ourselves out of the woods, I kept running, seeing the car already. That’s when we heard a blood curdling scream, I heard a ghostly voice whisper in my ear; “don’t look back, keep going”,  my friend must not have heard the same voice, or maybe she didn’t listen, all I know is that she saw something. I made it to the car First but she had the keys. eventually she made it to the car as well, unlocked it, and we both got inside. 

We started driving back home, we were silent the whole time. She dropped me off where she picked me up but that was the last time I ever saw her. She stopped coming to school, stopped answering her phone. I even called her parents once, she was still alive. 

This was about fifteen years ago. I graduated, and got the hell out of that town I moved to the west coast, went to college, graduated, and even started a family with my husband. I’ve spoken to a few people about my friend from back then. Apparently she’s not doing the best. Addiction, alcohol abuse, even mental health facilities. 

All I know for certain is that whatever she saw that day really messed her up.
