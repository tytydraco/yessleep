If you read my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o657a3/my_family_calls_it_springhouse_i_call_it_the/), then you already know about Springhouse. But to those of you who contacted me in my DMs… yes, it’s not just the house where weird things happen.

My mother told me once that, on some afternoons, if you looked closely towards the strip of forest, you could see lights moving up and down the forest path.

She told me not to worry about them, that they were family, people going from house to house or just passing by.

As a child, it never quite made sense to me; they always made me feel a bit nervous.

This forest was… strange, you see, strangely shaped, strangely populated, and strangely protected by the people living around it.

It wasn’t even mostly native, for Christ’s sake. To this day, the thing’s mostly pine trees and wattle.

Our houses (my mom’s, Springhouse, every one of my family’s houses) were sandwiched between a highway that connected two small towns (Springhouse was right in the middle) and the forest. Only after crossing the forest would you reach the lake.

This strip of forest was, in almost every sense of the word, unbroken. Even though cutting it would probably yield enough firewood to last a few decades, not one person I knew had ever seriously thought about it.

It just lay there, unbroken… except in two places: Where the highway cut through it on its way to town, and right in front of Springhouse.

Great-Aunt Gloria used to joke that it was afraid to block Springhouse’s view of the lake. I believe there might be some truth to that.

I remember it was around the time I turned eight (shortly after I began losing some of the fear I had toward Springhouse from the story I told you earlier), that I once more met up with my cousins at the house.

They were the sons of Great Aunt Gloria’s youngest daughter, Aunt Lily. And they were assholes.

They didn’t live near Springhouse, same as me and my family. Difference was that my dad worked in a city relatively close by, so we spent every holiday and long weekend in our cabin by the house.

My cousins, on the other hand, lived in Santiago, which meant they had to take a long ass ride to come visit. They only came during summer holidays, and even then, it was clear they didn’t enjoy it.

At all.

And who do you think they took their pent-up frustrations out on? Well, their little cousin, of course.

You see, although Aunt Lily was the youngest and my mom the oldest of the bunch, she had married later in life and had me by the time my Aunt’s sons were already alive and kicking. Cousin Carlos, the younger of the two, was almost four years older and Luis was a whopping ten years older than me.

By the time I was old enough to understand that drinking beer before going for a swim was a bad idea, Luis was old enough to do it legally.

It was on a summer afternoon, closer to night than to midday, that I wandered around the back of the house while my parents caught-up with my aunt and uncle in the house’s porch. The watery sound of the speaker filled the air as I paced lazily around the forest’s outskirt.

I was… bored. I didn’t like coming to Springhouse much, not only because I was still slightly afraid of the house, but because, well, they didn’t even have a television there to pass time.

Great Uncle had even installed a parabolic antenna in the courtyard next to the house in an attempt to get some TV signal and the thing had only worked for a few weeks before it began showing nothing but static.

It wasn’t the hills either, the TV in my house had no problem catching the signal for some national channels, so it was most probably something to do with the house itself… but along with everything else it was just brushed under the carpet as just another one of Springhouse’s oddities.

And so, I wandered around the house looking for something to do.

I turned around the back of the kitchen trying not to look up to the house’s windows and walked to the small bridge built over the spring that gave the house its name.

I heard them then. As I walked over the bridge, I saw them in the opening behind the house, sitting in the shade of the parabolic antenna. They were laughing as they played with what looked like playing cards.

They were drinking beer they had probably stolen out of uncle’s stash in the pantry.

I thought they wouldn’t notice me if I walked back quietly, but the creaking of the wood under my feet called their attention. They called me over and I, sheepishly, walked towards them.

I remember thinking they weren’t being assholes for once. Carlos even brought me a glass of coke from the kitchen when they realized I couldn’t drink beer (Which was funny if you think that he himself was 12 and shouldn’t be doing that either).

But that all changed when the sun moved behind the forest’s treetop. It wasn’t long after that that their mood changed in an instant.

“Hey…” Carlos said. “Have you seen the lights in the forest?”

I gulped and nodded.

“We can see them from our room upstairs, in Springhouse.” Luis continued, a smile creeping onto his face. “Mom says we shouldn’t go there after dark, that they might be strangers… or even worse… ghosts… but I’m really curious to know what they are.”

He looked at me. “Do you?” He asked. “Do you wanna know what they are?” I felt he wasn’t actually expecting an answer.

But I wasn’t fast enough to run away.

They picked me and dragged me to the forest as the sun moved further down in the sky.

I tried calling for my mom, but Luis was far stronger than me and he silenced me by placing a hand over my mouth. They dragged me to a tree far away from the treeline that I wouldn’t be easily seen and tied me to it using a piece of rope that waited on a branch.

I knew then they had been planning this from before. “We’ll come pick you up in a while.” Said Carlos, grinning. “Then, you can tell us what the lights are.”

They laughed as they walked away.

From where I was, I could see a single one of Springhouse’s windows. It almost felt like the house itself was keeping an eye on me.

But no matter how much I cried and called, no one could hear me, no one came to pick me up.

It wasn’t strange either, the forest wasn’t big, but it was wide enough to stop almost every noise from crossing it.

My parents also thought I probably was with my cousins, so they wouldn’t notice I was gone until the time they decided to go back home… which usually happened late at night.

But the worst part was that, the way they’d tied me up, I couldn’t even look at the path. Even if someone walked past, I wouldn’t have known who they were.

This only added to my dread as, slowly but surely, the light in the forest was beginning to fade, drowning me in that kind of darkness you only find deep in the countryside.

Have you ever been in complete darkness?

You know the one, when your eyes can’t gather enough light to make sense of the shapes around you?

When edges begin to distort and swirl and your mind begins to fill in the gaps?

After a while, even screaming for help did nothing but to add to my anxiety. It felt like I would be discovered if I kept going… so I just… stopped.

In the darkness of the night, surrounded by the sounds of a living forest, I found more safety in silence than in screams.

Someone would come back for me… eventually.

Maybe just waiting was the better idea.

And even though I knew that, it didn’t keep me from jumping with each small sound around me.

I remember that at one point I closed my eyes. It didn’t do much, but it kept my eyes from trying to make sense of the nothingness around me, it kept me from noticing how the trees moved, how they somehow looked more like people than trees… and how they seemed to be getting closer by the minute.

I’m not sure how long I was there, eyes closed in the darkness. It might have been an hour, maybe ten minutes, but my lone descent into madness was suddenly interrupted by the first sign of some light penetrating my eyelids, accompanied by the distant sound of footsteps walking over dried leaves.

I opened my eyes, a smile drawing on my face at the idea of someone finally coming to pick me up. I even felt my eyes fill up with tears of relief.

But my hopes were short-lived.

The light wasn’t coming from the direction of the house, you see… it was coming from somewhere down the path.

And the footsteps were drawing closer.

It was a man’s voice that finally broke the silence. “Oh dear…” he said in a tone that somehow reminded me of autumn days. “What do we have here.”

The steps grew closer, and with it, the light grew stronger. “Who leaves a kid out here at night?” he said. “It’s dangerous to walk around without a light.”

I felt hands messing with the knots around my own. They were rough, like bark, but they had a gentle warmth to them.

As I felt the rope release my hands, I brought them towards my body. They were cold and aching from being tied for so long.

“Who… who are you?” I asked, too afraid to turn around to look at the source of the voice.

“Did you come from the house?” the man asked, ignoring my question. “It might be a good idea for you to go back there. Here,” He walked around the tree trunk and extended a hand towards me. “I’ll take you there.”

With some slight hesitation, I took his hand and propped myself up.

I know what people say about stranger-danger, but him… I somehow felt like I *knew* him.

After we took a few steps, my hand in his, I finally managed to build up enough courage to look up at the man.

He wore a long greenish hood that covered most of his face and body. On his other hand, he carried the source of the light, an old storm lamp with a warm orange light burning in it.

Its glass was cracked, and the wind kept making the fire waver.

We walked past one of the grottoes on the side of the path and I instinctively did the sign of the cross with my free hand. I heard the man chuckle.

“Some things are not forgotten, huh.” He said as we reached the edge of the forest. “Go back to your people, boy.” He spoke.

The lights on the porch where still lit and I could see my parents at the other side of the glass. They were still talking with my aunt.

I looked up to the man who had walked with me mostly in silence all this way. “Who are you?” I asked again.

Although I couldn’t see his face, hidden as it was in the shadow of his robe, I saw his smile. “Just a friend…” He said, letting go of my hand and giving me a soft push towards the house. “Go, boy.”

I waved at him and began to jog towards Springhouse, its many windows looking down on me.

As I knocked at the door and was picked up by my mother who was just now realizing I hadn’t been with my cousins as she had thought, I remember looking back at the place where the forest path began.

I couldn’t see the man anymore, only and orange light slowly wandering back into the forest before flicking out entirely.

My cousins never again tried to do something like this.

Years later, when Luis and I were both old enough to reconcile the fact that he’d been an asshole as a teenager, he told me they’d gone back to that tree to see how I’d freed myself from the rope.

Only to find it singed and blackened, half absorbed by the tree’s bark.

A few days after the incident, I sneaked out of the house and walked back up the forest path toward the grotto where the man had stopped with me.

There, I found a forgotten statue, mostly covered in moss. Within the green you could just make out part of a face, and a name carved into the stone above it: “San Antonio.”

In one of the hands that protruded from the moss, the statue held an old lamp… its detailed shape cracked with time.
