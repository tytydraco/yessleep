# CHAPTER 1: THE NEW TOWN

  
David was a 35 man, who had a 15 son, Zack. David was lookin' for a new job, 'cause he had been fired form his previous job on suspicios of havin' killed his wife; he found in internet a 'police' job in a solitary, and unknow town, in that job, he would win a large count of money; because of that, him, along with his son, they moved at that town.

The town was some kind weird, the people looked at them with strangeness, but they didn't  give it importance.

The first day in that place, David went at his job, realizing he was the only one there.

\- This is weird... - He said, approaching at his office; once he was there, he realized that there was a sheet on the desk - What's this? - He asked, takin' it 'n he started to read it - Welcome to Copy Cat Town, as you can've noticed, you're the only one here, the comissary, but that's okey, you'll be the only one police in this town, 'cause we don't need so much cops. Your job will be attend the phone and follow the seven rules that I will provide you with below.

The first rule is: Don't drink the coffe wich is in the cafeteria only if the coffe is black, if it's brown, there's no problem, yo can drink it with no worries; if you drink it when the coffe is black, you will have to vomit it up as quickly as possible, if you don't do that, that thing will can smell you

The second rule is: If somebody call you for domestic abuse, go there with your arm, 'n, once you're there, shoots at the woman who called you and wait until the corpse dissapears, then, leave the house with the man and question him until he wants to leave, once that happens, let him go; if you try to keep it more time, he'll atack you, 'n, belive me, you don't wanna die for him

Third rule: If there a missing person in the town, you have to use the printer and print twenty flyers, don't print more or less. If that person is missing for more than three days and she 'r he, appers, don't trust in that person, now is a skin changer and you have to kill him or her before it's too late. If that person appears before the three days, there's no problem, everything will be alright

Fourth rule: If you recibe a call for a theft in a house or a store, go there and resolve the problem, only if the call is before the 12 p.m. , if that's not the situation, don't go there, ignore the call until the 6 a.m. , at that hour, you can go to the address and resolve the problem

Fifth rule: If a kid call you, no matter why or where, go there and help he, except if the voice is that for a girl, if that case, don't answer her and hang up the call until she finished speakin', don't hang up before, and, once you hang up the call, press the red button, that will set off an alarm 'round the town; when you've done that, run to your house and don't go out until the next day

Sixth rule: If for some reason, you have to miss work on the days you have to work, you have to make sure that one person stay here, this place can't stay alone that days

Seventh rule: If you don't do any of this rules, except for the first rule, you have to hide in the bathrooms of the comissary, and, you can leave until the sunrise of the next day, you could only do that three times, at the third time you have to leave the town, if you don't do that, those things can catch you

Your payment will appear in a little box on your front door every weekend. I wish that you last longer than a day here, but, that's your desicion. Oh, and, you only have to work Monday, Wednesday, and, Thursday, and you can leave this place when it´s 6 o'clock, don't worry about the other days, nothin' happens those days - David read the sheet - Is this real? - He laughed nervously - Is this some kinf of joke? - He drop the sheet on the desk - Well... I don't think this is a joke... so... I'll have to do everything that's on the list... maybe this was a bad idea... but... ugh... I only want Zack forget everything about the die of his mother... -

A few hours later, David was watchin' videos until he heard someone was calling on the phone of the comissary.

\- Hello? - David answered the phone

\- H-hi... - That voice was of a little child - I need help... -

\- What's your name? -

\- M-michael... -

\- Well... where are you? -

\- I'm in the enter of the forest.... -

\- What do you need help with? -

\- An animal... -

\- Alright... I'll go there, calm down -

\- T-thanks... - The child hung up the phone

\- Uhm... well... so... I have to go there, and, help he... with an animal... that's weird... - David left the police station, and, went to the single entry of the forest - ¡Michael! - Shouted

\- ¡Here! - The child's voice was heard, so, David went to his address, encountering a dead animal on the floor - W-what the heck...? -

\- Hi - 

\- T-this is a death animal... -

\- Yup -

\- H-how you can kill it? -

\- Easy, look - The child bent out and made claws appear from his hands - Whit this is so easy -

\- T-this is impossible... -

\- Hey, you have to help me -

\- ... - David looked at the child with fear - H-how may I help you? -

\- Take it to the deepest part of the forest -

\- W-why there? -

\- Those things will eat it up... - The child laughed

\- F-fine... -

\- Thanks! See ya later -

\- G-goodbye... - David looked at the animal - Ugh... I guess I have to take it to the forest - He grabbed the animal, and took it until he looked a black creeatures - What's that...? - He approached until one of those animals; its coat was black, with apparently red eyes, but, it turned around, so David walked away with fear - Uhm... I-I leave this here... - After to leave it, the creatures take it the animal and desappeared in the darkness of the forest.

After to do that, David returned to the police station. Meanwhile, Zack was at school, in the recess.

\- Hello - Said a 50 years old woman, with brown hair, blue eyes, and red blouse - Zack, right? -

\- Uhm, yes... - Responded a 15 years guy, with black hair, green eyes and black clothes - Who are you? -

\- I'm Lizzie, your Maths teacher -

\- Really? -

\- Yes, but, you've not been in my class yet -

\- Ah, fine -

\- Here - She delivered to him a sheet

\- What's this? - Zack took the sheet

\- Rules -

\- Of this school? -

\- No, there are rules of ev'ry class, Maths, English, Physichs, etc... -

\- And... Why I supposed to need this? -

\- 'Cause you'll not understand this school without that -

\- What do you mean? That I'm an idiot? -

\- No, no, of course not -

\- So? -

\- The teachers here... are freaky... -

\- Ha, I already noticed that -

\- Well... in general... the people born here are freaky... -

\- So... Didn't you born here? -

\- No, it's because that I've realized this strangeness -

\- I see -

\- Read it, you need to understand all, it's pretty dangerous that you don't follow them -

\- Well... thanks... -

\- You're welcome, if you need help with something, you can talk with me, there's no problem -

\- Fine -

\- By the way, welcome, this place is stranger and all, but I'm very sure you'll like this little town as much as me -

\- Yes, I'm hope the same -

\- See ya -

\- Bye - Zack looked at the sheet - Rules... - He started to read it - In English you have to do the homework and get an A+ in every exam, the minimum note that you have to have is B+, if you don't get that, run until you're in your house, and, once you're there, close ev'ry door 'r window.

In History you don't have to worry about the score, but you have to participate at every class as much as possible, and don't question the teacher, even if he's wrong about somethin'.

In physical education you'll have to run faster than those things, only that, but, if you can't, you´ll die.

In forgein lenguajes you may to study a lot and ask questions to the teacher, even if the questions are dumb, you never miss a class, if you do that, the next day you have to give a present to the teacher, that present must be expensive.

In Sciences, the most important is stay quiet, don't have a bad behaviour, don't fail exams, if you can't, you'll have to make a deadly experiment for the teacher to forgive you.

In my class, Maths, have a good behaviour, don't fail exams, participe in class, do homework, in short, be a good student, 'n don't worry, you´ll not die in my class, I'm a normal person, not like they... I guess.

If you have questions, feel free to ask me ev'ry single question you have, I'm your teacher - Zack reid ev'ry rule - I don't think that this is a joke... so... wait... C-can I die here...? - Zack looked the sheet with fear - I see... this isn't a normal town... What'll this be? -

When classes ended, Zack returned at his house.

\- Wait! - Said a 30 years woman with blond hair and purple eyes, she was carrying a white plastic bag 

\- What? - Zack turned 'round

\- This is a gift for every peeple in this town - She gave the bag 

\- Uh... - Zack took the girt

\- We hope you and you dad like it -

\- Yes... thank you... -

\- Welcome to Copy Cat town -

\- Thanks... - Zack opened the door, and he entered at the house - Weird... - He put the bag on the table of the dinning room - What will be there? - He opened the bag, encountering with a little box, in its interior was worms and cockroaches - Ugh... What the fuck is this? - Zack continued revising the bag, finding a dog's paw - S-shit... - He covered his mouth - What's wrong with these fuckers? - Zack took the bag and threw it into the garbage can 

Meanwhile, David was in the police station, until the phone rang.

\- No... not the child again... - David answered the phone

\- Hi - Said a child voice

\- T-the girl... - He thought

\- Hello? -

\- ... -

\- Fine, I need help with some thinghs, I'm out of my house, Can you come here? - She waited for an answer, but David didn't said somethin' - I´ll wait for you, bye -

\- Ugh... - Once the child hang up the call, he searched for the red button, and when he found it, he touched it; It started a loud alarm

\- I just need help... - Said the child's voice, but this time, that sounded behind David - There's no razon for do that.... -

\- What the-? - David turned around, bein' able to see the child, who looked at him with her black eyes

\- Don't run, I just- Before she could continue speaking, David ran out the police station - Hey! - The child tried to follow him, but she can't do it

\- Fiub - David closed the door

\- Ah, hey, old man -

\- Don't call me like that -

\- Blah, blah, Do you know wat's happen? -

\- A child... -

\- What? -

\- A child called me... -

\- Are you drunk? -

\- Of course no -

\- Well, is that by sayin' shits like that... -

\- No, it's part of my new job... -

\- Police, Right? -

\- Yes -

\- Ah, by the way... one of our new neighbors gave me a bag like 'gift' -

\- Where is it? -

\- On the shit - Zack poined out at the garbage can - Where it belongs -

\- Why did you that? -

\- 'Cause there was full of little shits -

\- Yes, like a dog's paw... or worms... shit, basicly -

\- And? She's 'till better than you -

\- Zack... -

\- It's because of that you killed her, Right? -

\- I-I didn't kill her -

\- You, little fucker... - Zack went at his room, starting crying
