You know how I haven’t really talked about my manager since the rescue in the graveyard?  It’s because not a lot happened with him after that.  He was kind of like, you cool? And I was like yeah I’m good and he left it at that.  My personal theory is that he either doesn’t remember what happened, is in denial, or is dealing with his trauma by burying it very very deep and hoping no one asks about it.

Haaaaaaaaaaaaah that’s familiar.

Probably a combination of all three, if we’re being realistic.  Anyway, I’ve been going to work as normal despite everything, because life goes on right, and I don’t have that many shifts to begin with.  And I think things would have just continued on like that, with him in a state of amnesia/denial/trauma and me not wanting to bring it up because I had other problems to deal with.

HOWEVER.

Neither of us accounted for my former boss.  

We certainly didn’t expect her to show up unannounced at the end of my shift.

“I AM OUT OF PUMPKIN SPICE,” she bellowed, bursting in through the back door of the kitchen area.  “DO YOU HAVE PUMPKIN SPICE.”

Uh, no, we obviously did not have pumpkin spice.  We did things like reheating spinach quiches and mixing cans of chicken alfredo with pasta.  Pumpkin spice wasn’t something we needed on the regular, unlike the coffee shop which had decided to make it a permanent part of their menu.  My former boss ignored me though and went into the pantry.  I stood there, waiting, while she rummaged around.  My manager emerged from his office at the commotion to see what was happening.

“Okay, you don’t have it either,” my former boss said, emerging from the pantry empty-handed.  “We need to go shopping.  My car is broken, so you’ll need to drive.  Oh, and let’s bring Ashley, we’ll need help carrying it.”

How much pumpkin spice were we buying?!

“You could just take it off the menu,” my manager suggested.

“UNACCEPTABLE.”

I would like to say that this level of volume wasn’t unheard of for my former boss, but it was unusual.

“I’d have a riot on my hands,” she added.  “Putting it on the menu was the most popular decision anyone has ever made on this campus.”

I’m not sure I’d agree with that, I feel like ‘a professor canceling a Friday afternoon class’ could put up some real competition, but my former boss was moving through the kitchen like a whirlwind.  She went to my manager’s office and helped herself to his car keys.  Then she headed for the exit, my manager following because it was his car and he had no choice, and me following because at this point I just wanted to see what the heck was going on.

I did remember to text Cassie and tell her what was going on so she wouldn’t freak out when I didn’t show at our meetup spot now that my shift was done.

My manager at least managed to reclaim control of the situation by insisting that he get to drive his own car.  But as we were leaving campus, my former boss gave him some instructions on where she wanted to go.  Don’t go straight, she said. We weren’t going to the grocery store.

She told him to get on the highway.

And then he drove in confused silence for half an hour while I sat in the back and wondered if I was being kidnapped.  I had my cellphone on me, so maybe not though?  Maybe we were just going to a retailer outside of town, because the local grocery store probably didn’t have the quantity of pumpkin spice she needed.  Restaurant supply stores are a thing, right?  I assumed this was the case just to calm my nerves, while I watched out the window as the rain pelting the car slowly dwindled and then vanished.  I could see sunlight for the first time in almost two weeks.

“Okay, now that the rain is gone,” my former boss sighed, “let’s talk about what this is *really* about.”

“So the pumpkin spice…” my manager began.

“Oh we’re totally out of it.  But I crossed it off the menu like a sensible person.”

Which meant this excursion was about the rain.  It was about me.  And sure enough, my former boss wanted to know what happened in the graveyard.  I didn’t just free my manager from the tree, she said.  It’d started raining that day and it hadn’t stopped.  That wasn’t a coincidence.

So while my manager drove, hunting for someplace to pull over that might have a decent coffee shop, I told them everything that had happened.  *Everything*.  Because I needed all the help I could get and both of them were pretty entrenched in the inhuman by this point already.

“The devil!?” my manager said when I was finished.  “Am I losing my mind?  Is this what it feels like to lose my mind?”

“Says the man that periodically eats the contents of his entire kitchen, including, mind you, the grease traps and the raw bacon,” my former boss retorted.

I’m so glad she’s on my side.

“But why are you getting involved in this?” I asked.  “I seem to recall you being an advocate of keeping your head down and not saying anything.”

“Yeah, I was,” my former boss said grimly.  “But you know what else is different?  Haven’t seen the possums around for a while.  Haven’t seen a few things around lately, actually.  Got me thinking - maybe campus can change.  It *is* changing.  And turns out you’re the reason.”

I started to say something self-deprecating, that it really wasn’t me, that I’d just been cast in this role because Grayson needed a body to inhabit, but she quickly cut me off.

“So what are you going to do about the rain?” she asked.  “Any ideas to get rid of it?”

That hadn’t even crossed my mind.  Stopping Grayson, yes, but not *getting rid of him*.  He was the rain.  You couldn’t get rid of the rain.  But I had a seed now, a seed to a tree that was weakening - containing - him and maybe all I needed to do was find someplace to plant it.  Not in the graveyard.  That would just return us to the old status quo, to the very situation the devil had singled me out to undo. I couldn’t go back to that.  Grayson was right in that regard - he couldn’t keep stealing bodies.  That had to stop.

“I don’t want to get rid of Grayson,” I said quietly.  “I think… I think in a way, the rain protects campus.”He hadn’t hesitated to kill all the swimmers.  He’d killed that kelpie.  He was keeping things in check and yes, he wasn’t getting rid of *everything* - the flickering man in particular came to mind, at least while he was following Grayson’s rules - I still had to wonder how much worse campus would be without him.  No ancient being was fully benevolent.  They were reflections of humanity, a single shard of a broken mirror, but even that slim aspect had a multitude of angles from which to view the world.  Grayson, no, the *rain*, was far more complex than mere good or evil.

“Look, I know it’s hard, but he made his bad choices and you are not responsible for them,” my former boss said and I felt like this wasn’t the first time she’d had this conversation with someone.  The words felt like she was familiar with them, like she’d used them before.  “You need to let him go and do what’s right for you.”

“I don’t know what’s right.”

“I didn’t say what’s *right*,” my former boss snapped.  “Because what’s ‘right’ is usually decided by like… society and people with lots of money and shit like that.  I said what’s right for *you*.  What *you* want to do.  So what *do* you want?”

What did I want?  I wanted to graduate.  I wanted to remain myself.  I wanted the people I cared about to be safe.  And Grayson… I wanted things to go back to how it felt when I first met him.  When he was just a part of my life like anyone else and there was no visible ulterior motive and he wasn’t desperate and he trying to make choices for me and he wasn’t anything more than just someone I felt safe talking to.

“I, for one,” my manager added dryly, “would like the rain to stop turning me into a monster, so I’m all for trapping him inside a magical tree.”

I wanted to protest that I didn’t know that’s how it worked, but something was turning around in the back of my mind, something *basic*, something so simple that I already knew it long before I started my geology classes.

It was weird that the rain turned people into things, wasn’t it?  And how all the monsters came out in the rain and how the doors in the steam tunnels led to other places.  Like the world was crumbling and the reality we humans knew and clung to couldn’t hold together.

Like it was eroding.

“Holy shit,” I whispered.  “I think I *do* want to plant the seed.”

What happened when it rained and there wasn’t enough plant life?  Erosion.  The rain changing things, turning students into inhumans and back again.  The crumbling of the divide between our world and theirs.  The traveling river, sweeping through our world and then back to where it came from.  The steam tunnels, leading to different places through each door.  And creatures crawling out of that pool of water, finding their way onto campus where the rain, trapped in a human body, could only do so much to remove them again.

The university president had upset the natural order by putting an ancient being into mortal flesh.  Professor Monotone’s ancestor had attempted to reduce the rain’s power by planting a tree.  And maybe that was the right answer, but for the wrong reason, and not in the right spot.  We *did* want a tree, not to trap the rain or to weaken it, but to stabilize the earth.

A live tree.  Not a petrified one this time.  Not a construct of stone, but something that could grow and spread roots and bind the earth to itself so that the world around it wouldn’t continue to disintegrate.  Something that had been given life, that had a soul - souls - inside of it.

And what happened to Grayson after that… well, I couldn’t say for certain, but I felt a wild confidence inside of me that whispered no matter how things ended out, I could just keep working at it until I got the outcome I wanted.  I had my whole life ahead of me to figure it out with.

“I think I need to take this to the gray world,” I said.  “I think that’s where the seed goes.”

Which meant I had to explain that whole concept to my manager and former boss.

“I suppose I could explore the steam tunnels until I found a door that led to somewhere else,” I mused.  “It’d be time-consuming, but it could work.”

Maybe I’d find that hole in the world again and could just toss the seed in and call it a day.

“Great, sounds like a plan,” my manager said tersely.  “Can I please turn the car around now?”

He seemed to want nothing to do with this anymore, so my former boss relented.  She, however, made me promise to call her for help if I needed it.  When I found a doorway into the gray world, she said, don’t go in.  Wait for her.  I didn’t have to do this by myself.  And I told her I would and this time, I really meant it.

The apartment was empty when they dropped me off.  I didn’t think much of it and I texted Cassie to let her know I was home.  After about fifteen minutes of her not responding, I tried again, because with everything going on we’d promised to be good about replying promptly so no one worried.  I checked her schedule on the fridge.  She wasn’t in class.

So I tried calling.  She didn’t answer, so I tried Josh.  He didn’t answer either.

That was when I started panicking.  Josh saw Grayson on the roof, he knew that Grayson was weakening.  So maybe when they realized I was out of town and was going to be out of town for a while…

They decided this was their best shot at getting Maria back without me being anywhere close to danger.

I called Grayson.

He didn’t answer.

So in desperation, I called Professor Monotone.

“My friends are going to do something at the power plant,” I said.  “I don’t know if they should be stopped or not - I don’t know what to do anymore - I don’t want to hurt Grayson but maybe this is the only way to put everything right - I don’t know -”

“How about I just go stall them,” Professor Monotone said firmly.  “And find out what they’re doing and decide for myself what to do about it.”

Strangely enough, that felt rather reassuring.  It wasn’t my responsibility to solve absolutely everything.

I didn’t dare join Professor Monotone at the power plant, because I didn’t want to be in the basement with Grayson.  It would be playing right into what he wanted and I didn’t trust that Cassie and Josh would be enough to stop him, not when my mind was not wholly my own.  

But if I let them go ahead with this, if they succeeded in returning James to Grayson’s body and the rain was returned to its original form - what then?  Would the rain stop?  Or would it continue, restored to full power without mortal flesh to hold it back, enraged by what it had lost?

What happened when the river banks could no longer contain the rain?

Flooding.

I needed into the gray world.  *Now*.  There was the laundry lady’s realm, but she was gone, and it was falling to pieces by now.  I might not even be able to get in.  I needed something certain, something reliable.  Like the worm in the hallway, except I didn’t know if it was targeting anyone new this year and it wasn’t even close to midnight.

There was another creature in the hallway, though.  Something that arrived and exited through a door.

I called my former boss.

“I’m out of time,” I said.  “I need to go now and I know how to do it, but - it’s dangerous.”

“Okay.”  She sounded very calm.  “What do you need me to do?”

I hesitated.  Nothing, really.  There was nothing she could do.  If anything, she would be a liability.

“I’m scared,” I said.  “I don’t want to do this alone.”

And she said she’d come with me.

We met on the steps of the English department building.  It was late evening by this point, so there wouldn’t be classes going on.  We went inside and I explained what we were going to do as we walked down the hallway.  There only sound inside was my voice and the rain pelting the windows.  We found an empty classroom and my former boss waited in the doorway, propping it open while I stood alone in the middle of the hallway.  I took a deep breath.  There was still time to back out.  The seed was warm and heavy in my hands.  I could admit that I didn’t have any confidence that this was what I needed to do and leave.  That I was acting on impulse, I could be safe, I could do nothing, I could take no risks.

But when it mattered, when it *really* mattered, that wasn’t who I was.  I’ve accepted that now.

“C’mon out, you fucker!” I shouted into the empty hallway.  “You know who I am, don’t you?”

I waited, panting.

“Grayson said you couldn’t come out, didn’t he?” I yelled, after a minute of silence.  “Well, he’s not here.  He’s not going to rule campus anymore, once my friends are done with him.”

Still nothing.  There was one last thing I could try and I had a feeling that this would do it.  That there’d be no coming back from it.

“I *ruined* you,” I hissed into the silent building.  “I told *all of them* how you can be BEATEN.  And you’ll never get to hurt *any* of us ever again because of me!”

And somewhere in the building, a door slammed open.

I dove into the classroom and my former boss shut the door behind us.  We crouched on the ground, right up against the wall, so that we’d be out of sight as the creature passed us by.  I tucked my legs close to my chest and squeezed my eyes shut tight.  I could hear it coming, the building groaning as it struggled to contain its body.  Overhead, the lights flickered, strobing the backs of my eyelids with each pulse of light and dark.  

We listened to the rasp of its body scraping against the hallway walls as it approached.  The noise paused just outside the room we sheltered in.  I heard a clicking noise, like a jaw popping, like teeth grinding together.  I heard the creak of the walls like a sigh, steady, rhythmic, in time to the creature’s slow breathing.  I was shaking violently and I clenched my mouth shut, trying to keep my teeth from chattering.  All I could think of was the sound of bones snapping in its jaws and how there wasn’t a whole group of friends to save me, there wasn’t a chain of people to grab my hand and hold me back if it called for me.  I felt small and scared and foolish -

* then my former boss took my hand and squeezed it tight.

I opened my eyes.  She wasn’t looking around, she wasn’t trying to sneak a look at the monster just on the other side of the windows.  She was looking at me and I recognized the stare, firm, unyielding, like when she’d taught me to drive off the possums, because some things had to be done and we were the only ones who could do it.

“It’s okay,” she mouthed at me.

It’s all going to be okay.

And the creature began moving again, scraping past, continuing down the hallway in its search to hunt me out.

My former boss let go of my hand.  I had to do this next part alone.

I rose, careful not to look back at where the creature had gone, and stepped out into the hallway.

Then I ran.  I ran hard and all around me I felt the building shake and a guttural, broken screech echoed down the corridor.  It was coming.  The ground trembled underneath my feet as it came, clawing its way forwards as it tried to catch up, but up ahead I saw the doors gaping open and the darkness beyond.  I ran as if my heart would burst, as if my lungs would collapse in my chest.  I ran, with the seed clutched to my chest, hot enough that it felt like it would sear through my shirt, and then I was through the doorway and underneath a gray sky.
