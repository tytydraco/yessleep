**PART 3:**

.--. = P

..-  = U

.-.  = R

.    =   E

What does that even mean? I feel like now I’ve got more questions than I started with… After reading through some comments on my last post, I came to the realization that those dots and dashes were indeed *NOT* random ink splotches. It was freaking Morse code! How I didn’t come to that realization in the first place is beyond me. But for one thing, my nerves are fried. I’ve not been thinking clearly and I’ve not been sleeping very well. Between constantly being on high alert and staying up every night until I pass out, I feel like I’m slowly losing my mind. So listen, all of you were a great help last time and maybe you can help me figure out what this new sticky note means too. It looks as if it corresponds to the blue one, and I’m starting to think that the color of them doesn’t even matter anymore. The newest one that I’ve received is purple. As promised, I’ve attached pictures of both sticky notes in hopes that all of you can be of some help.

But, I know you all aren’t reading this post to hear me whine about my sanity... So I’ve got an update. I’ve received another sticky note, this one has another marking on the corner and it was delivered to my workplace again…. Straight to my desk... With a dozen white roses. The second I opened the little  envelope and pulled out the sticky note, a sickening wave of nausea crashed over me so hard that I vomited up everything I had for breakfast. The other ladies in the office were quick to rush to my aid. And as comforting as they were, they were all completely oblivious to the fact that this sudden sickness was brought on by the note I’d received with the roses. I hadn’t told anyone at work, and I didn’t intend to. My boss ended up sending me home and telling me to feel better soon. His words were nice, but all I could think about was the fact that I *wasn’t* going to be feeling better anytime soon.

In the meantime, let me walk all of you through what precautions I have taken. I had my carbon monoxide detector checked… Twice. I checked for hidden cameras and I checked every vent and cupboard in my apartment. After the first couple of weeks that I dealt with these sticky notes, I also decided to speak with the landlord and see if he could offer any help. My next step was to see if he could assist me in getting my locks changed. He's a nice enough man and is always incredibly helpful. In fact, when I came to him in search of any openings, he was one of the only apartment complexes in town to offer me something around my price range. I was living paycheck to paycheck, and he knew what that was like. I still remember our first interaction clear as day.

*1 MONTH EARLIER*

“Hi! What can I help you with today?”

Warm brown eyes met mine from across the room. He was young, probably in his early thirties, and had a head of thick chestnut colored hair. There was a medley of tattoos on one of his arms, and I couldn’t help but wonder how long it took him to gather that many. I smiled and walked up hoping that this time I wouldn’t get turned away. The moment I approached the desk, he was quick to exchange pleasantries and shake my hand. He was a tall man, towering over my small 5’6 frame with ease. A little gold name plate stared back at me from the desk: Jack.

“Um, hi Jack! I’m hoping that maybe your apartment complex has some 1 bedroom, one bath openings?”

Tapping a pen on the table, he sat back down and clacked away on the keyboard before he looked up and said, “You’re in luck! We actually just had one open up about a week ago. It’s ready to move in and it’s yours if you want it!”

“Great! That’s perfect!” I smiled up at him, elated at the fact that I’d finally found an opening. The second he went over pricing though, I felt my smile drop into a concerned frown. As he went over the amenities and everything that was included, I anxiously twisted the ring on my finger. I couldn’t afford any of this… Tugging the ring free, I continued to fidget with it until I felt it slip from within my grasp and tumble over the desk and onto the floor in front of him. I sheepishly laughed, embarrassed at my nervous habit.

“Oh, I’m so sorry!” My words rushed together, tumbling out of my mouth almost as quickly as my ring tumbled out of my hands.

Reaching under his desk, he snatched it up and handed it back to me with an understanding smile. “No biggie! Really! It’s a beautiful little ring.”

Cheeks still red with embarrassment, I smiled back and said, “Thank you! It was a gift from my grandmother.”

Nodding his head, he pointed to it again. “That ring looks kind of familiar?”

“Oh, it’s just a simple little purity ring!” I tucked a stray piece of hair behind my ear before slipping it back onto my finger. “Playing with it is a bit of a nervous habit.”

“Well,” he started. “If the pricing for the apartment is what you’re *nervous* about, I’m sure I could make an adjustment for you. You seem like a really nice person, with a good head on her shoulders and I know finding a decent place to stay around here is a hit or miss.”

A small smile tugged at my lips as I looked up at him. I could hear the genuine sincerity in his words, and I was more than appreciative. “Thank you… really.”

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

As I sit on my couch, the purple sticky note is staring up at me menacingly from my coffee table as I twirl the little ring around and around my finger.

***“Are you afraid yet?”***

YES! I wanted to shout at it. I am afraid. In fact, I am terrified! The other sticky notes were scattered around it and my eyes roamed over each one, but they stayed on the blue one and the purple one. Both had triangular shaped arrows on them. What did it all mean though? What was this psycho trying to convey to me? Around the time that I was ready to pull my hair out, I heard a knock on my door. My heart raced as I heard the knock sound again. A bit of perspiration collected at my brow as I got up to cross the room. Stopping at the door, shaky breaths left my lips as I tried to force myself to look into the peephole of the door. No one that came to my door felt safe. This stalker could be anyone, and I didn’t want to take my chances. Finally peering through the hole, I noticed it was my next door neighbor. We hadn’t ever spoken and so why he wanted to speak to me now was beyond me. I didn’t even know his name.

Leaning my head up against the door, I drew in slow, steady breaths. The coolness of the door against my forehead was slightly comforting as I waited for the knocking to stop. Once I saw him walk back across the hallway to his apartment I hesitantly opened the door. There on my welcome mat was a note. My breathing quickened again and my vision blurred as I picked it up. My legs threatened to buckle as I reached out to grasp the side of the doorframe. I needed to get a grip. If I wasn’t careful, I was going to send myself into a panic attack, or worse, I was going to pass out. The moment I opened it though, the first thing I noticed was an obvious difference in handwriting. Relief flooded my body for a split second before I took the time to actually read what it said. Closing the door, I locked it and slumped down onto the floor. I couldn’t decide if this message was good or bad, but a part of me hoped that maybe he'd just happened to see something I hadn’t?

***“Hey... We need to talk.”***
