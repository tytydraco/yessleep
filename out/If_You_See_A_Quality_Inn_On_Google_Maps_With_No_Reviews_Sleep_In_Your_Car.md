We had been driving for hours, and the monotony of the road was starting to wear on me. The summer sun was setting, casting long shadows across the desolate highway. My best friend, Jake, and I were on a cross-country road trip, determined to make the most of our summer vacation. We had planned our stops carefully, but as the day wore on, we realized that we were going to need a place to sleep sooner than expected.  
  
Jake, ever the optimist, assured me that he had found the perfect place for us to spend the night. He showed me his phone, and on the screen was a website for a quaint little hotel called Quality Inn. I raised my eyebrow at the fact that it had no reviews, but Jake waved it off with a casual explanation.  
  
"It's probably a new place, dude. Besides, it's the only hotel within 50 miles, and it looks nice enough in the pictures."  
  
I glanced at the photos of the exterior and the lobby on the website. It did, indeed, seem like a perfectly reasonable place to stay. However, I couldn't shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that there were no images of the rooms themselves. We booked a room with two double beds and put the address into Google Maps.  
  
As we continued our drive, the sky grew darker and the stars began to peek through the inky blackness above. We finally pulled up to the hotel at 10:32 PM, the headlights of our car illuminating the tired-looking building. The exterior wasn't quite as charming as the photos on the website had led us to believe. The paint was peeling, and the once-white siding had taken on a dull, grayish hue. Most of the windows were dark, and the only light came from the flickering fluorescent bulbs in the lobby. I glanced at Jake, who sheepishly shrugged his shoulders.  
  
"Well, it's just for one night, right?"  
  
We grabbed our luggage from the trunk and hesitantly made our way inside. The moment we stepped through the creaky front door, we were hit with a musty, stale odor that seemed to cling to our clothes and skin. I wrinkled my nose, trying to ignore the unpleasant smell. The lobby was dimly lit, the buzzing overhead lights casting a sickly yellow glow over the cracked linoleum floor and the worn, faux-leather chairs.  
  
The entire place seemed to be falling apart. The wallpaper was peeling, revealing patches of discolored plaster beneath. A thick layer of dust coated every surface, as if the hotel had been abandoned for years. It was hard to believe that this was the same establishment we had seen online.  
  
Before we could voice our doubts and make a hasty exit, a piercing siren suddenly filled the air. The shrill noise made both of us jump, our hearts pounding in our chests. We exchanged frantic glances, our fight-or-flight instincts kicking in. We immediately turned to leave, our feet pounding against the floor as we raced back towards the entrance.  
  
The lobby door slammed shut just as we reached it, the sudden impact causing me to stumble back. A heavy, metallic click echoed through the room as the door locked itself, trapping us inside. Panic rose in my chest, my breath coming in short, shallow gasps.  
  
"What the hell is going on?" I managed to choke out, my voice barely audible over the blaring siren.  
  
As we stood there, paralyzed with fear, an Asian woman in her late 40s appeared from a side door, clutching a leather briefcase. Her eyes were cold and calculating, and she regarded us with an unnerving intensity. She wore a crisp, black suit that looked out of place in the decaying hotel. Her lips curled into a sinister smile as she approached us, the siren drowning out any attempt at conversation.  
  
And then, just as suddenly as it began, the siren stopped. Eerie silence filled the room, broken only by the sound of our ragged breathing and the woman's measured footsteps as she closed the distance between us.  
  
"Welcome to Quality Inn," she said, her voice devoid of warmth. "I hope you enjoy your stay."
