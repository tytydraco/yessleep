First, let me start off by saying my dad was never a supernatural, spiritual, or religious person, he always found the idea of ghosts and paranormal creatures like that extremely silly, whenever we were kids and would come to him asking to check for a monster under the bed, he simply told us there was no such thing as monsters and that the whole concept was silly, reluctantly check under the bed or in the closet, before going back to bed. With that being said, he recently died in what the officers said was a bear attack, he was 56, and since I was his only child, and my mom died in childbirth and he never remarried, I was the only person who got any of his stuff, like his house, the ranch he had before he died, and his money and possessions. There's a lot of strange things in his diary, and now I'm afraid their happening to me. This is what was in his diary.

The main reason I got this diary is to log what's happening on the ranch, a lot of strange things have been happening recently, one of my cows newborn calf's went missing last week, I just figured a wolf had broken in, since the enclosure fence was low enough for a wolf to jump over without much trouble, but when I found the calf, there wasn't a single bite taken out of it, it looked like it had just died a few minutes ago, with no signs of decay, but when I touched it, the body just folded in in itself, it was just the skin, somehow perfectly preserved and positioned as if still on the body, despite being in the woods for at least a week. Who would, or even could do this? I'll try and keep the diary updated.

I found some of the chickens, about 8, they were completely skinless, their bodies were arranged in a circle around a carving in the dirt, it looked like the stick totems from the Blair witch, but it had where the head would be that looked like antlers, and it had a stone in the middle of it. Who the fuck is doing this? This an elaborate prank for just some bored highschoolers. I'll get some cameras and set them up around the property to see who's doing this.

I got the cameras set up last night, and it is was mostly normal for the most part, the cows eating and drinking from the pond, me feeding the chickens, gathering the eggs, the occasional bug that lands on the lens, but at 1:30 AM, I saw someone in a black cloak walk into the cattle enclosure, they were impossibly tall, at least 8 feet, as they then raise one of their hands in the air and start swaying it, as one of the cows started walking over to it, it's head thrashing as if something was upsetting it, as the cloaked person placed their hand on the cows head, as the cow started violently shaking as it started foaming from the mouth, as a dark liquid, which I'm guessing is blood since I found a pool of it where the cow and the person were standing, started pouring from the cows eyes, ears, mouth and nose, before it dropped dead, as there was a loud, shrill scream that sounded halfway between a wolf howling and a man screaming in pain, as the cloaked person walked back to the woods. What's even stranger is how the cows body was gone in the morning, how did they even lift that cow? How did that not wake me up? What the fuck was that? Is it even safe for me to stay here?

I was looking at the cameras this morning, everything has been very normal through the past few weeks ever since the cloaked person, and I've been looking into it for the past few days, asked people online, and they've all said that maybe it's some sort of cult, whatever the hell a skin walker is, or a wendigo. It's hard to believe, but after what I've seen, it definitely seems plausible. But that's not the point of this entry, this morning after checking last night's camera feed, I saw something on the cameras, it was some sort of creature, it was on all fours, completely hairless, with large eyes that glowed in the dark, it's front paws looked like a clawed, skeletal chimp hand, and it's back legs looked halfway between a humans and a dogs, and it had antlers sticking from its head, as it wandered around the ranch, stood up on its back legs as it reached the cattle pen, as it reached out its hand towards one of the calves, as it attempted to grab the calf and run off with it, but was scared by the motion sensor lights and ran, leaving long claw marks across the calves back. I checked on the calf this morning after watching the camera feed, and the moment I stepped outside, I was hit with an extreme stench of rotting meat, so bad I almost threw up when I first stepped outside, as I walked to the cattle pen, and the calf was dead, and looked like it had been for weeks, it was dry and skeletal, it's eyes looked like they had been pecked out by birds, and the claw marks on it's back looked like deep, infected cuts that were crusted with dry blood. I'm gonna try to stay up tonight to watch the cameras and run out there with my shotgun to shoot whatever that thing was if it shows up again.

Last night I saw that thing on the cameras, trying to take another calf, so I ran out there with my shotgun, as I ran out, I was immediately hit with a mix of the smell of rotting body and a sickeningly sweet scent like walking into a candy store, as the thing growled and snarled at me, as I took a shot at it's face, hitting it directly between the eyes as it's head was replaced with a gory, mangled stump as it flopped down beside the fence, as I slumped down at the front door, sighing with relief, thinking it was all over, before the blood started to float back over to where it's head was, slowly reforming back into the shape of its head as the skin slowly formed back around it, as I watched with horror before running back inside, shutting and locking the door, as I soon heard it banging on the door and screaming, as I tried to run for the phone, but before I could even reach it, it's hand shattered through the window and grabbed the phone and broke it, as if knowing that was the only way I could call for help, as I then heard... My wife's voice, calling for me, but there was a slight animalistic growl in her voice, as I knew it was that thing, as I ran to the bathroom, shutting and locking the door behind me, as I heard it crash through the living room window, running around as it's claws clicked on the floor, looking for me as it called for me in my wife's voice, as I eventually fell asleep on the bathroom floor. I can't run, I need to find a way to kill this thing, if there even is a way to.

I haven't seen the creature my dad described yet, and I'm glad I haven't, I think I'll end this part here, I'm copying this all down from my father's diary in the middle of the night, I just saw the motion lights turn on outside and the dog just started barking at something outside, I'm praying it's not whatever that thing was that my dad described, I'm gonna try and go to sleep in the bathroom tonight with the shotgun and my dog, Gerald.
