Part 2: [The weight of a feather](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jdh8gr/the_weight_of_a_feather/)

I woke up in a panic from a dream and began to look around trying to find where she was. The dark hid many things so I leave my room lights on because I could no longer sleep in the dark. It’s been 3 weeks now that I am living under witness protection, again, but this time they are taking me seriously. She is hunting me and because she was wounded when she attacked me had driven her into a frenzy. The 3 letter agencies were now trying to find a link between myself and Razormouth, I called her that when I first talked about her and now everyone calls her that. I have been moved 5 times since I was taken from the town; she still finds me somehow.

The trail of blood that follows her leaves nothing for the police to find but I now know why. When she attacked me in the town, I finally saw why her mouth shone that day, she created braces with sharpened nails, the bite she took out of my hand was a chunk of flesh. I am still recovering from that wound; I still cannot use it for anything which angers me more. Why did I investigate the house that day, I should have just ignored it and none of this would be happening to me. The agents that were tasked to protect me also keep asking why she is after me all the time and I wished I had the answer other than she wants to eat me.

She is a sort of cannibal that basically eats the victims, I have no idea how but all I know from what they told me is that no bodies are usually found. The confrontation that occurred in the town was because I had interrupted her or she got tired of waiting and took it out on that old couple. The bodies were in the process of being ripped to shreds, they could not even believe the way the bodies looked, if the flesh wasn’t attached to the bones they would not have know what belonged to who. The postmortem could not figure out how they are killed, all they could see was that some of the flesh was consumed from the bite marks left behind. I asked them how could one person eat so much and remain as emaciated as she looked, they had no answer.

There was a storm outside and instead of rain there was a hailstorm, hail as large as baseballs pelted the safehouse. I could only hear the falling hail all through the house and I could see the agents guarding the place were nervous. It was worse for me as there feeling of being watched grew stronger as the night progressed, I kept looking out the window and one of the agents noticed. He asked me if I could see anything but I shook my head, I told him that about the feeling and he nodded. I turned in for the night as the hailstorm reduced to rain and the sound was more soothing to me, I left my door slightly open in case of anything and lay down to sleep. I had take meds to help me sleep so I was out before I could cover myself.

I woke up later in the night and there was a feeling of uneasy fear in my stomach, I got up and looked around and at the door. It was as I left it, there was light coming from the living room so I decided to get a glass of water. I then hear the sound of metal on glass coming from my window and I jumped, I looked at the window and there was nothing there. I got up and walked to the window to check properly, there was nothing outside. I returned to the bed and picked up the bat I kept next to it, I did not care if the agents laughed at me but I wanted to be sure. The scratching sound returned, and I jumped, I looked at the window again but there was nothing. I then slowly began walking to the door and peeked outside before stepping out of my room. I looked down the hallway to the living room and saw that the light was on but there were no sounds coming from the agents. I walked to the room to check on them and I did I saw the blood oozing out to the hall. I stopped and took a involuntary step back then turned to look at the other end of the hallway, the kitchen light was on. I choose to check the living room first however it may be and then follow up with the kitchen.

When I reached the entrance of the room the sight that I beheld caused me the double over and gag, both agents were dead, both were headless. One was lying on his stomach, how his head was ripped out shocked me to the core, it was as if she pulled the head for behind taking the spinal column with it, the back was completely exposed, and I could see the broken rib cage and everything inside. The blood was everywhere and the ceiling looked like a modern painting done in blood, how much strength did she actually have to pull off the head and spine. The other agent was sitting on a sofa but his head was sitting on his laps like a macabre joke, I took a step back and collapsed on the floor. This was not happening and my mind was reeling from all this.

A noise from the kitchen woke me, I looked at the light coming from there and slowly got up. I had to steel myself and walk as slow as possible so as to not make a sound. There was another open door along the way that led to another room but it was dark so I jumped past the opening and flattened myself on the wall waiting before moving on. I kept my back to the wall in case she was behind me so my attention was split between when I came from and where I was going. As I got to the kitchen I raised the bat and slowly peeked inside, ready to defend myself if needed. The kitchen was quiet and empty, I walked in slowly eyeing the hallway also to catch any ambush.

There was nothing in the kitchen and I walked around the place to check for any signs. I then checked the back door and it was still locked but I was not sure now where she could have come in from, the front door was accessed through the living room and this door was reinforced. There was light thump I heard from the kitchen entrance I jumped, I turned to see who it was and when I did my blood froze.

She stood at the entrance with a grin, I could finally see the mouth and I wish didn’t. Her teeth was removed and in their place a kind of bear trap was screwed into her gums making her mouth look like a bear trap. She was covered in blood and her eyes were deeper than I had seen her last, she did not move only grinned at me. I raised my bat in anticipation of an attack and she looked at it with some interest by turning her head sideway very slowly. Then she looked at me with an even wider grin, in an instant she jumped and I swung in complete instinct. The bat connected with one of her outstretched hands and I could hear the thunk of metal hitting bone, I jumped back and tried again but she already grabbed my wounded hand and yanked me forward. I was almost taken off balance but caught myself and tried to swing again. She lunged forward to take a bite of the hand and I used that as an opening to stop mid swing and bring the but of the bat onto her head. This caused he to release the grip she had and I jumped back again. She was grinning at me and I was focused on every twitch she made, my wounded had was bleeding from the nail wounds she inflicted but I could not feel the pain. My heart was beating fast and I could feel the blood rush to my head and I was not running on pure adrenaline, she lunged again and this time avoided the swing and grabbed my chest with both hands. She then used that to bite down on my stomach which resulted in a blinding white pain, I screamed out from the pain and dropped on to the floor and she was now on top.

I had dropped the bat when we fell so I tried to swing my fist at her and she grabbed my hand and held it, she was looking down at me with that grin. There was blood oozing from her mouth and she turned her head sideways again looking down at me, I tried to hit her with my wounded hand but she just pushed the weak hand aside like it was a fly. I tried to kick my legs for some momentum but she just tightened her legs and this caused the pain from the wound to intensify. My head was now swimming from the pain and I was seeing everything in double, I tried to fight but it was not possible and she bent forward to take another bite, this time from my chest and the pain doubled. I screamed and tried to move even harder but she kept tightening her grip.

I then heard a loud bang and I felt her legs loosen, I looked up and she was looking at the door. There was a wound on her shoulder, I looked at the door and there was an agent there with a gun in his hands. He was shouting orders and tell her to get up slowly, she tried to move and he shot her in the head this time. Her body fell sideways from the impact of the wound and off me. I tried to get up but fell back and passed out.

When I finally regained consciousness I was in an ambulance, I saw the technician working on a drip bag that was attached to my wounded hand. The world was hazy, and I passed out again. I finally woke up to find myself in a room, it was dimly lit and there were two agents in the room. One was standing next to the door and other was sitting on chair next to me, I asked what happened and he told me what happened.

After the second shot Razormouth fell and the agent checked if she was dead only to find that she had a metal plate on the side of the head. He then handcuffed the unconscious body and bound her so she could not move. He was just checking on the other agents when he found the grisly sight and heard me screaming in the kitchen which is where he managed to incapacitate her. They were there to make sure I recovered and was taken to another secure location. Apparently Razormouth escaped from her transport and will probably try to attack me again. I am well and truly fucked now, if you do not get another update from me then know she finally got her meal.
