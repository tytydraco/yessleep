To all those following along, thank you for being patient with me. Rummaging through my head and getting what I can remember out has been cathartic to say the least. It’s about time all of this got out.

November 23rd, 1 year prior.

Myself, Ryan, and an incredibly sweaty and disoriented Luke were all crammed into my bedroom. Ryan was sitting on my bed, fixed between the space where my bed met the wall, with pillows supporting his head and back. I was on the floor sitting to Luke’s left, and he was curled sitting upright in the fetal position. He was leaning slightly over with his head resting on my shoulder. Ryan and I were bundled up in what was likely all the bedding we had in the apartment, including throw blankets from the couch in the living room. We had the window open and it must have been thirty something degrees outside. Addiction is evil.

Luke however, was stripped down to his red boxer briefs, sweating profusely and claiming that it was still too hot to bear. He had been sick for days. This was our third shot at getting Luke sober in the past two years. It had to stick this time. We could feel the phone calls coming. Telling us that he was in the hospital with a failing liver, or that he had slipped himself into a coma of some kind.

“I can’t do this.” Luke told me. He pushed the words out of his lungs through waves of nausea. “It’s too much, man. I feel like I’m drowning and burning to death at the same time.” I believed him. I could see it all too well painted all over his entire being. I couldn’t stand to see my friend in such a state.

“We’ve got you, buddy. We’re gonna get you through this.” Ryan told him reassuringly. “If you start to drown, we’ll jump in after you. Always.” 

“My stomachs in knots man. I’m gonna try and hit the toilet.” Luke told us. He was starting to turn a milky white and green, and my body ached in sympathy as he tried to get to his feet. 

“Let me give you a hand, buddy.” I offered. I set his arm around my shoulders and heaved with every muscle I could activate. When we finally got up, I felt the entire weight of his massive frame, like he was complete dead weight. We took a few steps before he went completely limp, falling out of my grasp. Somehow, he caught himself on his hands and knees. He began to violently dry heave, his back arching up and down as his demons fought their way out of him. I kneeled down and rested my hand on his back, rubbing up and down. When it finally made its way out, the vomit was almost black, thick and viscous. It slopped into the carpet like warm hot glue. *Holy fuck. That can’t be normal* “Luke, buddy, I think we might need to go to the hospital.”

“No.” He said sternly. The serious tone of his voice caught me off guard. “No more doctors telling me I need to go to rehab. If I can’t do this on my own I don’t want to do it all.” He was silent for a moment. “I think I just need a cold shower.” This sounded like insanity to me. I couldn’t fathom how he could feel the need to get even colder, but we obliged.

We had bought a shower chair for him, and once we got everything set up, I opted to stay in the bathroom with him just in case he needed something. Much to his annoyance, but he knew I wouldn’t back down.

After about fifteen minutes, Ryan poked his head in.

“Wanna smoke?” Ryan asked me.

“I thought we were trying to quit.” I said with a tired drone in my voice.

“Yeah…I think we deserve one after today.” I couldn’t disagree with him. It had been one of our rougher recovery attempts with Luke. I looked back at the shower curtain. “Holler if you need something, man.” He didn’t respond.

We sat outside on the balcony of the apartment in tattered red and green lawn chairs as we lit our cigarettes. Ryan had a concerned look on his face as he blew out small tentacles of smoke that clung to his face as the rose and then slowly faded away.

“Jay…I don’t know how much longer I can do this.” He told me. I looked over at him and I could see tears swelling in his eyes.

“What’s going on, buddy?” I asked him, concern hovering through my tone. Tears started to stream down his face.

“I don’t want to be an asshole, man. I love Luke more than anyone…but I just can’t stand to watch him do this to himself. I want my friend back, Jay. But this…this is getting to be too much.” I’d never seen Ryan this torn up.

“What we’re doing for Luke…I don’t think anyone else could.” I said. “It HAS to be us. We’re all he has. You can’t give up on him now.” His expression changed violently. “…that came out wrong. I don’t think you’re giving up. I just really think we can do this.”

“No, Jay. You can do this. I’m not like you, man. This is…it’s…I feel like I’m melting.” The levies broke, and he began to convulse and sob. “I j-just can’t keep this up. Fuck. It’s tearing muh-me a-apart. Me and Emma are getting pretty serious. B-but…how am I-I supposed to even begin to think of settling down with all of this happening? Fuck me. I feel so fucking selfish.” I could feel his soul being ripped in two. I understood what he meant. Wanting to build something while you’re watching everything you’ve ever had fall apart. “My entire world is crumbling right now, Jay. And I don’t even have the guts to fix it.”

We sat in silence for a few moments.

“…I I can handle Luke for the rest of the day…I think you should go get some lunch, take a good nap, and maybe take Emma to a movie or something. Get Luke’s self induced debacle off your mind for a while.”

“I can’t let you do this alo-“ I cut him off in the middle of what he was saying.

“Ryan.” I locked eyes with him, “I got this.” We stood up, and I wrapped my arms around him. I repeated myself. “I got this.”

Present day

Ryan moped all the way to the hospital, like each step cost a piece of his spirit. As we made our way up to the front doors, I took in how dilapidated the hospital seemed. There were four main towers of brown brick reaching up into the sky like it was clawing at the gray overcast. Each had two rows of windows stacked to the top floor— some whole, some shattered and boarded up like bandages over wounds that wouldn’t heal. There were large sections of clean crisp brick, and others that looked like they had weathered years worth of storms, like the administration had decided to renovate but never got the chance to finish.

“He’d be in the ER right?” Ryan’s voice cut through my observation. 

“It depends on how long ago he ended up here. He could’ve been admitted into long term. But we should check there first.” I said, approaching the automatic doors. I heard the sensor click, but the doors remained sealed. “Shit.” I looked into the parking lot behind me. There were two cars and a truck, nowhere near enough to say this place was currently staffed. I peered back inside. “It’s so weird, the lights are on and everything. Where is everyone?” I read the lettering on the doors, “PUSH FOR EMERGENCY”. I placed my hands on the glass, pressed hard, and like magic, they opened inwards. Glancing over at Ryan, I snickered, “I’ve always wanted to do that.”

Oceans of white tiles stretched as far as the eye could see, reflecting fluorescent lights that hum constantly—a sound you didn’t notice until you did, and then you can't stop noticing. A few wheelchairs scattered throughout the waiting room like abandoned shells. Like the people who needed them simply stood up and walked away.

Rows of stationary blue chairs lined the walls. Tables separated every five seats—practical, designed for social distancing or personal space or some administrative decision made years ago by someone who never sat in them.

Paintings hung on the walls. Forests. Creek beds. Rivers. Landscapes meant to be soothing, calming. They made the white walls feel less baron but somehow more lonely. The TV that hung in the corner looped white noise and static. Visual snow falling forever. The sound of it wasbarely audible under the fluorescent hum, a soft hiss like something breathing.

There was no one behind the glass panes that lined the front desk. The chairs were empty. The computers were dark. No coffee cups. No half-eaten lunches. No signs that anyone was here and stepped away. 

As I scoured through the glass, my eyes caught on something. A scratchy red arrow pointing to something taped to the desk next to the keyboard. An envelope. Dirty and worn—the same yellowed, tea-stained quality as the one Luke sent them.

“Hey.” I got Ryan’s attention, and pointed down to it. “I think that’s for us.” He let out a sigh.

“I hate it when you’re right.” He said. We walked around the corner and through the door that read “STAFF ONLY”. I reached down, hesitated for a moment, and then ripped the envelope from the desk. The bottom of it must have ripped in the process, as something fell out and hit the ground with a light “clink”. I looked down at the ground between my feet. A house key with a strange tag lie alone on the floor. I bent down and picked it up. The tag read *1315 Scottsdale*

“That’s weird.” I thought aloud. I held it up for Ryan to see, then put it in my pocket. I turned the envelope over, and noticed paper inside. I opened it up the rest of the way, pulling a folding piece of hospital stationary out and setting the envelope back on the counter. Slowly, I unfolded it.

*Patient left this behind. Please leave in lost and found.* I flipped it over.

Perplexed, I handed it to Ryan.

“What the fuck?” He said, confused.

“I….I don’t know.” I answered. I began to feel an unspoken sense of urgency relaying between the two of us. He handed it back to me, and I stuffed it in my jacket pocket. “C’mon.”

There was no other way to do this than the hardest. We agreed that we would just go room to room, floor by floor until we found him. Thankfully, the double doors that lead back into the depths of the ER weren’t locked. They swung open automatically with a mechanical hum as we stepped in front of them. A long, empty corridor stretched out in front of us. 

Each room in this hall held a combination of the same things. As I walked in I could see an empty bed left in the upright position, a blank monitor, and no other signs of recent life. I peeked my head out of the room I was in.

“Ryan? You got anything yet?” I yelled down the hallway. He poked of a doorway down the hall.

“No…still nothing. We’re fucked like we have been this whole time.” I could feel the impatience in his voice. I started down the hallway to meet Ryan.

But as I made my way down the hall, a faint, metallic noise caught my attention. It kind of sounded like it was coming from above us. I focused my attention on the ceiling, and could tell that whatever it was was coming from behind me. *Oh this can’t be good.* I thought. The sound was getting closer. As I turned, I could see dust falling off the ceiling tiles as something was moving above them. I followed the trail as whatever it was was rushing over my head. Ryan was just stepping out of the room he’d been checking. 

“STOP.” I screamed at him so harsh that my throat hurt as the words left it. “Stop fucking moving.” He didn’t argue with me as he froze in place. The last bit of tile crumbs settled at Ryan’s feet and the scratching stopped. He slowly turned his gaze upwards. My body moved before my thoughts could comprehend it. I sprinted at him full force, like a track star on his last leg of a four hundred meter dash. When I reached Ryan, I placed both of my hands on his chest, and shoved him as hard as I could. He lifted up off his feet and fell backwards onto his ass, catching himself by his elbows.

As I started to catch my breath, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right forearm, accompanied by the sound of grinding metal. The sharp sensation made my lungs release the air trapped within them. I felt something snatch my arm up into the air. When I looked over at my arm, I could see that it was wrapped in barbed wire stretching all the way back to end of the hall, wrapping around the corner. My arm was suspended in the air by the strand of metal wire and I felt like it was being pulled out of the socket. I could feel each of the barbs digging deep beneath my skin. I traced it back to the corner at the end of the hallway.

Before I could react further, I turned my eyes back to Ryan, and the sight in front of me horrified me to my core.

Ryan’s arms and legs were completely entangled in a sporadic mess of barbed wire. He was fixed with his right leg bent backwards, his foot pressed flat against his back, the other was stuck fully extended above his head. His right arm was wrapped around his face just above his nose, blocking his vision, with the other trapped firmly at his side. Steel barbs stuck not only to his skin and ripped patches of his clothes, but to itself, grinding into him in tight knots. I will never forget the violent screams he uttered.

He was upside down, pinned against the wall, blood leaking down onto his face and arms, dripping onto the floor beneath him. The wires lead into two massive holes, one in the ceiling and one in the floor. The sound of grinding grew louder as he was starting to slowly drift down the wall. 

“RYAN!” I called out to him. I felt hopeless, and it boiled my blood. Suddenly, loud crashes began to cut through the hallway, each one followed by the sound of what I can only describe as a broken ventilator. Humming and wheezing so loud it hurt my eardrums. Something was…coming towards us. It had to be, my mind couldn’t rationalize it any other way. I looked over at my arm tangled in the wire and then down the hall. 

My attention became acutely focused on the other end of barbed wire. I could feel vibrations funneling along it, sending bolts of pain through my arm. Suddenly, a dirty black gloved hand connected to a pale bloodstained arm reached out from around the corner at the other end of the hall. It fiercely latched onto the barbed wire, and another followed closely behind it. Hands with too many fingers slowly collapsing around the wire. 

Fear and rage seeped through my bones. I pulled my arm as hard as I could. The barbs began to rip and tear at my skin, blood seeping out of the wounds on my arm as I tugged.

Before I could fully tear my arms to shreds, I was released, the back pressure sending me flat onto my stomach. The impact pushed all of the air out of my lungs, and I wheezed and gasped for air as I rolled over. I peeked back down the hallway. Whoever was at the other end of the wire had completely vanished.

I looked over at the wall Ryan was hung next to. Only shattered ceiling tiles lay on the floor, surrounded by small puddles of blood. Skewed lines of blood leading down into the hole in the floor painted the wall.

“Ruh…RYAN!?” I forced his name out of my throat. 

His screams trailed off into obscurity.

I fell to my knees. Guilt and shock spilled into my soul, freezing me in place. Pouring into like water filling some poor drowning sould lungs. My heart felt like it was about to explode, and the veins in my neck were pulsating rapidly. Tears began to swell in my eyes. How could I let this happen? As I ripped my jacket to patch my arm, a familiar pairing of words hit me harder than ever before.

*I did this.* It raced in my head like rats on a wheel. Spinning faster, gaining weight and momentum. I sat there, soaking in shame for what seemed like forever. 

But then, a familiar voice rang down the hall.

“Jay.” It echoed and then passed me. Familiar, angelic and sad, it sung through my brain distorting how I perceived it. I raised my head, and searched for the source. A shadowy figure stood at the end of the hall. Shockingly still. Unnaturally still. The kind of stillness that makes you realize how much living things are always moving—breathing, shifting, swaying. Tall, towering over the doors, it gazed down the hall with a fierce focus, bright white eyes piercing through me with incredible focus. *What the hell?* It turned away, and almost floated to the right side of the hall, disappearing around the corner.

I let out a fierce gasp as I forced myself to my feet and began to sprint down the hall after it. The corridor seemed the stretch and contort longer and longer as I ran. I began to think I’d never reach the end, like the tiles were just a long treadmill. As I reached the end I turned the corner and looked frantically for the figure.

“Luke??” I got no answer. He was gone.

This hallway was only about six feet deep and a lone familiar red wooden door sat at the end. Without even thinking about what I was doing, I walked towards it. 

I reached for the handle, hesitating slightly. Cautiously, I placed my hand on it. The metal was warm, like someone had just opened it. I slowly peered my head in.

It was…my room? Back at our apartment. Empty except for the furniture. I looked behind me and the hospital was still there. When I looked back, Luke and Ryan were sitting in the corner beside my bed and my decorations had returned. Ryan had his arm around Luke and was rubbing his hand up and down on Luke’s opposite arm, the two of them wrapped in a blanket. The gesture was gentle. Protective. Luke was covered in sweat, shaking violently, and his head was buried in his hands. His shoulders bounced up and down with silent grief.

“RYAN! I THOUG-“ Warmth spread over me as I stepped in. Poured into me like sunlight. The pain in my arm slowly faded away.

“Hey, buddy. Wanna swap out with me so I can go get us some food?”

“Whah? What’s…” Snakes of confusion swirled around in my head.

“Thanks, man.” He said as he gave Luke a hug. “I’m gonna hit Hong Kong, you want anything?” His voice was normal. Like he wasn’t just torn apart by barbed wire.

“I…I don’t…I don’t under-“ The words barely escaped my throat. My tongue wouldn’t work right.

“So your usual? Sounds good, you can get me back whenever.” He said, walking past me after patting his firm comforting palm on my shoulder. His hand solid, real and firm. I heard him pick up his keys and rush out the door. Something in my head snapped fiercely as I walked over to Luke, and I gave in to the warmth of this place. He looked up at me,

“Hey, buddy.” He greeted with a tired almost whisper in his voice. Like he was made of glass and might shatter. The most extreme sense of calm, and purity overcame me. 

I sat down next to him and leaned my head back on the wall. I no longer had control of my actions, my spirit left my body, only a spectator now. Bliss washed over me as I felt the hospital, the bar, and this awful town become a distant memory.

“How’re you feeling?” I asked. He didn’t budge, and began to shake. We sat there for a few moments, just relishing in each other’s company. He let out a sigh.

“I’m sorry.” He said, the words full of sorrow. I could hear the guilt in his voice.

“Why? You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, man. We all go through shit. I’m here.” He didn’t respond. I wrapped my arm around him, offering him the same protective gesture as Ryan. “We’re gonna get you through this, I promise.” He still had no words for me, and stared at the ground. “Do you remember that first summer we spent here?” I asked him. He seemed to be walking through his thoughts.

“…best summer of my life.” He said wearily.

“Three TVs in the living room, each of us bought new consoles, and we played that old gory fighting game for about sixteen hours straight? Pizza rolls, cream soda, and what was it that Ryan was eating?”

“Veggie dogs with mac and cheese on them.” He answered with a laugh. I thought back to when Ryan tried to go vegetarian. It didn’t work out.

“Dude that’s right! Those were actually surprisingly good.” I began to chuckle with him, and felt genuine happiness for the first time in so long.

“Now look at us.” A sense of longing drifted in his voice. “You know, I never wanted any of this.” I focused my attention on him as he spoke. “I don’t know why I keep letting things get so fucked up.” He crossed his arms on top of his knees and buried his face in them and began to cry again. 

“We’re gonna get back to that, buddy. I promise. Just a little bump in the road.” Silence took us over again.  “I love you, Luke.” I told him.

“I love you too.” He replied.

I relished in that bliss for a long time. Time stretched long and thin like taffy. What felt like hours went by as I enjoyed this time with my friend. If there was a heaven, it had to feel like this. The warmth and safety of it all. It had felt like it had been forever since I’d seen him. Everything I’d been through in the past few hours had all but melted away. 

“I left you a key.” Luke said softly, breaking the silence. I turned my head at him in confusion.

“Wha?…” I said softly. The trance was slowly unraveling. My mind began to twist and bend as the smell of iron singed my nostrils. I heard metal creaking and the sound of steam shooting out of pipes. I looked over at Luke, but he was gone. The room had contorted into a nightmare of red and orange metal. The walls were lined with rotted chain link fence, and chains with hooks hung from the ceiling. It was still my room, but it had turned into something putrid.

A distorted voice pulled me out of it. 

“I’m gonna die.” I looked over and I could see Luke slowly warping. His eyes darkening, and small streams of brown liquid dripped out of his mouth. “I’m gonna die, cold and alone.” His bones started to crack as his arms twisted upwards.

In Luke’s place, something horrifying finally looked back at me. It grotesquely sat there chattering its sharp, gap filled teeth. Its arms were twisted together above its head, bound in sickening fashion with barbed wire twirled into its skin. Its mangled fingers jerked with sporadic and jerking motions. Dirt brown skin clung tightly to its chest, held together by a zipper tracing diagonally from its collar bone down to its waist on the opposite side. Its limbs appeared to be stitched on and one leg was sewn on backwards. It lacked eyelids, and stared back at me wildly with bloodshot dark red-brown eyes. 

“Why did you let me leave?” The stench of its breath hit me like a truck. Any air I had stored in my lungs left me. I stumbled frantically up to my feet, trying to catch my breath. As it tried to stand up, it looked down, a sick gargling forming in its throat. Before it could lift its head, it threw up an unfathomable amount of visceral black liquid onto the floor, then tiredly looked up at me, still clicking its teeth.

Before it could even think about coming towards me, I was at the door, twisting and pulling with all my strength. My wounds throbbed as my forearm flexed, but I pushed it out of mind as I frantically did everything I could to get out of that room.

“C’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon.” I looked over my shoulder, and could see the creature was about three feet closer to me, waddling and shaking its way over. “C’MON C’MON!” There was still no give in the door. “FUCK THIS!” I shouted as I started ramming my shoulder into the door. I felt helpless again, but kept at it. I could feel that things energy right behind me, and I couldn’t bring myself to face it. I kicked my leg out behind me and planted my foot into its stomach. As it fell back, it vomitted violently up into the air, a decent amount of it slopping onto my back and in my hair. The smell almost took my strength, but I shook myself back and threw my shoulder into the door one last time.

I could feel it about to dislocate by the time the door finally gave way. The creature yelled like a crazed man, its voice twisting with different inflections and octaves.

“PLEASE DOON’T LEAAAVE!” 

I fell through with an explosion of wooden splinters, and hit the ground hard. The shock of the landing sent a dull yet intense pain through my entire upper half. 

I threw my body around to face that thing again. But there was no red door and no monstrosity to fight. All that was left was a hospital room entranceway. 

“What?…” I looked around. Trying to find any trace of it. I heard footsteps racing around the corner. 

“Jay!? Are you alright!?” My head started to spin. 

“R…Ryan?” My lungs almost burned as I pushed the words out. I looked down at my arm. Clean. *What the fuck?* I thought. He held out his hand to me, and I accepted the help. I did my best to gather myself as I stood, but something came over me and I lunged at my friend, wrapping my arms around him tightly.

“Jay…you good man?”

“There’s something wrong with this place, Ryan.” I finally confessed. I’d been pushing it out of my mind, trying so desperately to focus on the task at hand. “Where’s Luke? Could he really be here?” He placed one hand on my back and gripped my jacket tightly, then gently pushed against my chest to get me to release him.

“Yeah, this place is a ghost town for sure.”

“No, Ryan. I mean seriously wrong. I’ve been seeing things ever since the bar.” He gave me a very confused look.

——

Ryan’s face grew whiter and whiter as I walked him through what I’d seen, and if it had been anyone but him, he wouldn’t have believed me. Guilt began to wash over me.

“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m so sorry you got dragged into this, I should’ve come alone.” 

“Jay. I made the decision to come. It’s not on you, I promise. We’re gonna get through this. Sooner rather than later, I hope.”

I pulled the key from my jacket pocket.

“This has to mean something right? I mean he said he left it for us.” The question filled the air with urgency. Right as the words left my mouth, the fluorescent lights above us started to blink— not random electrical failure, but purposeful. *Click-click-click* down the corridor away from the exit. We froze, watching the darkness chase the light, or the light chase the darkness— I couldn’t tell which. We stood there a moment, letting it complete the sequence multiple times, before looking at each other, and then back down the hall. 

“We have to leave.” Ryan said insistently. “Now.” He pointed down the hall to the stairwell with an illuminated exit sign inviting us to escape. We jogged down the hall and as Ryan pushed into the bar, it wouldn’t budge. He pushed again, and again. 
“Fuck!” He screamed, giving the door a kick in anger. 

“What if it’s Luke? Trying to tell us where to go.” I said.

“Do you not hear how you sound?” But the lights began to flicker faster, insisting we listen to them. I gave him a sharp look.

“Goddamnit.” He sighed. “OKAY, let’s follow the crazy fucking lights.”

Entranced, we started to make our way down the hall, following the lights as they guided us through the wing. The temperature seemed to drop with every clink and hum of the fluorescent tubes above us. As we turned a corner, the corridor in front of us seemed impossibly long. But we obliged, passing a nurses station, and….another? And then another.

“That’s the same fucking cutout Jay! We’ve passed it three times!” As if bending the lights to his will, the bulb right above us blinked rapidly, screaming at us to get our attention. As we focused our eyes upwards, a light blinking in the stairwell just next to us began to blink, and we heard the lock unlatch with a hollow *CLUNK*. 

I pushed the door open, hesitantly, and the lights blinked in sequence down the stairs, descending into the inner bowels of the hospital.

“Fuck.” Ryan whispered. We followed the lights once again. Down. Further and further down. Pulling us into the lower basement levels of the building. The air grew thicker the further we descended. Chemical-sweet with disinfectant trying to mask something putrid underneath. The combination of the cold, and the scent of it all began to make me feel dizzy. 

A slight warmth in my jacket began to tug at my nerves. I dug around in my pocket for the key, and when I finally curled my fingers around it, it was warm, and getting hotter as we descended.

“Ryan, check this out.” I said, tossing him the key. As he caught it, he stared back at me with a bewildered look in his eyes.

“This is fucking insane.” But we didn’t stop walking down the stairs. The walls began to look more…decayed as we ventured further. This stairwell felt endless. Each flight down felt colder and smelled worse than the last.

We had to have been miles underground when the steps finally came to an end, and the key almost burned in my hand. The lights stopped flickering at a door marked MORGUE. The sign was old, the kind of lettering they don't use anymore. 

“Jay?” Ryan looked at me, concern spread across his pale features. “What the fuck is this?” I didn’t answer him, I couldn’t. A giant pit grew in my stomach. This couldn’t be real, it just couldn’t. It had to be another hallucination. Determined to prove myself right, I reached for the door, but before I could reach  it, it swung open furiously, letting out a soft pneumatic hiss, the room exhaling stale old air.

It was even colder in the morgue than in the stairwell. Rusted metal drawers lined the walls, incapable of reflecting any light back at us. The walls seeped orange and red liquid, trailing down and pooling on the floor.

I scanned each drawer, looking for any sort of reason why we’d been led down here. Each drawer had a slot for a card, and each was empty. Finally, my eyes focused on a drawer at the end of the room. A tag rested in its slot. I ran over to it, and our worst fears were suddenly realized. I could only legibly make out “LUKE” but the rest of his name was violently scratched out. Grief and guilt encompassed me, washing over my body like a waterfall. Ryan slowly made his way over to me. He let out a sound - half-laugh, half-sob. 

"No. No, we would have heard. Someone would have called—" I reached out and wrapped my fingers around the handle. It was remarkably warm for how cold it was. “Don’t.” He said, but he was too late. I pulled open the drawer, and it let out loud violent squeaks as the tracks slid across the rollers. It was….empty…except for a piece of hospital stationary with Luke’s handwriting on it. 

*Come home. Please* I picked it up, revealing a Polaroid photo laying underneath it. 

“Here, hold this.” I said, handing Ryan the stationary. The photo felt warm, fresh, almost. It held three young skinny boys, their arms over each other’s shoulders, carrying big toothy smiles on their faces between its bold white frame. They couldn’t have been older than ten. My head began to spin…was this...us? Fuck it had to be us. I didn’t remember this, but it all started to come spilling back into my head as the faces in the picture grew more and more familiar. As I looked closer, I could make out a tall shadowy figure standing on the porch, but it was too distorted to make out any real features.

“Ryan, look!” I turned around violently and held the photo up. His face went pale as he examined it. “THATS US! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?”

“…Jay…the house…” The words softly flowed off his tongue, full of fear. Flipping the photo over, I looked closer. In big, black lettering across the siding read *1315* 

The temperature violently dropped, and the tone in the room shifted. Suddenly, one drawer in the opposite corner began to shake violently. The others all over the room quickly followed suit. Metal banging on metal pierced through my ear drums, almost causing them to ring. Then, one by one, starting with the drawer across the room, the drawers slid open in sequence, metal screeching against metal. The sound multiplied, echoing until it was almost deafening. I grabbed the photo and the note, shoving them in my pocket with the key, still burning hot.

"GO!" Ryan shouted, already moving.

We took off in a dead sprint for the door. Behind us, the temperature dropped so fast that frost crawled across the metal drawers, crackling like fracturing bones. I could feel something moving in the darkness of those open compartments— not getting out, but watching us as we ran.

My lungs burned as we took the stairs two at a time. As we rounded the top of the first flight, I started to risk a glance back.

“Don’t look,” Ryan gasped, grabbing my arm. “Don’t fucking look back!” The stairwell felt endless. I could feel myself wheezing as we passed the same floor number. Then twice. Then yet again. I wanted to give up, for the pain in my legs to stop, but Ryan charging ahead of me kept my mind straight. 

Just when I thought I was going to pass out, or throw up, or more likely both, we burst through a door onto cold white tiles. I rolled onto my back, gasping for air and sweating through my clothes. Rolling back over, I did what I could to get my feet back under me, but my legs were heavy and numb. 

We were in the waiting room, just as we left it. Plain, white, and sanitary. Empty chairs and a vacant reception desk.

I held out my hand to Ryan, who was still lying on his back, trying to catch his breath. He extended his arm to me and held on as I pulled him to his feet.

Fresh air, if you could call it that, greeted my lungs as we stepped out of the entranceway. We were still gasping for air as we stumbled out into the parking lot. I placed my hands on my knees and bent over, trying not to dry heave.

“Is that…my fucking  car?” Ryan said, breathing deeply between each phrase. I looked up, and spotted Ryan’s blue shitbox. He pulled his keys from his pocket and hit the alarm. *HONKHONKHONK* He pressed the unlock button. *beepbeep* “What- the fuck.”

Ryan tossed me the keys. “You’re driving.”

My hands shook as I grasped the handle and opened up the door. We sat in silence for a moment after I started the car. Letting the hum of the engine carry on for a while. Ryan reached over and pulled the photo out of my pocket. He studied it hard for a moment.

"I don't remember this house," he said quietly. "I don't remember this photo being taken." My knuckles were white on the steering wheel.

“Luke does.” I shifted the gear into drive, and sped out of the parking lot.

Things are coming back, slowly but surely. The process of translating the mess in my head is taking a bigger toll this time. I promise I’ll post more soon. It’s the only thing helping me make sense of any of it.
