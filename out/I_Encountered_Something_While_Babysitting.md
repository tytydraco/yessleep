Yesterday was the first time my sister let me babysit her one-year-old daughter while she went out to a friend's wedding. I was excited, yet nervous, as this was also the first time my sister left her daughter with someone else for a day. I love my niece, so, of course, I would take on the challenge of babysitting her.

She was pretty calm for the most part, and only whined when she wanted something, which was easily attainable. We spent the day playing with toys and watching her favorite shows on Netflix. When I tell you my niece was a ball of happiness yesterday, I mean it. She walked around with a silly grin, flashing her new teeth. It made me feel so much joy seeing her happy with me. That was, until I took her into my room for a nap.

We played for a bit before she started fussing again, so I picked her up and comforted her. I knew she wouldn't go to sleep if she wasn't tired, and I put her back on the ground to play. She fussed some more, but I realized that she was staring at something directly behind me. Turning, I faced the closed door. I thought nothing of it since I knew I had closed it upon entering my room. Glancing back at my niece, I could see that she was still whining at something behind me. Sighing, my eyes darted back to the door that was now slightly opened. *What the...* I thought before getting up. I pulled the door open and peeked outside. Nothing there seemed out of the ordinary. Shutting the door again, I looked at my niece, who was playing with her toys as if nothing happened. I laid her down on my bed, and she went to sleep fairly quickly. I placed a baby monitor on the nightstand and left the room, leaving the door opened a tad bit.

In the meantime, I managed to make some food for myself and even finished up watching a few shows. After a while, I began looking at the baby monitor, eyeing the room my niece was sleeping in. There she was, sound asleep on my bed. I smiled and continued watching the monitor. A few minutes went by, and out of the corner of my eyes, I saw a human-like shadow glide to my bed. Pausing, I thought the monitor must've glitched. I've seen videos of things like this happening, but everyone else's monitors ended up being broken, so I let it go. I started watching tv, hoping it would take my mind off what just happened. Suddenly, I heard a door slam shut. I jumped out of my chair and grabbed the baby monitor, spying it. The door to my bedroom was closed.

I bolted into the bedroom, where my niece was sitting in an upright position playing with her toys. My breathing hitched as I glanced around the room. Nothing was out of place. I turned back to my niece who was glancing at me with doll-like eyes. Bending down, I lifted her off the bed and was about to walk out, when I saw it. A pair of eyes peered at me from a crack in the closet door. 

Terrified, I sprinted out of my house, calling my sister and the police in the process. When the police came, I was standing in the middle of my driveway with my niece in my arms. They checked the entire house, but couldn't find anything. My sister came, and we went through the monitor's footage with investigators, but the footage seemed normal. No doors were slammed, no shadows walked through my room, and there was nobody in my closet. 

The police claimed I was making false reports and wasted their time, and my sister told me that I won't be seeing my niece for a while. I've tried everything, but nobody believes me. I don't think this was all in my head, I know what I saw, and I will never forget it. My family has since outcasted me, and everyone thinks I'm insane. I just wanted to come here and get this off my chest, and hopefully, someone can give me some answers to what's happening with me.
