If you don't know, wilko was a great store in the UK, mainly known for their garden and home stuff, but they also sold cosmetics and tech, i don't want to call them a department store, or a bargain store, but they just sold various stuff, ever since the pandemic they claimed to be having persistant supply chain problems, evident by their shops not always being fully restocked, maybe a week ago now they went into administration, and a few days ago, went bankrupt, one of the causes listed was the supply chain problems.

&#x200B;

Literally the day before they closed for good, i visited a local one, with the exception of a few blank shelves it seemed surprisingly well stocked, although maybe a bit understaffed, i had been in there for a few minutes when i suddenly stopped dead, a desire had possessed me, why would i just buy somethings that would be gone by a few years? like i could from any other store, prior to this, i had never stolen in my life, but i realized the future was bleak and i wanted something to remember this great shop, i started small, mainly just paper notes telling employees how to stock the shelves and how many items to put in one place, but i saw something in the tech aisle that got my heart racing, there was a half opened USB drive package sitting on the shelf, obviously someone tried to steal it but chickened out, without thinking i quickly looked around and slowly continued tearing until the 128 gb datacruiser came free, i palmed it, pocketed it, hid the ripped package well behind something else and continued with what would be my last purchase in a wilko, i crossed the threshold for the last time, pocket full of souviniers.

&#x200B;

I couldn't believe it was that simple, so easy, i had been needing a USB drive for work purposes for a while now, i did do it in front of a camera but i knew they didn't care, had it been a healthy shop i would have been in trouble, but do you think they had the money for security guards and store detectives? they were running on a skeleton crew as it was, and the claims of 'plain clothed store detectives' never seemed to ring true even years before.

&#x200B;

The next day i decided to try out my new USB drive, i plugged it into my laptop and to my surprise, there was already files on it? it's often not uncommon for a new USB drive to have files on it, often a software to promote backing up your files, but this had mutiple documents, pictures, some seemed to be scans of notes, pictures of the wilko itself, and even CCTV footage? all dated between the beginning of this year and the day before i took it, without thinking i clicked on a video.

&#x200B;

It was CCTV footage, dated May 14th 2023, at night, when the shop was closed, it seemed normal at first, but a few minutes in a black hooded figure appeared, almost like the grim reaper, there was heavy interfearence on the footage, like old TV, i thought i saw the letter A and a smily at one point, the footage suddenly cut to another camera monitoring a familar set of tills, the black figure walks into frame and behind a counter, it picks up a pneumatic pod, opens it and seems to be sucked into it like the stereotypical genie in a lamp, it then rolled under an inlet and was sucked up, i didn't realize they were that powerful, either that or the thing was somehow effecting the pod system, but the footage ended shortly after the pod was taken up.

&#x200B;

Other footage would show similar things, sometimes a pod would appear out of nowhere at 3 AM and would slowly unscrew only for this thing to come out of it, it was almost like the grim reaper, or a vampire, but instead of blood, it was money.

&#x200B;

The notes were cryptic to say the least

&#x200B;

'January 24th 2023, it's in our pods, in our supply chain, up and down the country, every branch is affected, i wouldn't be surprised if we don't make it to the end of the year'

&#x200B;

'Feburary 28th 2023, the manager didn't get the money, he got an empty pod, save for a piece of paper'

&#x200B;

There was a scan of this piece of paper, it was a drawing of a wilko underground, buried, at the surface, various competitors and online shops seemed to be dancing and laughing around the gravestone.

&#x200B;

There was more CCTV footage, showing this thing seemingly making hundreds of pounds worth of stock just vanish into thin air, whatever this thing was, it was only a vessel, a carrier, sent to do a deed by some competitor, so they could have the spaces and one less competitor to deal with.

&#x200B;

The last piece of footage was chilling, it was made on the same day as a note that read 'it's happened all over the country, we're not making it out of this year' it was dated shortly before they went into administration, the footage was again from the local store, it showed the thing completely emptying the place out, before exiting via the pod system.

&#x200B;

But what happened next almost made me shut the laptop off, suddenly without warning, the internet browser opened to an amazon page i'd never seen before, it had a picture of jeff bezoz holding a bloody knife, standing over a bleeding wilkos, a dead debenhams, toys r us, woolworths, edinburgh woollen mill, british home stores and so many other stores, just at that moment, a news flash appeared at the corner of my screen 'Wilko declares bankruptcy, all store locations to close' 

&#x200B;

And as soon as it appeared, the web browser closed and i could never find that page again, i tried to format the USB drive but it wouldn't, it refused everything i did, even a military grade wipe, nothing would make it the harmless USB drive anymore, and wilko never stocked sandisk products, it was cursed, an exploit, a backdoor, ready to bring bankruptcy unto whatever shop it happens to be planted into, i cracked it open, it was no mere USB stick, advanced circuitry showed it connected directly to centralized amazon servers, AI and all that big stuff, today i threw it into the fire, along with my laptop, it was on it's way out anyway, the last thing i want is the curse of bezoz haunting my life and my buisnesses.

&#x200B;

Code can cross it's way into the real world, and just like how malicious code does bad stuff on the computer, it too can in reality, support your local buisnesses while you can, because there is no escape from the amazon curse, and this AI is going for your blood next, a few months ago i had to stay in hospital with a sick family member for 3 hours longer, the blood test just went AWOL, according to the nurse 'we put it up the pneumatic tube and it's just vanished' don't worry about the family member though, they're fine and the second test didn't go AWOL luckily.

&#x200B;

It's a like a real life computer virus, exploiting a vulnerability in liminal spaces to bring people and buisnesses down, for a purpose, world domination.
