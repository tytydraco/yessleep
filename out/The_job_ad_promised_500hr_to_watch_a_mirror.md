I decided not to include the company name for your safety. Money cannot buy back sanity.

Im fresh out of high-school, with my own apartment in a shady suburban town. Ive been taking odd jobs left and right, walking people's dogs, doing yard work, I even helped at an old folks home for awhile. 

Im signed up for practically every newsletter available in my area, half of my day is spent applying for jobs or looking through my email for opportunities. One night, when I was scrolling through my spam folder on my old dell laptop, something interesting popped up.

**JOB OPPORTUNITY**
Needed: Worker with highschool education, healthy and young.  Able to stay awake for long periods of time. Unique appearance preferred.

Job description: Night shift security at a small office. Monitor a mirror for a 9-12hr shift. Salary: $500/hr.

**PLEASE REPLY WITH INFO TO APPLY**

My fingers paused their typing, my eyes glued to the screen. Nothing stuck out in my mind besides that promised pay. Holy shit, $500? I scrolled through it all again, checking off the boxes for requirements. I'm only 18, with no history of bad health, and crazy insomnia. Hell, I couldn't sleep if I was paid to.

The only odd thing about this to me was the unique appearance blip. Maybe its a company diversity policy, or something. But this wasn't going to be a problem for me, I was always an odd duck, anyways, with freckled skin and bright ginger hair, every class photo made me look like fucking Ronald McDonald. 

I entered my info, email address, full name, etc. After filling out the short application, I closed my laptop and set it down on the floor. I went through my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, got changed, and flopped onto my bed. 

I thought a bit about what the job might entail while scrolling on my phone, the blue light doing nothing to help my insomnia. Just before the sun began to rise I managed to fall asleep, sprawled out with my phone still in hand.

A loud ringing woke me up, the default tone of my old hand me down android. I picked it up hastily, holding it to my ear.

"Hello?" God, my voice sounded dry and cracked, offensive to my own ears.

"Goodmorning! We have looked over your application, and would like you to come in for training tonight!" A too cheerful for this time of morning voice chirped.

"Like an interview?" My voice was the opposite, unsure and awkward.

"Please come in for your induction tonight, no earlier than 3am." 

I paused before I spoke. Induction? They must have looked over my resume and decided unanimously I was a good fit, if I was already hired. And why the hell was it at 3am?

"Sure. Talk to you later." I hung up the phone. Dammit, I hadn't even asked why the odd hour. I wasn't confrontational, always just a pushover.

I decided to trace back the company number I got the call from, cracking open my laptop and finding the website. It was straight to the point, just a company name with a contact number and an hours list.

Mon-Fri: 12am-10am
Sat-Sun: 3am-3pm

Today was saturday, which explained why they wanted me to come in so late- well, early. I didn't think much of it, just deciding to browse the internet until the day passed. 

9am..

9pm..
1am..

2:30am. My eyes hurt from my laptops bright light, strained and heavy. The address wasnt far from where I lived, so I pulled on some jeans, combed through my hair with my hands, and hopped on my bike to ride down town.
