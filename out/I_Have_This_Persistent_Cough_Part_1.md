It’s been getting really really bad recently, and I’m starting to worry I might have gotten something worse than a cold or flu. What’s extra weird about it is when it started showing up…as well as what it’s been doing recently.
I’m typing this up from my old IPad as I lost my phone, so I’d like to apologise beforehand for any formatting errors. I don’t have a computer I can use, is all.

The cough started about a week ago, while I was out swimming with my dad (it gets really hot in February over here and I’m a short drive to the beach.) We took the dog, just because he’d also appreciate the cool-off the water provided.
Now, I have to keep that dog locked out of my room, for fear he’ll maul me or something. I miss him, I haven’t seen him in days. I hope dad is taking good care of him…besides the point.
At the beach there are these rocks, and you’re always told to steer clear of them by any lifeguards present, no matter if you’ve been there a thousand times over. They’ll have a completely normal conversation with you, but if you so much as offhandedly joke about those rocks, they turn stone cold. I’ve seen them dive in just to stop people from getting closer.
During this swim, it was night. I don’t fully remember what happened but I got pretty far out. I started to swim back to shore where my dad and my dog were playing, but before I could, a wave pushed me right into some of these rocks embedded into the bay floor. The angles and rough texture tore my right heel to shreds. At the time I didn’t notice because I was swimming as fast as I could, away from the wretched things before I got caught and fined or something by the patrol.
I caught back up to my dad, the dog was refusing to get in the water. I don’t know if he knew something or could smell something we couldn’t, but he was adamant on not getting any deeper than ankle height.

Dad: “There you are! I saw you head over out there, what were you doing?”
“I was just trying to warm up, I don’t know how you can stand this water so easily”
Dad: “Oh I’ll tell you all about it sometime, I think we should get going though, Jamie’s refusing to get in the water”
“Weird, usually he’s all for it”
Dad: “could be tired, or maybe he’s cooled off enough”

We headed out to the path, beyond the sandy beach, avoiding the shells along the coast like little bits of shrapnel trying to stick to your feet. We got to wear you would usually wash your feet off when the two of us noticed the large gash I had gotten on my heel.

Dad: “Now where did you get that?”
“Oh…I crashed into one of the rocks out in the bay a little… I’m fine really”
Dad: “Alright if you say you’re fine, you’re fine. But either way I’d like to get out of here before those pansies try to get some money out of us”
“Yeah sure, let’s just go”

After quickly washing up, we hopped back in the van to get home. I wrapped my foot in my towel, it stung from the sea water, and miniature bits of shell that got into it. But I didn’t want to make a fuss.
After getting home I tried to relax but my foot wouldn’t stop bleeding, thick rivulets of the stuff kept dripping from it onto the floor. I got tired of it in the end and had a shower, but that only made the pain worse from the heat radiating off the water. Eventually I just ended up applying a tight bandage and hoping it wouldn’t soak through till it healed.
I wouldn’t have to wait very long, because the next day it was fully healed. That’s also the day the coughing started.

The wound looked…weird. I was amazed it had healed so quickly, and I thought I may have imagined it in the first place…but there were little dried puddles of blood on my sheets. I gave the wound a closer look and it looked like the skin had healed over…wrong. It was bumpy and a little wavy. But it was intact and I couldn’t complain. Just before I stopped my observations, I swear I saw one of those wrinkles under the skin of my heel disappear, or sink into me. I looked again but it was as unmoving as ever, so I left it at that.

The day of school was uninspiring as always, and the work following was no different. Only I had a little trouble paying attention because every time I went to put my hand up or ask a question, I felt this little seed in the back of my throat, and I coughed. Coughing is no big deal, usually. But because it was so sudden, and I can’t go home without a medical certificate, I had to cover my mouth in case it was something contagious. So I mostly abated from talking too much that day in case that set it off.
The walk home however, things went wrong. 

It was a stinking hot day, and I had made the idiotic decision to wear a blazer and long pants. I could take off the blazer but couldn’t exactly walk home two thirds naked, so I put up with it.
It’s supposed to be a short walk, but I was dragging on. I felt weak, sluggish, like I hadn’t really eaten that day. My coughing got worse. The humidity turning it from a mild fit every hour to a constant wheeze.
I always did cough a little weird, like a mix between something normal and a barking noise, but this was different. Had almost this whistle to it. I listened as I went into another fit, just on the corner of my street. I collapsed to the ground, falling on my knees from the strain. The fit wouldn’t stop, I felt something stick in my throat like an ant, digging a little burrow below my Adam’s apple. It hurt. Badly. My body was shaking after the fact, and I had to muster all the strength I could just to get up.

My dad was at his computer when I got home, browsing away at some medicinal website that sells supplements.
“You know there’s a lot of doctors who reckon those things are a scam”
Dad: “Not if you’ve been reading what I’ve been reading. I tell ya, some of these guys know their stuff, and some definitely don’t. Besides that, how was school?”
“It was alright but I had this awful-“
I paused for a moment to hack and wheeze, putting a hand to my chest
“…cough”

My dad looked at me concerned, asking if I wanted to go see a doctor. I agreed and we set an appointment for in a few days.
So after a few more days of enduring this cough that never bloody waned, nor let up in any way, shape or form, did we go to the GP. We had to wait an hour until the appointment, despite arriving five minutes before it was set, of course. Once the doctor invited me in, I described my symptoms of a whistling, barking cough, and the constant weakness I felt when it was hotter.
Doc: “it’s probably just a flu and a bit of heatstroke. Combinations like that aren’t rare”
“What about the rocks? Do you think they would have anything to do with it?”
Doc: “Well you haven’t offered up any injury from them, the fast healing was strange but sometimes things like that happen. The wrinkles were probably from the fast growth”
Of course I hadn’t shown the doctor the injury, it had been gone for days. Even the wrinkles seemed to have smoothed over.
“Alright, I suppose I just try to stay out of hotter areas and keep cool?”
Doc: “Along with taking some days off school, yes. We wouldn’t want anyone else catching that rock flu of yours mm?”
“Yeah nah, that doesn’t sound any good”

It was a short appointment. Quite frankly a useless one, because none of the advice the doctor gave me did anything to calm my symptoms.
That’s when it started getting even more abnormal.
I left my bed for a short while, just to get some food and more water, always more water. I quickly realised that whatever I had, was dehydrating me, so I had to intake quite a bit just to keep up. Upon leaving my room I heard Jamie growl.
I turned to face him, smiling to try and calm him down. My face slowly turned longer as I saw he was standing strictly rigid, hackles upright, eyes locked onto me. He barked, once, twice, and he kept barking, taking a step closer each time. I slowly went back into my room, and called out,
“Dad? Could you get Jamie?”
I heard him trudge down the hall and calm the poor boy down. Cooing at him and leading him away, before opening up my door.
Dad: “What’s wrong with him? Barking at you or something?”
“Yeah, I’m not sure why, he seemed a bit scared”
Dad: “He’s an old dog, maybe he just forgot you, don’t worry he’ll come back around”
God I wish he did, I really really really wish he did.

I stayed in my room the rest of the day, scared Jamie would attack me otherwise for being an intruder. All the whole still coughing up a storm. Wheezing and retching was all I could do, no matter what I did, what I took, or how I lay in bed it was the only constant. The seed in my throat felt more like a golf ball now, buried and blocking my airway. I struggled to breathe past it.
I considered going to the doctor again, but I couldn’t get any words out. Dad offered to bring one in, but I declined. If he was in charge of choosing the doctor, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was some quack that made things worse than they already were. I didn’t want to take the risk.
I could barely sleep. I kept choking and coughing right as my eyes were on the cusp of fluttering closed. My eyelids felt like anvils, always pulling down, before the jolt of a whistling bark escaped my lungs to prop them up again.
Last night, things got fully out of hand.
It was the same thing, the wheezing, the choking, all of it. Except I could feel that golfball of mine shift. Up behind my Adam’s apple into the centre of my airway. It was trying to choke me out. I retched as hard as I could, before eventually…I coughed up a hard, wet object onto my bedcovers. A miniature copy of my head.
I threw it away, immediately. I was having none of it. I tried to sleep but the image of my own face, screwed up as if about to cry, looking up at me…I couldn’t do it.

Today I lost my phone, I don’t know where it could have disappeared to. All I know is that it is, in fact, gone. I pulled out my old IPad from underneath my bed, and began charging it up.
Something was bothering me though. I didn’t stop coughing after that. It subsided slightly but I felt weak, and the coughing refused to let up, in fact it felt like it had worsened. I still haven’t left my room, and I don’t plan on it any time soon. 

I began typing this up only now, even if it only ends up a recording, please know this.
I came here for answers, and I’ll be here as long as my sickness allows it and my dad keeps passing food through my door. Please help me find a way out.
