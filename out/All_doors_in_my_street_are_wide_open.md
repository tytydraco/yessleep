Every now and then, our front door is left wide open. That's not weird, it is easier to bring in groceries, move furniture or bring in bikes that way, after all. But I recently noticed that the door stays open way more often than usual, with no one to be seen around it. But that also isn't unsettling. Some people don't care about the safety of the front door and just leave it open. Others don't seem to notice that they open the door with just the right impulse to make it snap into place.



But today was strange. When I came home from uni, I noticed that all the doors in our street had been left open. Not unlocked or leaning, not. Wide open, as if the entire neighborhood decided to invite thieves to pack everything into comically large bags and skedaddle away with them.



It's also not just the front doors. Standing in front of our house, I noticed that the doors to the apartment on the first floor were also open. Chalk it up to my social insecurities, but I wasn't comfortable knocking on the doors or entering the apartment just like that. There could be dozens of reasons after all, right? Maybe someone wanted to do a prank. But why would a whole neighborhood gather up to prank a random buffoon like me? Maybe I missed a national catastrophe? I wouldn't be surprised if my confused ass didn't get the emergency warning. Or maybe there's a holiday that has just been established this year. But what holiday would convince over 600 Germans to play open house?



I couldn't think of any more questions I couldn't answer myself, so I made my way up to our apartment. I hoped that counting the steps of the staircase could distract me somehow. To no avail. It wouldn't have made any difference how much I could have calmed myself down during the ascent, because when I reached the seventy-second step of the stairway I directly stared onto the red/gray wallpaper that wraps around the inside wall of our hallway. Our door is open. But I am currently home alone.



A quick patrol through our rooms could at least confirm that no unwanted guest felt comfortable in our modest household. My parents also didn't seem to come back from their holiday. But what confused me especially was that also all the doors inside were opened as wide as possible. It's not like I close every door whenever I exit a room but I can tell you for sure that the closet doors were closed. I'm more sure about that than if I actually locked our apartment door.



That can't be a prank and can even less be some weird neo-holiday. I would be quite surprised if I missed a day where some dude from the cultural office came by and cracked open all the doors to, what, invite the holy spirit into our homes?



On my search for answers I finally contacted the emergency line. I didn't know what I would tell the person on the other end without seeming to be some kind of crazy lunatic, but it would be stupider to pretend like nothing happened. The rhythmic tone of the phone was slowly replaced by my growing inconsistent heartbeat. I realized that it took way too much time for someone to answer the phone, who's only job is to do just that. Slightly panicking, I went on to call my friends and family - without use. I called everyone - old friends, people I had a fall out with, my ex, even the pizza store two streets away...



Nothing. Nobody picked up.



I sent text messages to my most important people but now, roughly eight hours later, I still didn't get an answer. Just these two arrows that grin at me aggravatingly while I am despairingly waiting for anything.



The internet itself is still working. Most websites and apps are usable without issue. Electricity and water likewise. But my feeds on Reddit and BlueSky have been waiting for new posts for half an hour. Either all of humanity decided that social media indeed isn't good for our mental health, or the darker, somehow more realistic alternative happened. At least I can share my story with you, if you are somewhere out there.



My restlessness drove me more than the hunger that accumulated after a long day of uni. My curiosity and unease made me take action. Equipped with our titan shoe horn, which may or may not protect me from unwanted foes, I made my way downstairs into the fourth floor.



Nobody at home.



I continued into the third floor. Still nobody. Did you ever not care about your social incompetence? Because at this point I would love to meet a robber more than nobody.



After the second floor I just hoped for anything. Some kind of life. Even a corpse would be fine if it meant that my face isn't the last I got to see in my life.



Eventually I reached the front door again. The only closed door in the goddamn neighborhood. Exhausted, I sat down on the lowest step of the stairs and stared through the glass of the door into the empty hallways across the street. The weirdly pleasant smell of our laundry cellar crawled its way up the stair below me and into my nose. The cellar? Of course! If anything happened, people would hide in the cellar! But why would they leave the door open then? And why would nobody take their phones with them? They say that hope dies last but according to how my day went, I fear that hope isn't even born yet.





And you can be damn sure it isn't. The basement was empty.





The sound waves of a clearly audibly perceptible grumbling sprouted through the laundry cellar and lost itself in the labyrinth of drying clothes. The curiosity has been satisfied, so the hunger took over. Seventy-two steps still. Arriving in our flat again, I put the last frozen pizza into the oven and made a quick plate of veggies for the guinea pigs. The rest of the evening was made up of distracting YouTube videos until I rotted the last bits of my mind away with Instagram reels. The sleep procrastination has been a thorough one today. Already, the first sunbeams of the next summer day made their way through the curtain and straight into my face and an eery realization hit me hard: The birds, that usually screech through the window as if they would mock my fucked up sleeping schedule, are gone.



My "night" has been short and without sleep. The noon's sun crawled through the slit in the curtains and enlightened my dozing face until my body gathered enough motivation to get up. Well, motivation is well said. It's rather the bad feeling from starting the day late. It's weird that I still feel bad even if there is nobody that can be disappointed by me. But the human is best at criticizing itself after all.



Standing like a goblin, with eyes as wide open as the curtains, I started my way to the bathroom. But my walk was quickly halted. Adrenaline rushed through my blood, my eyes now as wide open as the door that I just locked yesterday. Has someone been in here?



I made another sweep through the flat with an unhealthy feeling of hope and anxiousness - it was futile.



With the door now barricaded with a cupboard, I tried to appreciate the warm shower as long as the warm water was still working. The infrastructure would be active for a few days - at least google told me so. I exited the shower with shriveled skin and made a plan for the day as I got myself ready. One thing is for sure: I shouldn't sleep in my bed again. Someone or something is able to open the doors. But that is a problem for later in the day. First, I need to buy groceries. Well, "buy".



Driving feels weird if you seem to be that last person... in the city? Driving through 30 km/h zones with full speed ahead and rushing down the main street is exactly the kind of freedom and ecstasy you would expect to feel in the apocalypse. The wailing of the engine that would get lost in a buzzing town or crowded highways screams prominently through the lone streets of the abandoned city.





I took my wallet with me. Why? Surely not to pay in an empty world. Is it even theft if there's nobody left? Communism does seem to work if you are the only one left.





The supermarket was open, of course. The mechanical sliding doors work nine to five and five to nine nowadays - just like all doors. Exploring the backstage of the market surely was interesting, but not really exciting. I grabbed as much canned food and instant ramen as I could carry into our apartment in one go and left again.



On my way home, the temptation of empty roads, that would soon turn into a race track of a hobbyist survivor, distracted me. With free fuel and a lack of other road participants I got lost in the sweet tones of my music that I appreciated even more now, considering the upcoming electrical fallout. But a weird distant noise grew ever closer and soon took over the sounds that danced out of the car's speakers.



Onto the middle of the Autobahn chimes a weird, windy wailing that lost itself in the horizon beyond the car. I looked around. The wailing, which now sounded like a cheap imitation of a wind instrument, became louder. And I, naturally, am getting closer to it. Soon I recognized something that would soon reveal itself as the source of that beautiful sound. I left the car and took a big step over the guardrail. In the distance, in the midst of the grass field, stood a deer. A stiff deer, surrounded by a flock of dead animals of the wilderness. As I went closer, I noticed a weird pattern on the deer's fur. No, not a pattern. A... texture? It was holes! The poor animal looked like someone came by and punched a bunch of holes into it. The melody grew more significant with every detail I could make out. The wailing vibrated my eardrums like a deep bass. My mind has been in stasis while my husk moved continuously towards the morbidly repurposed wild animal. In the midst of a dead field stood this proud instrument and played a song that sounded like nothing that ever existed before.



Then, a bunch of leaves punched me in the face. My trance has been broken by an unclaimed pile of leaves that dance with the winds that surround me. Some seconds of shock made me regather my thoughts until I realized what just happened. With a tempo that I didn't even know I could reach, I sprinted back to the car, pushed the windows back up and cranked the music so loudly that it would hurt my ears. Whatever was going on with that fucking deer, I don't care. Whatever happened to the animals around it doesn't need to happen to me.



The rest of the way home went rather calmly. I didn't feel like speeding after that shock, especially since the wind picked up quite a bit. The sky turned orange as I arrived home. "Home..." Sounds weird if you are not the one with control over the front door. Especially if I don't feel safe there, can I even call it my home?



Passing the doorstep to my room, I was greeted by a sudden loud noise. But this time it was a melody of comfort, rather than one of death. The guinea pigs demanded veggies and wheeked their lives out of their lungs as if they didn't have any food for the last week. Nasty beasts that granted me the last place of company in an empty world. After giving them their holy veggies, it was my turn. The last piece of fresh meat needed to be cooked before I began my strict diet of can't-go-bad food. With the pan on the stove, I sat down to let the meat cook and lost myself in my thoughts and the music that granted me comfortability. Suddenly, a black cloud pulled me back into reality. Shit, I forgot the stove. I quickly removed the pan and opened all the windows so the smoke could escape. Well, I guess my years of eating canned food started today.



After dinner I searched for the most important stuff for sleeping somewhere else. Sleeping bag, sleeping pad, enough water and a roll of toilet paper for emergencies. The garage will be my bedroom tonight.



I grabbed the keys and made my way into the courtyard behind our house. I didn't park the car there - too lazy - so I didn't need to prepare a lot. After setting up camp I closed the garage door and barricaded the closing mechanism so nothing could get in. Whatever opens these doors doesn't seem to need a key.



Despite the small light that my dad installed centuries ago, a dark but somehow cozy atmosphere filled the room. My roommates shifted from divas in rodent costumes to small eight-legged guys and gals that made their homes in the corners of the cold car-holding structure and would protect me from any nasty vermin crawling in these streets. It is surprisingly cold for a summer night and the thin sleeping pad on the concrete floor doesn't really scream 'restful sleep.' I am guessing that today's experiences will keep me awake, but I am hoping that my exhaustion will put me to sleep.



I did sleep! For a bit. After only a few hours a stark draft found its way from underneath the garage door, past me and out the ventilation slits of the garage. A cold-induced shiver spread over my skin and interrupted my well-deserved sleep. Outside the garage, a raging wind took up in speed and distance. The rustle of the leaves outside announced an upcoming storm that I probably wouldn't forget so soon. It suddenly stopped. After an eternity of silence that hid in-between some just seconds, the wind picked up again; even heftier than before. Between the demonic wailing of the outside sounded one crash after another. Metallic screeching paints one devilish melody after another until the note sheet determined that my garage door would be the next drum to sound. Hefty impulses boxed against the aluminum door. The blocking of the mechanism seemed to work, but the integrity of the door was now worrying me. Suddenly, all the noises ceased again. A loud, last noise, harder than any before, impacted the garage door and immortalized a perfectly circular imprint on the only barrier between me and the hostile winds.



In shock, I waited until the sun greeted me through the slit under the door. The battered gate opened just wide enough to grant me my way out of the gray walls of the garage. What the fuck was that? And what does it want from me?



My questions were left unanswered and quickly forgotten as I looked at the scenery in front of me. I stood fossilized in the harsh winds when I saw that not just the garage doors, but also all windows were open. Firs doors and now windows? What kind of fucked-up game is being played here?



Thought after thought flooded my brain when I made my way up into my flat again. Just like the days before all doors were opened. The only obstacle on my way were the steps which carried my unsteady legs upwards. In hopes to distract myself yet again, I went to the kitchen first to prepare more veggies for the pigs. I don't have a lot to do in this world and I desperately need some distraction now. Rustling and faint squeaking fill the hallway after the pigs hear me opening the fridge. Impatient wheeking gossips into my ears if I even dare to carry some vegetables and curious eyes stare in my direction in hopes to get a bite of that juicy, tasty cucumber. But not today. The plate hit the ground. The clinking quickly turned into silence. They are gone. My trusted pets that greeted me day in and day out disappeared over night. Like the people left me. Like the fucking birds left me. Like every other hint of life that could bring some variety into my monotonous days.



That was the final blow. The final happening that separated my mind from my earthly husk. The floor gave way for my body to hit the ground, by thoughts storming around, leaving my motor functions useless in its wake.



After... I can't tell. Minutes? Hours? I could stand up again. Barely. The stream of panic-induced tears stopped and with the readjustment of my eyes, I noticed something new.



There is a crawl door on the wall. A closed door. A door that hasn't been there before and that should lead to the windy outside wall of the building. With a foggy mind I gathered myself and stumbled over to the tiny door. Shaking fingers slowly grabbed the knob and turned it. The door opened.



Behind it a long, narrow crawlspace revealed itself to me. It was like a tunnel. A wooden tunnel. Barely big enough for me to crawl through. Decorated with red wallpaper and ebony paneling, illuminated by candlelight in the distance. Without thinking, I got in. The tunnel was perfect for me. Just as wide as my shoulders and just as high as I am laying down. Meter after meter passed me. The tunnel felt like it got narrower the further I pushed on, but moving through wasn't a problem. After half of eternity I recognized a growing rectangle that marked the end of the crawlspace. Covered in sweat, I fell onto a wooden floor covered in an expensive rug that seemed just as old as the entryway I just went through.



Suddenly, I found myself inside some sort of mansion without windows. On the rug was an old sofa with a table and a tea set. The room was dark and quaint, only lit by the fireplace opposite to my entry. But standing was weird. The whole room was rotated a few degrees. The doors stood at another angle than the rest of the room. I began exploring this space. I found a kitchen, but everything is upside down. A bedroom without parallel walls. A bathroom without drainage. Everything appeared man-made, but not with intention. Like a cheap copy of the way that aristocrats lived 300 years ago. Built to be empty. Built for a man left behind by the rest of the world? Built to mock him?



Eventually, I stood in front of the last door. Behind the way too long dining hall is a gallery. Behind the gallery with empty canvases is the music room. And the music room is where I currently am. An anachronism in the middle of the only room that appeared to be normal. A man in a room from another time with a door that looked just like the one I entered this dimension through.



A hurting creaking accompanied the opening of the door. A small room, just enough for me to sit in, sits behind it. The floor is lined with pillows. At the wall is a desk with papers. Note sheets that didn't seem to make sense - all of them ripped or crossed out as if their author hated their work. Behind the desk emerged a set of metal pipes, similar to an organ. Not just there, all of the walls were covered in organ pipes of all sizes, controlled by a keyboard underneath the desk. The wall in front of me carried an inscription:



"The composer, from us he learned

A musician is what he's meant to be

Escaping his world is what he yearned

To orchestrate his symphony"



Without realizing it, the words slowly slit out of my mouth. After finishing the last words, faint winds left the pipes. The next moment was filled with terror and sound, as a hurricane of sounds let my eardrums vibrate like the tides of the ocean. Ripping tones played a melody that can only be described as the opposite of music. Filled with pain, I fled out of the small room, through the music room, through the gallery, over the dining table and through the hallway. I fled the screeching of the organ as I entered the crawlway again and emerged in my world.



I shut the door and stumbled down the stairs. "As far away as possible" was the only thought that powered my legs. I ran onto the street and entered my car. I don't care that I can't hear these sounds anymore, I had to leave. I couldn't risk being in the periphery of this hellish, freaked-up mansion.



But the car didn't start. Not even the dying sounds of the starting and dying engine. I could turn the keys as much as I wanted; the car appeared to be nothing more than decoration with a key hole. So I exited. Walking is enough as long as I can leave.



But my urge to go stopped suddenly. My ear canal experienced the next set of tones.



The wailing wind is blowing through the streets like an unstoppable double bass. Leaves are percussing like previously unheard bells that guide the blowing sounds of the tunes that enter and exit the buildings through their windows. The shrill sound from the manhole harmonizes with the wooshing that accumulates in my earlobes.



Sounds I have never heard before. Nobody had ever heard before. A transcending tune that is just the prelude. A celestial crescendo rains down upon me and washes all worries away underneath its highborn harmony. Hope has been born and its sparks evolved into a wildfire that lost itself in the consecrated tunes it dances to. The loneliness that was supposed to fill me left me and fulfillment took its step in this angelic arrangement.



I think the world as it exists now isn't as bad as I imagined.



The rest of my life will be guided by the supreme symphony.
