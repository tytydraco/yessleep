“She’s in the walls,” he said. 

I paused, not ready to jump to any conclusions. I’ve had clients say the craziest things, only for it to turn out to be something mundane, misunderstood. 

“You think I’m having difficulty telling reality apart from fantasy?" he continued, a tinge of spite in his tone. I blinked. Then I remembered. In one of our past sessions, he had shared some pretty implausible tales. Like how he was a master of black magic. He had talked about the hexes he had successfully cast in the past. I had gently probed his narrative, wanting to see how real his belief was to him. 

He must have realised I had doubted his grasp of reality. 

“I’m just curious, what do you mean by ‘she’s in the walls’?” I asked, keeping my expression pleasant, calm. He could still be talking about something perfectly normal. Like a rat. A lizard. 

“After I killed her, I placed her body behind the walls and bricked them up again.”

O…kay. He wasn’t leaving much room for doubt. 

“Are you saying that you killed the woman you’ve been…having nightmares about?” As I spoke, I flicked open up the web whatsapp window on my screen and typed a quick text to the clinic manager. ‘Potentially dangerous client, standby for emergency protocols.’

He nodded. “The bad dreams started a day after I killed her and sealed her behind the walls.”

He proceeded to tell me what he had been unwilling to tell me in our session last week. 

He told me how he had felt something strange stir within him when he had first caught sight of this woman. She worked near him. It wasn’t love. It was a fascinated contempt, a horrified disgust. He couldn’t take his mind off her, and followed her. Everywhere. He figured out her schedule, who she would meet, places she would go. 

He finally got her alone one day, down a route she occasionally took while going for her early morning runs. He didn’t have any brilliant plan in mind, and so he just struck her in the back of the head as she ran by, with a rock he kept in his pocket. 

She had fallen. He had simply scooped her up and carried her to his car parked nearby. No one was around to witness it in the wee hours of the morning. 

Still hoping for some normalcy, I tried to formulate what this could really be about. Maybe he needed attention. Maybe he liked to shock and awe others with outlandish tales. I mean, carrying an unconscious woman to his car? That couldn’t be as easy as he made it out to be.
Maybe, he wanted to test me. See how I would react to a wild tale of murder. Right?

“Why are you telling me this?” I asked. 

“Because of the nightmares. They wouldn’t stop. I tried not to tell you about it, to just work through the nightmares without context. But I realise I need you to know, so you can give me proper help.”

There was a dead earnest look in his eyes. 

Suddenly, I believed him. 

I could no longer try to poke holes in his story. This man meant every word he said.

‘Call the police, tell them a client just confessed to murder. Might be dangerous right now. Get them down here.’ I typed on the whatsapp chat, pretending to be taking notes. I had to break confidentiality at that point. It was legal protocol.

“The nightmares, yes. Tell me more about them. You said they were vivid. That you would wake up screaming. What did you dream about?” I asked, hoping to stall him until the police came. I was honestly also a little curious. He hadn’t been willing to tell me the contents of his nightmares last week.

“Just her face, right in front of mine. She would start off looking terrified, the way she looked when I slit her throat, then she would grin. A wicked grin. She was a wicked, evil woman.”

I fought the urge to raise an eyebrow. “She was a wicked woman, that was your sense in the dream?” I gave myself a pat on the back for keeping my tone clear of the disbelief and contempt I felt. He slit her throat, but she was evil? Holy shit. 

“She was always evil. I knew that. So I did what I needed to do. What the world needed me to do.” He smiled brightly at me, and winked. 

My stomach churned. It was a knowing wink, like we had some shared secret. I kept quiet, and he went on with his tale.

He told me about five minutes worth of the story, before the police came. 

He said he knew she was evil, from the dark aura he could see. He stalked her to make sure, and saw the horrible things she did to others. She was condescending, manipulative, rude, and a bully. He spat the word “bully” like it singed his lips to say it. Despite myself, I noted his reaction down in my clinical notes: ‘flinched at the word bully. has been bullied?’

He got rid of her, hid her body in the walls of some deserted building. 

He told me the building name. I knew it. I lived near it. I had watched dozens of stores open and shut down within months at that place. No one knew why business was so bad there. The location wasn’t great, but it wasn’t terrible either. But it was infamous for being bad luck for shop owners. It was in the process of being sold to a new owner for redevelopment.

“But I hear her now,” he said, fear flickering in his eyes. “When I lie awake late at night, she scratches at my walls. I know she’s not in there. I know where she lies. But the scratching, it wouldn’t stop.”

The door opened then, and two police officers stepped in. 

I was relieved that they had the sense not to sound the sirens or kick up a fuss before entering the room. I had been worried that my client would be triggered once alerted to the police’s arrival. I didn’t want him to hold me hostage, or something. 

They cuffed him, and took him away. 

He turned to face me right before they led him out the door. There was a look of calm and satisfaction on his face. Like he had expected me to call the police. Like he knew what would happen. And as if he wasn’t afraid of the consequences. Once again, he smiled. My insides curled.

I headed down to the police station and gave them all the details my client had told me about the murder. 

Once I got home, I took a shower, and downed some wine. It was a wild day. I was ready to put it behind me and get back to normal. I slept fitfully. There were flitting images of my client in my dreams. His look of satisfaction, his knowing wink. There was also a persistent scratching sound that I couldn’t locate. 

The next day, awake but in a fog, I was called back to the station.

“How did you know Anita?” (not the real name) was the first question I was asked. 

My brows furrowed. I knew only one Anita. Why were they asking about my crazy ex boss?

“She was my employer for a short while,” I responded. “I worked for her a few years back, for less than a year.”

“Did you part on bad terms?”

I bit my lip. Why was the investigator asking about this out of the blue? There was a sinking sensation in my gut.

“Yes. She was…difficult to work for. When I quit, she blew her top. Threatened me. Why are you asking about her?”

I had a terrible feeling I knew the answer. 

“Did you kill Anita?” 

My mouth went dry. I stared at him in disbelief, but his face was an impassive mask.

“No? No!” Shit. The woman in the walls. 

“Then how did you know the location of her body?”

I gaped at him. “The woman he killed. It was Anita, wasn’t it?”

“He’s saying he has no idea what you’re talking about. That you hypnotised him last session. Did something to his mind. He’s been having nightmares ever since.”

The fuck? I stared at the officer, mouth open.  

“Hey, right now, it’s he said, you said. We’re just trying to figure things out. But I’ve got to say, that man has no connection to Anita at all. No one’s spotted him near her, not even a text, a phone call, nothing. You, on the other hand…” he sighed. 

“You worked for her. You were open about your dislike for her. We saw some of your posts on social media. Subtle, vague, but quite clearly, targeted at her.”

“Posts? Social media?” I hated Anita, sure. But posting about her? I didn’t have that kind of guts. She was a terrifying, cunning bitch. She had considerable influence in our industry. She could make life pretty tough for me, as she had made it for many others. I had no wish to invite further backlash. 

The officer pulled out his phone, tapped on it for a bit, then showed it to me. 

Posts. From a social media account with my name on it, even my face. But it wasn’t my account. I told the officer so. 

“This account has been active for the past 2 years,” he said. “For 2 years, it has been posting intermittently under your identity, and you’ve never been informed, or aware about it?”

I grabbed his phone again, and looked at the account more closely. 

“It has 43 followers. Come on. And I bet none of them are my friends. How could I have found out about it? It’s not like I obsessively google my name or something.”

The officer took his phone back. He remained expressionless. 

The next two hours of interrogation were brutal. I told him in minute detail, all that I could remember about my employment under Anita, the fallout, the following months of insults and her attempts to blackball me. How her attempts failed, because by then, many in the industry knew her reputation. 

I even admitted to going for therapy sessions to deal with the trauma from it all. He said he might subpoena my therapist for clinical notes, but whatever. I didn’t say anything crazy during those therapy sessions. I couldn’t exactly be completely open and honest in sessions with fellow therapists, after all. We might still one day cross paths in our work. 

My could-have-been alibi, the doorbell camera, just so happened to be disconnected on the night she was murdered. I hadn’t even noticed. I only checked the footage whenever something cropped up. Like this investigation. 

I had gone to the park nearby for a walk that night, when I was supposedly murdering Anita. I told the police, and they went around the neighbourhood, looking for surveillance footage from shops, car dash cams, and witnesses who may have seen me. But there was nothing. 

By then, it was abundantly clear. I was being set up. Somehow, that client had been planning to murder Anita for years. He had been setting me up for years. 

It all looked bad for me. My history with Anita. My knowledge of exactly where she was hidden. How she died. The social media posts, which somehow had its I.P. tied in to my WiFi. I cursed myself for having a predictable WiFi password - ‘WiFiPassword’ 

The client claimed that he had never spoken about Anita. Or any murder. That he had recently come back for help with nightmares related to a past memory he hadn’t told me about. That I had hypnotised him. 

It was EMDR. I just let him access the memory related to the nightmares without telling me what it was, and did EMDR with him, letting his eyes follow my fingers as he accessed the traumatic memories. It was far from hypnosis. It was a legit tool to help with traumatic experiences. It was bilateral stimulation. 

It was nothing like hypnosis. The asshole had twisted everything. 

He told the police I made his nightmares worse. And that he didn’t know what happened during our most recent session. Said he had been dazed by my “hypnosis” when the police came. 

It’s incredible how easily someone can destroy your life, if they choose to.

One minute, I had my life together, more or less. Next, I was under suspicion of murder. 

I originally thought being innocent would clear my name quickly, but turns out, that’s not how the legal system works. 

Things only got worse. 

The night I got home after the interrogation, I downed a bottle of wine. Then I lay in bed, trying to sleep, to get some respite from the nightmare that my life was morphing into. 

A scraping sound roused me to full alertness. Another scraping sound. It was like something…scratching. 

There was something scratching behind my walls. 

My heart skipped a bit, and my breath caught in my throat. Hesitantly, gingerly, I pressed my ear to the wall.

The scratching was loud, like nails on drywall. It felt like something was scratching a centimetre from my ear. 

I jerked away from the wall, and sank back down on my bed, my limbs weak. 

There was another sound. Was it a whisper? I couldn’t tell. It was faint, covered by the scratching sounds.

I was imagining things, I told myself. The investigation was fraying my nerves. The wine had muddled my sanity. 

I thought of fleeing to a hotel for the night. But the police had told me to stay where I was. I didn’t want to look like I was running away.

I got back into bed and shut my eyes. I was imagining things, I repeatedly told myself.

The scratching continued. There was no way I could sleep. 

An agonising few minutes later, a soft humming started up. It rose in volume, until it resembled static. Or the type of sound a white noise machine might produce. The static began to overwhelm even the sounds of scratching.  I tried to sit up then,to get out of the house, consequences be damned. 

But I couldn’t. I was paralysed. I couldn’t even open my eyes. I struggled desperately, straining with every fiber of my being, screaming silently to the point where I thought my lungs would burst.

But I couldn’t move a single muscle. Couldn’t make the slightest sound. 

Then I dreamt. Or I think I did. 

I saw her, behind my closed lids. 

Anita knelt before me, begging for her life. 

An arm reached out. Mine. I grabbed Anita by her arm, and hit her in the side of her already bleeding head with a rock.

She collapsed to the ground, like a puppet with its strings cut.

I stood over her, grinning. A knife glinted. A knife that I held, I realised 

I knelt down, and placed the knife against Anita’s throat. 

I couldn’t stop it. Couldn’t will my hand to stop. Couldn’t wipe the grin from my face. 

Something rushed me from the side. I toppled over.

“You killed me!” Someone was screeching. I looked around frantically. A dark energy, like a swirling cloud. A flash of a maniacal smile from something within. “You killed me, and you’ll pay.”

The dark mass swept towards me. I screamed, fended whatever it was off with my arms. Silence. I looked around. Nothing was around me. No dark cloud. But Anita was there, a pool of blood spreading beneath her neck. 

I looked down. The knife in my hand was covered with blood. 

I woke up screaming. My shirt was soaked with perspiration. 

The police came for me a few hours after that. 

They told me they had found my prints. On her arm. 

Right where I had seen myself grab her, in the dream. 

I can’t explain it anymore. I know for a fact, I know with all my being, that I didn’t do it. I didn’t snap, split from reality, nothing. I remember the night she died. I was home. I got bored, and went for a walk in the park. I went home after my 45 minutes of brisk walking was up - I was trying to keep fit. 

But the dreams. The posts, the scratching in my walls. He had set me up, sure. But how could he have accessed my bedroom walls? My dreams? 

They arrested me. I was held for weeks, before a judge finally granted me bail. I was to be on house arrest until my case was tried. No flight risk, a stable career, good community relations, no priors. I was lucky to get bail, they said. I didn’t feel lucky at all. 

I got one text from that client in all this time. ‘Do you know what’s real?’ 

I had stared, confused, for a moment, before I flung the phone onto the sofa in anger. Was that what this was all about? Was he doing this to me because I had made some comments that suggested he might have broken from reality? Did he seek sessions with me just to set me up? Did he ever even need therapy?

I retrieved my phone within a minute, once I realised I could screenshot the text as evidence. But the text was gone. Evaporated into thin air. 

Maybe I really don’t know what’s real. Maybe I am losing my mind. 

I’m stuck at home for the next two months. Maybe longer, if there are delays in getting the case to court. 

My life is over. My reputation is in tatters.

And still, every night, the scratching goes on. The nightmares keep coming. I wake screaming every night. Anita’s face, contorted sometimes in rage, sometimes in agony. My client’s grin.  The dreams are so vivid they are starting to feel like memories. 

Maybe I should just give in. Say I did it. Plead guilty. Hope for the death sentence. 

Because I can’t live like this anymore[.](http://reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas)
