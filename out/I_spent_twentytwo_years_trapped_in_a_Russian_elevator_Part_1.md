In 2002, I was scheduled to attend a job interview in Omsk, Russia. That's in southwestern Siberia. I flew to Moscow, then took the Trans-Siberian Railway to Omsk. I was young, an unabashed Romantic and wanted a touch of adventure before the monotonous grind of work set in.

The trip was amazing. I met wonderful people and generally had a great time.

When I arrived in Omsk, I checked into a hotel I'd pre-booked. My room was on the tenth floor. Already thinking about the next day, I stepped into the elevator, pressed **10**, noting that the button didn't light up, and heard the old mechanism creak into life. Rattling, the carriage began to rise.

A minute went by.

The elevator was still rising, but there was no way to know the floor it was on. Although this was slower than the elevators I was used to, I convinced myself it was just post-Soviet reality. I'm lucky, I remember thinking, that the elevator works at all. Otherwise I'd be taking the stairs.

Another minute went by, and I began to worry. The carriage was obviously moving, but even a slow elevator should have reached the tenth floor. I looked over the controls and tried to figure out the Cyrillic. There had to be an emergency button, I told myself. In the meantime, I started pressing buttons at random, hoping to stop at any floor. The elevator rattled on and on and on.

Three minutes later, I was sure the elevator had become stuck, but I couldn't *feel* that being the case.

Seemingly, no button on the controls did anything. One or two lit up briefly. Most didn't even manage that. The building had fifteen floors, which matched the numbers on the controls, but how could I be riding fifteen floors in three minutes… four minutes… five minutes…

I banged on the walls, the door.

I jumped.

Nothing changed.

But I *was* moving. I was sure of that. 

Except how could I be travelling upwards for so long? I should have reached the building's top floor *and stopped.* I started to yell, in English and whatever Russian I knew. “Help! *Помощь!* I'm stuck in the elevator!”

Nobody answered.

The carriage kept on rattling and apparently rising.

This has to be an illusion, I thought. I can't continuously be going up. It would be impossible. The elevator was broken, yes; but so was my sense of motion, acceleration. I tried to settle my nerves by reminding myself I was a reasonable person, able to think through any situation even if my thoughts contradicted my own perceptions. If what I'm sensing cannot physically be true, I cannot trust my senses. Simple as that.

I searched the carriage for any indication of an emergency stop.

I didn't find one.

That's when I really started hitting the floors, the walls. Banging on them as hard as I could.

“Help!”

“Помощь!”

*Silence.*

But not true silence, because the elevator kept on rattling.

I slumped down in a corner and put my face in my shaking hands. Paranoid thoughts began to take over my mind. One of the carriage walls—the one opposite the doors—was a mirror, and suddenly I was convinced this was all a game, part of the interview: that the mirror was a two-way mirror, and behind it people were observing me, calmly noting my behaviour, evaluating me. I stood and stared into the mirror, and seeing only myself, I spoke to them: “I know you're there. Of course, I do. I've discovered your method. Let me out now and let's talk about it. If you think you've somehow broken me, found out something meaningful about my character, you're wrong.”

Nothing happened.

I sat back down. Hours passed in a haze of tiredness, panic and disbelief. I tried gauging the elevator's velocity, and using my estimate to calculate how far I'd travelled, even though I knew I couldn't be travelling that far. As a kid, I would sometimes close my eyes in elevators and try to predict the moment right before it stopped. Every once in a while, becoming aware of my racing heartbeat thrust me back into reality: a reality which failed to make sense.

Eventually someone at the hotel would figure out I was missing. Eventually, I would miss my interview. Somebody would try to find me. If I'm in the elevator, no one else can use it. *That's a problem. An out-of-service elevator is a problem for a hotel.*

At some point, maybe five hours after I had entered the elevator, I fell asleep. Briefly. When I woke I was sure I was in my hotel room because it was dark. I wasn't. The darkness was due to the only light in the elevator having gone out. I felt chills, tremors. There were tears in my eyes, but I didn't let them fall. I willed them away.

I decided the best thing to do was go to sleep. There was no use staying up, stressing out. I would sleep and someone would wake me up and apologize and tell me what was wrong with the elevator. I wanted out and I wanted an explanation. That was all.

I awoke on my own.

No friendly tap on the shoulder. No voice calling my name.

Just me on the hard floor of the elevator carriage in blackness, but at least not pitch blackness. While asleep, my eyes had adjusted to the gloom. I could make out the carriage interior again.

“Good morning,” I said to the mirror, because why not, but I no longer believed this was part of the interview. I don't know what I believed.

I began to feel thirst.

That terrified me because I didn't want to die of dehydration.

I imagined my body becoming a dried-out husk, the elevator doors opening, and my weak mind struggling to force my lips to speak as a gust of wind blew in, dispersing me as easily as sand.

*How long can one survive without water, three days?*

Much longer without food.

*But what am I thinking? I won't spend three days trapped in an elevator.*

I needed to pee.

As if from nothing, an intense pressure in my bladder that I couldn't ignore. It was maddening. I held it in for an hour before unzipping my pants and peeing in the corner of the carriage in embarrassment.

The urine just sat there, yellow and smelling.

I turned away from it.

I lay down, drew my knees up to my chest and rocked back and forth. I don't know for how long.

Some mental strength returned to me.

I got up and decided to climb the carriage walls and escape through the ceiling. I cursed myself for not thinking of that earlier. Something was above the ceiling, and I would soon see what.

But it was impossible.

There was no way past the ceiling. I didn't have any tools, and neither my fingers, fists or shoes could lift the ceiling or punch through it.

Back to the fetal position and the stench of my own piss.

I awoke for a second time—this time to a touch of coldness on my face. It was snowing. In the elevator carriage it was snowing!

*A blatant hallucination, yes?*

No.

The snow was real, falling through the carriage ceiling, which was now transparent and through which I could see the night sky, the stars. 

Two of the walls were transparent too. I saw wilderness through them.

Only the carriage doors and the mirror-wall opposite them remained unchanged. Before even being struck by the absurdity of this, I tried walking into the wilderness—only to walk painfully into an invisible barrier. The walls were still walls. I could merely see through them.

The air felt colder than before. Thinking about it made me think of the possibility of suffocation, and for a few seconds I physically struggled to breathe. However, there was no actual shortage of air. I was having a panic attack.

From somewhere deep without the carriage I heard a wolf howl.

The views to my left and right at least gave me something to look at. It wasn't static. Stars flickered, clouds moved. In moments of rational lucidity I looked for pixels, convinced the walls were digital screens. I didn't find any. Otherwise, I observed the landscape as if it were real.

I opened my mouth and let the gently falling snow land on my tongue, temporarily alleviating my mouth's insistent dryness.

*Wait, if snow can fall in*—I thought, rising excitedly to my feet, climbing and extending my arms. But no: I couldn't reach out beyond the ceiling. My hands hit a barrier.

Angry, I slapped the wall to my left, then to my right. I kicked the walls, punched them. Slammed my head against them until it hurt and my forehead was red. In the mirror, I saw a desperate madman staring back at me.

And the walls were like the ceiling. Passage through them was one-way only. The slow, cold Siberian wind blew in—across the volume of the carriage—but I couldn't even push a finger past them. For me, there was no exit.

Once I'd banged my head against the wall enough times to make myself dizzy, I slumped against it. The unrelenting rattling of the elevator combined with my limp, vertical orientation made me imagine I was back on the Trans-Siberian Railway. *Nighttime. I'd missed my stop. A uniformed worker was asking me if I wanted something to drink. “Tea? Water?”*

I lost my balance into a corner, propped myself up, and noticed water drops on the steel carriage doors, the mirror. I licked them. I was thirsty, and I licked them up. If anybody had been watching me from behind the mirror, they'd won. I was a weak man. In less than twenty-four hours I had been reduced to licking a dirty elevator door.

I cried.

I peed again, this time on the transparent wall, and watched the urine run down it like streaks of rain.

And through teary eyes I saw the sky outside the elevator begin gradually to brighten, swallowing the stars. I heard birds.

Dawn had come.

It was a new day—my *first* new day in the elevator.

I wonder, if I had known then how many more days there would be, would I have acted differently…

As it was, watching the sun rise not only renewed my mental strength, but it resharpened my mind. Because seeing the sun through one side of the elevator meant I could orient myself. I knew where east was, and therefore west, north and south. I observed a fact, and from it deduced several others. I could still reason. *I was not insane.*

I was still lost and frightened, shivering from both coldness and terrifying incomprehension, but I repeated to myself—and repeated, repeated, repeated —that for the majority of humanity's existence, fear was a natural state. Wherever I was, I had evolved to deal with it.
