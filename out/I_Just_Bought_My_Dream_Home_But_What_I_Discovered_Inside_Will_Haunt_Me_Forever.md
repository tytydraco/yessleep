I just moved into a new home, a beautiful, remodeled house with a grand entrance and a sprawling lawn. I was so excited to start my new life and spend the following weeks unpacking and decorating. But there was something strange about the house that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

It started with a door. The first time I noticed it was in the hallway. It was an old wooden door with intricate carvings, and I assumed it led to a storage space or a closet. I tried to open the door but, found that the handle was missing. So, I left the door alone and continued to unpack figured I would investigate it in the morning.

The next day, the door was gone. There was no sign of it in the hallway or anywhere else in the house. I searched the entire place, but there was no trace of the door. Tired and exhausted I shrugged it off thinking I might have been imagining the door with no handle after all it the placing didn’t make sense.

But then the door started appearing and disappearing at random places around the house. Sometimes it would be in the living room, other times in the master bedroom. And every time I tried to open it the handle would be gone.

One day, I was sitting in the living room when the door appeared in front of me. This time it was open. Inside I could see a dark, shadowy space beyond. I hesitated for a moment, but then curiosity got the better of me. I stepped through the door and found that other side was beyond anything I could have imagined.

The room was dark and foreboding, and I could hear strange cries coming from the distance. The walls were made of flesh, and strange writhing tendrils snaked through out the space. I tried to step back through the door, but to my horror it was gone.

I stumbled through the pulsating flesh room, calling out for help, but no one answered. The whispers grew louder, and the shadows seemed to be closing in. And then, I saw it. The door, it was back, just as suddenly as it had disappeared. I rushed towards it, desperate to escape.

When I stepped through the door, I realized I was in a similar area which looked like the inside of a living being. The air was thick with the stench of decay. The door started to disappear as the flesh surrounding the walls consumed it. I tried to run, but the walls seemed to be trapping me, pushing me forward. I came to the horrible realization that I was inside a creature, the house like an angler fish with its light had lured me with the door.

As I wandered through the living, breathing nightmare, I heard a voice. It was the voice of a person who claimed was owner of the house, a man who had disappeared without a trace just a few months ago. He explained how the house was ancient, it had been at the same location for thousands of years. The exterior changes but the house is always the same. In the past there was a group that worshipped the house and it fed of human sacrifices. Now the house has evolved to feed itself.

I knew we had to find a way out. We continued forward until reaching a dead end, and then I noticed hundreds of bodies absorbed by the house. Their bodies stuck inside of the walls, their eyes moving but their bodies standing still, only their cries could be heard.

The walls started to constrict, I screamed in terror, as our surrounding started to collapse, absorbing the previous owner’s life force until he too became part of the walls. From the corner of my eye, I noticed a door come out of the house’s fleshy walls.  The door standing still waiting for its next victim. Desperate I sprinted to the door, upon opening it I was relieved to find myself back into the original part of house.

I will never set a foot near the house, I will never come near it. I have received offers to buy the house, but I can’t subject another person to the trauma I lived. For now, all I can do is leave the house vacant so no one else will fall prey to the to its horrors. If you are reading this stay away from 123 Wysteria Ln.
