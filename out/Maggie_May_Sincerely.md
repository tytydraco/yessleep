**Part I - The End**

This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening. If I keep saying it maybe it will be true.

But it was happening. Tough times. Humpty Dumpty times. Out of gas in the desert with no bars times.

And, just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse than a Tijuana root canal; she walked in. Out of the sweltering Mexican heat, into the dim bar, she came; the only thing standing between me and the blinding light. I heard a couple of gunshots somewhere in the distance.

I still remember how the sun illuminated my 2pm rise and shine, shit-faced full of no caffeine afternoon after, hair of the dog; tequila shot and beer. Like I said, tough times on the Ponderosa, Hoss.

Every time I think of that moment, I stand transfixed in time. Unable to move, frozen in-place tighter than a suckered kid’s tongue to a Chicago lamppost in a February ice storm. Maggie had long ago won my heart’s devotion only to betray both me, and it, in ways still inconceivable to my sauce pan of a brain.

So, a couple of months ago, my life in post-apocalyptic ruin, I did what any red-blooded American would do; I flew across the border to CDMX to drown my sorrows in tequila and cheap living. And now, incomprehensibly, here she was; back, again like the September monsoon. Had the bitch air tagged me?

It seemed with Maggie my heart’s devotion was not enough. Everything she wanted and received soon became a dull knife; just ain’t cutting. Mags had to have it all, all the time. And I thought she had gotten all of me and more. Who’d think she’d want to pick at the carcass? But inexplicably, there she was like my constant migraine, the one that never really left the base of my skull.

Without a word Mags swooped in close like she missed me and now hadda kiss me.

Then, quicker than lightning showing off, she plunged her delicate-boned hand deep into my chest. She then removed it with even greater alacrity holding it high above her jet-black mane. She waved it for all the bar to see, my still beating *corazón* in it, color-coordinating against it’s will with her manicure, making what looked like vague Italian gestures.

Nobody in the bar paid us any mind.

I, on the other hand, couldn’t help but avert my horrified gaze into my now exposed chest cavity, only to witness darkness within darkness gazing back at me.

“*Heyyyyyy*,” a voiceless voice greeted and saluted.

I looked up at Maggie. She took the seat opposite mine. Then reaching over with her free hand commandeered my tequila and knocked it back quick. Her encore was to grab my beer and drain it with all the mud she could muster into my eye. Then, with a satisfied look she dropped the now emptied bottle on the wooden table hard enough to make a thud.

Maggie then met my stare. My cardia beating peripatetically in her freshly manicured right-hand she made an elaborate shrug, her face smug as a tyrant’s fart.

I remembered wondering what the fuck was keeping my cardio so vascular. It sure as fuck wasn’t clean living. Then, that voiceless voice had yet more to say.

“Now what, Spenser?” it asked.

Now, it was now my turn to shrug. Surprisingly, despite being a now certifiably heartless son of a bitch, I, too, had something to say. So, I said it.

“You’re fucking diabolical, Maggie.”

My words of judgment echoed clear, permeating deep into the abyss, then back again at Maggie. She caught my words easier than a kitten catches smiles. She just shrugged again. It was starting to get annoying.

“You ruined me,” I added just to be doing something.

The shrug undulated down from her tan and toned shoulder through her arm, finally coming to a full stop at her finger’s tips.

Waving my heart at me with more vague Italian gestures Mags asked, “How can you be so sure, Spenser?”

**Part II – The Middle**

*Sincerely, oh you know how I love you*

*I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine*

...

***This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening. My new mantra wasn’t working.***

Six months ago, I thought Maggie was the answer to my dreams.

Swooping down like an angel to shower me with attention and affection. Dinners with wine. Hot sex. More hot sex. No strings attached. Getting to know you pillow talk.

Now, there’s one thing I need to add. I met her through a dating app but as it turned out we both worked for the same nonprofit. We didn’t know each other as it’s a fairly big company but it turned out I supported the code for both her projects. This turned out to be one of many coincidences.

We both hated our jobs. We both liked writing short stories but never could sell a thing despite writing dozens and dozens. We both could dance salsa, on 1 and 2 and loved to *hablar en español que no era muy guapo.*

We both wanted to run away to Mexico city and live the Bohemian life.

Coincidences like we both grew up in NYC and had issues with our respective families of origin. And while she was Chinese-American and I was Russian-American both our fathers were born in the same year and were obsessed with Woody Allen. We both had much younger siblings we didn’t speak to.

Yeah, we had both grown up with weak fathers and selfish narcissistic mothers in common. And *worser* still, we had both experienced unstable living situations in high school. In my case, I was kicked out of the house for smoking weed.

In Maggie’s case, I never really was sure what went down but the best I could get out of her was at 13 she got pissed at her mom for cheating on her dad and left the house with nowhere to go. She ended up with family friends or relatives but the details were always murky and I was not the nosey type.

Her words to me were, “My mother’s emotional IQ is low. I raised myself.”

Impressively, she had made it through the Ivy League and seemed to be someone down to earth I could spend time with. But truth be told from the minute I saw her profile picture I was hotter than a Texas chili sprout for her.

It was some kind of primal attraction I thought I was long past entertaining. It wasn’t lust. It wasn’t love. It was like the thought of coming home to a family I never knew I had or that even could exist.

This shit made old me feel like young me again. But, as oft is the case in life, there was a problem. I was old, broke and probably about to lose my job. I was in IT and I was having problems with my manager being a psychopath; for reals.

It wasn’t mere conjecture as he had a reputation of getting people fired, or worse, making their lives so miserable they would quit; even with no prospects. I had been the focus of his sabotaging efforts and it had been having a bad effect on my mental and physical well-being.

This had taken a turn for the worse and I was catching a lot of passive aggressive hostility on the project Maggie supported.

Anyway, she was the bright spot in my otherwise mostly solitary and emotionally bleak life. And she lived nearby. She had an ex and kids and shared custody but I never met them and she didn’t really talk much about it except to say once, “You should need a license to have kids.”

I never had quite known what to make of some of the things she said, but like I said, I was under her spell. And I liked it.

And the icing on top? I had a dominant kinky side and that was a fire Maggie poured gasoline on every chance she got. She was worse than an arsonist in *Underoo* Town.

One weird thing about Mags was her knitting habit. If we weren’t fucking or eating she was knitting. Even at restaurants and bars.

One day in November, with the sun golden in a sky so blue you thought you could touch it I asked, “What are you knitting?”

Maggie gave me a wry look. She got out of her chair and seemed to be examining my bald head which I had shaved just that morning.

“A hat,” she replied.

But as the holidays rolled around things started to change. One Sunday morning as we were having coffee Maggie looked around the crowded steamy café.

“Everybody’s hooking up for the holidays,” she remarked.

I didn’t really know what to do with that one so I let it be.

But as the days went on there was a change in the weather. Fewer texts. Less sex. Maggie going out of town to some vague destination. Sending me sexy pictures of herself in Santa outfits after I caught the flu during Christmas.

A few days after Christmas I got a text late one night.

“Is it okay if I come by?”

“Very okay,” was my reply.

Maggie showed up with chocolate, red wine and the hat she had been knitting. Orange Afghani wool softer than a golden retriever’s fur. She put the hat on my head and then removed all my clothes.

“Let’s celebrate Christmas, Spenser.”

And, we did.

When we were done and lying head-to-head, I said, “I love my hat.”

Maggie said, “I made it especially for you. No matter what, don’t lose it.”

It was another one of those weird Maggie things she said, like, “I used to shoplift,” and shit like that.

I nodded.

“Promise me you’ll hold on to your hat, Spenser.”

“I promise.”

Maggie observed my face, then nodded as if confirming something to herself.

“Okay.”

Then we did that thing again.

That was the pinnacle. Things quickly went downhill for no reason I could discern. Texts unanswered and when answered; kind of abrupt-like. Being unavailable. Stuff with her kids. Time away in Connecticut for some vague reason. After that I began feeling like the weakest card in a gambler’s hand.

But Maggie kept shoe horning me in at odd times, giving me just enough crumbs to keep me on the hook. And as we rode the roller coaster down everything always seemed to center around alcohol. And sex. More and more debauched sex. Finally, by New Year’s Eve things were getting straight-up weird no chaser.

“You know that thing we talked about?”

By her tone I knew what she meant. I nodded cautiously.

“You want to try it?”

Maggie dropped a smile on me that would have had the serpent in the garden applying for unemployment.

“Yes,” she said.

So, we did.

I thought I had been imagining things. I thought we were back at the pinnacle. I could feel the love drug course through my veins. Things couldn’t be better. Or, so I thought.

*Oh Lord, won't you tell me why*

*I love that girlie so*

**The Following Monday**

The next Monday I was called into what turned out to be the most fucking bizarre moment of my fifty-eight years on this planet; and I’ve had some bizarre fucking moments growing up in south Brooklyn in the 1970’s; believe you me.

The company’s CIO, compliance officer, head of legal, head of HR and my evil manager, Conte Rugen were all in attendance, cameras ROLLING.

It appears I was being dismissed after 8 years loyal service for sexual assault, extortion, harassment, hate speech, insults to farm animals and every fucking other offense against God and man one could commit in these holiest of holy United States of America.

And just who had I… who had I.. victimized? Who had I preyed upon? Harassed? Gone full nutso on?

Maggie.

They had the goods. Recordings. Video. Ropes. Whips. Chains. Bad Spanglish. Maggie screaming, “No, papi! No!!!!”

I believe I was, what is known in legal parlance as, summarily fucked.

Nobody wanted to hear my side. How things were taken out of context. Things we had mutually consented to out of exciting and bonding trust and exploration.

“Did I have consent agreement?” I parroted back in shock to the head of legal.

“Did you get one when you fucked your mother in the ass before she shat you out?” I added just to keep my mouth from puking.

I was in bombshell shock. Maggie was my angel. Our situationship was supposed to be fucking healing from our abused childhoods and here I am now some kind of Tarantinoesque, Mr. Fucking Rapist? And my fucking manager once bragging about throwing a cat out a window when he was a juvenile delinquent?!?

There would be charges pressed. I would need an attorney. I might be arrested.

And it all happened faster than you can say, “Blue Monday, How I hate Blue Monday”.

And then Maggie sued the company. Take no fucking prisoners, Maggie. Disco-fucking-inferno burn that mother down we don’t need no water let the motherfucker burn Maggie. I wondered if her ex had been left on food stamps after the divorce.

A few months and my life savings and retirement account after that the criminal case got pleaded down to misdemeanor assault and I was able to arbitrate with my employer and Maggie’s lawyer leaving me with some clothes, my passport and precisely enough plastic to fly into the sweltering Mexican heat. So, fly into it I did.

**Part III – The Beginning**

*Sincerely, oh you know how I love you*

*I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine*

*Oh Lord, won't you tell me why*

*I love that girlie so*

*She doesn't want me*

*But I'll never never never never let her go*

...

“I wish you’d stop waving that thing at me,” I said gesturing at my heart with my chin.

“You’re still upset,” Maggie said. It wasn’t a question.

“You fucking abused me. You fucking eviscerated me. Yeah, you could say I’m a little perturbed.”

“But you’re still wearing the hat,” she said smiling.

“It’s a bad ass hat,” I said. It was after all. Why cut off your nose to spite your face?

“I put a lot of time and thought into it,” she said. My heart continued to beat in her hand.

*...*

*Oh Lord, won't you tell me why*

*I love that girlie so*

*She doesn't want me*

*But I'll never never never never let her go*

*...*

“Look,” she said waving my heart at me.

“I really wish you wouldn’t wave that around like that.”

The voice in the abyss in my chest spoke. It said, “Wait for it.”

Maggie said, “Spenser, you poor fucking sap. You hate your fucking job. You try to do the right fucking thing and speak up and you get kicked around like a dog. You try to love hard and you get beat up and left in an alley. You try to write books and start businesses and you end up bankrupt or dead.

And now look at you! You don’t have a care in the fucking world. You don’t have a shitty job. You are in beautiful Mexico City with the girl of your dreams. You say your heart was hardened? Well, I say it feels pretty fucking soft and sweet to me. Like the hat I knitted you. With the pom pom.  And you know what?”

“What?” I heard myself murmur?

The abyss in my chest said, “Yeah, what?”

“Well, one the fucking pom pom has a beacon so I knew where you were the whole fucking time you sap. So I can tell you this true. And I will. So here I am in fucking Mexico sweating my tits off. And I am telling you this," she said nodding at my cardio, "is a very good heart. And I am putting it back where it belongs.

There is nothing wrong with it and now nobody can hurt it again. And if you want to write a book now you have something, and someone,” she added with a wry smile, “to write about.”

Then lightning quick Maggie put it back in my chest and removing her hand made a quick flourish gesturing for the waitress.

“Botella de tequila, por favor!”

I looked down at my chest. Everything seemed to be the way it had been before she ripped out my heart. Only different.

I was about to speak. Maggie raised a hand.

The waitress appeared like a wraith and put down a bottle of Don Julio and two fresh shot glasses and two cold ones.

Maggie poured two shots and pushed one at me with the hand that had been holding my cardio captive. She then fished around in her pocket and found her phone.

“What the fuck, right," that's what your thinking, Spenser. Yeah, what the fuck is right. Look at this baby boy,” she said and then pushed her phone next to the shot glass.

I was looking at what appeared to be a bank balance that appeared ready, willing and able to face fuck an extraordinarily tall giraffe. I felt the migraine disappear like a bad dream.

Maggie gave me a wry smile.

She pushed the shot glass closer to me and picked hers up. I felt my elbow bending. It felt okay.

She tilted her shot at me and said, "Here's looking at you, kid," and took the shot. I drank mine.

We put our glasses down.

“You can negotiate anything," she said, then added, "sincerely.”

And then, then she kissed me.

*Oh say you'll be mine*

*Oo-eee, oo-eee-oo, ooi-ooi-ooo*
