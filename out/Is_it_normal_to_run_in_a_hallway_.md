I need to recount a harrowing experience that unfolded when my curiosity led me to participate in a ritualistic invocation with a friend. This unsettling tale took a dark turn when, following our venture into the supernatural, my friend inexplicably vanished from campus, leaving behind a lingering mystery that intensified the horror of our shared encounter.

As the ritual concluded, a palpable tension settled over us. What had begun as a curious exploration into the unknown now carried an unsettling weight. My friend, whose eyes mirrored a mix of apprehension and curiosity, shared a silent acknowledgment that we had unleashed something beyond our comprehension.

That very night, the footsteps manifested in the hallwayâ€”swift, purposeful, and echoing with a malevolent intent. The spectral presence we had unwittingly invited seemed to relish in tormenting us. As the nights wore on, the footsteps became more pronounced, creating an eerie cadence that resonated through the desolate corridors.
