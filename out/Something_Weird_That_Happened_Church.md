When I was a kid my parents used to force me to go to church with them. They were very superstitious and so naturally they were drawn to hyper charismatic pentecostal churches. For those who might not know, the charismatic pentecostal churches are the ones that speak in ‘tongues’ (gibberish) and do all that weird stuff like rolling around and ‘casting out devils’. Anyways we were members of a congregation that would meet up in a little shed in the middle of nowhere. When I say middle of nowhere I mean middle of nowhere. Looking back I’m pretty sure our ‘church’ was built without permits or anything. We had no running water, our bathroom was an outhouse and we had no electricity. It was very primitive. The congregation was made up of Spanish-speaking families (most were immigrants). I can honestly say that looking back at that time it was the worst experience of my life. The ‘Pastor’ was some old man that had served prison time and believed that he was part of a select group of pastors that were on earth to fight off demons. The services always involved ‘casting out devils’, reading very little scripture and singing while other members spoke in ‘tongues’. Even before this incident it has always freaked me out. My mom and dad were loyal members. My dad would tithe half of his income to the church. My mom would always be in the kitchen cooking for church events or fundraisers. The people were the worst. Nothing but a bunch of holier-than-thous that spent most of their time talking crap and gossiping about one another behind their back. I digress



One day. One hot summer day. We all met up for our usual Thursday evening service. Again, this church was in the middle of nowhere. Picture a single story church in the middle of the desert. Only roads leading to it were dirt roads with no names. 

My parents and I went early to help set up. We’d always have service and then eat a big meal with the church afterwards. 

We got there and started to set up the instruments. My dad hooked everything up to the generator and my mom unpacked the food. People started to slowly trickle in. Most went inside to escape the heat, some stayed outside to escape the crowd.Off in the distance we saw someone walking up to the church. Again middle of nowhere (everyone drove there because it was so secluded). As the figure got closer we noticed that it was an older woman. A slender elderly caucasian woman in an ankle length white dress. She didn’t seem to have a problem with the heat or long walk. The ends of her dress were covered in dirt.  She walked up to us with a huge smile on her face. 



Side Note: It was a Latino-Spanish speaking church. The songs were in spanish, the sermon was in spanish and most of the members only spoke spanish. Perfectly fair to say the church was a little racist. 



Before she got within earshot we all walked inside. Some seemed annoyed that we were going to have a visitor (especially because it was a white lady). Our Pastor greeted her after she walked in. He told her that this was a Spanish speaking church and there would be no English at all. The old woman was fine with it. She said she could understand all languages. 



The woman's smile never waivered. She sat in the front row in the middle pew, directly in front of the pulpit. No one wanted to sit next to her. One man tried to welcome her but because of his limited English he was only able to say “hello” and his name. She nodded and smiled at him. The absence of conversation made the interaction awkward and her smile visibly unnerved him. 



As the sermon began the pastor did his typical spew of how most everyone is going to hell and only those that keep themselves from sin are truly saved. The woman sat motionless, just staring up at the man as he cried aloud. 



He read one or two verses and pound his pulpit. At this she chuckled. 



Looking around I could see the ushers on either side of the chairs staring at her. The pastor didn’t let the quiet laughter impede his performance. He kept yelling about sin. He was yelling about immodesty and how women dress like harlots. He pointed at  the older woman. He made a big deal about how she hadn’t brought a head covering. At this one of the members discreetly gave the older woman a scarf to put over her head. The older woman took the scarf and draped it over her white hair. Her fingertips were black. They looked as though they were frostbitten but she nimbly tied her head covering and resumed to stare at the stage. 



The band went up next and began to play their instruments. This is when the pastor would go around and start to ‘cast out evil spirits’ out of people.

We would have pukebags that we would hand out to people. They would get the ‘evil spirit’ cast out of them and then they would just start spitting loogies and sometimes threw up in the bag (all while bawling their eyes out). This was also when some people would throw themselves on the floor and wiggle like fish, some would start to speak in ‘tongues’. And this is when it started to get weird.



The woman was clapping along with the music when the pastor walked up to her. He met her gaze and with the palm of his hand he tapped her forehead- HARD. The slap almost made the band stop playing. She recoiled back from the tap and grabbed her forehead. Her smile turned into a painfilled wince. A few men came to check on her and as they began to hold her hand her smile came back and she began to speak in ‘tongues’. A low grumble at first. A few phrases. And then all at once it started to pour out of her. I can’t describe the sound but it was eerie. Deep and echoing. She was ‘glorifying’ God but the inflection and tone didn’t sound sincere (it came across as mocking to me). Everyone loved it. People were praising the Lord and pastor seemed pretty happy with himself. As the woman was looking up towards the ceiling, her hands up and cupped towards heaven the congregation praised and yelled “hallelujah”. She suddenly vomited black goo (it erupted out of her). The ushers quickly gave her a puke bag and she heaved into it, filling it up almost to the brim. Black goo.



Men continued their praising, women cried in excitement. Then the Pastor took to the pulpit again. The band quieted down as the preacher preached. He asked the congregation to take a seat. This time the older woman had people sitting to her left and right. Her performance had made the crowd warm up to her. Her smiley facade intact she stared at the pastor with the same level of dedication as before. 



He again read small snippets of scripture and focused on one word. Using that word as a jumping off point he began to praise his power and how God can use him to give heathens the power of ‘tongues’. The audience went wild and the woman looked to her right and then left as they cheered at her abilities. 

Then she turned her head back to her right. Nodding and accepting the applause she continued to turn her head right. The applause slowly died down as she kept turning her head. Past her shoulder she continued to rotate her head. Her smile did not leave her face as she torqued her head even more. The crowd gasped and parted away from her as her head was now fully turned at 180 degrees. The pastor was silent with fear. 



She looked right at me and I will never forget her face. A wide smile with black eyes and black spittle running down the corner of her mouth.



I felt a vibration inside my skull, my vision trembling and I was frozen in fear. 



I can’t really remember what happened after that. I know she was kicked out. Politely asked to leave. For all their ‘demon exercising’ no one dared to rebuke her. She just straightened up and walked out.



She left and never came back.
