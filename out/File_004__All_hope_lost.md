I have lost count at how many days it’s been now. Frankly, all I know is that it has been over two years since the day my life changed forever. On June 3, *REDACTED*
I murdered one of my own children.

Friends and family members even began arguing with me about it, but the fact of the matter is this, I let my son wonder to his own demise.

….Let’s see, ah, once again, sorry it’s be awhile I feel like I need to reintroduce myself. my name is Jacob, Jacob Hager. I am a psychologist that..well I used to be a psychologist. I worked at an office east side of Arizona. 

After my sons disappearance, I began spiraling down a sick rabbit hole dissecting this hell on earth. You see,Throughout my 23 years of psychological practice and study, I had never heard about this until the a young man by the name of Jermaine bishop, walked in my door.

The boy told me what was clearly a traumatic event in his life, he began talking about this party he went to, however, he was dared to go in a cave.

I’ll spare you the disgusting and vivid story that the young man who looked tired, restless, and ten years older than he actually was. Unfold what sounded like a horror movie.

Let me explain quickly, this hard drive only has a little storage. A cave by the name “the devils lair” now bestows the title of this unknown phenomenon. At first I didn’t believe it, I thought drugs was the blame for all these wild things I was hearing. That was until it came into my life, through out the months I’ve had three people

I’ll never forget eating breakfast, residing in a lazy boy, pajamas, and a T shirt that definitely would’ve needed a wash. “And in local news, parents please talk to your children and teens in the house. An area just outside west Arizona, a cave has become a sight that many teens have not returned from.” 

I had to turn the television off after that but I knew, if I was gonna avenge my son. It has to be done before the authorities are all over it. That was short lived however, as just in three days time, yellow tape lined the chipped and decaying old red barn that sat I say three hundred yards away from the mountain that has the cave entrance.

A couple weeks rolled by, I had taken the down time to prepare myself for god knows what. I have this mindset of end it or die now. once I lost everything, I had lost every purpose for living besides one thing, and one thing only, avenging my son.

As I put my bag together gearing up for the trip, I started double checking to make sure I am not forgetting once single item before I go in.

“Let’s see here.” I spoke out loud to myself as I looked at all the things lined out across my garage floor. A headlight, two flashlights, a lighter, climbing rope and a hook, a thermos filled with water, A 10 pack of highlighter yellow glow-sticks, some energy bars, and to finish it off, a Glock-19 I was carrying on me.

I let a sigh of relief as I put everything into the bag, although, with cops near by, hopefully if I need to use the gun, worst comes to worst? They help me fight whatever it is after going in to a shots fired report.

I was starting to think on the cave and what I’m in for, my son, and..,why me? I began to drift off into thought.

I started hearing a noise the more I got into a deep trance.

*tick..tick…tick

As I looked up, my eyes centered on the old grandfather clock placed snug in the corner of the garage. The time read 9:47 PM. 

I soon regained the thought that I had going into this, my son and avoiding anyone before I enter the cave. I put everything under my trunk where the spare tire would be, just incase a Barney Fief wants to ruin my one opportunity.

After about a hour drive, I began to see what looked like the staging for a crime scene. Yellow “do not cross” tape lined the old decaying barn which barely stood up.

I looked in the field ahead to see small yellow flags leading all the way up to the mountain. I decided to park my car about a thirty minute walk away from the actual point of interest.

Once I burned off more than two months worth of cardio. Once I approached the barn  slowly getting bigger I looked at the outside of the barn, worn red paint, white trim and decaying wood made it all come together.

I finally made my way up the staggered mountain reaching the blocked off entry. I took a deep breath, sighed, then slowly headed into the cave.

Darkness surrounded me as I felt for a flare, upon striking it. I can’t say I wasn’t surprised when I realized, my patients, was telling the truth. In front of me laid four passage ways that drilled deep into the cave itself. It makes you wonder, why, or even who took the time to do all of this.

Thinking back to what stacey and Jermaine said, I decided to choose the passage on the far left. With my heart pounding, I slowly was engulfed deeper into the cave.

Nothing was out of the ordinary so far, just the occasional sounds of water dripping off the top of the cave and bats chattering to one another. After about I say thirty minutes of walking, I stumbled upon something that make my stomach turn into a knot.

A boulder that had clearly fallen after years of supporting the structure had sat almost blocking off the rest of my path. On the rock In what I only hoped was a red paint scrawled out “Help me”.

My mind instantly jumped to the thought of my son, bringing me to a weird state of panic and reassurance. What if he’s alive? Am I on the right path? Am…I too late?
