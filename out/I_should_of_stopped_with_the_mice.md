I’m not sure when the idea first crept into my mind, but it was always there, lurking. As a researcher in neuropharmacology, I had access to all the tools I needed. The project started innocently enough—an experimental drug designed to reactivate dormant neural pathways. I was driven by the hope of curing patients in vegetative states. I wanted to see those broken souls filled with the hope that one day they may have a cure for those they love. 

But deep down, I guess a sick,.twisted part of me wanted to know, could I bring the dead back to life. Now not in the zombie sense of course but minutes, possibly hours after dieing, could I save lives by basically hitting a reset switch? 

It started with mice. Of course I wouldn't test it out on the dickheaded neighbour living beside me who always yapped about bins going out too late. Im not a complete animal. The drug worked, kind of. Their little bodies twitched back to life, but something was off. They were aggressive, ravenous and worryingly no longer afraid of me. 

But i got cocky, the thrill of success drowned out my caution. I pushed forward, convinced that with a few tweaks, it would work perfectly on humans. I wanted the glory, I soon wanted to be noticed , win awards. As sick as it is I no longer cared about helping people. Fuck. I was stupid, I deserve this now looking back on the events that have led me to now.

The night came when I took it too far. Alone in the lab, I prepared the syringe, filled it with the latest version of the drug, so called 'cure'. My hands trembled with a mixture of fear and excitement as I stood over the body. I'll never forget hearing my heart pounding within my chest, nearly making it impossible to remember the task at hand.—a John Doe from the morgue, dead only a few hours lay in front of me. The perfect subject. Though perfect now isn't the right word, maybe had I started on him sooner things would be different.

I injected the serum directly into his carotid artery, watching as the last of the liquid was pushed into his body. For a moment, nothing happened. I leaned in, desperate to see some sign of success. A wheeze? Flutter of the eye lids?  Anything would do at this point. Just as I was about to huff in defeat.

His eyes snapped open.

My breath caught in my throat. His chest heaved, taking in a shallow, ragged breath. He sat up with unnatural stiffness, his gaze locking onto mine. I should have felt triumph, but all I felt was dread. I instantly knew this was wrong, the whole thing felt wrong in the air around me.

“Can you hear me?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He didn’t respond, just stared at me with vacant eyes. Brain dead i instantly thought forgetting moments before how he bolted into a sitting position. I reached out to touch him, but the moment my hand brushed his cold skin, he lunged. His grip was impossibly strong, his hands clawing at my flesh. I screamed, pulling away, but he wouldn’t let go. His strength definitely not normal considering he was about 6'1 and considerably thin, nearing unhealthy thin. 

Somehow, whilst tussing over the metal slab he was still sitting on. I managed to break free, scrambling across the lab floor my body refusing to move the way I wanted it to. He moved with jerky, unnatural motions, almost like glinching when a video is buffering. He was following me, his mouth twisted into a snarl. He was alive, but not as he had been. I hadn’t brought back the man—just the body, an empty shell driven by primal instinct.

I managed to hit the fire alarm as I locked myself in the storage room. I hear him outside, banging on the door, his growls growing louder and more aggressive by the minute.

What I failed to mention about my mice tests was that the ones I test on were already alive. The one I tested on that was dead came back killing the remaining mice that were serum free. It oddly ignored the ones that I had previously tested on. 20 minutes later I had a cage of half bodied, gory mice, bits and pieces missing from where my reliving dead mouse had ate random chunks out them. They were all,(bar the previously tested ones which huddled into the opposite end of the cage)chewing at the bars trying to escape, all now very much alive. 


I know it’s only a matter of time before he gets in. I created him, and now I’ll die by his hands. This isn’t life. It’s something far worse.

And I’ve unleashed it. I just pray that whoever finds him doesn't come to my fate. Because as I type this the arm he clawed at is starting to go dead, same was I observed in my mice subjects. I'm coming back with one thing on my mind. 

I'm sorry.
