I don't even know where to begin but I do know that this isn't in my head and it's getting worse. 

It all started about two weeks ago as I was heading into my work, a large corporate building in the city centre. I can't drive so the bus commute takes me about 30 minutes from my home. Nothing was out of the ordinary that day and I got off at the usual stop across the street from my work. Between the bus stop and the door was a small area with benches and trees throwing dappled shadows across the cobblestone. I started walking towards the building when something caught my eye. It was a shadow.

The shadow fell down over an empty bench from the tree above. Except it didn't fall *right.* The shadow appeared to mould itself around an unseen shape, hugging tightly around something. It was so strange that I stopped dead in my tracks, squinting my eyes trying to understand what it was I was looking at. That's when for just a split second I could make out the contours of a face. Shadows pouring into where eye sockets would be and curving around a head. 

I shook my head out of instinct and pushed down the uneasy feeling inside my gut. I started speed walking towards the safety of the door. I knew that there wasn't anything wrong and I probably just saw a strange trick of the light, but knowing that fact didn't stop my hammering heart.  As I passed the bench I couldn't stop my eyes from flicking to the side. It wasn't there anymore. I sighed in relief and continued on my way. Finally reaching the door to my building I pulled it open and moved inside. 

I wish I hadn't looked back then, maybe that third look was what sealed my fate. I looked over at the bench through the glass door as I closed it behind me. The thing was there, barely visible as the dappled shadows of leaves moved over it. Then it *moved.* The shadows on the face shifted as the head turned and faced me. I could feel it looking at me through the glass door. 

I quickly turned and made my way to my desk. It took me a few minutes to calm down and rationalise the situation to myself so thoroughly that I assumed I was sleep deprived and didn't see anything weird. So the rest of the day went by as normal. Everyday boring office tasks and meetings kept my mind occupied. By the time the workday was over I had completely forgotten my encounter. As I headed out the doorway I pulled up my collar against the icy wind that had picked up after the sun went down.

I checked my watch and knew the bus would stop at any moment and I needed to hustle across the street to make it. I started lightly jogging towards the stop when I saw movement. My first assumption was that a small bird may have just flown out of one of the tree branches. As my head turned towards the motion my blood went ice cold. It was the bench from this morning and it was still empty. I didn't see the shape but somehow I knew it was there. 

I snapped my head to the front and sprinted towards the stop with extra vigour. I finally reached the small bus stop and slightly out of breathe I chastised myself for being such a scaredy cat. As a woman who commutes alone at night there was plenty of real dangers to be scared of and here I was afraid of a shadow. As I was thinking about how silly I was being the bus came around the corner and stopped in front of me. 

I stepped inside and paid my fare before moving into the nearest empty seat. The window next to my seat faced towards the office building and benches. As stupid as I was convincing myself this whole scenario was I also couldn't find the courage to look back. I was scared to confirm my own suspicions. As the bus started crawling away from it's spot I hazarded a quick glance towards the bench. I didn't see anything there and sighed in relief. A relief that poured out of my body the second I turned my head back and saw it again. The bus's lights where throwing reflections and shadows across the bus stop and they weren't falling right.

The invisible shape of a man stood next to the stop, it's body facing towards me until there was no more light and shadow to illuminate it anymore. I sank back down into my seat and tried to focus on not crying. That was the first time I saw it but unfortunately not the last.

And so an awful routine fell into place. Each morning I would get off the bus and see the shadow sitting on it's bench. I would even catch it turning it's head to face the bus a few times. I would rush past where it was go to work and each night it would wait for me at the bus stop. One morning it was even seated on the bench next to a woman on her phone. She didn't seem to notice it at all even though to me it's silhouette and shape were painfully obvious. 

I asked one of my more friendly co-workers John to join me for lunch outside about 3 days ago. I wanted to see if someone else would independently see it. We both walked out the glass door and I could immediately see the shape, waiting for me at it's bench. 

I swallowed down all my panic and as casually as possible pointed out the bench to John who without any hesitation walked towards it and sat down right next to it. I stood in front of him as he sat and flicked my eyes over to the shape every few seconds. This was the first time I saw it up close. The shadow from the trees fell over its form and moulded around it. It seemed to have a masculine shape and it was bigger than I had first assumed. At one point John took a bite of his sandwich and gestured towards the seat next to him.

"Want to sit down?" He asked me and I glanced towards the bench. The shape then moved faster than it had before. It's head which until now had been facing John shot up and faced me as much as something without a face can. The intensity and purposeful nature of this made me feel ill immediately. I felt as if it was staring at me waiting for me to sit where it was, to get closer to it. I instinctively took a step away from the bench and made a lame excuse to John that I needed to go back inside. He seemed a little confused but stood up and we went back inside together. 

I spent the rest of the day worrying that I might be losing my mind. Surely if an invisible man was hanging around outside for weeks I wouldn't be the only one that noticed. That night I left the office later than usual to catch up on some work. I left the office just five minutes before the last bus of the night would come around. I looked down at the bus stop and confusion and dread filled my heart when I saw no shape waiting there. I glanced over at the bench and saw nothing there as well. I should have been glad that the thing wasn't there but I couldn't escape the fear that came from no longer knowing where it would be. 

I didn't have time to worry about it either way as the bus came to a halt at the stop. I sprinted across the area and pushed myself through the door of the bus into it's safety. The door closed behind me as I looked out at the seats looking for an open one. 

And there it was. Barely visible in the dim light streaming through the windows outside. It was seated by itself on a bench, it's head facing me. I almost screamed when I saw it and took steps backwards almost falling over a woman's baggage. I felt the eyes of the other passengers on me as I panicked internally. This thing was inside the bus with me. I swallowed fear as I scrambled to the seat furthest away from it and fell down next to an elderly man. I sank down low in the seat trying to hide myself from it's gaze. The old man seemed to notice this and leaned over.

"Miss are you alright?" He asked quietly, probably didn't want to embarrass me in a full bus. I felt a rogue tear stream down my face. I took a chance and whispered back to him as quietly as possible.

"Can you see someone sitting three rows back on the left?" My voice was barely audible. A part of me was terrified that thing may hear me. The old man furrowed his bushy white brows and slowly raised his head up to peak over the back of the seat in the direction I had given. He squinted and tilted his head slightly after a second, there was confusion in his eyes. He turned back around and looked me over again.

"I don't see anything." He said quickly and turned away from me. His entire posture and demeanour had immediately shifted into distrust. He probably assumed I was a crazy person and didn't want to be involved, but that moment where I saw confusion in his eyes stuck with me. It was a look of disbelief you would have if you saw something impossible. I sank even lower in my seat my face red with embarrassment. The old man almost purposefully didn't look my way again and turned his body away as well. 

At the next stop the man quickly stood up and moved towards the front leaving me alone on the bench. As the door opened and he was about to step off he made eye contact with me again before his eyes snapped behind me. His eyes looked fearful as he quickly hopped off the bus. I sat frozen in my seat as the bus started driving again leaving the man alone in the street staring through the bus windows at me. 

I sat low in my seat the rest of the way home, afraid to move and knowing that if I got off the bus there wouldn't be another bus until the next morning. I tried to distract myself as best I could but it still felt like the longest 30 minutes of my life. As the bus started approaching my block my stomach continued to sink deeper into my shoes. I was terrified that it would know where I lived now, but I had literally no choice. So I decided to make a risky play by waiting till the last second to get off the bus, hopefully that thing wouldn't be quick enough to follow me. The fact that this thing could probably move through walls was a thought I entertained for only a moment because if that were the case I wouldn't be able to stop it anyway. 

As the bus stopped on my block I stayed seated watching the doors open. My entire body felt wired as I waited for my chance. As I timed it out in my head the last moment finally came and the driver shifted in his seat to reach for the door close, I jumped up and damn near sprinted off the bus. I fell out of the doors and took multiple steps away from them. I was breathing harshly and my hands clutched my bag so tightly my fingers were white. I turned as I heard the doors close behind me.

I stood and stared at the door of the bus. Behind the glass on the other side of the door it stood staring down at me. It was right on my heels, it must have barely missed the opening in the door. Then the shadows shifted as it moved in a way I couldn't decipher at first getting closer to the window of the door. I stared back horrified as the head pressed up right against the glass. White whisps of condensation of hot breath on cold glass appeared over it's mouth. The bus had started moving at this point but I stood rooted in place unable to process what I was even seeing. I watched as it moved rapidly from the door though the bus trying to remain in my view through the windows until it came to a standstill in the back of the bus staring at me through the window. 

As the bus disappeared from view I became aware again and held back sobs as I sprinted the entire way home not taking a moment to stop until I was behind my locked apartment door. I crumpled into a shaking ball of tears when I was finally home. I didn't know who to tell or what to do, I know I am not crazy and I don't take any drugs. I closed every single curtain in my house and double checked everything that could lock. I was convinced that whatever that thing was it wouldn't stop at just following me on the bus. I was unfortunately completely right.

That brings us to yesterday where it was mercifully a Saturday which meant no busses. I tried to calm my shot nerves best I could at home but eventually decided going to see my parents would be the best help. They lived a walkable distance away from me and so I committed to going over and possibly staying the night. I packed some extra clothes in a bag and grabbed my things. I locked my apartment and made my way down the stairs and out the front door. 

A scream escaped my lips before I could even stop myself. It was standing in the doorway to my apartment building, I had nearly walked right through it. I stumbled backwards and slammed the door closed crying as I moved away from the doorway. A neighbour who had been collecting mail came over to help but I couldn't explain, what could I say? I just sprinted back up to my apartment as fast as I could and locked it behind me. I picked up my phone and called my father. I was so frazzled I'm sure I didn't make any sense trying to explain to him on the phone what was wrong. He said he'd be right over and I hung up the phone and locked myself in my bathroom with a kitchen knife.

Some time later my bell rang and I forced myself out of the locked bathroom to open the door for my father. His face looked deeply concerned as I opened the door and he got a look at me. I was so relieved that I hugged him close and cried. He hugged me back and gently moved me into the apartment and closed the door behind him. I sat down on the couch and he took a seat across from me. 

"What's wrong? Did something happen at work?" He asked softly clearly concerned but also confused. In that moment I contemplated my options. Could I even tell him the truth without looking like I was losing my mind? I bit my lip and weighed my options, eventually settling on a half truth.

"I think someone has been following me home from the office. I haven't been able to get a good look at him but I feel like I am going crazy." I admitted, I didn't want to lie but I wasn't going to mention the detail that the stalker is invisible to anyone until I absolutely have to. My father immediately had plenty of questions that I didn't have answers to. We settled on the fact that involving the police at this stage wouldn't really work as I had no witnesses, evidence or even a description. Instead my father agreed to stay the night at my home and then go with me to purchase some self defence tools the next day.

I did feel a lot safer having him around and it started to ease some of the stress I had been building up the past two weeks. I made us some pasta for dinner and made a temporary bed on the couch for my father. We ended up watching old movies on the couch together until we both fell asleep.

I startled awake around 2 am to the sound of a gunfight roaring from the tv that was still on. I looked over at my father snoring contently on the couch and pulled a blanket up around him. I muted the tv and walked into the kitchen to get some water before I went back to my room. I stood in front of the fridge and filled my glass with water. 

In my apartment most of it is open concept so I could see the front door from where I stood in the kitchen. My eyes fell on the front door and lingered there unsure why something seemed off with it. Then I spotted it, the small gap underneath the door that let a thin sliver of light into my dark apartment. It had two gaps where the light was being blocked. 

Legs. Someone was standing in front of my door blocking the light. I started shaking and moved as quietly as possible to the couch where my dad was still asleep. I never took my eyes off the door as I nudged my father to wake him. He opened one eye lazily and saw me crouching next to him and opened the other. Any sign of sleep my father had before he noticed my expression vanished as he turned quickly eyes wide and faced me.

I placed a shushing finger over my mouth and then pointed towards my front door. My father looked towards the door and I saw him looking for the problem before his eyes glanced down at the gap. I could see the goosebumps raise on his arms as he quietly maneuvered his way off the couch towards my kitchen. He reached inside my knife block for a weapon and crawled towards the doorway. I sat still and stiff on my hands and knees next to the couch watching him approach. 

He took a last glance at me before moving towards my peephole. He placed his face against it and peaked outside. I could see the tension in his body release slightly and be replaced with hesitation as he pulled his head away from the peephole and looked down at the gap where the shadow of legs still stood. Before I could even stop him he reached up and quickly as he could unlocked the door and swung it open.

A noise of protest caught in my throat and died away there as the hallway stood empty and illuminated behind my door. My father peeked out and looked down both ends of the hallway before closing and locking the door behind him. He turned to face me and his expression was hard to read.

"Must have been a trick of the light." He said in a hushed tone as he come over to me and helped me to my feet. I stood there silently staring at the door waiting for the shadows to return but they didn't. I ended up sitting in the chair in the living room watching the door as my dad eventually fell asleep again. The shadows didn't return again and eventually the sunlight beaming through my windows eased my fear enough for me sleep a bit. When my dad woke me this morning I felt like crap. We had some coffee discussing my options if I did have stalker.

My father promised to go out shopping for me today to get me a ring camera and some new stronger door locks. I thanked him for dealing with me and he left. I went about my usual Sunday routine as best I could and things felt like they were dying down as the late afternoon rolled around and the sunrays started pouring into my apartment. I decided I needed some advice and sat down in the living room to write up this post. 

While I've been writing though I've been feeling worse and worse. I looked up a few minutes ago and saw a beam of light hit and bend around something as it quickly moved into my bathroom. I think it's in my house now. I don't know what to do, my dad should be back soon but I am too terrified to move. I can see it watching me through the gap of my bathroom door. It's body is moving in a strange way now, it looks like it's panting or shaking with excitement. The dark shadows of my bathroom fold around its body and it looks bigger than before, much bigger as if it's body expanded to fill the space of the room it's in.

I can't move
