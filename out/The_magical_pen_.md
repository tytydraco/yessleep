*Baking a dream*

A small bakery with the fragrance of sweet pastries,

Colourful candies on the tabletop,
A cozy atmosphere, filled with smiles,

With the sound of wind chimes,
A tall chef's hat adorning my head,

And a heart full of happiness
Is all I wish for.

Small plants along the door,
And a carpet-covered floor...

And wooden tables,
Little kids who drool over the cookies
On the counter...

Meeting customers in a hurry—
With a silly smile, what a funny encounter.

Sounds of grinding coffee,
And a faint aroma of toffee.

Someone getting a forgetful cake for a late birthday gift,
A small, sparkly cupcake—perhaps for the date?

And the soft creak of a rusted doorknob!

A dream that in my heart remains untold...
A life of sweetness, warmth, and gold...

"What the hell are you doing, Siya?" barked Mr. James, my English professor, as he yanked the paper from my desk.

"Haha, you silly little thing. You're not thinking of submitting this for the annual literary competition, are you? That would be hilarious." He smirked, crumpling the page before tearing it from my notebook.

Tears stained my desk that day.

Next Month

I stood on the roof of the school building. Classes would start in a few minutes. It didn’t matter.

A Few Hours Earlier

“Did you hear? Mr. James is being promoted!” Sunny said, leaning against my desk.

“What happened?” I asked.

He handed me his phone. It was an interview on a national channel.

“So, Mr. James, is it because you’re an English professor or because you enjoy writing that you composed such a beautiful poem, Baked with Happiness? Even the title makes you feel warm!” said the interviewer.

I stared at the screen, confused. “Wait, what is this?”

Sunny scrolled down to show me the poem. Between bites of his snack bar, he said, “He wrote this poem and won some big literary competition. Now it’s being sent to nationals! He’s going to be famous. Try to get a selfie with him before he’s out of reach!”

The phone slipped from my hands. I recognized my poem.


_____***

I ran to the washroom, tears spilling over. My life couldn’t possibly be this cruel. How could someone everyone admired—our beloved professor—do this to me? He had everything: respect, success, and admiration. Why would he need to steal my work?

Later, I confronted him. “Mr. James, why did you do it? You stole my poem and mocked me for it, only to submit it as your own!”

He smirked, leaning closer. “Watch your mouth, Siya,” he hissed, then grabbed me by the hair and slammed my head against the desk. “If you know what’s good for you, you’ll hand over all your work. I don’t want any trouble in my new life.”

Bruised and humiliated, I stood on the rooftop. I had no sports achievements, no academic accolades—writing was all I had. Now that someone had stolen even my words, I felt empty.

“If God wills, may I find peace,” I whispered.

As I gazed downward, something shiny on the ground caught my eye. Curious, I climbed down and picked it up. It was a sticker that read:

> “Don’t give up. Get your revenge. Call #5432REVENGE and trust us.”



I chuckled bitterly. “What a stupid ad.”

On impulse, I dialed the number. My phone had no signal. Frustrated, I ran outside the school and tried again.

The call directed me to an old arcade center.


______***

At the center, the place was eerily empty. Only a dusty Mario arcade machine lit up as I approached. The screen instructed me to insert a dollar. Hesitant but curious, I complied.

The machine then asked me to scan the sticker. When I did, an interface appeared:

GET REVENGE / FORGIVE

I stared at the screen. My fingers hovered over “FORGIVE” before I chose “GET REVENGE.”

A grim reaper’s scythe flashed across the screen. A set of rules appeared, narrated by a small fairy on the corner of the screen:

1. Your payment has been received.


2. Do not tell anyone about this.


3. Trust us.


4. Follow the rules for a satisfying result.



“Do you agree?”

I clicked “YES.” Suddenly, a pen ejected from the machine.

The screen displayed: Write your revenge. But remember: it cannot contain fictional themes or harm uninvolved people.

I scribbled:

 “Mr. James shits himself in the middle of class.”



The pen glowed faintly, and I couldn’t help but laugh. It felt good to write again.

Moments Later

Sunny’s call broke my thoughts. “You won’t believe what just happened!” he exclaimed.

“What?” I asked.

“Mr. James just shat himself in class! It was so gross, but everyone was laughing hysterically! He ran out in shame!”

I froze, staring at the pen in my hand. Could it really work?


_______***

Over the next few days, I tested the pen. I wrote:

> “Mr. James is exposed for stealing others’ work and publicly shamed for it.”



The pen’s glow seemed softer this time, but the words still disappeared.

By the next morning, the school buzzed with whispers. News broke that Mr. James had been stealing students’ work for years. He was publicly shamed, and the competition committee stripped him of his award.

It didn’t stop there. 

One day, as I walked through the school, I saw an old man standing alone. Sunny grabbed my arm.

“Who’s that?” I asked.

“That’s the father of a student who died mysteriously two years ago,” Sunny whispered. “Rumor has it that Mr. James was involved.”

I approached the old man and handed him a bottle of cold banana milk from the canteen.

As we talked, I slipped the sticker into his hand.

“Don’t give up. Get your revenge. Call #5432REVENGE and trust us.”

He looked confused but smiled.

One Month Later

Sunny burst into the classroom, waving his phone. “Remember the old man? Turns out Mr. James confessed in a letter before…” He hesitated. “Well, you know, he… ended things. The police found proof connecting him to the boy’s death.”

I didn’t know how to feel.

The next day, I received a package: an expensive set of calligraphy pens. The old man had left a note: “Thank you for your kindness. My son would’ve admired someone like you.”

Epilogue

Dear Diary,

You won’t believe this, but my poem has been reinstated, and I won the competition! My work is going to nationals. I never imagined such a day would come.

Oh, and guess what? The theme for the next competition is revenge. I think I’m ready for it.
