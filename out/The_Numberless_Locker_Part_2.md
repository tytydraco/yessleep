[Part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lnmawa/the_numberless_locker_part_1/) The rest of school before summer felt like a blur and was mostly spent arguing with my parents about how much time me and Jason were allowed to play games. So much so that during one particular school night after my parents caught us staying up for the fifth time in a row, they took my playstation from me. Mind you, this was during the height of 2010’s gaming when modern warfare 2 was released, to say this was devastating for a twelve year old is a serious understatement. Add to the fact that they threatened to remove it all summer if I didn’t start taking school seriously. Eventually, we came to an agreement. I had to start making myself not look like a complete failure in school, and if successful, I would be granted my playstation. Even so, I was then only allowed access to my playstation in the evening during summer. 

Luckily, summer wasn’t that far off, and I guess my parents did feel a little bad about taking, in my eyes, the only source of happiness away from me. So during my birthday, I got a brand new bike. I let Jason borrow my old bike since he didn’t have one of his own, and our friendship transformed from arguing about who was watching whose screen to exploring what little our small town had to offer. I had forgotten it at the time, but when we turned that corner of the empty parking lot one day, I suddenly remembered the numberless locker. Despite what I told my mom and dad, I hadn’t been there since that first day. Before I met Jason, sitting alone on a bench behind the cafeteria after school became a routine. The amount of time we had spent together up until this point made me completely forget about the gym, and the weird tale surrounding the numberless locker. To my knowledge, Jason had lived here his entire life, so I asked him about it.

“Hey, do you know about the numberless locker? I got a membership here and was told about it, I even got pranked into opening it and got the crap scared out of me”

“No”

“Really? Well the guy who owns the place, I think his name was Louis, told me it’s-”

“Can we just get out of here, please?” 

“Uh, yeah, sure”

He didn’t say anything else for the rest of the day. When we eventually got back to my place and were supposed to play games for the rest of the evening like usual, he insisted on going home. He told me everything was fine and that he was just tired, but I could tell something was really wrong. I didn’t wanna push him about it though, so I just let him go home. Later during dinner my dad asked where Jason was, and I told him what happened. 

“Maybe has something to do about his sister”, my dad said.

“What? Jason has a sister?”

“Had, I’m afraid. He never said? Morgan told me what happened, but you should ask Jason yourself”

“Why? Can’t you tell me?”

My dad shook his head. “It’s not a good story, son. You should talk to your friend about it, not me”

The next day, Jason seemed like normal again, and was actually bummed out over missing our evening gaming session. When noon rolled around and we found ourselves on a ridge overlooking the town, I asked about his sister to which I was given no response. We kept on going, following a trail leading down to a river where Jason eventually stopped. He didn’t say anything, he just looked down towards the river.

“Hey man, if you don’t wanna talk about your sister, that's fine. I won’t push you about it.”

He sighed, sat down and gestured to me to sit down as well. 

“A year ago, I got a membership at the gym. I was given the exact same introduction to the numberless locker as you, but I loved it. I loved the stories surrounding it. How everything circles around the night. That there’s no need for a ritual to enact or a set of rules you have to follow to experience it. It’s always there, you know. And it’s creepy as hell.”

“Alright, what does the numberless locker have to do with your sister?”

“Well, my sister, Junie, was too young to get a membership, but she loved to hear the stories I told about it. But I went too far. The usual story is that if you leave something overnight in the locker, the next morning, it’s gone. But I told her that, at midnight, you can actually see what you put in there disappear.”

My heart sank. Did he tell his sister to climb into the locker at midnight? Did they sneak in there because of some weird ghost story? My head was suddenly filled with the whispers and looks of those other kids the day I met Jason. Did his sister actually die because of the numberless locker? Before I could say anything, he continued.

“So, I convinced my sister to sneak into the gym with me. I put a bag filled with old clothes in the numberless locker and the same night, we snuck in through the shower windows and headed for the locker. It was almost midnight. I was so excited I didn’t realize how scared Junie was. But when the time struck midnight, and I opened the locker…”

I was gripping the ground beside me, my head overflowing with questions too fast to comprehend. One question stood out though, ran wildly through my mind, and I am still ashamed of it. Did Jason kill his sister?

“... nothing happened. The bag was still there, untouched from when I left it. Both of us were disappointed but kinda relieved. Then, we heard a loud bang, like someone threw open a door. We ran as fast as we could towards the shower windows. I climbed out first so I would be able to pull Junie out.”

His lips were quivering and he trembled with the words. His whole body was shaking, but he continued. 

“But when I looked back, she was gone. I screamed for her, but I got no answer. I was panicking and I didn’t know what to do. I went back inside, I kept screaming for her, but I couldn’t find her. I don’t know how long I spent inside of the gym, but I kept searching for her. I searched everywhere, I kept screaming for her, why didn’t she respond…”

Jason was crying at this point. I didn’t know what to say nor how to comfort him. He didn’t kill his sister, he didn’t mean for this to happen. He was just a kid fascinated by another ghost story. I wanted to tell him to stop, that he had said enough, that everything was okay and that it wasn’t his fault. I tried my best to comfort him. 

“Did you find her? What happened?”

He wiped away his tears and took a deep breath. His whole mood changed, he suddenly became angry and serious. 

“I didn’t find her, but someone found me. The janitor. The look in his eyes when he found me, he was happy. That fucker looked happy to find me screaming for my sister. The numberless locker didn’t take my sister, he did.”

“I-... I don’t know what to say. I’m so sorry, man.”

“He called the cops on me. When I told them about my sister, they arrested the janitor for suspicion of kidnapping or something. He was held in custody for a while, but he was eventually released due to lack of evidence or something. But eventually, they found my sister.”

“What? They found her? Where? Was she okay?” 

I tried my best to hide it, but I felt like I knew that she wasn’t okay. Jason stood up and pointed to the river beneath us.

“There. They found her down there, in the river, laying face down in the water.”

I looked down towards the river. The shallow, dark water stained my view of this town even more. I hated everything about the place I had recently began calling home. Everything and everyone was tainted with lies, rumors and ugly truths, except for Jason. And this town had hurt him. 

“Rumors spread like a wildfire. Everyone's view shifted from the janitor towards me, saying that I had scared Junie so much that she ran into the forest and drowned in the river. But nothing was ever confirmed, and the whole thing was ruled out as an accident. My parents refused to believe that was the truth at first, but I can see the way they look at me. They blame me for it. The janitor never got the justice he deserved, neither did my sister. I know he did it, I know he fucking did it.”

Jason sat down again, and let out a huge sigh. I have a little sister too, and I couldn’t imagine how I would feel if I lost her, let alone have everyone believe it was my fault. I had to do something, for Jason.

“So let's give some justice then. For both of them”, I said. 

“What are you talking about?”

I stood up, and reached out my hand in front of him.

“Let’s expose that fucker for the monster he is. We’ll sneak into the gym and find some evidence. Then we’ll show everyone what really happened to your sister.”

“It was over a year ago, what are we even supposed to find there?”

“I don’t know, something! This has to have happened before, there’s gotta be some evidence against the janitor in the gym.”

Jason thought for a second, then looked up at me.

“When I was looking for my sister in the gym, there was a room that was locked. I think it was the office or something. If there’s any evidence to be found, it’s gotta be in there.”

“That sounds like the place to start! So, are you with me?”

Jason looked at my hand, then smiled. He grabbed it and I lifted him up from the ground. 

“Yeah, let’s do it.”

We gave each other a “friend hug” which, although awkward, felt needed. We got on our bikes again and began heading back towards town, discussing what our plan should be.

“You got any ideas on how we’ll manage to get into the office?”, I asked.

“Maybe.”
