So, I am about three months postpartum and I was wondering if any fellow moms have been experiencing this weird (what I can only guess) postpartum symptom?
I’m hesitant to ask anyone I know for fear of them thinking I might be crazy but I am desperate for answers because I feel like I’m losing my mind. 
Any time my baby cries or I lose my patience with my husband I see this…thing just out of the corner of my eye- I’m not even sure how to describe it, it’s almost like if a spider was a person? All lanky arms and long skinny legs with gray paper thin skin and sunken black eyes hugging the walls as though it were growing out of them.

I’ve only seen brief glimpses of it in those moments, seen it disappearing around corners or sinking behind door frames. Once or twice I swore I saw it scuttling into a dark shadowy spot on the ceiling. Just little things that I could write off as the sleep deprived effects of a horror movie lover's mind.

Until yesterday.  

Yesterday I was changing the baby after a nap and he would not stop crying, his high pitched wails piercing my ears like needles being shoved directly into my cochlea. Tears pricked my eyes as I zipped up his onesie, praying to whatever god there may be that he would calm down long enough for me to regain my sanity.

I paused my oncoming breakdown, the clicking taking me out of the crushing sense of defeat for a moment.

My eyebrows furrowed upon hearing it again. Slowly, I turned my head in the direction of the sound and…there it was, at the edge of my sight, peering around the door frame was an emaciated figure shrouded in shadows. 
I froze, not wanting to look directly at it for fear it would attack me or my son if it knew I could see it. My heart was racing, my son's cries were now muffled, background noise to the sound of that thing’s horrible crackling joints.
I could feel myself beginning to tremble, the tears from before now freely spilling down my cheeks, slowly, I pulled my son closer to me, now only small squeaks and soft “mms” escaping him as he nuzzled into my chest, unaware of the horror that loomed just a few feet away.

“Hey babe! Do you remember where we put the extra bottles? The rest aren’t finished being sanitised yet!” 

The sound of my husband's voice startled me out of my fear frozen state and I snapped my eyes shut for a moment, and in that moment, the thing had vanished…no clicks, no footsteps, not even the sound of a parting breath. Shocked, I looked around frantically, hoping that the thing hadn’t scurried away to some other part of the room and wasn’t lying in wait to try and ambush my baby and I once I moved. 

Nothing.

I heard my husband coming up the stairs and tried to collect myself before he could see how frazzled I was, “Elena? You up here?” his sturdy frame entered the doorway, his dark brows furrowed in innocent confusion that melted into concern as his eyes fell on me, “are you ok?”

I stared back at him, wide eyed and teary, from my spot by the changing table. For some reason I felt like I couldn’t tell him, I was sure he’d think I was crazy…and maybe I am? “Yeah I…I just had some healing pain in my…my stomach and Gabriel wouldn’t stop crying and I just got so overwhelmed and-” his strong arms took me in, hugging me gently, our son enveloped between his parents, warm and safe.
This should have eased me.
This should have taken all of my fears away. 
This should have set everything right.
But I could hear it again.

Please, for the love of god, tell me some of you other freshly postpartum moms have experienced something like this. Please tell me I’m not crazy. Please tell me that me and my family are safe. 
Please.
