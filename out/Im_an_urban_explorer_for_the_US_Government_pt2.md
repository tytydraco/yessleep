It was a long time before I finally fell asleep that night. The lights of passing cars painted lines across the ceiling through the shoddy curtains. Somewhere in the distance, a freight train called out. After about the eight-billionth time rolling over in a vain attempt to find a comfortable position, the HVAC unit rattled and kicked on.

I’d keyed Marcus’s number and hit dial before I was awake enough to think about what I would even say. It didn’t ring more than twice before the line crackled.

“J-man! Kinda late for a booty call, dude. What’s up?”

“No sleep for me tonight,” I muttered. “Anyway, you told me to call, remember?”

“Sure I did. Just thought you’d do it yesterday. Listen—I’m a bit tied up at the moment. If you want to talk, come to the address I’m sending you. And bring coffee while you’re at it.”

“Yeah, yeah. Alright.”

My phone said he was only fifteen minutes away at some transmission shop or something.

“See you in a bit.”

I glanced around the stuffy motel room to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything. I didn’t bring much in—just didn’t have it in me to unpack. I scooped up my keys, threw on my jacket, and stepped into the cold.

It took a full five minutes for my car to warm up. I stuffed my hands in my pockets and drummed my feet to fight the early morning chill seeping through everything. One gas station run and a white Monster later, I was beginning to feel human again. I shoved a honey bun into my glovebox behind the air filter and cranked the heat to toast it.

I pulled into the mechanics shop around 3AM. Aside from the graveyard of parts cars scattered around the lot, I recognized Marcus’s Tacoma and a Prius with out-of-state plates. The sign in the window was off. So were the lights. But behind the roll-up garage doors, something faint crackled.

I tried the side door and knocked.

There was a pause—the sound of a chair moving, then several clicks—before the door swung open. Judy stood framed in the doorway, sporting elbow-length green gloves over the same suit she’d worn the previous morning. Her air of professionalism was no less precise, despite the setting.

“Are we delivering a calf or something?” I blurted.

Shockingly, she chortled at that. She recovered quickly and waved me inside.

“Hurry up. I don’t own this place.”

“Sorry—Marcus didn’t mention you’d be here, or I would’ve brought more coffee.”

She relocked the door and propped a metal chair under the handle.

“No worries. I brought my own. Mark’s over in the pit. Go grab a seat, sounded like you had a busy first day’l

Ignoring the irony behind that last comment for the time being, I rolled a stool over to the edge of the lift pit, where Marcus was hauling thick-gauge extension cables. He glanced up, grinned when he saw the tall Styrofoam cup, and took it with both hands.

“Aaah, you’re a lifesaver. We’re on a bit of a tight schedule tonight, so you’ll have to bear with us working while we talk.”

The cords ran across the floor toward a microwave lying on its back and some instruments I didn’t recognize. With more questions than sleep in me, I decided to stick with what I could handle.

“What’s the microwave for?” I asked.

“The sample we took earlier isn’t stable,” he said. “It starts degrading within hours of being separated from the colony. We’re too far from any of our permanent labs, so in certain cases…” He gestured at the spaghetti mess. “…we improvise.”

Judy approached, apparently having predicted my next question.

“Nyctophyllosis,” she said. “A metastable crystalline silicon—”

She held the ceramic vessel from earlier in her gloved hands, stepping carefully toward the pit.

“Think of it like a fluid made of microscopic solar panels. Except we don’t know what it’s made of or how it works. The closest we’ve gotten is mass spectrometry, but that destroys the sample almost instantly. What we can infer is that it feeds on most forms of electromagnetic radiation, and it’s sensitive to high-energy wavelengths like ionizing radiation and UV.”

I let her talk. I wasn’t awake enough in high school science to have ever understood this stuff, and she didn’t seem bothered by that. If anything, the lecture felt like a side effect of her nerves.

“We can contain a sample with most of its mass intact by encasing it inside a glass sphere using a short, yet powerful burst of microwave radiation. Hence the… McGyver setup.”

They secured the container inside the microwave. Marcus set the timer, then started messing with the exposed side panel.

“We’re gonna burn this thing out,” he said, “but it’ll do the job. Just don’t look through the screen—this creates a fair bit of plasma.”

Judy grabbed a welder’s mask and leaned over the microwave as it whirred to life. Marcus ducked down and pulled safety glasses from his hair.

The sound of the microwave was quickly drowned out by crackling and a high-voltage buzz. Arcs of light illuminated our dim surroundings, and in a flash the machine was dead. Judy wasted no time exhuming the canister. A torrent of smoke billowed from within, bringing the smells of carbon and fresh ozone. She carefully unlidded the container and poured its contents into a Home Depot bucket full of what I assumed was water. It hissed, and I heard a small clunk as the drop of molten liquid hit the bottom. How anything living or otherwise could survive that was beyond me.

While we waited for it to cool, Judy and Marcus tried their best to answer my questions as they sanitized the scene. Marcus had worked for the company for years—something he’d been brought into at college overseas. He promised he hadn’t been hanging out with me with the sole purpose of recruiting me, something I hadn’t even considered yet.

Judy was much less enthusiastic about conversation after the whole process. She had to be exhausted at that point. She admitted to bugging me with the listening device earlier to gauge how I reacted to the Nycto and to get a recording of the encounter, since the stuff apparently blocked most forms of radio communication.

It was almost five by the time we wrapped up, and with daylight and the threat of the shop’s actual inhabitants returning, we all agreed to head to a nearby diner. Judy pulled what she called a “Prince Rupert’s drop” from the bucket where it had been cooling. It was about the size of a mandarin orange—a clear bubble filled with a jet-black haze.

Once I’d sliced into my pancakes, I began to contemplate the undeniable fact that an entire secret government organization could not exist solely to mess with these glass blobs. I wondered then what else there was out there in the dark that I didn’t know about. For better or worse. I wouldn’t have to wait all that long. On the bright side, for the first time in my life I could leave a decent tip without even a second thought.
