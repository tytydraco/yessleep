[\[Part 7\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hct9a1/the_call_of_the_breach_part_7/)

The makeshift headquarters for our tiny alliance was already packed by the time we arrived, and I found myself standing beside the rest of the officials, along with the other lieutenants from both our rangers and Ark River’s forces. All in all, we squeezed into the crowded olive-green surplus tent, around a rectangular folding table where Sean spread out a large paper map of Barron County.

“Our plan is to move fast, up the lesser used secondary roads, to put Black Oak in a pincer.” He placed wooden tokens on the map to signify various units and moved them into position as he spoke. “Our scouts will lead the way through the marshlands in the north, and we will take the enemy by surprise. Hit-and-run attacks will wear down their outer defenses, including outposts and patrol bases, leaving the city exposed. Our guns can help breach the outer walls, and once inside, we will secure the warehouses, weapons depots, and headquarters respectively. If we can close with their heavy armor before it can deploy, we can overwhelm it. Without those, ELSAR won’t be able to maintain their defense, and will be forced to withdraw.”

Sean gestured to Sarah and pointed to a cluster of buildings on the map. “Our researchers will send medical aid teams to occupy these abandoned buildings in a chain down the valley, allowing us to relay wounded to Ark River in rapid fashion. Each stronghold will be heavily defended by machine guns and flamethrowers, enough to keep both mutants and ELSAR at bay.”

“I take it that’s where my boys come in?” Ethan scratched his chin, both arms folded in contemplation.

“Correct. Aside from securing our main supply route, your workers will form the bulk of our regular forces behind the rangers.” Sean slid his forefinger along the winding road leading from Black Oak to the interior of the county. “They’ll be key in organizing our logistics as well as casualty evacuation. Advance combat units will be small and mobile, to keep enemy drones, artillery, or aircraft from targeting them.”

“We rangers will be on the front line then?” Chris hooked both thumbs into his belt, shifted on his feet.

“With our riders, of course.” Adam answered instead of Sean this time, one hand resting idly on the hilt of his cruciform sword. “Our men are ready to take the fight to the enemy. With our deer, we can move easily through the swamps, and circle around them to cut off supply lines.”

Sean nodded his dark-haired head and pushed a few tokens around on the map to indicate the aforementioned movements. “Ark River will serve as harassment and scouting parties to keep them guessing as to where our main force is. Our rangers will act as shock troops to crack ELSAR’s main defensive line and connect with the resistance members inside Black Oak.”

From where I stood, I chewed the inside of my cheek with a mild frown, as a realization settled in. In all these complex war plans, no one had mentioned the Puppet army yet. True, ELSAR was a massive threat, but the mutant king posed no less of a danger, and he could be anywhere outside the protective walls of Ark River.

*Man, I hate being the one to do this.*

I swallowed hard and dared to raise my voice. “What about Vecitorak?”

All eyes turned to me, and embarrassed heat flooded my face. Even now, after all the things I’d done, risks I’d taken, victories I’d had, speaking in front of others still made my guts churn. Chris was perfect for this kind of thing, governing, making big decisions, debating people. I preferred to go on patrols with my little platoon, where the choices were simple, the rules easy to follow, and the world, though cruel, made sense.

“Once we take Black Oak, we’ll have a fortress so strong even he couldn’t breach it.” Sean tapped his finger on the borders of the city. “As soon as ELSAR is pushed to the county line, we can range into the center of the county to look for Vecitorak. Regardless of when, our main problem will be finding him.”

“His forces have disappeared.” Next to her husband, Eve scowled at the map in thought, the enmity between the mold king and the Ark River people almost as personal as my own due to Vecitorak’s enslavement of their unredeemed kin. “Even in their natural state, the Lost Ones shouldn’t be able to conceal so many of their own within the forests, especially not without leaving enough sign for us to track. It’s as if they all turned invisible.”

*If anyone could hide that well, it would be them.*

I met her gaze, curious at hearing my own thoughts voiced from another person, and eager to try and solve them now that I had more allies in this task. “Maybe they dug some kind of underground tunnel system to hide in?”

“I suppose it’s possible.” Eve shrugged her narrow shoulders and brushed a stray lock of golden hair from her equally luminous eyes. “But what tracks we do find keep appearing in random places, far from each other, and with no burrows or holes anywhere nearby. That much movement means they can’t be spending enough time digging to build a tunnel network big enough to hide them all. They can’t be covering the distance on foot either; we’d find the tracks.”

Heart pounding at the way everyone else waited on me to make my point, I stepped closer to the table and swept the faded paper map with my gaze in hopes of finding solutions. “I think he’s getting ready to make a move. Vecitorak has to be watching us just like we’re hunting for him, and if he’s hiding his movements, it can only mean he’s preparing something he doesn’t want us to see. We can’t leave him in our rear area, or he’ll pick off our supply trucks one by one.”

Ethan jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “We can load down the trucks with extra supplies, so we don’t have to run so many convoys back and forth. It’ll keep our footprint low and make it harder for ELSAR to track us by air. The mold-king surely can’t keep up with our convoys.”

*His Birch Crawlers can.*

Chris’s eyes collided with mine from across the table in a knowing look, and he shook his head. “He’s smart. Last time he set an ambush to immobilize our trucks, because he knows they can’t catch us on the open road. Hannah’s right; Vecitorak needs to be neutralized first.”

Sarah rested her hands on both hips. “*Should* we though? I mean, last time we lost quite a few men, and from what the survivors said, Vecitorak managed to exert some kind of telepathic influence to stun them. Only Hannah wasn’t affected.”

That earned even more intense stares, the others eyeing my silver tattoos that ran across the right side of my face in silent uncertainty.

*Yeah, that’s me, the freak of nature.*

Sean rubbed his chiseled jaw, and sighed. “If we can’t find him, we can’t hit him. You make a valid point, Brun, but if we don’t move on Black Oak before they deploy those tanks, the war is over. Once we get ELSAR out of Barron County, we can link up with the resistance and turn all our forces on Vecitorak.”

Biting my lip, I forced myself to nod, my chest deflated in acknowledgment that he was right. I couldn’t expect the world to stop just because I had a different opinion, but the thought of driving north to fight ELSAR in the woods, while the shadowy priest of doom stalked me like a tiger in the long grass made my skin crawl. Even the ego-fueled head of ELSAR, George Koranti, wanted to keep the Breach and its denizens contained, to prevent them from spreading beyond Barron County into the rest of the world. Vecitorak was the walking embodiment of the threat imposed on our planet by the Breach, and while I knew a bullet could stop Koranti, I had yet to think of anything that could put the mold-king down. After all, the freak had taken a gunshot to the chest and walked it off like a mosquito bite. If Vecitorak was truly immortal, how on earth were we going to stop him if we *did* find him?

In a subconscious reflex, I glanced around to look for Jamie’s reaction, and felt a pang of loneliness at remembering that I didn’t have her to rely on anymore. Like so many of the people I’d come to know when I arrived at New Wilderness, Jamie Lansen had been ripped out of my life, and while she wasn’t dead yet, a small voice in the back of my mind whispered the word I feared the most.

*Yet.*

“Right then, any further questions?”

I looked up to find the meeting over, having continued on in my mental absence, and shook my head along with the others. Chris would relay any orders I needed to know for my platoon, and I wanted to use today to catch up on some rest, as we would be moving out the following dawn.

As I turned to leave with the crowd, Sean’s voice stopped me. “Lieutenant Brun? A moment.”

Chris paused at the tent doorframe and gave my arm a discreet squeeze. “I’ll be outside. Figure I can help get your boys squared away, then you can get some shut-eye before the big push. Go on.”

Already tired just thinking about the amount of work required to prepare my men for tomorrow morning, I returned to the table, Sean and I alone in the dim canvas shelter.

He leaned one hand on the map table and Sean ran one set of fingers through his hair dark in exhaustion. “There is an additional assignment I have for you. One that we have to keep between ourselves. It’s a matter of defense secrets.”

I stiffened a little at that, the words eerily familiar to me for how often they’d related to horrible events in the past. “Of course, sir.”

In a secretive hunch, Sean leaned closer and lowered his voice. “We need to have a team of researchers and rangers on standby inside Silo 48, in case we have to launch on short notice. If ELSAR got their hands on the nukes, we’d be done for. Your platoon will escort the team to the bunker, and get them settled in; then, you’ll continue on with your official mission to reconnoiter the north.”

*We are going to use them, then.*

Disturbed at that concept, I glanced down at the map, noting the empty green patch where I knew the bunker lay. “So, who’s going to get the launch keys? They’re going to need both, which is going to mean a massive security risk. I’d say Chris would be a good choice, but we’ll need him in the field—”

“Sarah told me her crew analyzed the documents you brought back from the bunker, and apparently, they think there’s a way to convert one of the auxiliary control panels to a remote-launch shortwave system.” His mahogany-colored irises eyes scanned the inked hills, trees, and ridges, as if already searching for invisible enemies. “It would help us keep the launch capabilities mobile with us and ensure that neither ELSAR nor Vecitorak could overwhelm the facility by sheer force to use the missiles. Once the team reaches the bunker, they can convert the panel, pre-install the keys, and hand it off to you.”

Time seemed to stop, the air caught in my lungs, and I swayed on my heels. “*Me*?”

Sean gave me a small, proud smile. “You’re one of the few people I know would never hand it over to ELSAR, and Vecitorak’s abilities don’t work on you. The safety of the device is paramount. Once you have the panel, you’ll proceed north and rendezvous with my convoy, and I’ll take it from there.”

*Last time I carried something that important, I almost got killed three different times.*

Pulse roaring in my temple, I shook my head. “Sir, with all due respect, why not keep the keys inside the bunker? No one else knows it’s there, it’d be far safer. Our platoon could be destroyed, I could be captured—”

“And so could the bunker.” Sean’s hard gaze caught and held mine, and he folded both massive arms to accentuate his point. “The garrison there will be given charges to install, to blow up the missiles in case they are overrun. You will destroy the launch panel and keys if you believe capture draws near.”

“But why bother if we can’t even use them?” I dug my thumbnail into my hip to prevent myself from breaking out into a nervous sweat at the authority being entrusted to me. “I mean, Chris and I have talked about it, and he said he didn’t think there was a situation where the nukes can help us. We can’t launch on Black Oak, it’d lose us the war.”

“If we fail, either ELSAR or Vecitorak will swarm over Barron County.” Sean gestured at the map with a broad arc of his hand. “Vecitorak might even cover the world, if he succeeds. If the day comes when our defeat is all but certain, we’ll send the missiles into the sky and bring them back down on Barron County to wipe the slate clean once and for all.”

*Mother of God.*

My stomach clenched, the enormity of that like a truck on my intestines. “You mean . . . kill everyone?”

His hand rested on my shoulder, heavy, but compassionate, calloused from many days of brutal manual labor at the reserve. “ELSAR we can survive; they are men, corrupt and evil, but men nonetheless. They can be fought, or brought to justice if possible, but Vecitorak? A nuclear warhead would be a mercy compared to whatever he has in store.”

“So, it’s a failsafe? A last resort? We won’t actually use it, right?” I angled my head to plead with Sean, peering into his dark eyes in hopes of securing a form of comfort at my chilling orders.

Sean’s features drew into a grim resignation that didn’t inspire any sort of optimism. “I hope not, Hannah, but those missiles are the only sure thing we have to stand between us, and total oblivion. That’s why I had to overlook your objections earlier; I can’t have you hunting Vecitorak down when I need your help securing those nukes. Moreover, if the times comes to act, and I’m not able to, you will be the only person authorized to issue a launch command.”

Circling back behind the table, Sean reclined into a small folding chair and rested both arms on the table before him, fingers interlaced. “I know you understand just how important this is; Dekker seemed to think you were up to the challenge when I asked him about it in private, so I won’t order you to do it. I want you to go on your own volition. If you don’t want the job, I’ll try to find someone else, though I can’t honestly say I’d be that confident in another choice. It’s up to you, Brun. Can you do this for me?”

I stood, stock still, frozen in the moment. How long ago had I been offered such a petrifying choice by our commander, in his old office at New Wilderness, when I first chose the Rangers as my home faction? Jamie had been at my side then, cheered me on, guided me to make the right call. Now I stood alone in front of Sean, with no one to advise me but myself. It was the biggest responsibility of my life, and one that shook me to the bone. To be able to launch a nuclear strike, to obliterate all of Barron County in the blink of an eye, to disintegrate both friend and foe in one last doomed stand was nightmarish to think of . . . but I knew that Sean was right.

*True bravery is being willing to do hard things for the good of others.*

As fresh as the day I’d heard it after being rescued from ELSAR headquarters, Kaba’s voice echoed from my memories, one of many people in my journey who had put their life on the line for me. I couldn’t let them all down, not now.

With a practiced rigidity, I straightened to give Sean a salute that would have made Jamie proud. “Consider it done, sir.”
