This happened years ago, so some details are fuzzy. 

I am an agnostic person. I was raised Catholic, went to church, and was a firm believer for years. Right after high school, I was fat, depressed and not doing too well in life. I was drinking a lot, my room was a mess, and I hated everyone around me. I was in a dark place. That's around the same time I started to notice little things around me, little movements from the corner of my eyes, dark shadows, and weird noises. One day, my friend, who is somewhat medium, comes over, and we watch a movie. I tell her about what I have seen and heard. She immediately gets up and goes to my room. Which is still a mess. She comes back around 2 minutes later with a rosary ring (it's the same thing as a regular rosary only in ring form). I got from a Catholic retreat a few years prior. She said her guardian angel led her to it. She told me with this deep look on her eyes, "Keep it close, you are gonna need it.

2 key things happened the following week: I found out the names of my guardian angel... and my demon that was trying to ruin my life. I was praying in my room because what she said scared the shit out of me. I prayed to God, Jesus, and Mary and asked my guardian angel for protection. I said, "Please..." A voice in my head just kept saying "Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, " so I continued,"Please, Gabriel, protect me. " I felt at a little more peace with myself. A few days later, I had slipped into an even darker place than where I was before. I saw a movement from the corner of my eye again and again and again. I asked "what ks your name?" I knew it had to be something. And I heard in a very dark, rasp, midtone voice "Seth" needless to say I was beyond scared 

The night it all ended. 
I was at my lowest this night. Work was killing me, I had gained even more weight and was tired beyond what I thought i could be but also wide awake. When I went to bed, something strange happened. I was sitting on my coach. But I was lying in bed. I was so confused. It was my basement, and the TV was on. Something started to crawl out of the TV. It was a demon (I knew right off the back somehow). I know it sounds like the ring, but at this point, I had never seen it, but i knew about it. It started to crawl towards me. Then boom! I was sitting on my swing set outside. The swing set is where I spent my time relaxing, I'd blast music and just swing for hours. But this time, it was all dark around me, yet I could see maybe 10 feet in every direction from some dime light. Then, out of the darkness ran a figure as tall as I was covered in hair from head to toe. I know it sounds silly, but think chewy but a man, and I can not see its face. Plus, it'd hair it much linger than Chewy's. It bull rushed me and sent me flying. I then realized my physical body was lying in bed, but my spirit was fighting. 

I fought 2 battles at the same time. I remember the tv demon my soul was shaking in fear, and my body ached. I just remember it was her soul or mine. i pushed her back into the tv. It's like I overpowered her. Then I was back at my swing set, fighting the hairy demon. I remember being scared like scared, scared. I was beating me. My soul wasn't strong enough. I felt myself weakening. Then, as it approached me, I had this surge of energy come over me, and I pushed it with all my might, and it went flying back through my neighbors fence. 

Boom, I was back in my room. I'm crying but happy because I thought it was over. Then I hear a laugh in my head. It's Seth. I started to scream in my head, "Leave me alone!" He just laughed. I demanded over and over he show himself and when he finally did I didn't know what to do. He showed me himself in my head so every time I closed my eyes, I would see him. He has grey skin, with yellow eyes, pointy cracked teeth, and a lot of rincles on his face. Each rincle line was a thin red line. 
I was screaming, "Leave me alone over and over." he wouldn't leave. Finally, I played for Grabiel to help me. This is the part that I can not explain. I very vividly remember feeling to arms around me as if someone was giving me a hug from behind, the arms started at my mid side stomach and both ended on my chest and I could feel someone's body pressed up against my back (I was laying on my stomach) and I heard in the lost clear voice I've ever heard "I cannot help you, but i am right here" as soon as I heard and felt that I started screaming over and over to seth "go Way, go away, go away!" Then nothing, he was gone. I went from being sad and crying to being at peace like true peace. It is as if seth and his 2 demons had been pushed out of my soul at last. I have never nor sinse felt a sense of relief like that ever sense. After the ordeal, my life got back on track, I started tinlose weight, I became happier, and my whole life did a 180. 

Sorry, I know it is kind of long. If you have questions, I will do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading my story. This is the first time I have ever read said this to anyone.
