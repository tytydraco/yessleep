18 days have passed since we departed from our home station. Me, Tyler, Issac, our operator Vaughn, and our captain James all loaded up into our type 3 fire engine and made our way for our assignment to central Washington. The green creek fire had grown from 1,000 acres with a low spread potential to over 30,000 acres in just a matter of days. 

   Our first week consisted of vigorous mop up. Digging, cutting and drowning any residual heat out of the wasteland the flames had left behind. Certainly not the most glamorous work but we were used to it. This was my second year in fire and the beautiful landscape of trees, mountains and streams that Washington had to offer sure beat the desert scenery that we were used to back home. 

   On day 8 we were informed during briefing that a hand crew of 18 people were missing. They were working on one of the most active flanks of the fire and had not been seen since the previous day. Overnight various attempts to contact them and other crews forming search parties had no luck in locating the crew. The pickup trucks that they arrived in were parked in a safe area a short hike away from where that began work that day. Fatalities sometimes happen and we often study and learn from incidents in which individuals or crews are lost on fires. I’ve been on fires where people got injured but nothing like this. Some of the crews gear had been found burned over in the area they were working but no bodies, which gave everyone hope that they may just be lost. Needless to say we had been told to Keep an eye out and hopefully they would turn up. 

   It was on day 9 that we were told by our division leader that we would be reassigned to help hold a burning operation on the most active flank of the fire. This usually meant standing on a road while a hand crew takes drip torches in a line to burn off everything on the side that is threatening to burn past the road. Meanwhile as an engine crew we make sure that if anything catches on the opposite side we can put it out quickly and ensure that the burn won’t get out of hand. 

   The burn began around 1930 and the familiar burn of smoke in my throat was a generous way to take me out of my sleep deprived state. I stayed with the hose for about an hour watching into the green on my left for embers that might escape into the brush. The occasional tree would ignite causing a surge of adrenaline to fuel my body and give me an excuse to enjoy spraying the hose. After giving Issac and Tyler some time on the nozzle and the three of us taking turns  assisting with the burn it had become dark out. The development of the missing crew left a haze over everyone and every radio transmission of the search parties was listened to intently in hopes that they might bring good news. 

   Things would wrapping up for the night around 0000 and we had progressed almost 2 miles. As the burn was coming to an end I stood nozzle in hand looking out into the dark Forrest on my left only barely illuminated by the flames on my right I became transfixed on a pair of antlers peaking out from the brush. They moved only slightly bobbing up and down. They were too far away to see clearly and the flames cast light on them in an inconsistent way that made them even more difficult to focus on. I thought to grab the attention of Vaughn from the drivers seat but his focus was on the burn to the right. As I looked back towards the antlers they had come closer. The bizarre fact was i couldn’t  see the head they were attached to. The brush was tall but a buck should’ve stood taller, this bothered me because it was as if somehow the animal was sneaking through the bushes as if it were a predator, not to mention deer cannot move in that way. 

   I became more unnerved the closer they came. From where I first spotted them the darkness they left room for my eyes to deceive me but the closer they came I began to see more clearly. Instead of the plump tall figure of a deer I could only see the antlers barely protruding from above the bushes. Slowly swaying left and right in a hypnotic dance. I was transfixed and as they weaved in between the brush and the tree trunks fear shot throughout my body like I had never felt it before. From around 50 yards away I saw a slender human-like hand reach out and grasp onto a tree limb followed by a humanoid body slightly visible now above the brush. For one moment I could see it entirely, its arms and legs too long for a normal humans and its grotesque naked body stood abnormally tall and at its head was a buck skull worn as if it were a mask. In an instant it was gone and from deep within the trees I heard it scream like a man’s voice mixed with an animalistic tone of despair and grief that I could never forget. 

   I didn’t sleep until two days later when the exhaustion of working 16 hours a day caught up to me. I was quiet for the rest of the assignment and incredibly sleep deprived. I didn’t tell anyone what I saw and I knew that nobody would believe me if I did. I tried to rationalize and shrug it off as my mind playing tricks on me in the dark. After days of endlessly thinking about what I had experienced our assignment was over and we were heading home. During our drive on the second day James found a news article that revealed the crew had been found, all dead. The official reports stated that they had been killed by wildlife according to their injuries and were found 2 miles away from where they had been. Everyone tried to make sense of how 18 people could’ve died the way they did and what kind of animal could have done that. I’ve never heard of anything capable of doing that but I believe I may have seen what was responsible that night.
