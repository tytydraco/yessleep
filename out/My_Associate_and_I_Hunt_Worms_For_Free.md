Two months ago, in Russia, a scheduled demolition of a high rise took an unexpected turn when, a few minutes before explosives were due to go off, the entire building coiled like a snake and vanished in a cloud of dust and debris. The so-called "optical illusion" was explained as a chain reaction of explosives travelling down the building. 

Even more recent, sooner than a few weeks ago, a popular museum collapsed in Poland, derailing a train. Tragically, twelve people lost their lives. A couple of people who witnessed the event described seeing something very strange moments after the collapse: a spiral of dust and bricks emerging from the wreckage, only to vanish in the space between two buildings. 

What the general public don't know, is that these were not accidents. They were Worms. 

(Probably). It's difficult to know for sure, but me and my associate believe they are becoming more active, which is an issue. 

Of course when I say Worm, I'm not talking about your garden worm or your wood worm or anything like that at all. What I'm talking about is possibly the most impressive creature on our planet - so impressive that they have hidden from us for millennia. 

So, how do I know about them? And what exactly are they? Let me try and explain. 

I like to think it was fate which led me to this unfathomable world I now inhabit, but you could also say that I was in the right place at the right time. I'm not particularly smart or motivated. Before my world was changed forever, I worked in an office, in a warehouse. I was an administrator. 

To tell you the truth, I had no direction in life. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, or feel. I was going through the motions, counting down the days and the hours, waiting for something to happen. I suppose you could say I was looking for something beyond, beyond myself, beyond the surface level in which people's lives usually operate. 

Maybe it was as simple as that seeking, which put me on the same path as my associate. 

One evening, I had to finish late at work due to missing some hours the day prior. As I made my way home by foot, I walked down the same industrial estate I did every day. It was autumn, and even though it was only about seven or eight, the sky was black and the only lights were those shining from the tops of buildings and street lamps. Almost everyone had gone home by now. It was fairly quiet, just the rush of distant traffic. 

Quiet... until I began to feel the edges of my ear vibrating. You ever feel like you're hearing sounds that you can't hear? Like, higher frequencies? That's what it felt like. I remember my ears popping, and stumbling over the pavement onto a patch of grass, then looking around, bewildered. 

Moments later, a man in a black trench coat emerged from a large gate at the building opposite me. "You there! Come here! I need your help!" His instruction sounded urgent yet friendly and casual at the same time. I wasn't sure what to make of it. "W-what is it?" I asked, scratching my head. 

His hands ushered me in frantically but his voice remained polite and pleasant. "Please?" 

My ears were ringing slightly as I stood up. For some reason, I began making the journey across the road towards him. "Is there a high-pitched sound?" I searched for reassurance from him. 

"Yes - don't worry, you're not going crazy."

Before I'd even got to the gate, he produced this... black box of sorts - like some kind of sound system, that was my first impression of it. 

"Is that what's making the noise?" I asked, trying to decide whether to be annoyed. 

"Yep, and please hold it. We don't have much time." He thrust it into my arms as he sprinted inside the gate, yelling behind him. "Quick, come inside!" 

Still heavily confused, I traced behind him carrying the heavy box, until I found myself in a wide and empty car park, which he was now at the other end of already. 

When I finally caught up to him, he was yanking tons of thick black cable from the boot of his car. "What's forty six times two?" He asked, looping the wire around his arm. 

"Uh, ninety two?"

"OK. Double it." 

"Uh, one hundred and eighty four? What is it you need help with again?" 

"Set that frequency on the device."

"I'm sorry, what?" I said with my face scrunched. 

"Just do it!" 

The desperation in his voice made me trust him, and I looked down at the black box and saw it was on via a green LED display. I twisted the large knob until the display read one hundred and eighty four. 

"Put the box down. I need you to help me carry this wire over to the building." 

"I'm sorry, what is going on here?" 

"No time to explain. You'll see very soon. Don't worry, everything is going to be OK." 

I don't know whether it was the pressure pulsing in my skull or what, but I did what he said. I put the box down and let him collapse the weight of the cables onto my arms. Then we both ran as fast as we could towards the front of the building. 

We connected up each of twelve cable ends to a part of the building he had marked, then we retreated across the car park as he instructed. 

We were stood next to each other, when suddenly his hand held mine and squeezed it tight. "Are you ready for something spectacular?" I turned and looked at him terrified, then what I can only describe as a nuclear bomb's worth of light blinded out everything in an intense flash. As it faded ever so slightly, I realised that there were gigantic spotlights set up on the wall behinds us, focusing on the building. 

Then, the ground began to feel uneasy. That's when I turned to him again. "Is the world ending?" I shouted over the perceived intense ringing in my ears. I must have looked like a little kid having a nightmare, yet astonishingly his face was full of unhinged laughter as he looked back and squeezed my hand even tighter. 

The ground was noticeably shaking now. Not by much, but just enough to scare me into closing my eyes for a second and brace for something apocalyptic. But when nothing happened after a few seconds, courage or curiosity forced my eyes open again. What I saw would change my life forever. 

It's hard to describe what I saw. Picture a massive office block unravelling like gigantic three-dimensional Tetris pieces as a waterfall of dust cascades to the ground. That doesn't even grab 1% of the energy of it. 

A behemoth of glass, concrete and steel rising like a self-replicating Rubik's cube, towering into the night sky while the powerful lights gave it an eerie and celestial glow. 

"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!" I screamed. "WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?" 

"That, my friend, is a Worm!" 

"A FUCKING WHAT?"

"A Worm!" He laughed maniacally as his head turned upwards to face it. 

Suddenly, the great churning mass lurched to the side followed by a loud crashing sound as the entire wall and gate to our left flopped over like cardboard. 

"It's moving!" He yelled, taking a few steps towards the car as his head followed it. 

"I can see that!" I shouted sarcastically as my mouth hung wide open. 

"Quick, get in the car! We have to follow it!" 

"We have to what??!"

"Follow it!" He said, sprinting towards the vehicle across the car park. "Come on!" 

Next thing I know, we are darting it down the industrial estate, chasing the "tail" of this monstrous mass, dodging stray chunks and things that its spewing out behind it. It's rising up and down so violently that our wheels leave the road several times. 

"It's heading towards the main road! Brace yourself!" 

By the time we reach the end of the industrial estate, the thing is barrelling along at ridiculous speeds. Some kind of rock hits our windshield and splinters half the glass, but it doesn't penetrate it as it's made out of some kind of impact-resistant material. 

The thing passes the main road in a split second, disappearing between the trees. That's when he slams the breaks. "What now?" I ask, somehow just as involved as he is in this escapade. 

He's silent for a second. "I think it's going to the scrapyard." He says, before flooring it again. "We can intercept it." 

On the way to the scrapyard, I start throwing out questions. "What are we trying to do? Capture it?" 

His responses were short and rushed. "Nope. You can't capture a Worm. It can imbed itself into anything. You put it inside a box, it will just make itself the box." 

"So then, we're trying to kill it?" 

"That's also a negative. We're just testing my tracking software so we can keep an eye on it."

"And then what?"

"And then we kill it."

"So, what exactly is a... Worm?" 

"Have you ever seen those diagrams of human nerve systems?"

"I think so."

"Well, that's what a Worm looks like. It's like a living nervous system that can wire itself into anything, giving it an exoskeleton of whatever it desires." 

"Why have I never heard about them before?"

"Ah, well, there's many reasons. For one, they're very clever creatures. Experts at hiding." 

"That one we just saw didn't seem too good at hiding?" 

"That's because we lured it out - that setup you helped me with - it's a special technique I use to find them."

"You do this as a job?"

"No, not really; a hobby. Almost there now."

As we pull into the scrapyard, everything seems still. The ringing in my ears has died down, and it's dark. 

We circled the scrapyard a couple times before I spoke up. "I think we lost it."

"No, it's still here."

For a moment the distant whirr of traffic evaporates, and everything is silent save a dog barking. I try to listen for it. 

"We'll leave it here for now. Not much we can do until we have the tools." 

"We can't kill it here?" 

"Absolutely no chance in Hell." 

"Then, what are we doing here?"

"This." He says, showing me a cellular panel with a flickering dot. "I can track them now. That's important." 

"You risked both our lives and the public so you could track a giant worm?"

"Well, when you put it that way it makes me feel bad, but yes." 

I shook my head in disapproval. "Unbelievable. And there was me thinking you were some kind of hero."

"Well I'm glad you don't think that. Because the last thing I need is some lost son who needs a father figure. However, I do need an assistant. Someone who can help me do my job better." 

"After today? Absolutely no way." Was my reply. 

Two days later, I quit my job to join him. 

My associate - let's call him Nick - was a genius. Sometimes I thought his intelligence really bordered on the supernatural, the way he explained things with lightning wit. He'd figured all this Worm business out by himself about a year ago, and had been hunting and studying them ever since. He didn't like talking about himself that much, though. I still don't know much about him, I just know that I like him, a lot. 

He told me a lot about the Worms. How, apparently, they had likely been responsible for structural disassembly going back thousands of years. But if so, how didn't we know about them sooner? 

For one, he said, Worms are "unofficially psychic". Being a gigantic assembly of nerves, they are extremely sensitive to their environment, able to recede at the slightest risk of danger. If you somehow suspected a Worm in your wall and tried to hammer at it, for example, the creature would have sensed your intent to do so long before you even took your first swing. The only way to "surprise" them is to jam their neurological system via complicated techniques that I will not disclose here. 

What is their purpose? To survive, just like any creature. 

The Worm diet is very rudimentary - requiring only warmth and light to sustain themselves. However, as they grow, they need ever larger amounts. Really massive Worms migrate to larger buildings, where they can feed off the increase in energy footfall and their neurological pathways can continue to branch out. Their size is theoretically limitless. 

The electricity grid has been a great innovation for them in this regard. Nick theorises they've been gorging on it for a long time, slurping up the radiation in our modern world like milkshake through a straw. Accelerating their growth to levels unseen in the history of their evolution. 

This is potentially bad news for humanity. One building falling down every few months isn't the end of the world - tornadoes and natural disasters will trump that easily. But if things escalate beyond a point - if the Worms get too big, too quickly... 

As far as I know, it's only me and Nick monitoring the Worms. We're trying our best to figure out what's going on. 

We're trying to save the world.
