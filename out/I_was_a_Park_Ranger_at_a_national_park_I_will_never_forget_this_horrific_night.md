I am a big fan of CampfiretalesYT on youtube, so i originally shared this horrific experience to him via email, but i thought it would be a good idea to also share this on Reddit...

It all started a few years ago, It was your run of the mill boring shift at the office. I worked the night shifts, and our staff was pretty small, so there was usually only one or two other rangers working with me, but on this specific night I was alone.  I yawned and looked at the clock, it read 3:00 AM.

*Only a few hours to go..*

Suddenly, I heard a branch crack outside. Like the paranoid person I was, I instantly tensed up and began to slightly panic.

*You’re being crazy, it’s just an animal or something.*

My paranoia returned twofold once I heard another branch breaking. I knew it was most likely nothing, but I got up and made sure the door was locked, and then I looked out the window, scanning the area for anything suspicious. I took a deep sigh of relief when the answer was affirmative.

Upon sitting down, I swore I could hear the faintest footsteps coming from outside the office. So faint that they could’ve been in the back of my mind, but then they grew louder, and there was no doubt that they were real.  The footsteps seemed to be getting louder and closer by the second, and they sounded like no normal animals or humans.

I tried to distract myself by playing some games on my computer, but the paranoia was becoming too much to ignore. I jumped when I heard the horrific sound of screeching nails on one of the back office windows. I got up and quickly made my way to the window, only to find a long, red scratch mark. My stomach threatened to empty itself at the sight.

Usually I like being alone at the night shift, but at this moment I wished I had another co-worker with me.

I heard another scratching noise, this time coming from the window closest to my desk. I ran out of the room and watched as five terrifying nails slowly scratched their way down the window, leaving the same red mark.

I spent the next half hour sitting in my chair shaking and teeming with intense anxiety, hearing the scratching sound every so often. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore, I got up and looked at the first window, it was totally and utterly covered with red scratch marks. There was absolutely no seeing out of that window.  I checked every other window, and it was the same for all of them. I sat back down and looked at the clock, it was now 4:00 AM, meaning there was only around an hour until dawn.
