They say that the day you meet your doppelgänger is the day you die.

It has to do with a taboo that stems from the uncanny feeling of losing your idiosyncrasy and uniqueness. Supposedly, the day you lose your status as an exclusive individual, is the day you lose yourself. 

The sayings are true. These urban legends and spooky bed time stories have been passed down for generations by word of mouth for a reason. But I am here today to enlighten those who have brushed it aside as some kind of mere psychological discomfort. 

The truth is, the fun stories of “I met my doppelgänger today” and friendly photos of two people posing who look alike are just a mere coincidence of physical similarity. No, if one is found by their doppelgänger, there won’t be any cheerful stories or photos. Just a vestige of what was once a person.

You will not come across your doppelgänger when you are in a safe environment. It will not approach you until you are the only one left in a room, an alleyway, a building, or any kind of space. By the time you see a presence that eerily looks indistinguishable to you, it is too late. 

How do I know this? I found it, before it found me. Just out of pure coincidence.

But this is a story for another time.

Right now, I am writing this for the readers to educate themselves and avoid their doppelgängers like the plague. The plague might be better in some cases. 

From the day a person is born. A doppelgänger is formed. Nobody knows where or how but it seems to be the case that everyone has a pair. 

From day 1 life becomes a game. A game of hide and seek. The catch being, that the one who is IT is aware of this game while the prey is ignorant of the cruel reality. Some being lucky until the day they die, some visited and replaced. By replaced, I mean that the existence of one who is caught will still continue in the experience of those acquainted. It would be as if nothing had happened, only that the doppelgänger had won the game, the prize being solitude. Your existence replaced. The whole ordeal is a harrowing experience only available in the first-person perspective.

When one is found by their doppelgänger, they are eaten. The only positive being that the death is painless and quick. For it eats the head first. It is not known why they do this, but some assume that it is an action based on clandestinity. For it is aware that a loud noise may bring attention to the feeding scene. Some assume that it is for efficiency. Consumption of the head will quicken the digestion of the prey’s memories and emotional structure. 

But just because death is rapid do not underestimate the experience of the chase. Hide and seek for the hiders is usually a game that encompasses 3 main emotions throughout the game. The feeling of security and relief of finding and hiding in a space that seems cozy yet concealed. Unaware of the surroundings and the location of the IT. Only to be visited by the emotion of dread as the sound of the IT that is on the search seems to get closer with each breath. 

There is a moment of complete silence as the hider and IT both become aware of each other’s proximity. A mini game of who can be the quietest takes place; a game where the loser is predestined. 

It hears you breathe.

Its mouth widens, ripping the skin of the cheeks.

Its eyes dilate and triple in size of a regular human. Staring at the very place that you are hiding. It waits, as if to give you a head start in the inevitable run of panic. In and out does the breath go, ba-dump ba-dump does the heart pound. A melody too good to resist for your counterpart.

If you have visual as the doppelgänger approaches, running is the best option. Therefore, hiding in a place that allows you to have an idea of your surroundings is the best-case scenario.

I’m sorry, up to date there is no strategy book for facing your doppelgänger. When it’s time for your personal chase, you’re on your own. So far, no one has made it past chase. Your best luck is… to win the hide and seek.

Now that you’ve realized that you are a part of a game, make a conscious effort to stay in hiding. Maybe you’re glad I told you. Maybe you’re barely keeping your anger in for you would prefer blissful ignorance. Ask yourself, is it truly better to find yourself oblivious in a nightmare not knowing how it ends…

Or would you want the agency of safety in your hands?

It is constantly looking for you.

It is awake while you are asleep.

It starves day to day just to have a taste of you with a fresh pallet. 

Even in this very moment you are a desirable prize waiting to be taken over.

Do not be complacent. 

As IT is constantly looking for you, you also should constantly be on the lookout.

Trust your gut, for you will know when it is close by.

A sudden silence not expected.

A moment of realization followed by a helpless trepidation.

No one to be seen but footsteps to be heard.

Temperature unchanged but shivers running down your spine.

The silence brings out a ringing in your ears 

In and out does the breath go, ba-dump ba-dump does the heart pound.

Until the very moment you hear,

“I found you”
