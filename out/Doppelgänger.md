I was curled up in my apartment, binge-watching a cheesy rom-com to unwind after a long shift at the diner, when my phone pinged. It was a text from my best friend, Mia, who lived across town, a solid 30-minute drive away. Her message sent a jolt through me: “Lila, why are you standing in my driveway staring at my window? It’s 2 a.m., this is creepy as hell.”

I frowned, typing back fast. “What? I’m at home, Mia. On my couch, nowhere near your place.” My apartment was quiet, just the hum of the TV and the faint drip of my leaky kitchen faucet.

Another ping. “Don’t mess with me. I’m looking at you right now.” Then a photo loaded, and my breath caught. It was blurry, snapped through her bedroom window, but there I was—or something like me—standing in her driveway. Same curly black hair pulled into a messy bun, same denim jacket I wore everywhere, same lanky frame. But the face… it was mine, yet not. The eyes were too big, too dark, like ink spilled across a page, and the mouth curved into a smile that was all wrong, too sharp at the edges.

My fingers shook as I typed, “Mia, that’s NOT me. I’m in my apartment. Lock your doors and call the cops.” I hit send, my heart pounding like it was trying to escape my chest.

She replied, “You’re freaking me out. It’s you, Lila. I see you.” Another photo. The thing was closer now, standing on her lawn, head tilted up at her window. That smile stretched wider, unnatural, like it was carved into its face. My denim jacket looked tattered in the porch light, frayed in ways mine wasn’t.

I called her, my voice trembling. “Mia, listen to me. That’s not me. Get somewhere safe, call 911, now!” She laughed, nervous, like she thought I was pulling a prank, but I could hear the panic creeping in. “I’m not joking,” I said. “That thing—it’s not me!”

She went quiet, then whispered, “It’s… moving. It’s waving at me, Lila.” I heard her blinds clatter as she peeked out. Then a choked gasp. “It’s gone. It was right there, and now it’s just… gone.” Her voice was shaking. “What is this?”

“Stay on the phone,” I told her, grabbing my keys. I was halfway to the door when she screamed—a piercing, guttural sound that cut off into dead silence. The call dropped. I tried calling back, but it went to voicemail. My hands were ice as I dialed 911, stammering about Mia, the photos, the thing wearing my face. They told me to stay put, that a unit was on the way to her house.

I couldn’t wait. I sped to Mia’s, my old hatchback rattling as I pushed it past its limits. When I got there, her street was flashing with police lights. Cops, paramedics, neighbors gawking from their lawns. I ran toward her house, but an officer stopped me, demanding ID. When I showed it, his eyes narrowed, like I was a suspect. “You’re the one from the footage,” he said, his hand hovering near his holster.

“Footage?” I asked, my stomach twisting.

They showed me later, at the station. Mia’s doorbell cam caught it: the thing with my face, standing in her driveway, staring up. It moved wrong—too stiff, like its joints didn’t bend right. At one point, it turned to the camera, flashed that jagged smile, and whispered something. They played it back, amplified. It was my voice, warped and hollow, like it came from a throat full of gravel: “Open the door, Mia. It’s Lila.”

Mia was okay, barely. She’d locked herself in her closet after hearing it inside her house—footsteps, uneven and heavy, and my voice calling her name, soft and wrong. “Lila, come on, let me in,” it had said, scratching at the closet door. It stopped right before the cops arrived. They found my denim jacket on her doorstep, stained with something dark that smelled like damp earth and rot.

I haven’t seen Mia since. She won’t answer my texts—says looking at me makes her sick, reminds her of that thing. Last night, I found marks on my apartment door—long, jagged scratches, like something tried to claw its way in. At 3 a.m., my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number. Just a photo: me, standing in my own parking lot, staring up at my window with that same too-wide smile. But I was inside, alone, curled up in bed.

I burned the jacket today. The stench was unbearable, like mold and something metallic. As it burned, I heard it—a low, scraping laugh, coming from the shadows of my yard. I locked every door, every window, but I still feel it watching. Whatever it is, it’s not done. It’s still out there, wearing my skin, and I’m terrified it’s coming for me next.
