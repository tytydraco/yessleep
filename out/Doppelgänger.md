My name Is Kaveriah, For the sake of this story, I will refer to myself as Xav.

Ive learned the English dialect about 5 minutes ago. Me and a team of space marshal Forge and attendees have traversed galaxies.
Our job is to protect planets from mortal danger. We have arrived on a planet we call Terrox. The previous inhabitants called it something different-iThere are lifeforms here. They seem to be primitive. Using technology in selfish and self worshipping ways. Learning recycled information.
I am going to be reciting this journal written by one of the lifeforms here. I will give my all-around assessment when lam
Finished and presented it to fellow crewmates.

“My name is Jennifer, in going to recount the events that have happened in this journal. This started a year ago, I had breakfast at around 7 am then went for my morning run. On my run were the first signs. I run for 3 and a half blocks usually..”

As much as Ive read this person does not sound like Mike the lifeforms currently inhabiting this planet. I am intrigued with curosityafs tie been reading this Someone has been staring outside of Our translucent light ship. Almost like he can see through it. I will not deceive myself, I am with worry.

“ ...at around the 2nd block, I saw something, I saw... well, me. A woman who looked just like me. It was uncanny, as I ran past she just stared. Almost like she was studying me. Then something worse happened, she started running too The same pace, the same gate, She remained eve contact, She even had the same 'in-step' as me. Then abruptly She stopped, I picked up my pace and carried on home. As I carried on throughout My day, I ran errands, went to the bank, and even brought extra butter to my neighbor”

It is astounding how mundane task, and meaningless monotony, was the way of life for these people. Maybe this is why they're so primitive because they spoil themselves with boring tasks, Ive looked out my ship once again. My ship once again. She’s still staring at me, my anxiety is increasing. She won't go away. It's almost like she can see me. This lifeform is observant. I’ve also realized shes mimicking my behavior. Of all the galaxies My team has traversed, this by far, is the most intriguing.
The inhabitants before called it the "Milky Way” Odd name to say the least and so, despite the uneasy feeling I get from this life-ferm side of my ship, there are indeed safeguards. I shall Keep reading.

"After getting home I heard a Knock on my door it was my neighbor, Craig. Craig has always been an awkward guy, but this time he was different When I answered the door he just smiled Then it happened. "H-..
"Paused. I said " Hello? Craig?"'
"''Pello Jennifer" Was all he said then left" Ever
Since it has gotten worse Ive been staying inside now. Every time I go out I see my double, mimicking my moves and my activities.
I hate to sound like in wearing a tin foil hat, but I believe aliens are taking over.
I don't go to work anymore, I showed up the other day and they didn't even know who I was. I stay home now, the other ME, took MY job!”

I must say I'm getting an idea of what's happened here on planet Terrox. Although I'm not sure Where these false lifeforms have come from.
Update on the current situation of the girl, er... Dog now? Confusion is baffling me, did I not take more heed to the lifeform staring at my ship? I think im coming to a conclusion. I must Study this. 
"Shapeshifters? Clones? do they
Change based on Physical examination? I must read on!

"'No one I Know recognizes me, Im cowering in My apartment now, they act like everyone else. I called my mom, Only ..ugh Fuck! It wasn't My Mom. She said "Hi Jennifer " she's called me "'Jen" for Years! they can mimic behavior mamerisms, FACES! but not sentimentality They know in not one of them, They’ve taken everyone. No one is real. Where are the people I called my Family, My friends, my colleagues?
Hold on, someone knocking on my door,"


After reading this my conclusion is mimic
Parasitix. The Alien breed of mimicking
Parasitic lifeForms. The dog... I mean... me, is Still there. There are more. This lifeform was Male when I first saw it. I must warn the Others.

"The mailman was at the door, I Killed him. He spits a viscous purple liquid on my skin as I stab him. it's been a week since. My body is changing. Ive shifted many times.
I recently saw an aircraft land about 1 mile from here, Maybe They can help, are we rescued??
I'm making a journey to it. God help us!”

My crewmates finished the 
journal I showed them. 

We all looked in Awe 
as we stared out the aircraft once more. 
We opened the hatch, it, or, she. 
Walked in, "Who are you," we asked talking over each other.
It will, She, stared and said “Jen, are you here to
She was cut Short. 
She was changing again, Into a grey, one-eyed figure, with a head just like mine, limbs grew, and to all of our surprise, She Split into 4 beings, mirror images of me and my crewmates.

"Who are you" the beings said in unison. Before any of us could speak they said
"We are one
"We are many". 
“We are hive”
I snapped out of my paralyzed State and sprinted for the last resort. As I was using the hover hallway within the ship I looked back. They absorbed my crewmates.
"We Are One We are Many We are You".
They chanted as the sickening slurp and pop rang in the air from my crew mate's disappearance. 
I stopped looking back and finally reached the machine, the very last resort, I arrived at the machine and hit the button for the year 2023.

“Where’d he come from? Brief me” a tall gentleman, with a gun on his waist, demanded.
Another man in a suit replied, "Sir, he arrived in a capsule with nothing but a Journal with him". 

"Hmm,” the suit said.
"um, sir there's something else you should Know". 
"Well? " the suit said Condescending
"he says he's a time traveler... from 2096, he said he has a warning for Terrox.. his name for the earth.”
