How we met Ashton

I spent a bit of time thinking of how I wanted to present this to everyone. Of course, my first instinct was just to do things as usual. 

But I don't think that’s the right way to go about this. Our reactions are probably the same as yours. It wouldn't do anything for Ashton's advice for me to break it up with Mike making a joke, or Leo being fatalistic. 

So I'll relate it as it was related to me. With a few grammatical fixes and liberties to make it not a chore to digest: 


If I'd have known your Bishop was what I tangled with back in the summer of '34 I'd have found you sooner. But back then, he wasn't called the Bishop. 

The thing you need to understand about the paranormal is that it's just as much a slave to trends and the passing of time as anything else. 

Wherever you see something taking off, you'll find the devil and his minions.

The true talent of the thing you're chasing is it's ability to sniff those trends out, glom onto them and use them to further it's own fucked-up ends. 

Back then, he was a door to door salesman...

"Give the meathooks a rest, will you, Butch? I'm trying to think over here!", I say. 

The person I’m talking to is Sue "Butch" Anders. Tall as a Basketball player, wide as a linebacker and with barely an inch of flesh unmarked by scars. 

She ignores me, just as I expected would happen.  But a man's got to try, am I right?

"Ease up on the gal, it's not her fault you picked right now to have your first thought.", Abe says. 

He's a hundred and thirty pounds of book learning. Now, those books happen to be things like the Necronomicon, so he's no pansy, but you couldn't tell by looking at him. 

We sit in an old speakeasy, ever since uncle Sam decided to turn the Draught taps back on, there are plenty of hidden spots going unused.

"Take that act on the road, and I could get someone who knows what they're doing.", I reply. 

We both laugh, a small smirk creeps to one corner of Sue's mouth. 

I know every old man since Adam has talked about how much harder they had it than the current generation. And I’ll be the first to admit, most of the time it's a load of shit. But things were a lot more fast and loose for Heroes in my time. 

Management were still rubbing elbows with anyone in a position of power, but us grunts on the ground? We got the mushroom treatment. Received our information in envelopes shoved under a doorframe, or during brief passes on the street. Hell, I don't think I met anyone giving orders till I was damn near fifty. 

We relied on smaller, more local networks. The first, of course, being your family. Being good with faces and names was as much an asset as being quick with a pistol though. Making friends was an essential part of the job.

Our orders were to keep an eye on a certain travelling salesman. Management didn't tell us much more than that, but the grapevine was saying some strange things. 

Which is to say, the rumor mill was milling rumors. But everyone seemed to be able to agree on one thing. 

They didn't have a clue as to what he was. 

A lot of folks don't understand why that's such an issue. We know what he's done, we know what he doesn't like, why get worked up about the details?

The thing you young kids don't understand is that the devil you know is always better than the devil you don't. If we're talking literal devils that is. 

If you have something that can split the world in two, but you know exactly how to stop that from happening, it's nothing more than a chore. 

You have some weirdo with a Dutch accent, who pops up at random doing things no one can make sense of, that's a danger.

On top of everything else, intel was a lot more up to interpretation, once upon a time. Little more than urban legends in their Sunday best. 

We’d been following the Salesman for a long while. But he was as slippery as anything I’ve ever dealt with. I never felt we'd been made, mind you, but we were always a half-step behind. 

That night we had a lead that we hoped would change that. 

Didn't know where he was going, or what in the hell he was doing, but we knew where he was going to be. 

We weren't going in blind, but our vision was sure as hell blurry. 

We managed to get a hold of a cherry Rumrunner's Jalopy. Another thing that was in ample supply after the government came to it's senses on booze. 

No headlights, every screw and panel welded tight, and an engine full of almost as much sawdust as gasoline. It was quicker than anything else on the road and as close to silent as an automobile of the time would allow. 

It was an ass clenching ride down a nearly abandoned road in a southern state I can't quite remember. After this many years and miles, places kind of blend together. 

We're a little less than a kilometer out, all looking through military surplus binoculars. 

"Please tell me that's 20 something ghosts in that field.", Abe says with a tone of dismay. 

"I'm seeing sheets, I'm seeing soulless bastards under them, but no ghosts.", I reply. 

Sue grunts in anger. 

"I think this is more of a police situation.", Abe says, shaking his head at the group of misguided racists. 

" 2 o'clock. I'm seeing two cruisers parked, I don't think the coppers are too concerned.", I reply. 

"Fucking south, fucking coppers, fucking meshugana rednecks.", Abe comments. 

"Ain't getting any argument here. 

But, looks like our little birdy was telling the truth. There's the Dutchman, by the tent.", I observe. 

"Guess it's my time to shine.", Abe states, popping the trunk of the jet-black car. 

Abe pulls a large device out of the trunk, looks like a cross between a loudspeaker and a radio dish. He pops out a collapsible bipod and starts to aim it toward the closest thing to a consort of demons humanity has came up with. 

A large, stiff cable snakes back to the trunk of the car. Inside is a 200 pound combination of technology and the occult. Useless without someone versed enough in both to keep it running. 

Abe starts to fiddle with levers and dials, sweat beading on his brow. Slowly, but surely  the sounds of garbled static and occult whispers turn into something we can understand.

We hear the background noise of a bunch of small minds and big mouths. 

"You've got some big friends square-head. Only reason we're taking this meeting. 

Say your piece, and be quick about it.", We hear a gruff man say.

"If I’m offering a million dollars I’m going to take all the time I need, Avery. ", The salesman says. 

"Hey! We don't go using names around here.", a second man chimes in. He's trying to sound intimidating but he's shaken. 

"Sorry, sorry.", the salesman replies. His accent thick, his tone dismissive. 

"And what do you want for this million dollars?", Avery asks. 

"You know what I’m looking for. Or is that projector something you always bring to your get togethers? Watch a lot of Mickey Mouse? Get caught up on the newsreels maybe?", The salesman ends his reply with a mirthless laugh. 

"I do, but I want to make sure you know what you're getting into. 

I've got the film, but there ain't a damn thing I’ve been able to do to get rid of it. 

And every man who's tried watching it, ended up meeting the lord. 

I hope anyway. 

Best I can do is show it to you, but how am I going to go about getting my money from a dead man?", Avery explains. 

"You let me worry about when I see your god. 

You can have the money up front, if I die, leave me where I drop.", The salesman states. 

There's silence from the three men. even this far removed there’s a weight in what's going on. An oppressive, final energy to this devil's deal. 

“Your funeral Mac. Anyone I should send the body to when you’re done? A million will get you that at least.”, Avery asks. 

“No. There is no home for me here.”, The Salesman says wistfully. 

Sue and I are watching the tent. Men mill around it, no doubt having what passes for conversation in their circles. 

We hear the movement, the subtle hiss of a propane lamp stops. The dim light coming from the tent is extinguished. 

The salesman is in there alone. 

I’m sweating, heart racing, and I can’t quite tell why. I was young, but I’d seen more than my share of what the dark parts of the world had to offer. 

A soft hum, a projector beginning to warm up. 

“Nine corners, nine times, nine times nine. 

Why does no one remember the…”, are the last things we hear as the listening device begins to blast hellish static loud enough to be painful. Loud enough I’m concerned the pea-brained parade may have heard. 

“Shut it off Abe, for the love of god.”, I scream, drowned out by the din. 

Abe is frantically turning knobs and levers. Sue covers her ears, a look of mild annoyance on her face. 

The pain is too much, I start to stumble away from the jalopy, desperate to be rid of the sonic icepick stabbing into my brain. 

The listening device begins to rattle, small metal parts crack and tear themselves free. 

I see a trickle of blood coming from one of Abe’s ears as he starts ripping out wires and smashing tubes. He incants, prays, invokes, but nothing technological or arcane works. 

With one final ping of strained metal and a burst of grey smoke that moved against the wind, the sound mercifully stops. 

“What in the hell was that?”, I scream. 

“What?”, Abe replies. 

I sigh, no use in trying to have a conversation when all we can hear is ringing. 

A paranoia inducing non-silence pervades my hearing as I try to keep an eye on what’s going on. 

Flickering, pale white light flashes from below the tent. I don’t like it. The shadows it’s making seem all wrong. 

I wipe sweat from my brow. It’s a still night, but I swear I see the corners of the tent rippling in the breeze. 

This whole situation is fubar. I can’t shake the feeling there’s something we’re missing. 

“Ashton!”, Abe screams, entirely too close. 

I nearly fall over, startled to hell and back, absorbed in the unfolding scene below. 

“What the hell is wrong with you?”, I say, trying and failing to keep my voice low. 

Sue puts down her own Binoculars for a moment to turn toward us, shoulders moving slightly as she silently chuckles.

“Didn’t know if you could hear me!”, Abe replies. 

“Stones could hear you, Abe. Christ. “, I state.

Abe looks about a second away from calling me an asshole when Sue snaps, she points toward the gathering below and gives us a look that seems to say, “Stop being idiots.”.

Where the escaping light hits, the short grass begins to wilt and rot. Poorly made robes and hoods flutter in a wind that isn’t there. 

There’s something in that light that shook me more than any shapeshifter or ghoul I’ve come across. 

Even at this distance, silent, we see the crowd become agitated. Body language is aggressive, shoving matches break out.

Then, from inside the tent, the Salesman opens one flap. That light from somewhere else giving his thin form a halo from neither heaven nor hell. 

The effect is immediate. Pushes turn to blows, knives are drawn, bottles shattered, anything that can be used as a weapon, is. 

If you ask me, the kind of man to devote his life to the hatred of another, not someone I have pity for. But watching them tear each other apart, not something I could do again. 

Blood stains white sheets, it’s a battlefield with no sides, no logic, no point. 

Even from this distance, the light is a physical pain. Still potent enough to tug at our minds. But we can’t turn away. 

The brawl turns into a slaughter, those violent or lucky enough unintentionally splitting into haphazard alliances. But then things take an unexpected turn. 

The slaughter turns into, something worse than indiscriminate violence. Something focused, something brutal, something evil. 

I’d call it a ritual, but I’ve seen enough of those. This wasn’t some hotline to a basement god, this was the reaction to the human mind seeing something truly wrong. Something with no connection to our reality. 

I wanted to turn away, even who these people were couldn’t excuse the level of pain and damage they were inflicting on each other. You put a mad dog down, you don’t tear it apart. 

But on it went, those too wounded or unnoticed by their fellows wail in remorse. Something making them demand to be a part of whatever is happening. 

The salesman looks on, taking casual glances back into the tent. 

By the end of it, not a body is recognisable as human, not one of the victims still draws breath. 

“You have any idea on what the hell is going on down there, Abe?”, I ask, scared and shocked. 

“I’d be guessing. It’s not any kind of technology, and I’m not even getting a whiff of the void. 

Sue?”, Abe replies. 

Out of the three of us, Sue is our best tracker. Once found a mimic in Alaska with nothing more than a dog sled and anger. 

I don’t like the look on her face. 

She shakes her head confirming my fears. 

We’re all smart enough to stay far away from whatever is going on. But we can’t come out of this with nothing. We watch, we wait, trying to get any bit of intel to send up the chain of command. 

I’ve seen senseless violence. Groups of men driven to insanity by curses or the whims of a petulant demon. It’s not pretty, leaves you not ordering liver and onions for a while, but that’s it. In our line of work, you get used to things. 

This though, there was a sense to it, a rhyme, a reason. But I’ll be damned if I could figure it out. 

It’s an odd, creeping sense of unease. My mind grasps at patterns that aren’t there. 

And as this all unfolds, the Salesman turns toward us. 

I find myself thinking, “He can’t see us. We’re a Kilometer away, in the dead of night. We’re in black clothing, with a black car.”.

He grins, his teeth are small, and jagged. He points, smiling. 

It doesn’t hit me till I notice all of us are looking to the same place, the back door of the Jalopy. 

Maybe the Salesman can see farther than most. Not that much of a stretch. 

But how did he point so that three people a kilometer off all looked to the same place. There’s implications there. And they aren’t good. We’re supposed to be hardened and warded against illusions and compulsion. At the very least we should be able to notice them. 

What we’re all looking at is a beautifully made, black and gold envelope. 

Abe fiddles around in his coat, pulling out a magnifying glass with a smoky grey lens. 

“Seems safe. You getting anything, Sue?”, Abe asks as he looks through the glass. 

She shakes her head, but looks uneasy about the envelope none the less. 

My mind is spinning, years worth of training and experience scatter to the wind. Fear takes over. 

Being able to pull this off on 3 average Joes, that’d take something powerful. 

To do this to us? Without us so much as us being suspicious? Not to toot our own horns but that’d take the kind of thing religions get based around. 

“Relax, both of you. You think I came out to an intel mission without wards up the yin-yang? Up to and including a yin-yang?

I’m covered from cognitohazard to seizure.”, Abe says walking over to the envelope. 

“Abe, something about this isn’t right. I think it’s time to abort.”, I reply. 

Sue nods in agreement. 

“With your ‘abort’. 

You know what this guy is? Some one-off. He finds a place he can get a body count, then lets people think it was him, not some kind of natural disaster like that film. “, Abe says, grabbing the envelope, “So let’s see what that schmuck thinks is going to rattle our cage:

Dear Children of Light

I am absolutely impressed with you three. Until you pulled up to my business dealings, I had no idea you were stalking me. 

So, I will show you mercy, and beyond that reward you. 

My mercy is to tell you to find another quest. What I am doing is beyond the ken of those like yourself. 

I don’t deal in gods and demons. I seek neither artifacts nor infamy. 

Our paths do not need to cross. Your world and mine have no reason to collide until they have to. 

Your reward is to know something no one else will. The most important date that will ever occur…”

Abe said the date. There isn’t a damn thing that’d get me to repeat it. 

I smelled it before Abe started screaming. 

A rotten, gamey odor. Abe’s eyes go wide, he begins to cough, then wheeze, then start to claw at his neck. 

And the whole time, not so much as a hint of any paranormal energy. 

“Sue, grab his arms, make sure he doesn’t  hurt himself!”, I scream. 

Sue curtly nods, taking Abe to the ground as gently as possible.

I’m no doctor, but not for lack of trying. I’ve read every book, sat in on any lecture or class I could find, and have had plenty of opportunity to become an advanced laymen when it comes to the human body. 

There’s some kind of mass in Abe’s throat, he’s got maybe another minute before he passes out, panicked as he is. 

I pull out a small slipback knife. My grandfathers. It’s sharper than Einstein, with a point a needle would envy. 

I lock eyes with Abe, the look in his begs me not to do it. 

Truth be told, I’m not at all sure this is going to work, but I don’t let him know that. 

I slide the knife into his windpipe, black, mildew looking pus comes out of the tiny wound. The smell is like a shit convention in Rot city. 

With a twist, and a crack that I’ll hear in my nightmares till the day I die, I core a hole in Abe’s throat. 
He breathes, then gags on the fetid air. 

Steady aim and steady hands are two separate things. Didn’t really understood this till I had to scrape a mass of god knows what the size of a silver dollar out of my friend. 

He tears up his arms thrashing, the coarse gravel of the road showing him no mercy. The pain more than he thought possible. 

It's not pretty, but I manage to miss every major vein and artery. 

That’s only half the job though. The human body, let alone the body of one of our kind, is good at plugging holes. 

“Sue, I need…something to keep this open!”, I scream, trying to keep the flooding, oozing wound clear. 

She looks around, as close to panic as her stone-like face will allow. 

She runs toward the jalopy, tearing her knees open as she drops to one of the wheels. 

With a grip strength that’d make a lobster blush, she yanks the air nozzle from one of the tires. Thankfully, at the time, they were as big around as a thumb. 

She puts the stem in her mouth, ripping out the brass valve, and part of her incisor.

She tosses it to me, i see the consciousness start to fade from Abe’s eyes as I push the vulcanized rubber tube into his throat. 

But that little man is tough as nails, he fights through the pain and keeps awake. 

I’m ripping pieces of my shirt into long strips, bracing  my impromptu trach-tube.  

As Abe starts to calm down, I hear footsteps. Slow, casual. 

I look to my right, and sure enough, the Salesman is strolling down the country road. Film in one hand. 

He smiles to us, his casual nature more of a threat than any fire and brimstone theatrics. 

Sue is starting, body tense like an attack dog. Can’t say I don’t share the same sentiment, but I know when I’ve been beat. 

“This will be a story you will tell your grandchildren Ashton. Cherish this day as when you met what is beyond the gods.”, is the statement he leaves us with. 




“Ash, you okay?”, Travis asks. 

The old man is clearly not in a good place, relating the story has taken it’s toll on him. 

And not just him, Mike is sweating like a thief in church, one leg bouncing up and down. 

“I don’t mean to be an asshole, but I’m missing what we can use in your story, Ash.”, Leo says. 

The old man doesn’t respond for a moment, then meets Leo’s gaze. 

“That’s because the story isn’t over yet. 

You’re never going to understand this thing without context. He’s nothing like you’ve ever come across. 

But I need a minute. I’ve stamped this shit down so hard over the decades, this is…rough.”, Ashton replies. 

“Mike, do you have anything on your mind?”, I ask, notching he’s chewed one nail to the point of it bleeding. 

“Patterns, fucking patterns man. 

I spend so much of my time telling myself all of the static in my head is just chemical imbalances and trauma. But, Jesus Christ, things keep coming around. 

Twenty years ago I wrote…something. Posted it on line, it got spread around a but as these things do, called Parareality Induced by Trauma. Figured it was just my most insane ramblings. 

But, now I’m thinking there’s something to it. Nine corners of reality, the M. This is shit I’ve heard before. “, Mike admits. 

This makes me think back, to dozens of minor glimpses and hints we’ve gotten. 

If Mike was dealing with this two decades ago, how god-damn deep does this go? 

I’m going to end it here, I’m still processing what Ashton and Mike said. 

If anyone knows about this story, or anything else about these Nine corners of reality, or the M, please, let me know. Who knows how many more hints and help are out there buried deep within the bowels of Reddit. 

For now though, stay safe. 

Punch.
