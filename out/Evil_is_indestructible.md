I was in the right lane on the I-90 eastbound from Seattle towards the Cascades, driving slowly in the summer night and waiting for dawn. When I exited at the Division Street junction, it was still dark, prompting me to drive around aimlessly and await the first light of dawn. The nervousness had subsided and was replaced by a calm determination that surprised me. I knew exactly what I was going to do.



The first rays of the sun fell over the rooftops as I drove into the garage driveway and turned off the engine. I unlocked the garage, fetched a shovel and a wheelbarrow. I had gone through everything in my mind and carefully chosen a spot in the yard. The ground was rather dry, so I watered the grass where I intended to dig. Birds were chirping, but no humans were in sight; everything was calm and still. Just as I had hoped.



Once the water had soaked into the ground, I began digging. I dug up clumps of grass to form a square. I placed the clumps on the lawn beside the square and started digging downward. I put the loose soil into the wheelbarrow. While I was busy digging down through the earth, I heard a car approaching. I set the shovel aside and stood completely still. It was the newspaper delivery person; I remained standing and waited until he had passed. I resumed digging and continued until I had reached below the layer of topsoil and encountered hard moraine.



I went back to the car and fetched a wrapped aluminum box, which I placed at the bottom of the pit. I noticed that the birds had stopped singing. I took soil from the wheelbarrow and filled the hole. I finished by replacing the clumps of grass and tamping them down so that there were no visible traces of disturbance. Everything had gone as I had hoped, and it had not taken more than fifteen minutes. I went into the house and had breakfast while looking out the window at the spot where I had buried the aluminum box. The birds had resumed their singing, and a neighbor was retrieving the morning newspaper, everything was as usual.



I'll start from the beginning. When my son pestered me for a metal detector. He and a friend were out in the yard scanning with it and found some nails and other junk. After a while without finding any treasures, he used it less and less. I suggested that we could go down to the beach, maybe find some jewelry that someone had lost. Of course, we didn't find any jewelry but only bottle caps and the like. On the way home, I suggested that we take a detour through the park.



"Do you know that your great-grandmother and great-grandfather had a farm where the park is now? We could search there; who knows, maybe there's something hidden underground."



My son nodded.



Fruit trees and a house foundation are all that remains of my family's estate, Willowbrook. However, my older relatives have always spoken highly of Willowbrook, and the estate has taken on an almost mythical quality on that branch of my family tree. The metal detector beeped a few times, and we found a tin can, a horseshoe, and the usual nails. But after some searching, we got a stronger signal. I took the garden spade and began to dig.



After a while, the spade hit something hard. After some more digging and prying, we unearthed an iron lid. It was clearly old, and despite being dirty and covered in dried mud, we could see there was some sort of pattern and a few letters on its rough surface. Under the lid, a hollow space made of bricks appeared. At first, we saw nothing, but when my son turned on the flashlight on his phone, we saw a metal box sitting at the bottom of the cavity. I lay down and reached for the box, lifting it out. It was about the size of a shoebox and weighed a few pounds.



"Open it, Dad, what's inside?" he asked eagerly.



He was excited. I tried to open the box, but the lid was stuck tight.



"We'll take it home and try to open it calmly," I said.



We took the iron lid and the box home, cleaned them up. The iron lid turned out to be relatively well-preserved, patterned with grapevines and the letters "HW VP" in ornate script. The box, however, looked unremarkable. It was made of rough metal with no inscriptions or decorations. I had to pry and gently wiggle the lid. It tested my patience, but after a while, it finally loosened. My son leaned over as I revealed the contents.



"What the heck," he said disappointedly.



It was somewhat anticlimactic. Instead of treasure, there was a clay statuette, several smaller clay figures, and a number of bone fragments inside. The statuette and figures were crudely made and didn't mean much to me. The statuette resembled an amateurish attempt at a Roman statue, and the clay figures resembled some kind of small gnomes or creatures. Upon closer inspection, the bone fragments had inscribed markings on them. Soon, my son lost interest in the contents of the box but was quite pleased with the iron lid, which he proudly displayed in his room. As for myself, I felt a bit uneasy about the box and its contents. An impulse came over me to get rid of it all, to simply throw it in the trash, but something held me back. I tucked it away in a drawer under a heap of winter clothes, hoping it would fade into obscurity.



Looking back now, the oddities actually began before my son and I dug near the park.



We've lived in our villa for many years, familiar with the neighborhood from our walks and jogs. With a dog in the family, you get to know who frequents the area and become superficially acquainted with other dog owners and local exercisers. One day, maybe two weeks before we found the box, a new face appeared. A man in his seventies, I would guess. He was very talkative, as some retirees can be, but he was friendly and seemed to know a lot about my family. He knew who my grandparents were and was familiar with my mom, my uncle, and even their cousins. We talked until the dog grew impatient and wanted to move on. A few days later, while on a run through the woods, I was nearing home when we crossed paths again. We chatted briefly, and he mentioned that he often walks to the ski slope to admire the view, "yes, at Willowbrook, your great-grandparents' estate," as he put it. He seemed to have insight into other family relationships that surprised me a bit. But people keep tabs on each other, I thought.



A few days, or rather nights, after I hid the box in the dresser, the dog began to behave strangely. We have some wildlife that visits the garden at night, and the dog usually barks a few times, something we're used to, but suddenly he just growled. Our bedrooms are upstairs, and we woke up to find him downstairs growling at the couch, staring out the window. My wife went downstairs and looked outside without seeing anything. I went down the next night when he was again growling out the dark window. We chalked it up to a fox or a cat prowling the garden, unseen in the darkness.



I work shifts. It was after an evening shift when I got home just after 11 pm and sat in my favorite armchair to unwind when the dog came running and started growling. I turned off the lights and tried to figure out what he was looking at. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see the fruit trees and bushes, no animal or anything to explain the dog's behavior. After a couple of minutes, I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye. When I focused there, it disappeared, not uncommon when staring out into the darkness, I thought, and went to bed.



I had intense dreams that night. First, I dreamed I was standing on the steps of a cathedral. There were crowds of people below on a large square. They were talking loudly and arguing with each other, seeming to disagree about something. I couldn't make out what it was about but got the feeling they were about to make a big decision. The more they argued, the more chaotic it became; people started pushing each other, and there was tearing of clothes and hair. I had a leather bag beside me on the steps; when I opened it, the box was at its bottom. When I took out the box and held it in my hands, the crowd slowly fell silent, and all attention focused on me. The total attention was both terrifying and intoxicating.



"What do you want?" I shouted across the now eerily silent square.



"We seek guidance," replied a man who appeared to be some sort of leader among them.



"Should we go out to war?"



For some reason, I answered yes, that they should go out to war. Everyone bowed and lined up in orderly rows, marching away from the square and disappearing.



I woke up feeling almost intoxicated. When I fell back asleep, I found myself in a new dream; this time, I was wandering through a dense forest near the Snoqualmie Falls area. I walked along a winding path, surrounded by towering trees and the gentle sound of a nearby stream, until I stumbled upon a small, secluded village nestled in the forest. It had the quaint charm of those old towns you find in the foothills of the Cascades. I encountered an elderly woman standing by a moss-covered bridge. Her eyes met mine with a knowing, unsettling look, and she shook her head slowly. I was about to ask her what was wrong when I noticed that I was holding the box visibly in my hands. I woke up with a start.



That morning, I found it difficult to shake thoughts of the box. I made coffee and listened to the radio news, but it was as if I couldn't comprehend what they were saying. I forgot I was supposed to go to work before my shift for a meeting; it was only after my boss called to remind me that I hurriedly made it to the meeting. We were discussing a potential schedule change. I had to concentrate hard just to understand what the others were saying. Throughout the evening shift, I struggled to get the box and its contents out of my mind.



When I came home late that evening, I poured myself a large whisky and sat in the living room. I had nearly finished half the glass when the dog ran downstairs and started growling. I had completely turned off the lights and had good night vision. It took a minute before I saw movement in my peripheral vision that then disappeared. I continued to stare out the window and managed to focus my gaze on a dark figure that quickly vanished. After a moment, it reappeared. I couldn't follow it with my eyes; it appeared and disappeared much like trying to track a bat against a fading summer night sky. It resembled somewhat a wild boar, but walking on two legs. I stayed awake until dawn. Then the creature disappeared.



It had long been planned that my wife would visit acquaintances on the west coast the coming weekend and stay for two weeks. I would stay and work during that time, and then we would go together to our cottage on Bainbridge Island. After some persuasion, I managed to arrange for the whole family, including the dog, to go to the west coast. I wanted to stay alone at home. The dreams and thoughts of the box had become increasingly intrusive, and I found it harder to cope with work. In the end, I took sick leave. At night, I sat up and watched the creature roam outside the window. They seemed to be several now.



Sometimes when making decisions, you can later wonder how you were thinking. I don't know if I was thinking at all when I booked a ferry ticket to Bainbridge Island on the overnight ferry. It was the same day I had concluded that there were probably several creatures in the garden. I wanted to get the box away from the house and find somewhere at the cottage on Bainbridge Island where I could hide it. Upon arriving at Bainbridge Island, I placed the box in a kitchen drawer for the time being. I greeted some neighbors, turned on the water and electricity as one does. I was very tired that evening and went to bed before it started to get dark outside. I locked the doors and checked that all the windows were closed, something I had never done before in the cottage. I also looked in the kitchen drawer and noted that the box was where I had left it.



I slept and dreamed of the man from home. He spoke to me in my sleep; I don't remember everything but remembered him saying something about choosing the right path and that it was my turn to take over. When I woke up, the sun was rising. I pulled up the blinds and caught sight of a face with black eyes staring at me from the other side of the window. In an instant, the face disappeared, but it took no more than that to understand what I had seen.



I went into the kitchen, and there I got an even bigger shock. It was like getting a punch in the gut. I know that's how people usually say it, but it was true; my knees buckled, and I knelt down and stared. The clay figurines were arranged on the stove. After recovering from the initial panic, I grabbed a knife and searched the house without finding anyone there. I looked out the windows and saw that everything was in order. I tremblingly picked up the box that was in the drawer where I had left it and immediately felt that it was lighter. I don't know what I had expected, but the clay figurines had moved during the night, so someone or something had been inside the house while I slept.



I don't know how long it took me to regain my composure. I needed help to move forward, someone to ask for advice. I couldn't exactly call my wife or any friend and ask how to behave with found clay figurines that moved by themselves overnight. The police didn't seem like an option either; I would probably be driven to the nearest psychiatric clinic. I wouldn't take my own story seriously unless it was my own.



Another ticket to the mainland? I could throw the damn box overboard halfway to Seattle, but if it turned out to be a mistake, it would be difficult to repair.



The church? Priests were not strangers to the supernatural. I wasn't religious, but I was baptized and married in the church and still paid church taxes. A priest could probably handle what was in the box. I put the box in my backpack and got into the car. Regardless, I didn't plan to spend another night near the box and its contents.



I stopped at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church and asked one of the groundskeepers to speak with a priest. I was told there was no priest on site and that she would come out to St. Paul’s first the day after tomorrow, but there was probably a priest in Port Angeles. I thanked her, got back in the car, and headed for the ferry that links the island to the rest of the mainland. I knew the church in Port Angeles; in the eighties, I had sworn allegiance to the flag and the country there during my conscription at the local base.



Arriving at the church, I stepped inside and asked an elderly woman who was rearranging hymn books if I could speak with a priest. She pointed towards the altar where a middle-aged man was busy with something. He introduced himself as Jackson and asked how he could help me. I explained that I preferred to discuss this privately and glanced at the woman with the hymn books. Jackson gestured toward the sacristy and closed the door behind us. We sat down, and he asked me to tell him what was troubling me. I started hesitantly describing my discovery of a box but noticed that the priest was skeptical. They must hear a lot of nonsense, I thought, before he straightforwardly asked me to show him the box. I took it out and opened the lid. His face turned pale, and he recoiled as if there had been a venomous snake inside.



"Close the lid, close it at once," he shouted and took a step back. "Oh my, oh my."



He was visibly stressed and began fidgeting with his phone.



"That's right, just the landline, the landline," he muttered and disappeared.



After a few minutes, he returned and nervously sat down, attempting small talk. It was clear he had received instructions from someone higher up. The lady with the hymn books appeared in the doorway and asked if everything was alright. The priest abruptly sent her off to fetch coffee. I didn't understand what was happening.



"What about the box? Will the church take care of it?"



"Not here in this church, someone from Seattle will come, I believe. We just have to wait, and someone will take care of it here."



From Seattle, I thought, that will take time. I didn't want to sit here wasting time with the anxious priest. Luckily, Priest Albert stopped his clumsy attempts to normalize this bizarre situation with small talk. In fact, it was just under an hour before we heard a car stop in the parking lot. Into the church came an elderly man in a wheelchair who looked very old, accompanied by a young female assistant. Something about how she carried herself made me think of her as a bodyguard or military.



"Leave us alone," said the man, and Jackson and the assistant left the sacristy.



"Show me what you've found," he said without hesitation, his gaze fixed on me.



If he seemed old and frail in body, his gaze was sharp as a knife and intensely present. He examined the clay figurines and picked up one of the bone fragments, scrutinizing it in the light before putting it back in the box. He asked me to tell the whole story from the beginning to now. He listened attentively and asked only a few clarifying questions. It felt good to tell my story to someone.



"Good," he said. "Do you have any questions?"



"Yes, actually quite a few. What is this that scares the life out of an experienced priest? What can make clay figurines summon black apparitions outside the house and emerge from a tin box on their own? How can it evoke dreams and conjure up an old man I've never seen who seems to know everything about my family estate that has been in ruins for over half a century? And above all, can you or anyone else take these items away so I can be done with all this? Then I'm also curious about who you are, how you can get here from Seattle in under an hour, and make the nervous wreck of a priest act like it's nothing special?"



"I could lecture for weeks on everything you've been through. Unfortunately, we don't have that kind of time. The clay figurines, to simplify, are condensed evil. Evil is like energy; it is indestructible and can only change form. For example, if an evil person dies, the evil doesn't disappear but is taken up in a new form, perhaps in a new person who carries it forward. So destroying the box or, as you suggested, throwing it into the sea would only release the inherent evil, and we would have no idea where or when it might emerge. However, by hiding it, we can control it without exposing it. As for the bones, they come from a very evil person who lived long ago; the runes carved into them are a kind of curse. The creatures you've seen are what some would call evil spirits or demons; they cannot physically harm you but can affect you mentally, lead you to make bad decisions or do foolish things. The clay figurines did not get out of the box on their own; you were the one who took them out in your sleep, and what that tells me is that time is running short."



"The man you encountered both in reality and in your dreams is the guardian. He is likely part of, or someone close to, your family. And he, this might be difficult to hear, has just handed over to you."



He raised his hand in a calming gesture just as I was about to protest.



"You are the only one who can take care of these items and ensure they remain hidden. You are now the guardian. You can choose to see it as a burden, or you can see it as a great trust placed upon you by your ancestors who have chosen you to handle this responsibility."



“Who I am doesn’t matter; those closest to me usually call me the old one. Time is rushing, my friend; you must do what you must. When you are ready, take the car to the airport at Sea-Tac, and someone will meet you there to handle what needs to be done. And, most importantly, make sure you are at the airport before darkness falls.”



I got into the car and drove to the hardware store in Capitol Hill, where I bought epoxy, hardener, fiberglass cloth, and brushes. I emptied an aluminum toolbox from the toolshed and packed the items into it. I sealed the toolbox hermetically with multiple layers of plastic. While the final layer of epoxy cured, I said goodbye to the neighbors, blaming having to cover for someone at work.



The sun was starting to set as I drove off the ferry in  Bainbridge Island. I took the winding road to Sea-Tac Airport, pushing the car to its limits. It was getting quite dim by the time I parked at the airport. I walked towards the entrance, worried that it might be a problem to get through security with a bag containing a hermetically sealed aluminum box, when a man discreetly approached and asked me to follow him. He looked like a military man. He showed me an ID card, and I was waved past security.



“Give me the car keys, and we’ll make sure the car is delivered to your address.”



He led me out onto the airport tarmac to one of the military helicopters. I was ushered inside and strapped into a seat.



We landed without incident at a small airstrip near the old man’s estate. There, the old man’s assistant was waiting. She escorted me to a nearby car and handed me the keys to a rental vehicle.



"The old man sends his regards; he thinks you're handling things excellently," she said.



And at this point in the story, we're back where I began.



It's been a few months since I buried the box, and autumn is approaching. Things are slowly returning to normal; I spend increasingly longer periods between the now rare visits to the garden. The man who walked to the park I've only encountered once more. He visited me in a dream, thanking me for finally finding peace.



To gain certainty about the guardian before me, I visited my mother's cousin Monica. She had many photographs from Willowbrook Estate in her possession. I carefully examined all the old black-and-white pictures of posed people and could recognize many younger versions of people I've met over the years. Then suddenly, I saw what I was looking for. He stood between my grandfather and his brother. The former guardian, the one who sought me out. I learned that his name was Harold. Harold had passed away in the seventies, I was told.
