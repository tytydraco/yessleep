How does someone forget the person they loved most?  
I tried. I tried everything.

Friends told me to “move on.”  
Therapists told me to “process the trauma.”  
Bottles of vodka told me they could numb me if I swallowed enough.

None of it worked.

Every night I still saw her dying — her body thrown out of the car, her cold, motionless body, her empty loveless eyes. I’d wake up gasping, reaching for someone who no longer existed.

People love to say grief fades with time. They never explain what happens when it doesn’t.

I don’t know when I started browsing the darker corners of the internet. Maybe I wanted to feel something uglier than sadness. Maybe I was hoping to find a reason to hate the world that took her from me. I don’t know. But that’s where I found a tiny post on a hidden forum. No username. No title. Just a block of text describing a ritual to bring a loved one back.

I laughed at first. Then I bookmarked it. Then I read it every night.  
Grief makes impossible things sound… almost reasonable.

So, at midnight, a month after her funeral, I did it.

I still don’t know why the candles felt warm without fire, or why the air tasted like iron, or why the shadows on the walls moved even though I wasn’t moving. I spoke the words anyway. I cried, too. I don’t know if that was part of the ritual, but something tells me it mattered.

When she appeared, I dropped to my knees.

She looked exactly the same ,the same dark hair falling over her shoulders, the same perfume she always used, the same trembling smile she made when she was trying not to cry. She stepped toward me, and I grabbed her, pulling her close, sobbing into her shoulder until my throat burned.

Then the world collapsed into black.

I woke up in my bed at sunrise.

My room was normal. My window was open. Birds were screaming in the trees outside. My phone alarm was buzzing. Everything was painfully ordinary.

Except… she was alive.

It was like the accident had never happened. There were no funeral photos on my phone. No sympathy messages. No nothing. Her clothes hung in the closet. Her toothbrush was by the sink. Her slippers were at the foot of our bed.

And she was sitting beside me, brushing her hair, like it was just another morning.

For the first time since the crash, I felt something close to happiness. I kissed her forehead. She kissed mine. Her skin was warm. Her hands were soft. Her voice made my chest ache.

But something in her eyes felt… slightly wrong. Like she was too careful about everything, like a machine.

I ignored it.

Love makes you ignore things you shouldn’t.

The neighborhood animals disappeared first. Cats went missing. Dogs stopped barking at night. People found blood smeared across driveways, splattered on fences, trailing into bushes. Sometimes there were footprints. Bare, human footprints. Too small to belong to a grown man. Too wide to belong to a child.

She told me not to worry. She said animals wander off all the time.

But she never looked at me when she said it.

Last night I woke up to the front door closing.

Her side of the bed was cold.

I don’t know what pushed me outside. The night air was piercing. The moon was awfully bright. Something in my body knew before my mind did. There was a streak of blood leading away from the house. A long, dragged smear that glistened under the moonlight.

I followed it.

Down the road, past the abandoned basketball court, through the park where we used to sit together on summer nights.

That’s where I saw her.

She was standing under a streetlamp, her back hunched, her hands buried in something dark and furry. I recognized the collar first. The neighbor’s missing golden retriever. Her mouth was red. Her chin was wet. Her fingers were digging, pulling, tearing.

She turned when she heard me.

Her eyes glowed in the light like a predator’s. Not human. Not anymore.  
But the smile she gave me, that trembling, familiar smile she always made when trying not to cry was still exactly the same.

“Why are you awake?” she asked.

Her voice was soft. Loving. Concerned.

And her hands were dripping with blood.
