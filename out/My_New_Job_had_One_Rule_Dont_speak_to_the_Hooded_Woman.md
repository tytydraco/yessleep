"Look kid. She only comes out during the 1am hour. So, just be careful, okay?" I looked at him, skeptical. I think he could tell I didn't believe him as he continued, "This is serious okay, just promise me you won't talk to her."

"Okay. I promise." He smiled a fake smile and let me leave his office. What a load of BS. I thought to myself. Did he really think I was going to believe that some creepy chick in a hooded cloak that only comes out at 1am was real? How stupid did he think I was? I walked over to the time clock and punched in. 10:08pm. Great. Late on my first day and it's not even my fault. I walked back out into the kitchen. My anxiety rising. You see, I don't know anyone here, but I needed a job to get my own place. It's not a great job, just an overnight drive thru job at a local fast-food place. Nowhere you've probably even heard of. The name isn't important, mostly because I don't want anyone looking for it and trying to prove my story right or wrong. I promise you however, what I'm about to tell you is real, and I will never forget that night for the rest of my life.

10:13: I take my place at the drive-thru window where I would be until 6am. None of the other employees have approached me, and I am completely okay with that. I did notice a few of their names on their nametags. Jim is the guy on the grill and Tina is on the register. Owen, the manager who was pulling my leg about the "hooded woman" had just left for the night. Tina would be leaving at midnight due to the fact that the dining room closes then. The drive thru, however, stays open 24/7.

10:21: My first car approaches, finally. It's a family of 4. A woman, presumably the mother is driving, the father in the passenger seat, and two young girls in the backseat. I ask the woman for their order, and she gladly gives it to me. Now comes the hard part, social interaction. We're an old school type of fast-food place. Therefore, I had to actually go tell Jim the order. I reluctantly walk over to the grill where is standing playing on his phone. "Um, hey Jim, we got an order."

"FINALLY!" He says, with a smile creeping across his mustached face. I read him the order, 2 kid's meals, no pickle on the burgers, and 2 large chicken tender meals. "Aye-aye Captain," he says giving me a sarcastic salute. I smile and walk back to the window and wait for the order to arrive, which it does in no time at all. I give the kind family their food and prepare for more boredom until the next customer arrives.

10:35: Jim walks over to me and begins to try to make small talk. "So, you're Daniel, right? I see Owen didn't print you out a nametag. Figures." I smile at him, but don't say anything. "You don't talk much, do you? That's cool. Well, if you have any questions about how things work around here, don't be afraid to ask." I immediately jump on his offer, "So this 'hooded woman' thing, Owen haze all the new guys like that?" His face grows cold, yet he manages to let out a nervous laugh. "Well, if there is a 'hooded woman', I sure haven't seen her, and I've been working here for 9 months now."

10:53: "So, what's it normally like here at night?" I asked. He looked around the empty restaurant, "You're seeing it, kid." He replied with a laugh. "Nobody really comes here late. Most folks are already asleep." I shook my head in agreement. I look over to Tina, who is sitting on the counter taking pictures of herself. "What's up with her?" I ask him. He rolls his eyes, "Your typical case of daughter needs a job and Daddy gives her one."

"You mean Owens her dad?" He nods. She's far too pretty to be related to him I think to myself. Me and Jim continue our small talk for what feels like ever. Talking about anything and everything. Soon enough, midnight rolls around, and Tina is quick to wave goodbye and get out of here. I don't blame her. I really didn't want to be here either. Jim was making it a little bit easier though.

12:13: I surprisingly get another customer at the drive-thru, a truck full of high school aged kids. They order enough food to feed the entire U.S. Army. They get their food, and drive off into the dark, cold night. "Hey Jim," I yell back to him. "Do you mind watching the window while I go use the bathroom?" He nods and walks over to my station.

12:17: As I enter the stall in the men's restroom, I notice something that sent chills down my spine. On the back of the stall door were the words "SHES COMING". I shivered as I sat down on the toilet and grabbed my phone out of my pocket. Great. No signal. Looks like it's going to be a very long night.

12:34: I realize I've been in the bathroom for far too long. I wash my hands and head back into the kitchen. "There you are! I thought you fell in or something." he joked. I smiled, "Nah, the hooded woman got me." I laughed. He did not. He gave me another uneasy smile. It kind of freaked me out but I didn't believe in this stuff anyway.

1:00: I start to feel uneasy. I knew that I was just paranoid, but the moment the clock struck 1, something just didn't feel right.

1:04: As I look out the drive-thru window, I swear I saw a figure moving in the darkness, though it's far too dark to know for sure. The drive-thru lights barely reach 10 feet away from the building, so in order to see something, they'd have to be very close.

1:11: "I'm gonna go take a piss," Jim exclaimed. I shot him a smile. A weak smile, but a smile, nonetheless.

1:17: There's a knock on the door of the dining room. "I'm sorry, we're closed!" I scream loud enough for anyone to hear me. However, the knocking continues, quickening with every knock. I'm really hoping Jim gets out of the bathroom soon. I'm starting to get freaked out.

1:20: The knocking at the door stopped. I hear the bathroom door open and am relieved to see Jim make his way back out. He notices my worried expression and I tell him about the knocking. His face once again grows cold; however, he's not looking at me, he's looking behind me, through the window. He slowly raises a finger to his lips as if telling me that in making any noise, I'd seal both of our fates. "I'd like to make an order please." A woman's voice called out from behind me. The voice doesn't sound right though. The pitch is off. The words just don't seem like they have any life behind them. Jim shushes me again. I give him a nod. "Hello?" The womans voice calls out. I turn around to look at her and am terrified by what I see. There is a figure facing away from the window. It looks almost human, but not quite. Its arms were too long, and the way it was hunched over didn't seem normal. It wore a long black cloak with a hood over its head. I reminded myself of what Owen told me. Don't speak to her. I didn't believe any of this at first, but I was starting to lose my skepticism.

"We need to leave", Jim whispered to me, and I nodded in agreeance. He held three fingers up, then two, then one, then pointed at the door, we both bolted for it. He was slightly faster than me and made it outside much faster. "Wait for me," I heard myself say. Only I wasn't the one who said it. "Sorry man." Jim said. "hahahahahahaha" I heard in the woman's inhuman voice. The next thing I heard was Jim's screams. I stood motionless, still inside of the store. "It's okay. I'm okay. Are you alright in there buddy?" I heard her say in Jim's voice. I resisted the urge to speak to her and instead decided that I needed to get out of here as quickly as possible. I quietly ran to the kitchen and grabbed a spatula. I made my way back to the drive-thru and threw it out the window. The woman growled with pleasure at hearing the noise. I heard her uneven footsteps as she ran across the concrete.

I wasted no time in running to the front door, and out to my car, ignoring the sight of Jim's mangled body in the parking lot. I locked the doors and turned the key in the ignition. As I looked out the window of my car, I saw a sight that will forever haunt me. The woman was standing right outside the door, this time facing towards me. Her face was a pale white with a hideous smile that was too big for her face. I didn't take the time to memorize all of her features, I knew I had to get the hell outta there. I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and never looked back.

Needless to say, I quit that job after my first night there. However, I still visit during the daytime, and am astonished to see Jim flipping burgers in the kitchen.
