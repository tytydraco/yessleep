Hey, I have a question, I need advice... a suggestion.... a solution... ANYTHING.

Something has been eating my photos... I don't know why either. 

However, the eaten photos aren't what I'm asking about... it's the thing eating them.

I'd find picture frames, broken with the photo on the outside, with a massive bite mark in it, and a wet spot around the edge where it was bit.

And to make matters stranger, It's purely pictures of *ME.* My portraits, any and every photo with my face in it, would have my face bitten out of it.

You'd expect to NOT know what the thing is that has been eating my photos. For a while, I didn't I suspected mice, cats, dogs... but mice wouldn't smash a picture frame open just to get to the photo, and I don't own any cats or dogs, plus my neighborhood isn't prone to strays wandering around. 

That resulted in me installing cameras around my house and seeing the creature responsible.

And what I saw is the very reason why I've come to ask for help from all of you.

I was reviewing the footage three days ago, seeing If I could find anything that could give me closure on this mystery, but instead, I saw a tall, pink, fleshy creature hunched over. This thing had fingers that had to be a foot long, it had no hair to speak of, and there was a bloody heart carved into its chest. It was breathing heavily, and it sounded as if there was some liquid in its lungs. I saw the creature break open my picture frame, pull out the picture of me alongside my older sisters, and ate the part that had my face on it. I gasped at the sight, and the creature turned to face the camera as if it heard me, and it did.... nothing. The creature just stood up straight and walked into the hallway where my room was. I was too shocked to move, but when I heard the footsteps growing closer, I managed to get out of whatever trance I was in and I locked the door just as the creature reached my room. It knocked, and knocked, getting more desperate as I sat on my bed in fear, luckily it left after a bit, but I didn't leave the room until morning, I fell asleep as scared as ever, but morning came, thankfully, and when I opened the door, there was a dead, disemboweled squirrel, along with a letter:

**Hello.** \- The letter said, so I've learned the creature can also write, and it's trying to communicate with me. 

Now here I am... three days later. The creature has been coming every night, trying to come into my room, but I've locked the door each and every time. I'm not sure what intentions it has, and why it's so desperate to reach me, nor am I sure why it's eating my pictures. I've learned that It only comes at night, and the creature does speak, I just can't understand it.

So tell me... what do I do?
