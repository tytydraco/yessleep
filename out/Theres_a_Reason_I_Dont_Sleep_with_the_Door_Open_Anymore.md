I haven’t talked about this in years. Not even to my therapist. But I’m writing it down now because last night—at 2:12 a.m.—I heard the knock again. Same rhythm. Same pause. The same sick feeling crawling up the back of my throat.

I used to think it was a demon.

I know how that sounds. But when you’re a kid, there are things you just know without proof. You don’t question why your closet makes you nauseous or why the attic door feels like it’s breathing. You just know something’s wrong.

And something was very wrong in that house.

We moved in when I was nine. Old Victorian at the edge of a dead-end street. Sloped floors. Wallpaper like dried blood. My mom called it a “fresh start.” She’d just gotten serious with a new boyfriend—Rick. He helped pay for the place but stayed in the city at first. So for a while, it was just me and her.

The first night, I couldn’t sleep. Normal new-house stuff, I thought. Until I heard it:

Knock.

Just one. Soft. Like someone gently tapped their knuckle against my door.

I sat up in bed, listening hard.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Three more. Spaced out. Deliberate.

Then—silence.

I got up and opened the door. The hallway was empty.

I asked my mom in the morning if she’d checked on me. She said no. She looked… tired. Her hands were shaking when she poured her coffee. I noticed a red mark on her neck. She said it was a bug bite.

That night, I stacked books against the door. Just in case.

The knocking came again. Same time—around 2 a.m.

But this time, it didn’t stop.

It turned into scraping. Like nails dragging across the door. Then breathing—wet and slow, right up against the wood. I heard it say something I didn’t understand. Too low, too garbled.

And then I smelled it—rot, like something dead had been stuffed under the floorboards.

I didn’t sleep. Just stared at the door, flashlight clutched tight.

In the morning, my mom had a bruise on her arm. Purple and angry, like someone had grabbed her too hard. She said she tripped on the stairs. She wouldn’t meet my eyes when she said it.

It kept happening.

Some nights, it tried the doorknob. Other nights, I’d hear it crawl across the hall. And once, I heard crying—soft, broken sobs, like someone trying not to be heard.

Sometimes it came for me. Sometimes it didn’t. But someone always got hurt.

The worst was when I forgot to block the door.

I was half-asleep when I heard the slow creak of it opening.

I froze. Pulled the covers over my head.

Something stepped into the room.

It didn’t walk right—too heavy, too slow. The mattress dipped beside me.

And it breathed.

Right in my face. Hot, sour, and wrong.

Then, finally, it left.

In the morning, I had scratches across my back. Through my shirt.

I didn’t tell my mom. She already looked like she was unraveling.

Eventually, Rick moved in. Just showed up one day with his bags and that look like he belonged there all along.

The weird part? The knocking stopped.

But the house didn’t feel safer. It felt worse.

Colder. Heavier.

And my mom seemed even more withdrawn.

I started having dreams. Of something watching me from the hallway. Tall and thin with no face, just a mouth full of too many teeth.

Sometimes I woke up with bruises. Sometimes with dirt under my nails.

Once, I woke up outside. Lying on the porch. Barefoot.

My hands were bleeding.

I told my mom we had to leave.

She cried. Said she’d find a way.

That night, she locked her bedroom door.

And I waited.

2:09 a.m.

Footsteps.

They didn’t stop outside my door this time. They kept going. Toward hers.

I heard her murmur something—confused, half-asleep.

“Rick…?”

Then a crash. And a scream. Then silence.

I ran to her room.

The door was open just enough.

Inside, in the dark, something was crouched over her. Tall. Wrong. It held her down, hands wrapped around her wrists. She was fighting, kicking, sobbing.

And then it turned to me.

And grinned.

I didn’t think.

I ran to the kitchen. Grabbed the biggest knife I could find.

When I came back, it was still on top of her.

I screamed, ran forward, and drove the blade into its back.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Until it slumped to the floor.

My mom was screaming.

Screaming at me.

I looked down.

It wasn’t a monster.

No claws.

No fangs.

Just a man.

Just Rick.

His face was caved in. One eye open. One shut. Lips split like someone had tried to tear the truth out of them.

The police came. Said it was self-defense. Said I saved her.

But she never looked at me again.

We moved out of the house.

She never spoke to me after that.

Years later, I still don’t sleep with the door open.

I live alone now. One-bedroom apartment. Third floor. No creaks, no attic, no shadows in the hallway.

Still…

Last night, I woke up at 2:12 a.m.

Knock.

Knock. Knock.

Tap.

And a voice behind the door.

Not growling. Not whispering.

Just… tired.

“Why?”

Edit:
This morning I found something under my bed.

My old flashlight. Cracked. The one I used to keep under my pillow.

Still faintly glowing.

And it smells like cigarette smoke.
