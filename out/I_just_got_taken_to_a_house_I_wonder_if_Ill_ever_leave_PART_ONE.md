Content Warning: Gore, self-injury, suicide


I didn't mean to get here. I didn't mean to end up in this horrific predicament, yet somehow, some way, the fates sent me a twisted, sinister destiny that left me scarred for as long as I live.

It started with a text.

Mom: Avery, pack your bags, you're going on a trip! ðŸ©·

My mom never used hearts before, and she definitely would never pay for a vacation. She was what I would consider a 'workaholic', and she wouldn't even deny it. I didn't suspect she would directly harm me, yet the itch inside wanted to press on it.
Three days later, I found myself being driven to a house that I had never before seen in my life. It was massive, with hallways that I could explore for days. It had a pool that I could see myself diving in. I could envision the summer I would have there, yet it felt wrong. 
"Thank you for bringing her. Avery, you will be in our care now." The woman's voice was gentle, but it was unsettling. Where was I going? Why was I here? 
Then she slammed the door.
"Why'd you do that!? I never got to say goodbye!" 
"We typically do not allow our guests to say goodbye to their parents. It makes the departure easier."
It was safe to say I didn't stay there long. 
I bashed down doors, refused to eat or drink, yelled at the other girls, and utterly refused to cooperate with anyone. They called the cops on my third day there. 
It wasn't all bad. I did, in fact, get to swim in the pool. My roommate wasn't bad. She was quiet, which was nice. That place just wasn't right for me.

And that was why I slashed my wrists on my third day.

I was taken to the hospital. It wasn't great. They made me take my nose ring out, and when I tried to fight them, they put me under. The sedative they had used had caused purple bruises on my thighs, not the worst thing, but definitely not something ideal. 
Three days later, I was taken by another facility. This time, I stayed longer. Nineteen days. 
The first day was torture. The staff didn't really like me, and their rules were absurd. The second day was decent. I met a nicer staff, one who would end up hurting me later on. The rest of my time there was repetitive to say the least. Sure, there were peers who certainly had distain for me, at the very least, but I was content. I was fine with the prospect of staying.
Then, I left again.
This time, it hurt. I didn't break myself, I broke someone else. I lied, hurt myself to hurt others, and let myself suffer for solace.
 Of course, that didn't work for long.
Back to the hospital again. This time, no one wanted to take me. Not a single facility wanted to take a girl who was 'high risk' and had seriously hurt themselves in two past placements already.
Then, a light came across the horizon. A place that might've just been the death of me.
Hillside Summit. 
The chance-giver to those who are undeserving. The paradise to the pain-bearing. The solace to the suffering. And that was where I was going.
I packed up for it, thinking I would get kicked out their doors all the same, but they wouldn't; in fact, I was chained to that house, no matter what.
When I arrived, I met who would become the most important person I'd ever meet.
And she would destroy me before I could destroy myself...
