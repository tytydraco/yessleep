I grew up in one of those small towns, the kind where everybody knew not just your name, or the color of your bed spread, but who was past tangled in your duvet. The streets were lined with splintered porches and lopsided, dusty picket fences, and every mailbox seemed to tilt just enough to ensure they weren’t toppling over. 

Where this town is, doesn’t matter. 

On Sundays, after Pastor Jim was done giving his sermon, the elderly women would gather like clockwork. They’d perch their saggy asses on their faded lawn chairs, the arms shiny from where the paint had chipped off. They’d sip iced tea from sweating glasses of various fluorescent colors, the melting ice clinking softly as their arms swung around expressively. Handkerchiefs of varying pastels would dab at their perspiring  forehead with dainty manicured nails between bites of powdery tea cakes no bigger than the size of my thumbnail. 

And always there was a radio. 

It sat on a crooked little side table between two of the ladies, usually Darlene or Ms. Abigail, like it had earned its place. It was old, chunky, and beige with a thick coat of dust covering it that seemed to have been there for years. It so thick, that I could see it from my house across the street from Mrs. Rebecca’s, where they held all these gossip sessions. The dial was turned just enough to catch the signal, but never enough to hear anything clearly. Just enough to let you know that it was on. 

Even when the air was still, the damn thing would crackle, and it would pop and hiss as if it were breathing. 

Even if there were no tea cakes, or sweating iced tea, or pastel handkerchiefs, that radio would be there. Sometimes I’d pass by before they all showed up, and I’d hear it buzzing faintly from the porch — whispering to no one in particular. Sometimes, when I got real close on my bike, it’d flare with static just as I passed, like it was reacting to me specifically.

I never heard music from it. Not once. No Willie Nelson. No Johnny Cash. Not even Dolly Parton — and this was a town where even atheists kept “Jolene” on rotation. It was just….static. Cold, insistent static.

And sometimes…I swear to you, they were talking *to it.*

Not to each other, but like physically talking into the radio. They’d be leaning forward, powdery white hair stiff even in the wind, their voices low and careful. It was as if someone was on the other line, *listening* to it. I once saw Mrs. Rebecca press the speaker with her fingers like she was feeling for a pulse. Like the radio was alive. Another time, Mrs. Reida leaned real close to the antenna, and whispered something that made all the others go quiet. Real quiet. 

Then they all looked at, sitting on my porch swing with a tattered composition notebook, simultaneously. It was as if it were some choreographed dance move and it made me so uneasy, I moved inside to be with Ma. 

They gossiped with the sharp enthusiasm of schoolgirls — the petty kind that always teased me for my too big glasses and teeth that my braces never quite straightened out. Their voices were low and cutting, sharper than any blade of dead grass wilting beneath those squeaky lawn chairs, backs hunched as they leaned closer to each other when one of their subjects of interest would walk past. They murmured over everything, from who’d been caught slipping out of whose shotgun house, who’d shown up to church smelling like gin and grief, and who’d gotten too familiar with the wrong person’s son. 

And no matter what they said, that radio buzzed quietly beneath them like some sort of threat. Or as if it were listening, drinking down every word they said greedily. 

They’d always start by jabbering about one of the town drunks — usually finding amusement in the widowed Mrs. Jones whose husband died last June from some sort of aggressive cancer. 

But they always ended with Ma. 

And sometimes, when I’d hear them whisper her name, I swear that staticky old radio would start howling. 

It was early August, when the sun was always the harshest and those women reeked of too much perfume. The kind of reek where it was obvious they were trying to cover up the sweat. I understand now, they were trying to cover up the rot. 

By then, I’d learned to tune them — and especially that radio — out. I’d sit on my porch steps, scabbed knees pulled to my chest beneath a scrappy old sundress, pretending to be absolutely enthralled by a comic book. But I always kept my ears open. You had to, in a place like that. Information was more valuable than any crisp bill and secrets? Well, secrets had teeth. 

That day, the wind shifted just enough to carry their words my way — something purposefully crafted by Mother Nature for my own psychological downfall. Their words were soft and sticky in my ears, like Georgia peaches left out on the counter too long. 

“Did you see what she was wearing this morning?” Mrs. Reida whispered, purple talons cradled around a cube of ham sandwich. “That lipstick…Coral Heat. I wore that when I was in highschool. On purpose.”

The women chuckled at that. Like Ma’s beauty was something to be laughed at. 

“Trying to look young again,” another, this time Mrs. Corley, mused. “Like that’s going to slow anything down.”

“She’s been driving that long stretch past the quarry lately,” Mrs. Reida added. “You know how the light hits that bend. Like it wants to take someone.”

There was another silence. It felt heavy. 

The radio squealed, and Mrs. Rebecca leaned in closer to it. I think she was shielding it in some way or another. 

Then, almost too quiet for me to catch, face buried in the speaker of that radio: “Some folks get called back early. Doesn’t matter how they paint their lips.”

The screen door creaked behind me, but I didn’t look up. Ma’s heels clicked softly on the wood, her keys jingling in that careless way she always held them with when she was in a rush. I caught the flash of her purse. 

She ruffled my fiery red curls, her own tied up haphazardly with tight coils framing her round face. She wasn’t wearing much makeup — she never did. A little blush here, a bit of concealer there. She smiled that sweet smile, the one that always felt warm like tea and honey in fall. 

“You behave now, Adelaide.” 

I rolled my eyes at her, but I could feel myself fighting back a smile. “I always do, ma.”

“I know,” she murmured, rummaging through her purse for something. “Sometimes I wish you’d cause some trouble. You’re always on this porch.”

“Better than them,” I loosely gestured to the gaggle of elderly women between flipping the page of my comic. “All they do is yap.”

Ma didn’t respond, but I could hear her soft laughter. Then the soft click of a lipstick tube. She twisted the cap off and carefully applied it with the help of a chipped compact mirror, the one with the smudged butterfly I’d painted at eight. Her hands were steady, the ritual so second nature she could’ve done it blind.

She smacked her lips carefully together, the vibrant salmon hue making her teeth look even whiter. 

“How do I look?”

“Beautiful as always,” I said, voice flat with just enough lift to sound like I meant it. I did. I really did. 

She stooped down and kissed the top of my forehead, the faint press of her lips leaving behind a waxy, warm smudge just left of center.

“I’ll be home before the streetlights come on,” she said, slinging her purse over her shoulder. “I’ll bring back pancakes from Jerry’s Diner.”

“Get extra syrup,” I muttered, trying to wipe the kiss away and failing. Coral Heat clung stubbornly to my skin.

I watched from the porch as she backed out of the gravel drive, the sun dancing on the hood of her car like a ghost.

The women were still outside. Still in their chairs. Not talking. Just watching.

One of them — I think it was Mrs. Reynolds — raised her glass toward me. Not in a wave. Not in farewell. Just held it there in the air, like a toast.

And the radio crackled loudly one last time as Ma’s car disappeared down the cracked road. 

I didn’t know it then, but that would be the last I’d ever wipe Coral Heat off my forehead. That it would be the last time I’d ever hear Ma’s name being whispered through lipstick stained teeth. 

She didn’t even make it past the county line.

They said it was the brakes. Or maybe she had swerved to avoid a deer, which didn’t make sense because Ma was always so watchful when she drove to the point of paranoia. Especially after Pa died. 

Nobody really knew what happened. But what *was* known, was that it was fast, and it was quiet, and nothing could’ve been done to stop it. 

The sheriff found her car wrapped around an old oak tree that we’d passed my entire life. When I went down to the wreck three days later — just me and a crowbar and shaking hands — the door was open. The keys were missing.

And the radio was still on. 

Not music. Not static. Just…whispering. 

The whispers of those old women.

And they were whispering my name and apologies. 

That was only three weeks ago. 

Now I’m on my Maw-Maw’s living room floor. She’s gone out to get some groceries. She left the radio on when she left. 

And I can’t hear them whispering my name. Can hear them saying “Some folks get called back early.”

The dial isn’t tuned to any station I recognize. The light behind it pulses, faint and sickly, like it’s breathing. The whispers are getting clearer now, like they’re leaning in closer, brushing the shell of my ear.

One of them — Mrs. Darlene, I think — is crying so loud I can hardly stand it. “We’re so sorry, baby,” she keeps saying. “We didn’t think it’d be you.”

Something inside the house keeps creaking. Not wood settling. Not the wind. I think it’s footsteps. 

I’ve just heard a scream come through as I’m finishing this. 

It’s mine. 

But I haven’t opened my mouth yet.
