I've just arrived at a village in the Honduran countryside and my welcome has been a bit... odd.

A few weeks ago, I accepted a job offer that would take me from Tegucigalpa, where I've been working as a guest lecturer at a local university for the last two years, to the sparsely populated Honduran countryside. I've been dying to get out of the packed capital city of Honduras for a few months now, but opportunities for someone whose whole career has revolved around teaching English that don't force me to relocate to another country, or San Pedro Sula (an even bigger city than Tegucigalpa) aren't exactly common. So, when I got a text from a friend with a link to an online application for a job out in the countryside, I was ecstatic. 

I applied, had a fairly normal over-the-phone interview a few days later, and accepted the job a week after that. I was told that I'd be given a bonus to help with relocation, and to report to the village, named "Alegres", in a month and a half. In the time since then I was kept busy with the tasks that accompanied planning a move most of the way across a country and wasn't able to do a whole lot of research on Alegres, specifically, but given that the name translates to "Joyful" in English I figured the name was either sarcastic, or pleasant foreshadowing. The truth as it so happens is... weirder, than that.  

My actual move has been odd. While leaving Tegucigalpa, and even the Francisco Morazan department was fine, when I started to get further away from the more populated parts of the country, I began to lose some of the handy comforts of civilization I've grown accustomed to. At first it was small stuff, like radio and the sights of other cars. Eventually though it started to become bigger things, like well-maintained roads and even the sights of towns in the distance. At one point I thought my mind began to try and comfort me by providing me with mild background noise to hear, like muffled commentary over the radio in-between bursts of static-like white noise. I even heard child-like voices trying to play games together, complete with rare but starting bursts of laughter from my radio as though someone brought their kid to work! 

When I eventually completed the arduous, eight-and-a-half-hour long journey through the countryside I drove my tiny car through a wooden gate and found myself in the smallest village I had ever seen. A collection of nine houses, each made of mud bricks, and a scattering of surprisingly modern buildings were placed in unhealthily close proximity to each other, and they were all ringed by a thin wall made of incredibly pale, remarkably sharp looking wooden stakes. It took me a few moments of gawking at the to notice that the houses all create a strange, oddly protective-looking circle around the modern buildings. I drove my car right up to one of the modern buildings, which even had a tiny car port, and when I parked it and got out, I had a moment to catch my breath. 

I had been driving for close to nine hours, having started at eight in the morning in Tegucigalpa and driving, mostly non-stop, to the village in the depths of the Gracias a Dios department in eastern Honduras. I studied my surroundings while I stretched my legs, and the first thing that stood out to me was the remarkable quiet of the village. It was almost eerie, though the modern buildings had electricity and when I was driving up to the one with the car port I had seen people in the modern building's rooms, going about their business on desktop computers, so I knew the village wasn't abandoned or anything. 

While studying my surroundings I must have been distracted or zoned out for a moment because when I was satisfied with what I had seen I turned to go to the back of my car and get my luggage and found myself looking at a large, white-furred dog with weirdly human-like blue eyes not more than a few feet from me. I gasped and almost fell backwards, and the dog kept looking me up and down, almost... studying me, if that made any sort of sense.

The dog was beautiful, but it was also gigantic, easily larger than a full grown, and particularly well-fed mastiff. The dog didn't growl at me, or bare its fangs, but it was intimidatingly large, and there was something deeply unsettling about the way that it looked at me. In the moment it felt like it could see into my soul, and that itself was not a fun thing to feel. 

For a few moments it was as though the world itself had faded away, or at least dimmed, and I was alone with the dog. There was nothing else, and no one else, who seemed to matter, and the longer the moments went on uninterrupted the more I felt my heart quicken in my chest. Eventually though, the dog was distracted by the sound of strange, child-like giggling that filled the air, coming from, as far as I could tell nowhere, and when it turned around to try and locate the source of the noise it was quickly further distracted by the sight of a little girl who couldn't possibly have been older than three, emerging from one of the mud-brick houses with a curious bell-like flower in her hand. She smiled at the canine and the creature happily bounded over to her, before reaching down and beginning to eat the flower in her hand. The scene was surreal, but even as I watched it I noticed that the giggling had ended, and I wondered if the giggling had somehow come from the girl herself. 

While I watched the scene I heard a door nearby open, and a far older sounding chuckle emanate from whoever opened it. I turned in the direction of the door, and I saw an older looking dark-skinned man smiling at the little girl and the massive dog, standing just outside of one of the modern buildings. He didn't even bother to turn to face me, before he began speaking to me in accented Spanish. 

"You must be the new teacher. It seems you've already met the town pet. Worry not, he's big looking but he's harmless. Unfortunately, other things that lurk nearby... Are not so harmless." The man tells me, his Spanish accented in ways that remind me of the various indigenous tribes that populate some of the more isolated parts of the country. 

"Well? Come on, young man. We've got a lot to talk about." The man says, his Spanish more musical than I am used to. I glanced back at the girl and saw her still standing with the enormous dog, the friendly creature gently eating the flower. I watched the scene for a second, before noticed an impish figure in the background, out past where the girl and the dog were standing, a tiny... thing, with a human-like frame but with weird, jet-black eyes and a mouth like a gaping black hole, with no teeth or tongue. It was dressed in all green, and it was also watching the girl and the dog. The creature glanced upward and saw me looking at it. When we made eye contact, or whatever the right term would be for what we did since it lacked eyes, I began to hear that odd giggling again, though it grew louder and louder before eventually ceasing to be giggling and becoming an exact copy of one of the sounds I heard on my drive here; the weird, laughter I heard on the radio. That was the point I regained my senses and I looked away from the scene, before walking towards the man who addressed me earlier. 

When I reached him he let me into the building he was standing outside of, and introduced himself as the mayor of the village. He got me some water, told me the wifi password for the building, and ran outside to get the little girl back indoors. 

I've been waiting for him for an hour now. In the time since I sat down and began to type this all out, the little, green-clothed figure has walked over to a nearby window and is now watching me. It seems harmless, but now that it's closer to me I can definitely see things like its needle-like hair, and the moles that dot its face. I can also see that its eyes are not jet-black, but actually aren't there at all. It has empty eye sockets but somehow it looks like it can still see. I guess I'm gonna need to ask the mayor some questions about this town...

It looks like my decision to accept this job is going to result in my life getting a lot weirder than I could have ever imagined it getting.
