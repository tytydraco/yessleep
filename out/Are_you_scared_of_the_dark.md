I’ve always been afraid of the dark, matter of fact I still sleep with a nightlight at the age of 29 and I’m not ashamed to say it. It just always feels like somethings lurking in the shadows waiting to snatch me and do God knows what to me. It’s so bad that I’m even scared of the darkness I see when I wash my face, always quick to rinse the soap off of one eye so I can open it half expecting to see the entity I feel staring at me.
I always told myself it was just another of my many irrational fears. Until 3 days ago anyway. 

It was Monday night and I was only an hour into this night shift already regretting switching with my coworker. For context, I’m co owner of a well known Private investigator company. Our office building was cozy enough there’s only 4 of us after all. I was nestled in my bubble chair that I’d positioned in the corner of my office which of course was probably bright enough to light up a whole neighborhood. I was looking over my notes when the lights began to flicker. They did it often as this building is extremely old so I continued my work until the lights flickered off again…and stayed off.

I sat there confused reaching beside me to grab my phone to use the flashlight. I started to panic when I didn’t feel it beside me. The lights flicked back on after about 2 minutes. I sighed with relief as I glanced up seeing id sat my phone on my desk. Right as I stood up to go grab it the lights cut off again and it oddly seemed darker. I stumbled my way to my desk shuffling objects around trying to feel for my phone in the darkness. Then the lights flicked back on again. I honestly wasn’t bothered by the lights going off and on brushing it off while mentally noting to call an electrician in the morning. Then my phone dinged as the screen lit up with a notification…behind me…on the bubble chair.

I stood frozen for a second convincing myself I was imagining things because I’m usually asleep at this hour instantly calming myself. Until I read the text: “We’ve hidden in the shadows too long. 29 long years observing slightly taunting you . I know you’ve felt our eyes on you as you’d speak out loud trying to convince yourself nothing is there it’s just your imagination and nothing to be afraid of. We watched in silence as you joined in the mockery people threw your way every time you had to explain why there’s always a light or a candle or the glow of the tv screen. The mockery has grown old…let the games begin .

I gasped in horror “ No, no, no this isn’t real, this CAN’T be real “ I said trying to convince myself. The lights went off again and a sudden chill washed over me goosebumps  nearly immediately decorated my arms and legs. I stood frozen in a daze still in my head repeating ‘this isn’t real, this isn’t real, this isn’t re- thoughts instantly silenced and I swear every hair in my body head to toe rose in terror.  Terror that flooded my whole body as a voice whispered in my ear…”Oh this is very real my sweet” the menacing voice said with a chuckle. “Ruuunnn!” 

Without a second of hesitation I bolted out of my now open office door into the hallway . I kept running past the other offices, past the bathrooms, past the dark shadow smiling its pointy pearly whites at me…wait what? As I  made it to the exit door filled with relief knowing safety was right on the other side I made the idiotic decision to look back at the shadow but it was no longer there. I hurriedly turned back around pushing the door that would release me from my nightmare. Instead of emerging to the brightly lit parking lot I fell on the floor surrounded by darkness. To my dismay I realized the door had disappeared and so had all the windows. There was nothing but darkness and the stares it felt like hundreds of eyes on me.

“You can’t outrun us nor can you hide from us”, a voice that felt more like a vibration thundered around me. “
