It's been a month since I left psych ward. It was nice to say the least. But I never opened up to anyone about what actually happened. I feared I'd be judged. So I felt that this would be a good place to share it. 

I have to admit before I start, this story mentions suicide. It'd be rude of me to trigger anybody. So I thought I'd tell you that. 

It was about 7 months ago this all started. 

I was sitting on the worn-down couch, lounging. Watching the news to pass the time. Empty chips bags laying on the couch and crumbles all over the floor. 

It was such a mess. Nothing was in the right place and the home started to stink from rotting food and dishes. 

But there I was. Sitting in the house of garbage. Contemplating. Everything. 

You see. A week prior to this, I was about to meet my daughter for the first time in 13 years. My ex-husband fought for full custody, and I got no chance to see my daughter. 

But when I visted her. The ambiance was different. It was not that I cared about that my pony-loving girl has shaped into something new, but that she– she was furious at me. Sent me right out as I had just came in. 

"You never contacted me, and now you want to see me?" She had told me right as I was trampling out the door. 

I thought she'd understand. Besides her dad would have never allowed me to even say a word to her. But nonetheless, I blamed myself. Really blamed myself. Sent me down a spiral of depression and crisis, worse than the one I already dealt with. 

But there I was, on my couch, trying to ignore what happened. Even though everything on my mind was about her. 

Out of my existential crisis, I stared out the window. Strangely, I saw my own reflection on there. My windows had never shown me so clearly. You could see the details of my tangled hair, pale skin and exhausted eyes. Though in one way it felt... Surreal. As if there was one detail off that I just couldn't explain. 

The more I stared into my own reflection, the more disorted it became. But I didn't question it too harshly. I was not someone who looked in the mirror much. I thought that was how it worked. 

Eventually I looked back at the TV. But suddenly something felt different. In a way I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. Everything suddenly felt so hazy. Everything felt so wrong. The TV got louder and my hearbeat was more clearer. 

It all stopped as I looked at the window again. Atleast temporarily 

I couldn't see my reflection anymore. I had seen it, I swear. But suddenly it was gone. 

Tap tap

I felt it. Right on my shoulder. Someone was touching it with their pointer finger.

I looked behind me and there I saw–

Myself. That reflection. But even more twisted now. It was faceless, and much lankier compared to someone like me. Even if it had no eyes, I could feel it staring into mine. 

As soon as I saw it. I ran. 

The logical response would have been to rush out the front door. Though out of pure panic I accidentally ran into the kitchen. I heard no footsteps behind me, but I could feel it coming.

As I was in the kitchen, I saw a window right over the dining table. I could climb out of there, so that was my goal. So I ran towards it, but it felt far away. Farther than usual.

No matter how fast I ran, it took so much time until I reached the window. I could feel it behind me. I wanted to look, but I was scared. Really scared. It was tempting in a strange way. 

When I was finally infront of the window. Something changed in me. 

As I looked out. All I saw was the empty forest. Then. 

The swing.

I built it for my daughter when she lived with me. She would always swing on it. Every day she would. 

Staring into the abyss of fir trees and the empty swing, I felt. Lonely. I was the only one who lived here. 

It felt unmotivating to climb out of the window. Where would I even go? Hide in the forest? Drive my car and sleep in an hotel till I finally found the urge to get a job? 

The temptation to look behind me grew strong. It just grew and grew. Eventually I did. 

It was right infront of me, it's hand clawed. Before I even got a chance to react, it stabbed me with one of it's spiky fingers. Right in the stomach. 

The blood stained my floral shirt and covered everything. But as I looked up to face the creature one last time. There was nothing there. 

That was the moment I looked to the stomach and saw a knife piercing through my stomach. 

Did I stab myself? 

That couldn't be possible. I swore that it was the one who did. But a part of me knows that I probably would have stabbed myself. 

I told the police that an intruder entered my house and stabbed me. But the knife had only my finger prints so I was sent to psych ward. 

So here we are. The story finally out my chest. Even if it should all point to a simple suicide with some hallucenation of sorts. I can't help but feel this feeling that I'm still being watched. 

Everytime I look into the mirror or at the windows I get scared. Scared it'll all happened. I can't trust my own reflection. 

But I've started to calm down. The phone screen shows my reflection clearly right now. What is it to be afraid of! 

I'm okay now.
