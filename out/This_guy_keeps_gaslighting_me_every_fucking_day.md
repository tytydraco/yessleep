Hi, I 20F have a pretty boring work checking cameras and analysing data of radars from my city, one day I got out to buy myself a lunch since nothing was happening and a co worker was there to cover me.

As I was leaving the restaurant a homeless man approached me and asked for me to buy him a meal, I said I was low on money (Wich was half a lie, a had money but just barely enough to buy meals for until the next week) and he said he saw the money on my wallet and said I'd be rewarded by God if I got him at least a salad to eat, and god I wish I've listened to this guy, I said I was sorry and I couldn't help, he them started following me, I said for him to fuck off and that he was being a creep, he said that I would regret not helping him, and he would fuck off, he then proceeded to jump in front of the first vehicle that was passing by, I swear I saw a smile on his face as he was thrown abou 23 feet away, I KNEW he was fucking dead, there was no way this guy wasn't at least in coma by what I saw, I called the cops and an ambulance, explained the situation and just continued in the best way I could the day.

By the night has I got home I kept watching news to see if anyone said anything about that guy, apparently no one knew who was this guy and he died in the hospital by medical complications, I was really shocked and confused by why the fuck someone would off himself by meal, maybe he was on some drug, maybe he had some mental condition, I tried to say that it wasn't my fault and if weren't for me, he would have done this to fuck with someone else. Well I guess he doesn't think the same way

And yes, doesn't, because when I got to work the next day there he was, in the same street about 2 blocks away from my work, looking for food in the trash cans, I just shrugged it and thought "must be someone that is pretty similar to him", by the time my coworker arrived he said there was a homeless man looking for a girl that might work by this shift, he said he was very creepy and he was smelling like a dead animal, I froze, he must have seen the name of my work on the uniform, but how the hell was he alive, I said I would see who it was and if he needed help, I looked through the other room window and the he was, waiting, and cracking some of his bones, I got out and asked what the fuck he wanted, as I got near him I started to ask myself why none of his wounds was open and there were no scars on him, he said he was going to teach me a lesson, I asked him if he wanted food, he said this was fine.

I got to the same restaurant and got him a nice meal, he was eating a simple parmegiana and suddenly he started to choke, I called for help and tried everything but everyone including him was desperate he fainted while we were waiting the ambulance, same thing, he died In the way to the hospital, and the next day was at my work.

I don't know what to do, it has been 3 months that this happened, he keeps appearing at my work seeking help and every fucking day he die because something I did, is this because I didn't gave him food? Is he some kind of spirit that is torturing me for not being nice to the poor? Why do I feel like a murder? Should I kill him? Should I kill me? Anyone has any tip of what the fuck this could be?
