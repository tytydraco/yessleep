Ok so a bit of a update on the current situation at my new home I'm renting. The blue cyclops Thing/possibly my neighbor Ned is still tapping on my windows. I've started to expect it but its still off putting. But I'm not as worried as before because if he had a way to get in he would of by now. In fact he's still is as I'm writing right now as outside my window. Still tapping. I've also learned he is also very camera shy as when I try to take a photo he somehow just immediately knows I'm there and ducks out of view. So still working on getting that picture.

He also writes. Crudely I must add because his understanding of English seems rudimentary. Just the night before he wrote on my window using mud and his finger "*Give Me Entrance*" like I was going to trust him or something. I don't know about you but I don't think that wand is just used for tapping. 

During the day Ned is still being the cheery neighbor... the freak.

I honestly don't trust that guy, he acts all nice and what not but I bet he's hiding a big blue one eyed secret I can't prove it yet!

But what I'm writing about now is something that happened last night. Because that night something new happened. Lights, floating lights INSIDE my house! 

I first saw them as I was in my bed trying to sleep as the Thing kept tapping at the windows. I was struggling to sleep and I had to work in the morning so I was getting a bit peeved. More than peeved actually. I already have struggle sleeping and now the reject from Planet X is keeping me up! So I go to do what people naturally do when they can't sleep and make myself a sandwich in my kitchen. A depression sandwich really. 

Two Slices of White Bread.

Slice of Cheese.

and Cheerios with a drizzle of Siracha. 

Don't knock until you've tried it.

So while looking in my fridge to grab the cheese and close it but the light was still on. Which is weird because I hadn't turned on the kitchen light. So I turn around and what do I see? A floating purple light, in *my* kitchen! Now at the time I was frankly trying not to turn my PJ's brown at the sight of sheer terror. Because I thought the wards were meant to keep the weird stuff OUTSIDE! 

So what is the point of them if they don't even do that! at least that's what I think they do. So I do what I think any normal person would do and just surrender my cheese too it. It reacts by engulfing my hand in its heavenly glow and suddenly that slice of orange American cheese was nowhere to be seen and my hand felt like I just stuck it in front of my freezer. 

It then proceeds to zoom over my head and around my house disappearing and reappearing at seemingly random. I just take my sandwich, without my cheese this thing just gulped down, and hide in the panic room. I just sit in there eating my sad sad midnight snack as I can see the light from it from under the door appear and disappear but never entering the room itself. eventually after eating I feel tired enough that I drift too sleep.

The light hasn't reappeared tonight so I'm not sure if its a thing that repeatedly happens. I do know I'm a cheese slice short and my hand probably is now riddled with radiation of some kind. 

So I'm just left confused about what happened. What that might of been and how it was inside my house. was it a ghost or a UFO? I once again, am stumped. 

One last thing before I leave you all tonight is that I did attempt to call my landlord about what has been happening like one guy recommended I do and he picked up. I asked about the, the light, the wards, and even Ned. What I got was only more questions as he didn't seem to want to talk about it. He said that strange things like that have been happening since he bought the property from this old woman back in 2009 as he was looking to capitalize on the housing crisis and buy properties for cheap. It seems to have nipped him in the back because since day one of owning the place these strange things have been happening. 

I asked why would he rent it if he new the place was weird and he told me "Yah gotta deal with life sometimes." and proceeded to ask if I have seen the dog girls. 

Now there are werewolf ladies!?! What kind of place is this I feel like this is the house from hell! What Indian burial ground got built over to cause this! 

I tell him no and asked if he knew if the Thing and Ned were the same thing and he told me. "I'm not sure. I never talk with the neighbor so I wouldn't know. But if he knocks on you're door or anyone else do not let them in that house. I don't wanna clean the mess that comes after up or I'm gonna have to repaint the damn walls again." and then he hangs up. 

Ok so now someone has died in this house that is reassuring!

I'll be sure to watch out for those dog ladies. luckily I haven't seen them yet. 

Guess what the Thing is writing on my window again while I finish this up. now he's saying "I make you Pieces", wonderful now he's threatening me with dismemberment. 

That seems like a good way to end this post tonight. Lucky me I don't work weekends. Goodnight Everyone reading this and pray I'm still alive by morning. If you have any questions or advice leave them in the comments and I will reply when I can.
