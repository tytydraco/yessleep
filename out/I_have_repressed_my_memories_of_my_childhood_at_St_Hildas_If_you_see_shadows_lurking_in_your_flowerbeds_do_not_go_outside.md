I somehow always knew I would eventually be adopted. Even as I got older, I found myself free from the crippling concern that plagued the other children in our orphanage—that we were somehow unfairly punished to a sentence in that imposing, lonely mansion tucked away in that clearing in the forest, and doomed to the inevitable uncertainties and struggles of independent life once we reached legal age. Granted, I wasn’t that old when my parents, after an impulsive but decisive choice, adopted me— I was seven and a half—but, for us, once you were past the endearing years of toddlerhood, everything was left to fate. There weren’t many prospective couples seeking to adopt in our area, made worse by an arduous and expensive process to claim a child as ones own. I would later on learn, as a young adult, that I was one of the lucky ones, having found a family when most of my peers would eventually age out of the system before having a life outside of that damned home.

Though images of St. Hilda’s return to me in only hazy fragments as I attempt to recall my childhood, they are vividly clear in my nightmares. Long nights, long corridors, long waits for visiting couples. Worse, still—corporal punishment by nuns cloaked in black, the eery whispers of the wind against rusty window panes, and of course, the shadow in the forest.

Boys and girls were separated into bedrooms of twelve, but because we weren’t many, most rooms in St. Hilda’s remained unoccupied. The orphans - a ragtag group of rebels, bookworms, and outsiders - were strictly put to bed every night at 7:30. Of course, we never listened, and once the sisters returned to their wing of the mansion, we had all the fun we weren’t permitted to have in St. Hilda’s. Ghost stories, stolen snacks, forbidden movies - those nights were our only reprieve from the monsters that cursed us from within that home. Of course, we were completely oblivious to the one that stalked us from outside. Until one day.

Alfie, the youngest of our age group, pointed out unsurely as we ate away at some snickers bars, “There’s a man in the flowerbeds!” Of course, none of us believed him, mostly because the clearing in which St. Hilda’s was located was in an unusually secluded forest, but also because Alfie tended to have an equally unusual imagination. But as we peeked out the long windows of our second floor room, sure enough, there, lurked a shadow in the flowerbed. A swift hush fell over the room. It was a rare occasion for us to receive any visitors, and they certainly never came in the middle of the night. But as soon as the silhouette had appeared, it was suddenly gone. We wrote it off quickly as the shadow of a fox or a deer, and anyways, as children, our naïveté protected us from thoughts of burglars and thieves.

But the very next day, Lucie, the most timid of the girls, cried all through lunchtime, complaining that she couldn’t sleep with monsters stalking us in the clearing. The sisters swiftly took her away and Lucie never mentioned it again. Of course, with Lucie now having corroborated what we thought we might have seen, we dared not to look out the windows at night. We stopped playing outside during our breaks, and we certainly never went near the flowerbeds. Peter, the leader of the boys, occasionally took quick looks for us at night, and assured us that there was nothing outside. But he was always overprotective of us, and I couldn’t decide whether I believed him or not, so I took a look outside, and he was right.

But on another night, as he routinely looked out the window to assuage our fears, he stopped mid-sentence, frozen, not in fear, but in confusion. We all ran to his side and took a look for ourselves. On the flowerbeds stood the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She was about our age, but she definitely was not an orphan at St. Hilda’s, because there were only fourteen girls, and I knew each of them like a sister.

“Want to play with me?” she shouted up at us, smile wide and eyes twinkling.

None of us replied. We didn’t know what to do or say, both awestruck and confused at the same time. Who was she? What was she doing there?

“Maybe she needs our help,” Peter announced to our group as he opened the door to the long corridor. But just as he was about to step into it, he was stopped by the girls whose bedroom was right next to ours.

“I know what you’re going to do, Peter” said Lina, the oldest of the girls. “She’s been looking at our window all night. We don’t know what to do, but don’t you find it a bit weird she’s just… standing there?”

“What if she needs our help?” he replied back, worry aging his young face.

“She’s been there all night. She’s asking us to play. If you wanna do something about it, go tell the sisters, but don’t go out on your own.”

Suddenly, the wind outside stopped, and an eery silence fell over the mansion.

“WHY WON’T YOU PLAY WITH ME! WHY WON’T YOU PLAY WITH ME! COME OUT!” shouted a much deeper voice, shaking the whole house and resonating through our bones.

We all scrambled to the girls room in fear, not daring to look down the windows, and remained huddled together for the rest of the night. When the sisters found us the next morning, we received a punishment I will choose not to speak of. But when we relayed what had happened the night before, I recognized a hint of uncertainty in Sister Agatha’s voice as she announced that “it was nothing but your imaginations.” Because the very next day, cracks had spread throughout the windows in all our rooms, many of them too high for us to reach in the long windows.

None of us brought it up the next day, or the day after, or for weeks to come. We were afraid that speaking of the creature outside would somehow help it materialize. And though we all silently knew what each other was thinking of, we dared not bring it up again.

But curiosity overtook me, and when no one was watching one night night, I stole a quick glance out the window. At the edge of the clearing lurked a shadow, but as I was about to alarm the other boys, a beautiful lady stepped out. Her bright smile was drawn with red lipstick, and a luminescent string of pearls hung around her neck. She wore the most lovely yellow dress, partially hidden by a small apron adorned with polka dots. She was humming— a lull so sweet it made me dream of a home I never had. And though, at that point, I had never truly knew what one was like, she was exactly what I had imagined a mother to look like.

“She’s carrying a cake” cried Alfie, as the other boys joined me, “right on time for my birthday!”

And right under arm, she was carrying gifts—of all sizes and colors, as though she had one personally for each of us. As though entranced by her lullaby, every boy ran down the stairs, asking excitedly questions no one had the answers to. Who was she? Where did she come from? What were in those gifts? Who were they for?

And as we reached the bottom of the stairs, we watched her continue to walk towards us—stopping, however, abruptly right before the doorsteps. It is difficult for me to relay what happened in the moments next, but I believe it is finally time to tell the story covered up by the sisters of St. Hilda’s. I don’t know why I didn’t follow, but I have never been more grateful for my guts.

The beautiful lady—almost out of a 1950’s housewives magazine—laid down the cake and gifts, then held her hands out to us, beckoning us forward. The boys, excluding myself, ran out, leaving the premises of St. Hilda’s for the first time in a long time, and ran towards her. But as soon as they had all ran out, the main door slammed shut, trapping them outside.

I will never forget the sounds of their screams, and at night, when I recall these memories, I try not to imagine what caused them. But I know.

I can not recall the moments after, or how long I had just stood there or when I finally ran to the sisters, but the echoes of their cries will remain with me forever. After that night, I became the only boy left in St. Hilda’s, and the mysterious disappearances of Peter, Alfie, and the rest was quickly covered up by both what I assume to be a great effort by the sisters of St. Hilda’s and the authorities’ disregard for a run-down orphanage. To this day, media coverage of the incident remains minimal, and the guilt that eats at me has been suppressed by attempts to repress my unhappy childhood.

So, if one day, you find shadows in your flowerbeds, the best advice I can part with you is to not go outside at night.
