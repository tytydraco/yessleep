Back when I grew up in rural Minnesota, my mother wanted me to keep in touch with my Scandinavian roots. We haven’t lived in the Nordic countries for three generations, but there are still a couple of things that stick around. Behavioral quirks, mostly, and a couple of traditions that’ve been with our family for as long as anyone can remember.

Putting porridge out for the forest gnomes was one thing. Mom used to trick me with these dolls that she’d put in the snow and point to, saying;

“Don’t move too fast, you’ll scare them.”

And let’s not talk about dancing around the maypole. That stuff’s just embarrassing.

 

But the most peculiar tradition is the one about a Midsummer night’s dream. I know, that’s a Shakespeare title, but it’s also a traditional Scandinavian thing. It goes a little something like this; on the evening of Midsummer, you are to collect seven kinds of wildflowers. Then you bundle them up and put them under your pillow. If you do, you are supposed to dream of your one true love.

Now, I have three sisters. They were all about romance and predestination, and I couldn’t have cared less if I wanted to. But every year they’d walk hand in hand, collecting wildflowers, and putting them under their pillows. And since I was too young to wander off on my own, I had to stick around.

That is, until they decided it was my turn.

 

It was my oldest sister who made the call. She was 12 and I’d just turned 7, but she figured the earlier the better.

“You have to tell us what she looks like,” she said. “Like, if she’s tall, or thin, or fat.”

“I bet she’s fat,” said my second-oldest sister.

“Statistically she’s Chinese or Indian,” said the other. “That’s where there are most girls.”

I tried to ignore them, but their cackling got on my nerves. They gathered up some silky aster, blue-eyed grass, silverleaf, wild bergamot, blue sunflowers, and ground plum - but couldn’t get a seventh one. They looked around but couldn’t find one. I just wanted to go home, so I picked up the first thing I saw, sticking out next to a rusted-out barrel.

“How about this one?” I said, holding up a yellow flower with a black spot.

“That’s a Black-Eyed Susan,” said my oldest sister.

“You’re gonna marry a Susan,” grinned another.

“Little Susie-woo gonna love you-hoo!” sing-sang the last.

I rolled my eyes so hard that they almost popped out of my head as they cackled and teased, putting my hair up in a bow.  They bundled up the wildflowers and made me sleep with them under my pillow.

 

I didn’t notice anything strange at first. Just a night like any other. You have such vivid dreams when you’re a kid – like everything just happens faster. You even sleep faster.

But this was something else entirely. It wasn’t just a dream; it was an experience. And the worst part is, I didn’t even remember it. I just remembered it was bad. Really, really, bad. It was so bad that I completely blocked it out. I don’t even remember waking up, I just remember laying in the bathtub submerged in cold water

I looked up at my three sisters. They looked terrified. My throat was hoarse, and I was wide-awake; but I couldn’t even remember going to bed.

“Does it hurt?” my oldest asked.

Her voice was different. Lower, careful. I shook my head.

“No,” I said. “I’m okay.”

“It sounded like it hurt,” she continued. “Like it *really* hurt.”

“I think it was a bad dream.”

“Was it her?” asked my youngest sister. “Did you dream of her?”

I couldn’t tell. It was just a dark space in the back of my mind that made my pulse shiver when I thought about it. And yet, I knew the answer.

“Yeah,” I said. “It was Black-Eyed Susan.”

 

Now, I’ve been teased by my sister my whole life – but they never teased me about Black-Eyed Susan. They’d never seen me like that. I’d woken up screaming at the top of my lungs, rolling around on the floor. They thought I was having a seizure. They took me to the bathroom while my mom called an ambulance.

We didn’t talk much about it. They never had me checked for epilepsy, and I was perfectly healthy otherwise. They talked a little about it being some kind of allergic reaction, but I’d never seen a reaction like that. Over time, we came to this unspoken conclusion; that those wildflowers gave me the worst nightmare of my life.

And in that nightmare, I saw my one true love.

Black-Eyed Susan.

 

I wouldn’t think much about that night over the years to come. It became this distant memory, like your first cold. But every now and then, particularly around Midsummer, I would try to remember what that dream had been like, and something inside me would sink into this bottomless hole in my chest. It teased me. I could concentrate, and I’d see it, but I didn’t want to. To have forgotten was a blessing, and I knew better than to challenge it.

But it’s a weird headspace to live in. To have concepts such as ‘true love’ and ‘marriage’ so closely associated with trauma. Especially since all other couples in my life were perfectly fine role models. My mother and father were an extraordinary couple, and while my sisters had some dating life drama, nothing bad ever really happened to them.

So as I got into my teenage years, I didn’t want to chase girls and flirt. I didn’t want to fall in love. I joked about it a lot, but the feeling of meeting my one true love felt like throwing my soul down an endless pit.

 

I tried to rationalize it away. It was just a stupid phase. A quirk. It became like a fun party story to tell in my late teens. It was funny, in a way, saying I used to believe in such things. But there was an asterisk stuck to that story every time I told it; a little white lie.

I never *stopped* believing in it.

It started to really bother me when I was about 17. At that point I’d been in short relationships, and I’d been in love; but I couldn’t stop thinking that it wasn’t *real*. That ‘*true’* love was out there, and that it was terrifying. Something that would make my heart sink into my stomach. So I decided to just bite the bullet and try the whole thing again – to face my fears.

So that Midsummer, I put together seven types of wildflowers again; ending with a Black-Eyed Susan.

 

As kids, we’re very good at handling pain. Or at least we’re resilient. We have time to heal. But when you’re 17, it hits differently. When I went to bed that night I had cold sweats, and I couldn’t stop thinking about what was waiting behind my closed eyes. Would there be a reaction at all, or had I wasted all this time being anxious about nothing?

I closed my eyes and tried not to think about it. I counted down from a hundred. Then two hundred. I twisted and turned, trying to get the sweaty covers to stop sticking to my skin. At the slightest stretch, my eyes would pop open. I’d get this ache in my face from trying to keep them closed. But after hours, something clicked. My muscles relaxed, and I caught a whiff of the flowers from under my pillow.

And something inside me screamed at me to turn back. To open my eyes – but it was too late.

 

It felt like looking at the bottom of a pool, but straight ahead. A reflective shimmer, ethereal but physical at the same time. Like a night sky that you can push your hands through. I fumbled with my hands, trying to find something to hold on to. There was this swirl in the back of my head, like having a large drink on an empty stomach.

Something reached for me and touched my fingertips. Something as hard as fingernails. It poked and prodded me from different angles. A strange voice seeped through me; neutral, genderless, and with an unusual pronunciation.

“…where have you *been?*” it asked.

I tried to regain my footing, but there was nothing to hold on to. Just these protrusions from the dark. Finally, I felt myself slowing down. A steadiness – control.

 

Something came out of the dark. Eyes so dark that their head look hollow against the night. A vaguely human skull connected to an infinite mass; like a broken flower growing out of cracked concrete. Muscle and vein contracting and compounding at every angle; ripples of flesh with every offset heartbeat.

“…it’s been so *long*.”

Something wrapping around my ankle. Tightening.

“…come home.”

 

My eyes snapped open, but I wasn’t awake. I could feel her wrapped around my ankle. I pulled away the covers and watched my foot turn blue. It was bending, and I felt nothing.

Then the bone snapped.

I’ve never experienced something like that. I’ve never broken a bone, and experiencing a trimalleolar fracture in the comfort of your own bed is inhuman. It hurts so bad you lose bladder control, and I couldn’t do anything but to fall out of bed and writhe on the floor, but the pain wouldn’t go away. I just screamed. I tried to reach for my phone, but it’s like it refused to let me reach it.

A neighbor heard me. Help came. It would take time for the leg to heal, but bones mend all the time. But true love doesn’t.

 

I pushed the thought of love and marriage out of my life for over a decade. I would shy away from coy smiles and flowery laughter. Some people thought I had a problem with my sexuality. Others thought I was under some kind of religious repression. I tried to explain that relationships just weren’t my thing, but it’s hard to explain without a reason. If I was really pressed about it, I’d say it was a childhood trauma – that usually stopped the questions.

I’d do this for years. A string of short-term relationships where I kept hoping and praying I wouldn’t fall in love. Anything to keep me away from that dark space. I couldn’t tell what was going to happen if I met someone who’d make me feel things. *Real* things.

But life isn’t so simple. It would take me years, but when I turned 31, I met her.

 

Lilia hit me like a summer’s breeze the first time I talked to her. It was a birthday party, and she was invited by a mutual friend of ours. Lilia had been working overtime and forgotten all about the party, so she’d joined at the last minute. She showed up in an oversized hoodie and yesterday’s jeans, spending most of the night at the snack table looking at her phone. Her enthusiasm started and stopped at bobbing her head to the music. When I saw that we were out of pretzels I went up to talk to her.

“Looking for snacks?” I asked.

“Your mom’s a snack,” she snapped back.

“Alright, yeah, but I was talking about the pretzels.”

She looked at me like I’d struck gold. She’d been so hell-bent on the idea that I was coming up to hit on her that it never even crossed her mind that she’d eaten a full bowl of salty pretzels. She snort-laughed, apologized, and I felt my heart skip a beat.

I knew it was trouble. I *liked* her.

 

Lilia was a work-from-home backend developer. She spent most of her days trying to steer her team though rough deadlines and absurd last-minute changes. She explained it as trying to teach cats algebra while falling out of an airplane. She cycled through periods of insane stress to weeks of coasting, which she’d made into an absurd routine. Clearly something she couldn’t keep up forever.

We didn’t start dating right away. We chatted a bit and found out we had a lot in common. She’d been dating this one guy since she was 14 years old, and had only recently turned single, so she wasn’t eager to get back on the market. She didn’t mind my vague “trauma”. She just liked being around me.

I think our friends realized we were dating long before Lilia or I did. We just spent time together until one day when we didn’t want it to stop.

 

Still, I couldn’t help but think of Black-Eyed Susan. No matter how soothing Lilia’s snores were, I could still lay awake at night. There was a warmth in my chest as I imagined the smell of wildflowers from my pillow. An ache in my leg, where I could touch the scars. If I were to *truly* fall in love, what would happen?

Those nights came more often. From once every six months or so, to every week. After having dated for about a year, Lilia was eager to help me get over the whole thing. She knew it was a trauma, and she knew I didn’t want to talk about it, but she couldn’t let it go. And of course she couldn’t. She was in a loving relationship with a man who couldn’t say he loved her, and all she knew was that something had happened.

It got to a point where it was driving a wedge between us. She wanted to help, and I wanted her to understand. And I could only think of one way to show her.

I had to do it again.

 

On Midsummer, we went outside to pick flowers. Lilia was excited, but her smile faded when she felt how serious I was. I did what I’d done every other time; I picked six types, and a final flower would pop out of nowhere. And of course, it’d be the Black-Eyed Susan. I bundled them all up. I could feel a phantom pain cutting into my leg, which gave me a limp.

“So what are these for?” she asked.

“For sleep,” I said. “And I’m gonna need your help.”

“Sure, yeah. Whatever you need.”

“If it looks bad, I need you to wake me up.”

“How do I know if it’s bad?”

I shook my head and took her by the hand.

“You’ll know.”

 

I did some preparations. I had gauze and painkillers. Lilia was prepared to call for help if necessary. She still had no idea what was going on, but I could tell she was nervous. Then again, so was I. Problem was, I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, and she watched me. After about an hour, she crawled up next to me. She knew it was something that happened when I slept, but she wanted to calm me down.

“I need you to see this,” I said.

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “Go to sleep.”

“Promise you’ll keep watch.”

“I promise.”

I didn’t turn my head to look. I trusted her. So I closed my eyes, let my breathing slow, and felt my head fill with the smell of wildflowers.

 

It was like waking up again. A mild tingle covering my body, like being draped in spider webs. I blinked and blinked, but it was still dark. A long, drawn-out breath echoed like a field of sighing flowers.

“…*beautiful*.”

A growth coming out of the dark; translucent, like living glass hardening into soft marble. A woman, dragging her legs through the darkness like she was trudging through a swamp. She grabbed me by the hand, pulling me along. It felt like I was carried through a current.

I could see the bedroom from above. I lay there, and Lilia was sitting next to me. I can’t really explain what it felt like. Sort of like watching your reflection blink. I could see her struggling to stay awake, nodding on and off. She was trying so hard.

“…is that what *beautiful* looks like?” Black-Eyed Susan asked.

“I don’t even know what you are,” I said.

“Of course you do,” she said. “I am your one *true* *love*.”

 

The words slithered - a drawn out ‘s’ poisoned the air. I tried not to look at her. It was like the opposite of staring into a sun; the light in your eyes begin to die, and you can feel yourself grow colder. Slower.

“You can’t be,” I said. “It’s impossible.

“But I am,” she said. “You love me.”

She turned her attention to the room hovering in front of us. I could see little tendrils creep under the furniture, reaching for Lilia and me. Long finger-like limbs in layered scales, bending at painful angles. One pulled down her phone. Another moved a chair. Two of them struggled to move the bed.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Passing the time.”

 

One of the tendrils closed around my stomach. There was pressure, like someone tightening a belt. It cut into my hips. Before the pain, I could feel a slight pop.

“If you love me, why are you hurting me?” I asked.

“How else are you going to get used to it?” she asked back.

“Get used to what?”

She turned to me, breath reeking of ammonia with every spit of a word.

“Us.”

A hand closed around my neck.

 

My eyes flung open. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t feel my legs. I flailed with my arm, reaching for Lilia. She got out of bed, only to find that her phone was gone.

“What’s wrong?!” she asked. “What’s happening?!”

She had to cover her mouth when she saw my neck. She grabbed my arm, but the moment she did, something took hold of her. In the corner of my eye, I saw her getting pulled into the other room; clawing at the carpet with a terrified shriek.

My left arm rose out of the bed, as if carried by an unseen string. Two of my fingers popped out of their sockets, like a painful countdown. I couldn’t scream – I could barely think. No oxygen.

 

Lilia came running back and grabbed me. She pulled on my arm, and something let go. I fell out of bed, gasping for air as she cradled my head in her arms. I could see color returning to my hands as two fingers turned purple. I didn’t feel a thing, but I would in a couple of seconds.

“Hold on,” Lilia said. “Hold on.”

Her phone was gone. She bandaged my fingers and tried to keep them straight.

“I’m sorry,” I gasped. “I’m so sorry.”

She just shook her head, trying to process what’d happened. There were no words, we just stayed there on the floor. But I could see something in the corners of the room – little quirks and shades. Something was waiting for me to let my guard down.

“What’s hurting you?” she asked. “What is it?”

Something broke in me as I swallowed my words. But Lilia deserved the truth.

“I think she loves me.”

 

Over the coming weeks, I tried my best to explain. Lilia was terrified. She’d never seen anything like it, and there was no explanation that could settle her nerves. It’s one thing to know someone you care about has trauma, but it is another thing entirely to experience something impossible. That can make or break you.

But Lilia didn’t break. She started asking questions.

Why was I targeted? What was this thing? What did it want?

 

But things were getting strange. It’s as if thinking about Black-Eyed Susan brought her closer to us in a physical, literal way. Like we were building towards something. I would spot movement in the shadows. I’d notice furniture out of place and hear creaking doors in the middle of the night. And of course, it had to be *her*. She was playing with me.

Lilia would stay up at night reading about various Scandinavian traditions. The cast iron scissors under the pillow. The Midsummer Pole. The yearwalk. Trolls, elves, dwarves, and gnomes. She gave me lists of things to ask my parents about, to see if our family had been targeted by something ancient, or evil.

But weeks would come and go, and we wouldn’t be anywhere close to an answer. And the shadows would grow longer. Things would disappear.

And every night, when I closed my eyes, I’d catch a whiff of earthy wildflowers.

 

Things would quickly progress beyond tricks and shadows. At one point, I was tripped while walking down a flight of stairs. Another time, something pressed down on the gas pedal, sending me straight through a red light. It’s a miracle no one was hurt.

Lilia wouldn’t go unscathed either. Electronics would break or go missing. Odd sounds would wake her up at night. She told me that sometimes she’d see a silhouette outside the window, as if someone was trying to catch a peek of us. Every time she looked closer it would turn out to be fallen leaves, or a peculiar branch.

It was stressful, but there wasn’t really an option. What else could we do but to stick together and love one another?

 

I don’t remember the moment we moved in together. It just made sense, since we spent all our time together anyway. She just moved more and more of her stuff in, and all of a sudden her place was pretty much empty. So yeah, we lived together. It wasn’t really a conscious decision.

Lilia had a couple of rough ideas about what that thing might be. She had a binder with ideas ranging from Arthurian mythology to Djinn and some kind of Polish bird demon. None of them fit perfectly though, and frankly, it was such an odd thing for it all to be tied to this one ancient tradition. How could this thing be my true love? What was I missing?

We figured it had to be something connected to that very first night back when I was a kid. When they had to put me in the bathtub to wake me up.

 

For a full year, all we did was try to make it to the next day. It affected pretty much every aspect of our lives. The way we slept at night. The way we cooked. The way we did our laundry. There’d always be something messing up the rhythm of the day.

It exhausted us. Not just mentally and physically, but socially. We stopped going out. Hell, we barely even talked. Instead we kept our heads down and tried not to think about it too much, silently hoping for the problem to solve itself as Lilia’s binder gathered dust.

But once the next Midsummer came around, there was a difficult discussion to be had.

 

“We can’t live like this.”

She’d sat me down at the kitchen table. The light bulb had burned out somehow, despite only being two weeks old.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I wouldn’t blame you if-“

“I’m not going anywhere,” she said. “You know that.”

“So what do we do?”

She looked around. The kitchen faucet was leaking again.

“I suppose we ought to try something,” she said. “You got any suggestions?”

“She could kill us,” I said. “We can’t go there.”

“Maybe we don’t have a choice.”

I just sat there in the dark, counting the seconds. She was right, of course. But that didn’t mean I had to like it.

 

As Midsummer came, we decided we would do this together. We got a single large pillow and gathered the flowers together. We didn’t say a word. We just walked among the wildflowers as a low rumble lingered on the horizon. A damp taste in the air as a storm brewed. But to me, all I could see was the woman I loved, and how she carefully brushed her hands against the tall grass. Even now, she could find something to appreciate.

Tradition, ritual, and myth be damned. At that moment, there wasn’t a force in the world that could convince me that she was anything but my *actual* true love.

We rounded out our wildflowers with a Black-Eyed Susan. It was hidden next to a rusted-out barrel, as if trying its best to hide. But like every other year I’d done this, I’d find one. And with all seven wildflowers in hand, we bundled them up, and wandered home – hand in hand.

We hugged each other tight as we went to bed. Someway, somehow, we would make it through the night. We had to.

 

When I opened my eyes, something felt different.

I thought I was standing in sand, but it was more like a fine concrete dust. The moon covered most of the night sky – but I couldn’t see any stars. There were black trees in the distance; leafless and skeletonized by years of thirst. Along the horizon was a single large tree, tall enough to almost reach the moon itself. An apocalyptic vision, if anything.

“Who are you?”

A melodic voice. Kind, but unsure. I turned around.

Lilia?

 

My first thought was that she looked taller, but that wasn’t it – she was the same as always. It was me that’d gotten *shorter*. My hands were smaller. I looked down at the 7-year-old version of myself, still dressed in my most comfortable childhood jammies. Lilia didn’t really sound any different, but a child’s ears hear things in other ways. She had the most beautiful voice.

“It’s me,” I said. “Somehow.”

“You’re really cute,” she smiled. “But I don’t get it.”

“I don’t either. Maybe we’re not supposed to.”

“Maybe.”

 

We wandered down a trail, hand in hand. There was no one around. No wind blowing through dead plains. No birds in the sky. No chirping cicadas, and no rustling leaves. Just feet on dust.

“There’s no one here,” I said. “This can’t be it.”

“Did we do it wrong?” she asked.

“I don’t think so. She’s usually here by now.”

Lilia blinked, looking around. Then something dark settled over her eyes.

“What if she is?”

She let go of me and brushed her arms up and down in a self-hug. Something she usually did when stressed.

 

We wandered around for what felt like hours. Nothing happened. No one came to disturb us. It was just her, me, and nothingness. No Black-Eyed Susan, and nothing to tear us apart.

“Does this mean you’re my true love?” she asked. “I mean, I am dreaming of *you*.”

“That would make you mine too,” I smiled.

“I thought that was occupied.”

“I thought so too.”

But there was no one there to challenge that claim. We just smiled at one another. That had to be it. Despite it all, something good had to come out of this.

 

But no matter where we went, or for how long, nothing happened. We started to worry. We weren’t waking up. We didn’t get hungry, or thirsty, or tired; it was just this complete stage of emptiness. We would walk down forgotten paths for what felt like hours, strolling past sand-burnt concrete ruins.

I don’t know how much time passed. It might’ve been days, it might’ve been months. It was impossible to tell, and Lilia always had this amazing ability to make every moment pass by in a flash. She was impossible not to love. Even then, and even there, we’d make jokes and laugh. Though I couldn’t get over the feeling of being stuck in my younger self. You don’t realize how much you’ve changed until you step back into old shoes like that.

Then I noticed something; a flicker of yellow.

 

Right there, behind a rusted-out old barrel, was a Black-Eyed Susan. The same yellow flower I’d found on that fateful Midsummer night as a kid. I don’t know how I recognized it, but I did. It was the same flower, it had to be. I picked it up and showed it to Lilia.

“Strange, huh?” I said. “Only one of these I’ve seen around.”

“I wonder what it does,” she said. “You think it means-“

Her voice cut out. The light warped in front of me, blurring like I was watching through a thin layer of rushing. I could feel a tingle in my eyes. Lilia looked different. Further away.

“…don’t go!” she called out. “What are you doing?”

“I’m not, I just picked this, I-“

I held it out and dropped it – giving her one last flower.

 

We drifted apart. Something shifted. My head rolled back, and I felt this intense heat settling into my head. Then a coolness – someone trying to lower my temperature. Young voices, terrified. Lilia drifting further away, screaming at me to stay with her. Her voice goes from beautiful, to desperate, to something else.

She would scream how much she loved me, and then scream at how much she hated me. I would leave her in that place for what would equate to eternities - for her to twist and turn in a place where she’d have nothing but her thoughts and regrets; where a starless sky would seep into her, whispering things to do. Ways she would play whenever I returned. Her head spinning with tales of djinn, and mares, and demons.

It would just be seconds passing as I felt her disappear, but in those seconds there would be eons. Long enough for a body to forget what humans looked like. For a mind to forget what love is supposed to be. For a word, or a phrase, to change. True love.

An ammonia-reeking scream reflected off a fractured space as she reached for me, trying to pull me back through the breaking light. A hand so warm that it burned my face. How could I be so cruel as to leave her for endless time to suffer? How could I be so selfish?

Black-Eyed Susan. Lilia.

My one, true, love.

 

Then I woke up.

My head burst through the water as I looked up at my three sisters.

I was 7 years old, and still in my jammies – submerged in the bathtub of my childhood home.

And as healthy young minds do, my memories healed themselves; sealing away a trauma for me to uncover years down the line.

 

Life would turn out the same way. Awkward teenage years. Short relationships. And I’d come back to that broken place time and time again, and she would play her games; reminding me of the betrayal she felt. And I wouldn’t understand.

That is, until one night, when I woke up alone. We’d gone to bed together, but only one had made it back. I’d lived a life twice, and I hadn’t even realized it.

I stumbled into the shower, set it to cold, and collapsed. I could just think of one thing to say.

“I’m sorry. I’m so, so, *sorry*.”

Another view of the world from behind a shimmer – be it warm tears or running water.

 

Today, I’m 47. Never married. No serious dating. I go back to Lilia every year, hoping I can find something to remind her of what she used to be. I’ve tried bringing things along; something to bring her back with me. I’ve yet to find anything useful. It doesn’t work like that.

Sometimes I try to stay a little longer, but the pain is unbearable. I suspect one day, she’ll kill me – and I won’t come back. I suppose that’s the only way this can end. I try not to think about it, but when I do, I try to convince myself that I will end up the same way as her. Maybe we can find solace in our madness. Maybe we’ll live together in a paradise of dust and strange moons.

I don’t know.

 

I don’t think that old tradition just shows you true love. I think it will take you to a place where you can meet. But perhaps that place isn’t what it used to be. Maybe there used to be more flowers, and dancing.

I’ve asked my sisters about what they’ve seen the times they’ve done this. All they tell me about is handsome men and blue skies. I guess we don’t all go to the same place. After all, true love isn’t the same for everyone. If there truly is someone for everyone, well, then we must face some hard facts. They could live across the world. They could have passed away. Or maybe they’re just not what you expected.

But the older I get, the less I worry. Maybe I’ll wake up in that bathtub a third time, years from now. And if not, then at least I get to see her again.

There must be something of Lilia left in Black-Eyed Susan. There has to be.

Or else she wouldn’t still be my one true love.
