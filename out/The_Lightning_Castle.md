Every town has their local legends. Myths, monsters, mysteries, lore—passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation. Campfire stories that provide an extra chill given “it happened right here.”

Ours is The Lightning Castle.

I remember hearing of it for the first time from my best friend, Billy, when we were in the seventh grade. A headstrong boy, and a bit of a daredevil; he called a group of us over on the playground, gesturing excitedly.

“Have any of you heard of The Lightning Castle?” He asked.

Several shook their heads, including me, but Aaron scoffed, “I have; it’s just a myth. My uncle told me about it years ago and said it’s just a dangerous prank used to get people to go up Shepherd’s Hill in a storm.”

“It’s not a myth or a prank, my older brother and his friends saw it!” Billy retorted.

“Bullshit.” Aaron coughed.

Curious now, I asked, “well what is it?”

Aaron rolled his eyes but said, “go on then, tell them,” to Billy.

Billy smirked and dropped into his creepiest whisper, pulling us all in closer.

“Okay, so hundreds of years ago, when this town was first founded, a rich man named Elias Murphy built a small castle up on Shepherd’s Hill and on top of the tallest tower, he installed a massive metal rod. Whenever a storm would roll in, the people in the town below could see the castle lighting up as lightning struck it.

“Shortly after, townspeople started to go missing. They all suspected it had something to do with The Lightning Castle, but Elias quickly filled the pockets of anyone that came asking questions, so the investigations never went very far.

“Then, one stormy night, a badly burned man stumbled into the local tavern. He croaked out a story of how he’d been captured and subjected to torturous experiments at the castle. Elias was trying to use a combination of spells, lightning, and human sacrifice to open a portal to Hell itself. He’d only escaped because Elias thought he’d died and discarded him in a pit of bodies in various states of decay.

“That was the last straw for the deeply religious townspeople. Not wanting a devil worshipper performing evil experiments near their town, they formed a mob and marched up Shepherd’s Hill, braving the particularly violent storm. But, just before they reached the top, a huge bolt of lightning split the sky. When it hit the rod, they all watched in shock as a molten pit opened up under the castle and swallowed it whole. As the last of the tallest tower disappeared beneath the earth, the pit closed, leaving no trace that the castle had ever existed.

“The burned man died of infection several days later and over time, they began to wonder if it had all even really happened. They convinced each other that it was some sort of dream or hallucination and agreed not to speak of it. But, on stormy nights, some whispered that they could still see the castle in a brief flash of lightning.

“To this day, if you venture to Shepherd’s Hill during a thunderstorm and stand where the mob did on that fateful night, you can see The Lightning Castle—a projection from Hell, where Elias is still performing his experiments on tortured souls.” Billy finished with a triumphant grin.

“See, it’s bullshit.” Aaron chimed in. “There’s no evil castle up on Shepherd’s Hill. I’ve been up there tons of times and it’s just weeds and rocks.”

Shepherd’s Hill is on the East side of the town and is a local hiking destination as you can get a great view of the valley below from the top. Shear rock formations make it difficult to climb on most sides, but there’s one well-worn trail up to the top leading out from a small parking lot at the bottom. It was difficult to imagine a castle built up on the rocky summit, but there was one flatter area and if Elias had incorporated the rock formations to make his towers, I supposed it was possible.

Aaron, however, was right; there currently was nothing up there but weeds and rocks.

“Yea, but have you ever been there during a thunderstorm?” Billy asked.

“Well of course not, that would just be stupid; it’s the highest point in town.” Replied Aaron.

“So you don’t know shit.” Billy snapped. “My brother swears it’s real; he and his friends went up the hill during the last storm and saw it with their own eyes. They even said there was light coming from a window in the tallest tower and they could see the dark outline of a man staring down at them…

“Elias is still in there.” Billy had again dropped into his creepiest whisper. “And the scariest part is, they all said they could hear the house calling to them, beckoning them to come in. They had to drag each other away and ran all the way back home.”

“Sounds like he’s fucking with you dude—trying to get you to go up there yourself and get soaked.” Aaron snickered.

Billy was getting more annoyed by the minute. “He is not! He even warned me to never go looking for the castle and made me promise that I wouldn’t. He just wanted me to know in case someone else tried to convince me to go see it with them because of how stupid and dangerous it is—especially given they saw a literal demon. He was terrified when he was telling me about it.”

Obviously, as Aaron was alluding, The Lightning Castle sounded much more like a myth or a prank than a real place, but I knew Billy’s brother, Mark. Their dad had passed away from cancer several years earlier and Mark had taken on the role of father-figure to Billy; always watching out for him. It seemed unlikely that he would pull a dangerous prank on Billy and try to trick him into walking up a hill in a thunderstorm.

“Whatever man. I still think it’s a load of crap, but you believe what you want. I’m out.” Aaron walked away, as did the others, but I remained with Billy.

“You believe me, don’t you?” He asked.

I still wasn’t sure, so I said, “I dunno…but I don’t know why Mark would lie to you about that, so it sounds like he at least saw something. At any rate, we’ll never know for sure because you promised you wouldn’t go up there, and I’m not about to risk getting electrocuted to see a Hell castle.”

“You’re right, I did promise him I wouldn’t go looking for the castle…but I also had my fingers crossed behind my back when I did…so…” Billy’s expression turned mischievous.

“Dude, no!” I gave him a stern look. “If something happens to you…think about Mark; think about your mom!”

Billy rolled his eyes a little now. “Oh, come on, I’ll be fine! There’s a thunderstorm forecast for tonight and I just want to go get a quick look. Mark and his friends were okay—as soon as I see it, I’ll run like hell.”

“Billy, it’s way too dangerous, especially by yourself! Even if there isn’t a demon castle, you could get struck by lightning or hit with hail or something. I want you to promise me now that you won’t go up that hill tonight. And hands out front when you do it!”

He relented. With a dramatic sigh, he held his hands out in front of his body and said, “I promise I won’t go up Shepherd’s Hill tonight looking for The Lightning Castle.”

While he said the words, his tone was less than convincing, but I decided not to press him on it.

“Good. That’s the bell, we should head back inside.” And we returned to class, Billy looking defeated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The rest of the day passed without further discussion of The Lightning Castle or anything else of note really—other than the mountain of homework we received. By the time I got home and was buried into my third hour of assignments, I’d forgotten all about Billy’s story—until I heard a low rumble.

Thunder.

A storm was coming in; I looked out the window and saw a few quick flashes of light. My mind immediately drifted to Elias’ evil experiments and a chill ran up my spine. I tried to keep my imagination from drifting to what he might have done to those poor people as the storm intensified.

BOOM

A huge crash of thunder shook the whole house. Thinking now of Billy, I imagined how insane it would be to be up near the top of a rocky hill in this weather and prayed that his promise to me would be enough to keep him away. Yet, I had a sinking sensation in my stomach that he’d only made that promise to shut me up and had no intention of keeping it.

I had a sleepless night while the storm raged outside. Our parents hadn’t gotten either of us cellphones yet, so I couldn’t text him to check in. I just kept repeating to myself over and over again that Billy was going to be fine and that I’d see him in school in the morning.

But, the next morning, while I was eating my cereal, my mom got a call.

It was Mark—Billy was missing.

My stomach dropped through the floor as my mom handed me the phone.

“Hey Shane, did Billy sneak over to your place last night and sleep over?” I could hear the anxiety in his voice.

“No, I haven’t seen him since school yesterday. Why, what happened?” My voice shook with the question.

“Last night, I said goodnight to Billy just before that big storm rolled in. He was working on homework in his room and said he was going to turn-in soon as well. Then, this morning, when I went to get him up for school, he was just gone! I’m hoping he just snuck out and fell asleep at one of his friend’s houses. Is there a girl he’s been talking to maybe or did he say anything to you about where he might be going last night? Mom and I are calling everyone we can think of to see if anyone has seen or heard from him.”

I hesitated. I had a strong suspicion that Billy had gone to Shepherd’s Hill during the storm, but it had been Mark that told him about The Lightning Castle. If Billy had gone to the hill and he’d gotten hurt…or worse…it would kill Mark. But I pictured Billy at the bottom of the hill with a broken leg, having slipped off the path in the rain and tumbled down. He might be desperately in need of help, and I knew I had to tell Mark my concern.

“Mark, Billy told us yesterday about The Lightning Castle and he was talking about going there in the storm last night. Now, I made him promise me that he wouldn’t do it, but you know how he is when he wants to do something…nothing is going to stand in his way.” I blurted.

“Oh no…oh no, fuck no!” I’d never heard such desperation in a man’s voice before.

“I’m sorry, Mar…” The call ended; he hung up before I could finish.

My mom now looked at me with grave concern and I broke down and explained everything. She’d lived in the area her entire life and I learned she knew well of The Lightning Castle.

“That stupid prank…people get hurt every year trying to see that damn castle; it’s a myth! One kid actually got struck by lightning and died when I was in high school and I thought that’d stop people going up there, but I guess it still happens…I hope he’s okay.” She got up quickly from the table and grabbed her keys.

“Come on, we’re going to go look for him; I’ll call the school and let them know what happened.” She motioned for me to follow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They found Billy’s bike in the parking lot, but that was it. An entire search party was put together and we combed every inch of Shepherd’s Hill and the surrounding areas, but not a single other trace of Billy was found. It was as if he’d simply vanished into thin air—he left no note, no one had heard anything else from him or seen him since Mark went to bed that night; he was just gone.

With no evidence to go on, law enforcement simply classified him as a missing person, but different theories sprung up around town as to what might have happened to him. Some postulated that someone had picked him up in the parking lot either voluntarily or involuntarily. Others believed he’d been abducted by aliens. Yet, none were quite as popular as the theory that the castle took him. That was the one that I began to believe; even more so because of the dreams.

It took me several days to fall asleep after Billy vanished, and when I finally did, I only found nightmares. So clearly, I could see them. Billy, strapped to a table, a dark shadow of a man looming over him. Maniacal laughter, the sounds of electricity crackling through the air, and pain. Nauseating, crippling, bone shattering pain. Billy’s screams always echoing in my ears when I awoke.

At first, I chalked them up to the guilt I felt for not telling anyone that I was worried Billy might go out in that storm, but they were so vivid I began to wonder if they might really be cries for help. Billy reaching out from wherever he was now, begging for someone to save him.

I became more convinced that this was true when I realized that Mark was having them too.

He spent every free minute he had standing on that hill, screaming at Elias to give his brother back. “Where are you, you bastard, show yourself! I know you have him! I see what you’re doing to him in my dreams! Give him back! Take me instead!” He alternated between burning fury and weeping grief, begging for a storm to make the castle appear—but the sky refused his pleas.

Months it went without a single flash of lightning, and Mark’s screaming became more and more slurred. He was underaged, but it seemed everyone had collectively decided to turn a blind-eye to his drinking, even his own mom. Letting him numb the pain a bit seemed a mercy, especially as it afforded him a few hours of dreamless sleep, free of his brother’s tortured wailing.

Unfortunately, no one noticed he was turning to harder substances to keep the nightmares at bay, and four months after Billy disappeared, Mark OD’d right there on Shepherd’s Hill.

After he died, his mom had a total mental breakdown. She’d lost her husband and now both of her sons in the span of a few years; her mind simply couldn’t handle that level of grief. She became completely catatonic and had to be taken to a fulltime care facility.

Then, the mayor had the trail up to the top of Shepherd’s Hill closed and hired round-the-clock security to keep watch on it. He said too many injuries and deaths had taken place there over the years—safest if no one was allowed up. And with that, life for most of the residents in the town began to go back to normal. Billy’s story began to fade from their minds and talk of The Lightning Castle diminished. With no new developments or evidence to go on, people simply moved on.

Six months later, a man was arrested one town over who had the bodies of several boys buried in his backyard and Billy’s story came up again. While Billy’s body wasn’t found on the property, he was in the same age range as the other victims they uncovered. For many, that was enough to call the case closed, even though the man was shown photos of Billy and he said that he hadn’t taken him. People wanted closure, and that became the narrative around the town. Billy had been abducted not by a castle or a ghost, but by a man. An evil, human man.

I even let myself start to believe it—I had to; because the dreams never stopped. If I let any part of me think that something else had happened to Billy, that he was truly still in The Lightning Castle, I would have gone crazy.

Every night, I would hear Billy’s torture, and every morning I awoke to the screams reverberating in my ears. Like Mark, I turned to drugs to quell the nightmares, but mine were of the prescription variety. I got into therapy and received medication for anxiety and insomnia, which allowed me to sleep most nights and keep my sanity intact. Yet, some nights…stormy nights…Billy broke through my medically induced comas; his screaming so loud it threatened to burst my eardrums. I’d awake in a cold sweat with a pang of guilt for working so hard to drown him out.

So, when I turned eighteen, I moved across the country, thinking that getting some distance between me and the town might help. To a degree, it worked. Billy would still wake me up some nights, but he wasn’t quite as loud and was much less vivid. I got in the habit of checking the weather forecast for my hometown before bed, and if there were storms, I’d take a double-dose of my medication and could usually get through to the morning.

One such night, I saw there was a severe thunderstorm warning for the town and worried it might be a particularly bad night. So, I popped my pills and put my head on the pillow, hoping for darkness until the sun came up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“FUCKKKKK!!!!!!! STOPPPP, PLEASE STOPPPP!!!!”

I was back in the torture chamber.

Billy was in the worst anguish I’d ever witnessed, and Elias wasn’t just a dark shadow this time. I could make out his features—his wicked smile; his cold, black eyes.

His laughter was as deafening as Billy’s screaming; my ears were splitting, but I didn’t wake up and for the first time, I heard Elias speak.

*“I can’t stop now, boy, we’re nearly there! Just one more big jolt! Here it comes!!!”*

I heard a powerful crackle of electricity and lighting jumped through various instruments. Billy convulsed terribly and let out the loudest cry I’d ever heard as his skin began to turn red and smoke. I screamed now too, and when I did, Elias looked straight at me with those black eyes. Somehow, he knew I was there and he smiled that wicked smile—his teeth sharp as daggers.

That was when I finally woke up. My ears were ringing when I snapped upright in bed, completely drenched in sweat and hyperventilating. I sprinted to the restroom immediately and vomited profusely. When I finished, I slumped against the bathroom wall and sobbed into my hands.

“It was just a dream.” I repeated for the hundredth time. “You caused it because you saw the severe storms coming in tonight. You got your brain all worked up and it made it worse this time.”

I was able to talk myself down eventually and laid back in bed, expecting to be up all night as I’d just likely vomited up most of my medication and I was terrified of what I might see when I shut my eyes. However, astonishingly, I felt exhausted. More tired than I remembered feeling in years and the next thing I knew, it was morning. Billy hadn’t returned…I’d slept clean through the night. What’s more, I felt different—like an oppressive weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

That was the last time I ever saw Billy. I slowly weened myself off my medications, expecting at some point that he’d come back, but he never did. Six years, six months, and six days to the night Billy went missing, he vanished from my dreams. I was free; somehow, I’d finally snapped out of it. At least, that’s what I told myself…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was ten years ago. Ten years since I heard Billy for the last time.

I still thought of him most days, it’s what kept me from ever going back; I was terrified that if I returned to where it all happened, the nightmares would start again. My parents understood, they knew the trauma I’d gone through and just came to visit me instead.

That is, until my mom got sick. The doctors recommended she didn’t travel long distances, and so, I decided to drive home for her birthday—maybe her last one.

As I drove into town, I passed right by Shepherd’s Hill and, to my surprise, I saw some hikers going up the side. They must have reopened the trail at some point—maybe they ran out of funds for the security, or maybe they just thought it was time to move on. I followed the path up the hill with my eyes to the very top.

My blood froze.

At the summit stood a young boy, staring down at me. He was too far away to make out distinguishing features, but the clothes looked so familiar; an outfit I’d seen so many times in dreams.

“Billy…?” I mouthed.

The car started to jump violently and I quickly looked back at the road to realize I was only halfway on it. I’d drifted off into the grass and had to whip myself back into the lane. When I’d corrected the vehicle, I looked back up to the top of Shepherd’s Hill, to see that the boy was gone. Or had he really been there in the first place? I wondered. It had been a long drive and I was tired. Coming back to the town was bound to bring up some bad memories.

I chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me and made it to my parents’ house without further incident.

We visited for a few hours as night fell, but my mom tired out pretty early. I was exhausted as well from the drive, so before long, I found myself lying in bed in my childhood room. And, as I shut my eyes, I heard a distant rumble.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*“Shane.”* A low whisper permeated my dreams.

*“Shane, wake up.”*

I opened my eyes to find two staring back at me, inches from my face.

I nearly screamed, but I stifled it, not wanting to wake my sick mother. Instead, I backed my as far back into the corner of the bed as I could go and covered my mouth with my hand. Pinning myself against the wall, a flash of lightning illuminated my intruder.

It was Billy.

He looked exactly the same as the last time I saw him on the playground—wearing that same outfit from my nightmares.

*“Hey Shane, been a long time.”* His voice came from the darkness.

I was paralyzed with fear. There was no way it could be real, I was either still asleep, or hallucinating very badly. I had to be. Yet, another flash of lightning came and there he still was, as solid and real as any boy I’d ever seen.

*“Shane, we have to go.”*

“What? No, you’re not real. This is a dream.” I whispered back.

*“It’s not a dream, Shane. I tried to show you for years, but you never came. You ran away! I’m still stuck in that castle and I need your help.” I detected a hint of anger in his whispers.*

“No, no, no, no, no. You’re a hallucination! My mind is playing tricks on me. You were kidnapped and murdered. You’re dead!” I tried to rationalize with him—with myself.

*“Do I look dead? I wasn’t kidnapped. I’m telling you; I’m still trapped in that castle and we have to go, now. We don’t have much time; the storm is moving quickly.”*

“You’re not trapped in the castle, you’re right here!”

*“I’m not really here; I can project myself during a storm, but my body is still up in the castle. You can save me! Elias is working on someone else tonight; I’ll guide you right to my body once we’re inside, and you can take me out. Please Shane. It’s been years. I don’t age, I don’t sleep, I don’t eat. All I know is prison and torture. Please!”*

Another flash lit the room, and I saw the face of my old friend. The boy I grew up with, laughed with, got in trouble with. He really had been trapped in the castle all those years, and I’d abandoned him. Something told me that I finally needed to answer his call for help.

“O…Okay Billy. I’ll go with you. Let’s get you home.”

*“Excellent. Get a flashlight, and meet me at the hill.”*

Another flash revealed that he was gone.  The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, but still I got up and crept as quietly as I could through my parents’ house. My dad had always kept a flashlight under the sink in case of a power outage, and I found one there. Borrowing his raincoat on the way out the door too, I stepped into the howling wind and made my way to my car.

The entire drive over, I kept thinking to myself that I might be going crazy and actually hoping that that was the case. Hallucinations might be treatable, but if what was happening was real…

By the time I pulled into the parking lot for Shepherd’s Hill, the storm was raging. I breathed a small sigh of relief when I parked as I hadn’t seen any sign of Billy when I pulled in. Maybe it was all in my head…

“SHIT!”

Lightning struck nearby—Billy’s face was right next to the driver’s side window.

*“Come on.”* He mouthed, and I got out of the car.

*“This way.”*

I clicked on the flashlight and followed him to the trailhead. As he said he was a projection, I expected the beam to pass right through him, but I found the light hit his back and he cast a shadow just as if he were a real boy there with me. Odder still, he was completely dry and the rain seemed to be going around him, rather than through him. Something seemed off…I paused just before starting the ascent.

*“What are you doing? We don’t have time for this, the storm is almost past us!”*

He looked genuinely desperate.

“Sorry—right behind you.” I’d come this far and I wanted to help Billy; with no real idea of how any of this should work, I pushed down my concerns, and moved forward.

The trail was slick and the rain was driving in the powerful wind. I could barely see a couple feet in front of me and stumbled several times on the way up. Thunder boomed in my ears the entire journey, so loudly that I was certain lightning was striking dangerously close. Every once in a while, I’d check ahead and could still see Billy in the light; gesturing for me to move quicker.

Just before the top, he stopped and I paused next to him. I was about to ask him what we were doing, when a huge flash lit the sky.

Lightning screamed down from the heavens and struck the rod on the tower of a castle that had suddenly appeared before us. Three stone towers rose off a central keep, built straight on top of the rocks that formed the summit of Shepherd’s Hill. It was magnificent and terrifying at the same time.

Near the top of the tallest tower, I could see light. A window was illuminated, and I swore I saw a black shadow standing in it, but in an instant, it was gone.

“Fuck, Billy, I think I saw Elias. He might be watching us.”

*“I don’t see him. Don’t worry. He’s distracted, just like I said. I’ll tell you exactly where to go. We’re nearly there, just go open the door, we need to hurry.”*

The wind was starting to die down and I wasn’t sure how long the castle would remain if the storm passed. I began to walk towards the door and as I got closer, I heard more whispers. Not Billy this time, several different voices.

*“That’s it.”*

*“Nearly there.”*

*“Come in.”*

*“Join us.”*

The castle itself was calling to me, inviting me in. The strangest sensation came over me the closer I got. I wanted to go in; not to rescue Billy now, but join the rest of the voices inside.

I put my hand on the handle.

*“Good, now just open it.”* Billy’s voice came from behind me, but something sounded different. It was like there were two voices laid on top of one another. Billy’s, and a low growl of some kind. I looked back at him just before I was going to pull the door open.

Lightning lit his face once more and I saw it.

His eyes were black. He smiled at me with teeth like razors, just like Elias had in my dream, and my mind snapped back to reality.

This wasn’t my friend. My friend was long gone. Elias’ words played back in my head, “We’re nearly there! Just one more big jolt!”

That’s why Billy had stopped coming to my dreams. He wasn’t Billy anymore; Elias had made him into some sort of demon, just like him. And now, I was in danger of becoming one too.

I let go of the handle and turned to face “Billy.”

*“What are you doing? Go inside!”* He hissed.

Without thinking, I sprinted past him as fast as I could, but he grabbed my arm as I went by. His fingers seared through the raincoat and burned into my flesh. For a young boy, he was absurdly strong and held me in place briefly, but I felt his grip begin to weaken after a few seconds and I managed to pull away.

The rain was letting up and I ran like hell.

*“No!”* I heard softly behind me, like it was fading away, but I didn’t look back. The storm had passed and I thought the castle might be gone, but I wasn’t going to slow down to find out.

I moved as quickly as I could back to my car and sped all the way back to my parents’.  As soon as I got through the front door, I checked the forecast for the next few days. Luckily, no storms were showing and I felt I could finish my visit for my mom’s birthday at least; if only with me on edge the entire time fearing I might hear a rumble of thunder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But we did get to celebrate in peace. The weather held, and I got to wish my mom a Happy Birthday—likely for the last time. I had decided not to tell my parents what happened that first night I was in town as I didn’t want to spoil the festivities; hiding my dad’s raincoat under my bed, and wearing long sleeves to cover the burns on my arm.

However, before I left, I knew I’d need to tell them something, if only to protect them. So, as I packed, I called my dad into my room to give him back his raincoat.

“Dad, I’m sorry, but I borrowed this on the first night I was here, and it got a little burnt. I ordered you a new one online and it should be here tomorrow.” I showed him the sleeve.

“What the hell? You went out in that storm? What happened?” He asked.

“I’m not sure I can explain it exactly, but…just…if you see Billy, don’t follow him. You or mom, tell her too.” I knew I must have sounded crazy, but my dad’s expression wasn’t one of confusion; it was fear.

He hesitated for a second before replying.

“I thought I was imagining him all these years…”
