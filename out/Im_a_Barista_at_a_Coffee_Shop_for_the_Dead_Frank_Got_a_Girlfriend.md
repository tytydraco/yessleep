Yep, this is going to be a Frank segment. It’s his time to shine, and as much as it pains me to tell this story, I don’t think I can leave it out. So, here it goes.

In case you’ve forgotten, Frank is the biker with the gnarly road rash seared into his face. Aside from Nona, he’s the only other person who comes in literally every day. Honestly, he’s not my favorite, but all things considered, Frank isn’t that bad. Don’t get me wrong, I like the guy. He seems like a decent person. He’s just really, really… corny.

I think what gets on my nerves the most about him is his dad jokes. I’m all for a good dad joke every once in a while. Aren’t we all? But believe me, Frank’s jokes are far from good. He cycles through the same ones over and over again like a broken record. Ugh. It gets my blood boiling just thinking about it. Okay, sorry for ranting. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. On to the story.

I was around six months into working at Aftermath when this occurred. I wasn’t really a newbie anymore, and I was seasoned enough to notice when something seemed off. It was Steven who pointed it out, though.

“Hey Calla, have you seen Frank lately? I think it’s like three days since he’s been in,” Steven said while wiping the counter.

“No, come to think of it, I haven’t seen him in a while either. Maybe - hopefully, his time is up. I mean, people come and go all the time, don’t they?”

“Yeah, maybe you’re right. Frank doesn’t seem like a bad guy. His time must have been pretty short,” Steven mumbled, averting his gaze.

“Hey, cheer up. I’m sure that you don’t have much longer. You’re a great person in my eyes,” I reassured him, shooting him a grin.

“I’m glad at least someone thinks so.”

I didn’t even have time to respond, because a customer shoved open the door before I could. I’ll give you one guess as to who it was. Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner! Yep, it was Frank.

*Speak of the fucking devil.*

It was like we’d summoned the smug son-of-a-bitch just by saying his name. Normally, I’d roll my eyes and start whipping up his usual espresso. But that day was different. Because Frank wasn’t alone.

He waltzed through the doorway with his arm wrapped around a gorgeous brunette. And when I say gorgeous, I mean *gorgeous*. Seriously, she looked like she stepped straight out of a magazine. Lush, wavy hair cascaded down her back. Long, slender legs protruded from a short pencil skirt. Beautiful, deep blue eyes peered around the shop, shimmering like the ocean. And on top of that, the girls weren’t shy either, if you know what I mean.

I don’t swing that way, but I found myself drooling over the enchantress. This had to be some kind of joke, right? Frank is no spring chicken, and this lady was a solid fifteen out of ten on the hotness scale. There was no way he could pull a bombshell like her… could he?

Frank let go of the girl, and lowered his shades - something else that was completely new - to make eye contact with her.

“Go find yourself a seat, babe. I’ll get us something good.”

She nodded, surveying the room. The woman took one look at Nona and shuddered. She plopped down at the table furthest from him, which coincidentally is Frank’s regular spot. Can’t say I blame her. Nona is fucking terrifying.

Frank sauntered up to the counter with more swagger than I knew he possessed. Even then, he had a big, goofy grin plastered across his face. I’ve always liked that about Frank. Most days, he seems pretty content with life - or, afterlife, I guess.

“Oooh, Frank, I’m impressed. Cute little lady friend ya got there. Where’d you meet her?”

“Oh, ya know. Out. Not too shabby, huh? I may not be as young as I used to be, but I still got it,” he smirked, glancing at the stunning woman sitting in his normal seat.

“I’ll give it to you. You did good. So, what’ll it be, hotshot? A couple of blonde espressos?”

“She’ll have a blonde espresso. I’ll take a black coffee.” I stared at him, eyes narrowed.

“Frank. You don’t have to get a black coffee to impress her. She won’t think any less of you for getting your regular order.”

Frank sighed, his expression faltering.

“Calla, can you just get me the black coffee? This is the first girlfriend I’ve had in a while, and I really don’t want her to think I’m a wimp.”

Wait. Hold the phone. Did he say *girlfriend*? If I’d been drinking something, I would’ve spat it out. This was the first time I’d seen this woman and those two were already official? The dead don’t waste any time, huh?

“Frank, how long have you been seeing this girl? Where’d you meet? What’s her name? I want all the details. Spill it, mister.” That familiar grin returned to his lips.

“Most days you won’t even crack a smile, but I get a girl and suddenly you’re all ears. I see how it is, Calla.”

“Well, duh. You were gone for three whole days and now you come in with a *girlfriend*? No shit I’m gonna want to hear about her.”

Frank chuckled. “Well, alright. I’ll come in some other time and fill you in. Don’t want to keep her waiting. Deal?”

“Sure thing, buddy. Go take a seat. I’ll bring your drinks right out. Oh, and Frank. I’m proud of you,” I said, shooting him a soft smile. For a second, I thought I could see a tear forming behind his sunglasses.

“That means a lot, Calla. It really does. Thank you.”

As Frank took his seat opposite from his supermodel girlfriend, Ivan’s door creaked open. Right. On. Cue. Of course. I’d be damned if I was going to let that horny bastard ruin Frank’s chances with this girl.

Ivan licked his palm and slicked back his hair. He swept a few crumbs from his dingy white beater before sauntering up to me and Steven. Gross.

“How do I look?” he said, shooting me a wide grin. He had lettuce caught in his teeth, but I wasn’t going to tell him that.

“Disgusting, as per usual. Where do you think you’re going?”

“I am going to become acquainted with pretty lady.”

“Oh, no the fuck you’re not. You will not go anywhere near that girl. Do you understand me?” I seethed angrily, jabbing a finger toward his chest. “This is probably the only woman Frank has ever managed to date, and you will *not* screw this up for him. Got it?”

“This is no way to speak to your boss,” Ivan sneered.

“Oh yeah? Well, *this* is no way to treat a loyal customer.”

“Fine. I will not interfere. You are buzzkill, Calla.”

“So I’ve heard,” I said as Ivan slunk back to his office.

“Great job on damage control. I’ll make sure that he doesn’t try anything if you’re not around,” Steven said, flashing me a thumbs up.

“Thanks. The last thing we need is that rat bastard sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong.”

Frank and his new lover started coming in regularly. It took about five days before Frank switched back to his usual order. I guess he couldn’t handle the plain coffee anymore. I was happy for him. I really was. But although he wore a genuine smile whenever he was with her, I couldn’t help feeling like Frank’s new girl was hiding something.

Why did I think that, you might ask? Well, to be quite honest, it was the way she looked at Nona. He was no stranger to the normal mean mug stares from other patrons, but this woman didn’t just scowl at him. She’d look almost disappointed every time she’d spot Nona in his seat. Like she was *really* hoping he wouldn’t be there. The whole thing felt strange to me. I needed to know if my concerns were justified.

“Hey Steven?” I whispered after tending to a customer.

“What’s up?”

“Have you noticed anything… off about Frank’s new girlfriend? I feel like she’s up to something.”

Steven’s brows furrowed in confusion. “Nope. I’ll be sure to keep an eye out, though. Why do you ask?”

“Oh, just a feeling. It’s probably nothing. It is that time of the month for me,” I said, pursing my lips.

“Woah! Hold it right there, cowgirl. T-M-I.”

“Whoops. My bad.”

I watched the pair like a hawk after that. Well, as discreetly as I could, at least. Oh, and by the way, Frank never stopped by to fill me in on all the juicy details. Was I a little pissed at him for that? Duh. But honestly, I couldn’t stay mad at him. He looked truly happy for the first time since I’d started working at Aftermath.

Nona was gone when it happened. It was strange to see his table empty, but it did happen every once in a while. I guess even he has matters to attend to every now and then.

It was only Steven and me in the shop. Frank and his girlfriend, whose name I’d learned was Kara, shuffled through the door. Kara’s eyes lit up when she noticed that Nona was gone. An uneasy feeling twisted in my gut when I saw that.

“Calla, can I get the usual?” Frank shouted, waving to me as he headed to his spot.

“Sure thing. Coming right up.”

I began preparing Frank’s order, but I didn’t have a chance to finish it. Because a nauseating, sickly-sweet aroma began wafting throughout the shop before I could. It wasn’t like anything I’d ever smelled before. If I had to put a finger on it, I’d say it was like someone had mixed a high-end perfume with sulfur. Sweet with a putrid scent lurking just below the surface.

It took me a moment to notice that I was paralyzed. I couldn’t move a muscle. Fear coursed through my veins like venom. What the hell was going on?

Blood pounded in my ears as I watched Kara stand from her seat. She was grinning from ear-to-ear like a child on Christmas day. The smell grew stronger the closer she got. That evil bitch. I knew there was something wrong about her.

My eyes darted from side to side, searching desperately for anything that might be able to help me. That’s when I noticed Steven out of my periphery. I couldn’t be sure, but I thought I noticed him wink at me.

Kara sashayed up to the counter, leaving Frank alone at his booth to helplessly watch the entire thing. Poor guy. He’d been used. My heart shattered for him. Frank might not be the most perceptive dude out there, but he didn’t deserve that.

“Hello, um, Calla,” Kara said, squinting to read my nametag. I stared blankly at her in response.

“Ha. How inconsiderate of me. You couldn’t respond if you wanted to.”

*Yeah no shit, lady.*

“I’m sure that you’re wondering why I’m doing this. Well, long story short, you could be a very valuable asset to me. A live girl who can mingle with the dead? You will make a great… translator of sorts. I knew that you wouldn’t willingly work for a demon, and there’s no way that thing would have allowed me to take you. So, this was my safest option,” Kara said, making her way behind the counter.

Shit, shit, SHIT. This was not good. Nona was missing, everyone was frozen, and I had no way to defend myself.

*Yep, this is it. I’m doomed.*

My heart pounded against my chest like a jackhammer as Kara whispered into my ear. “You’re going to make a wonderful pet.”

I clenched my eyes shut. This couldn’t be happening. I was going into shock. Then, I suddenly felt something warm spray the back of my neck.

I opened my eyes. The smell was dissipating and I was beginning to regain mobility of my limbs. I slowly turned my head. My eyes grew wide as saucers when I drank in the scene before me.

Steven was holding a bloody knife. Kara writhed on the ground, desperately trying to stop the bleeding, to no avail. She had a deep laceration on her neck. I watched in horror as dark black blood pooled around her body. That was the first time I’d seen the light snuffed out of someone’s eyes. That’s something that I hope I never have to bear witness to again.

Once her body stilled, I glanced up at Steven. He looked completely out of it. Like he’d never expected to have to do something so heinous. But eventually, he noticed my stare and abruptly snapped out of it.

“Her power didn’t work on me. I can’t smell.”

The shop closed early that day. Ivan called to have the “cleaning service” take care of the body. Fortunately, they were able to squeeze us in the same day. I was in a state of shock, but Steven had it worse than me. He actually had to murder someone to save us. That would take a toll on anyone, living or dead.

Frank, Steven, and I were sitting at his favorite booth waiting for the cleaning crew to finish up. Of course, Ivan had a “problem” to take care of at the worst possible time, so he left me and Steven to close up shop. Fucking asshole. Way to treat your employees.

“Guys, I know I’ve said it before, but I’m so sorry. I never would’ve guessed that Kara was a demon - if that’s even her real name. I should’ve known, though. No woman that hot would ever date a loser like me,” Frank said, breaking our tense silence.

“Hey, don’t talk like that. You had no way of knowing. And you’re not a loser. You’re a cornball, but you’re no loser,” I said, flashing him a soft smile.

“Thanks, Calla. That’s nice of you to say.” A weak grin began to tug at the corners of his lips. What a shitty situation.

The cleanup crew waved to us as they carried the body bag out the door. Frank and I returned the gesture. Steven didn’t even look up.

“Well. I guess I’m gonna split. Got a lot to think about. Are you two going to be okay?” Frank asked, standing to leave.

“Yeah. We’ll be fine… eventually. See ya later, Frank.”

“Bye Calla. Bye Stevo.”

“I’m gonna mop the floor before we go. I won’t leave you here. Take as long as you need.” I started to stand, but Steven’s finger’s suddenly wrapped around my wrist.

“Calla, wait. There’s something I need to tell you” he muttered, glancing up at me. Tears were brimming at the corners of his eyes. My heart dropped into my stomach. This was really getting to him. I quietly returned to my seat and Steven released his grip.

“Do you remember when you asked why I was here? In the in-between?”

“Vaguely, I think,” I squeaked, eagerly awaiting his reply.

“Well, all this has gotten me thinking. I’ve decided that I’m finally ready to tell you.”

“Steven, you don’t have to. I’m fine with no-”

“No. I need to get this off my chest. I’ve been carrying this around for too long. I have to tell someone,” he said. I nodded, motioning for him to continue.

“So, I’m sure that you might have put the pieces together based on my lack of physical injuries… It’s fucked up, you know. The dead have to wear what we die in forever. We can take it off, but it’ll just appear right back on our bodies the second we do. That’s why I’ve always worn this black long sleeve shirt under my uniform. It’s what I died in. I always wore long sleeves, even in the Summer. And this is why,” Steven said, rolling up the sleeve over his left arm.

His skin was racked with track marks. Angry, red sores glared back at me. My mouth fell open. It was all starting to make sense.

“I was a junkie. I’d do anything for a fix. And I mean *anything*. I’ve sold my body, pawned stolen items, conned people out of money. All to get high. But the worst thing I’ve ever done - what cemented my place here - it…” Steven trailed off, choking back tears. I placed a hand on his shoulder.

“It’s okay. You don’t need to tell me if you’re not comfortable with it.”

“But I do. J-just give me a second. I can do this.” He took a long, deep breath. With his nerves in check, he continued.

“One night, I was high as per usual, but I wanted more. I was already so fucked up that I didn’t know where I was, but I was feening. So I found a random house at the end of a cul de sac. It seemed familiar, but I didn’t pay that any mind. I peered in the window. I could only see a woman sitting in an armchair watching TV. An easy target. So I smashed the window and climbed in. She wasn’t scared, though. And that pissed me off. The woman was talking to me, trying to calm me down. But I was so screwed up that I couldn’t hear what she was saying.” He paused, steadying himself.

I could tell that this was taking a toll on him. I felt like I wasn’t supposed to hear this, but I couldn’t just walk away. I had to listen.

“I couldn’t hear what she was saying. Maybe if I had, I wouldn’t be here right now. But I wanted drugs. And this woman had money to buy them. I’ll never forget the look on her face when I shot her. Her eyes were so sad. So disappointed. And that’s when I recognized her. I betrayed her. How could I do that to her? I couldn’t take the guilt. But I could take her money. As she bled out on the floor, I rummaged through her purse and took any cash I could find. Once I sobered up in the morning, the weight of my actions came crashing down on me. It was all too much. So, I overdosed. I failed her. Calla, I’m a monster. I deserve to be here. I killed my own fucking mother for a fix.”

He broke down, sobs wracking his body. I didn’t know what to think. Steven was such a kind person. How could he do something so… disgusting? No. That was in another lifetime. He was a new person now.

I wrapped my arms around the trembling boy before me. I held him like that for a long time. I felt like a mother consoling a child - and I had no earthly idea what to say. I just knew that I had to be there for him, no matter what it took.

Eventually, Steven’s cries died down. He glanced up at me through teary, empty eyes. I felt so horrible for him. He’d been through so much.

“You probably think I’m a terrible person now. I don’t blame you if you do,” Steven said, pulling away.

“Hey, I don’t think you’re a terrible person. In fact, I think you’re one of the most genuinely kind, caring people I’ve ever met. All that was in another life. You’ve learned from your experiences and used the pain that they caused to better yourself. I think your mom would be proud of the man you’ve become.”

Steven’s face contorted in confusion. Then, his visage melted into one of acceptance. He locked eyes with me, a renewed sense of determination sweeping across his countenance.

“Thank you, Calla. You don’t know how much that means. I really hope you’re [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/).”
