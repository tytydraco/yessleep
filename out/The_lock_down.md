A few years ago at my old high school when I was in my senior year, we had a lockdown.

But it was no normal lockdown, no the secrets and mysteries behind it will never be known. Not to me, not to you, not to anyone except the (I assume at least) scientists or government who unleashed that creature among us. 

See, my school was small. Unimportant, which is why I assume they picked us. I might not make it after this, after I tell this story. I was forced into silence I had to sign papers stating I’d never tell anyone, I don’t know why. I don’t know why they didn’t just finish me off.

It all started 3 years ago, my last year of high school, it was the last class of the day and everyone was looking forward to going home. That was until loud ringing abruptly started going off, it was the lock down sound.

We all thought it was a drill so we didn’t take it seriously. Laughing and goofing off with each other while the teacher tried to quiet us down.

We all froze when the sound of screaming came from outside the classroom.

Along with that a loud banging sound.

After the loud banging sound happened the screaming stopped.

‘Oh God’ was it not a drill? Was it real? Was that banging a gunshot? What do we do? 

The only thing I felt was fear, and I could tell by looking around that everyone else was scared to

It wasn’t even a minute later before a sound like a door being tore off its hinges came, then a second later screams. 

Some girls in the class were crying, some guys were panicking. Our teacher was yelling something about barricading the door.

Some of my classmates grabbed some desks and threw them against the door, I could hear people outside the door running and screaming and sometimes a squish noise before the screams get quieter.

Eventually the screams stopped, I gasped as I looked at the door. There was red pooling through the crack at the bottom of the door.

I’ll admit I felt tears falling down my face, everything was quiet. No screams no nothing.

Then, a knock at the door. A small one, polite. At first I wondered if it was a student trying to get in, but then another knock. Louder this time, then another even louder. Until eventually knocking turned into banging, strong banging. The whole door was shaking. I thought this was the end, that the door would be knocked down and we’d all die.

But, no. I heard someone scream outside the door before the banging abruptly stopped. I assumed that someone had accidentally walked this way and saw whatever it was banging on the door and couldn’t stop themselves from screaming.

Suddenly I heard running, fast. So fast, inhuman type of fast. Not even 3 seconds later there was a loud squish noise before the screaming stopped.

Then walking, normal this time. The walking stopped at what I assume was in front of our door.

Again, the same thing happened with the knocking. 

I jumped up and ran for the window, I could hear my teacher telling me to stop but there was no way I was going to die there. I opened the window just in time to hear the door being thrown to the ground. I jumped out, while the rest of the students screamed. I looked, it looked like a gorilla except it had abnormal things about it. Things I can’t place, not quite. Have you ever heard of uncanny valley? Something like that.

I watched as it squished- quite literally- each one of my classmates. It took less than 20 seconds for all 28 of my classmates to perish.

Then something I didn’t expect happened. 


The gorilla monster thing pulled out a walkie talkie, and preceded to talk into it.

“It’s done.” I heard, it was a deep voice unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. 

“Good, experiment 102, come back outside before your time is up.” I heard someone from the walkie talkie say.

It didn’t notice that I had escaped, which I thank god for everyday. 

I ran out, wondering what they meant. What had they meant by it being done? Had this been planned, had someone planned to kill a bunch of kids for no reason? 

I ran to the police that were outside the school not even considering that they were apart of it, they were surprised to see me I could tell by the way they acted.

There were a bunch of parents parked outside the school, worried because of the police car. I assume that’s why they let me live, because it would’ve been suspicious if I was announced dead after so many parents saw me clearly alive. 

Later I was asked what I saw, I told them everything because I still didn’t understand. Then a guy came in, he was dressed in a big white coat. Like a scientist. 

He made me sign papers saying that I could never tell anyone, but I’m done staying silent. I know what really happened that day, and it makes me wonder how many more times it’s happened.

That’s the truth, of what happened.
