There are places all over the world, where if you happen to make a wish at the right time, it will come true.

I stumbled into one of these places last New Year, just outside the back door of a seedy old downtown disco with a group of friends. I had stepped out of the crowded hot sweaty club for a breath of fresh air, and even though I knew they would be ringing in the New Year in a matter of minutes, I couldn’t force myself to go back in. I stood there, leaning against the wall, and thought about her- for months I had been unable to think of anything else.

And just on the stroke of 12, I groaned and loudly, from the bottom of my heart, asked for what I had been wishing for all these months - ever since I met her: that Camilla would fall in love with me.

It was pure coincidence that I was at that spot when I said those words. You have to believe me.

I got her text seconds after. “HAPPY NY!!” embellished with five red heart emojis. I felt a sense of shock. Camilla had never texted me anything personal during the time I had known her, and certainly nothing with red hearts.

But soon delight overcame the shock, as I texted back and we flowed into a natural beautiful conversation which ended with arranging for our first date.

By February, she had moved in with me, breaking her lease to do so. I had been delirious with joy. My love for her did not lessen an iota and she seemed to reciprocate just as passionately. Our friends were first stunned at this rapidly blooming relationship, but we both looked happy and everyone accepted her decision to be with me.

It sounds crazy when I type it out like this, but I knew it was from the wishing place, behind the old disco.

A year passed, a year full of joy for me, and now we were at the same disco again.

I looked at Camilla’s beautiful face, lit up by the flashing disco lights.

She gripped my arm. “Nick- it’s almost midnight.”

I hesitated and she frowned. “You promised me!” she yelled in the thumping music.

Feeling like a condemned man, we started walking towards the back entrance- my heart flopping about in my chest with misery.

Oh how could I have been so foolish. Because I had told her about the wish, and the place, just a few weeks ago.

Camilla didn’t deny or withdraw her love- it was too strong, I could feel it. But she became insistent, and she made me promise to take her there this New Year. She wanted a wish too.

I tried to cajole her into telling me what her wish was, but she wouldn’t. And she was so sweet and loving towards me that I soon gave up, melting into the bliss of being loved by her. After all, I didn’t really think everything between us, our relationship, our love was just based on some fantasy, how could I?

But now, as the minutes raced closer to midnight, dread filled me. “Camilla- please!” I begged as the thumping noise of the disco faded and we stepped outside. “Sweetheart, please tell me your wish!”

Camilla stopped just before the door, and drew me close to her. She kissed me deeply and I felt like a drowning man gasping for air. This was real, I told myself, willing myself to believe.

Then she opened the door and stepped out into the chilly night. The crowd behind us started chanting the countdown.

“Here?” she called.

I nodded miserably. How could I give her up? But maybe her wish had nothing to do with me. I remember thinking, maybe the force of our love would keep us bound together, as we had been throughout the past year, the most amazing year of life. Maybe she simply wanted to wish for a healthy life or success in her career or some shit like that.

“To the left a bit” I muttered and against my will, I positioned her on the exact spot where New Year wishes came true.

“*Seven… Six... Five*”

Camilla declared loudly:

“I wish to fall out of love with Nick, the man standing here beside me.”

Cheers erupted and fireworks lit the sky.

I covered my face with my hands, a sob escaping me. I could feel the shift in the air between us.

And so I didn’t see the flash of steel until it was too late- Camilla burying the sharp point of a knife deep into me with a soft grunt of fury.

As I slumped over, my life blood spurting out through my fingers onto the cold wet pavement I heard was her whispering so viciously I could barely recognize her voice, “You asshole! Die motherfucker! Burn in hell!”

As the sound of her heels faded away into the night, I groaned out a feeble wish to stay alive. But I’m pretty sure it was just pure luck that a second later, a couple stepped out, almost stumbling over me, and were able to save me, staunching the blood and calling for help. Luckily, the tip of Camilla’s blade just missed vital spots.

I never her saw again. Despite my recovery, I remain sickly, enfeebled, my days passing in a haze of regret and grief at losing love. I know the place won’t work for me again, and nor would I ever make such a wish even if it did.

This New Year I stayed alone, at home, staring outside the window at fireworks, listening to the joy of others, knowing that I might as well have died at her hands as I am nothing but a living corpse without Camilla and her love.
