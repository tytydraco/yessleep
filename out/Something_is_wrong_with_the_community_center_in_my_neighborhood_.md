5 months ago I dived headfirst into what up until recently, was the the most terrifying endeavor of my short life. 

I sold my house , left my steady job of 9 years and moved cross country with the love of my life to start a new. My world was small before her, 12-14 hour shifts at the paper mill, recovering my broken down body (that I couldn’t always tell was just in its 20’s) with miller light and first person shooters, paying my bills and keeping my head above water in the sun battered inland panhandle town i was born to die in. But then there was her, she was beautiful and unique and will always be more than i ever deserved. she had moved down for college, an endeavor that covid had brought to its knees like so many other things. we bonded over our stalled out lives and found love. 4 years later shes wearing my rainy day fund on her finger and were headed out west to her parents old home for a fresh start. 

I say “old home” but the place is wonderful, more than I ever dreamed of. Her parents are accomplished professionals and kept up with the place meticulously, it’s a little suburban slice of heaven hundreds of miles from the hurricanes and humidity of my hometown. 

Heaven for a man who didn’t always know he was in hell, or at least it seemed.

The neighborhood is nice, comfortable upper middle class, walking distance from yuppy vibrant downtown scene, tall oak trees and old ladies walking their boykin spaniels. And nestled in the middle of it all, a three minutes walk around the corner from our new home is something unseen in the mostly rural area i came from, the north side community center. 

A delightful little slice of the taxpayers dollar, a fenced in playground with slides and swings, basketball courts and a large building best resembling a primary school for random community events art classes ect. 

I didn’t think much of the place when I first saw it, it was foreign but friendly, largely inauspicious. Kids played, people worked there section of the community garden. I’d see these things on my regular walks around the neighborhood to stretch my legs and smile at there quaint normality. Then there was the lady in the trench coat. I overheard her on walk about month ago as i rounded the sidewalk out in front of the  place. She was SCREAMING, ear piercing cries of shrill anger and frustration out in front of the main building of the community center. Facing up into one of the second floor windows, I couldn’t make out all the words I’m not sure there was much there to be made since off. She had stopped me dead in my tracks, breaking the peace I was just beginning to be accustom to. I waited a moment unsure of what exactly i should do, she was obviously in distress. And judging by the state of her clothes and hair the giant coat on a 90 degree day, unhoused and mentally ill. 

I had heard before coming here that my new city had a large homeless population that sometimes caused some civil disturbances when someone was strung out or unmedicated living on the streets. So I immediately assumed this was my first encounter with such that I had been dreading. I have no personal issue with the down and out’s of our society but just like many I feel extremely uncomfortable around people such as terrible situation that I can’t help, or even worse could be harmed by. 

I ducked back around the corner quickly and pondered my options, I should just head home it’s right there? This isn’t anything I need to be involved in, this random person in my path is obviously unwell and could be anything from high on PCP to mentally unstable and carrying a 6 inch kitchen knife in the pocket of that giant coat. But her wailing was to much for me to ignore, she needed help, she could be dangerous. There’s a house right across the street that I’ve seen two children no younger than 5 playing outside of, something should be done. i peaked around the corner again, she was still stuck in the same cycle I had seen before, screaming unintelligibly up into that window.  I should have called the police but i knew that they weren’t always the best in these situations, dealing with the mentally ill and disenfranchised. I would walk up to her and try and make sense of the situation first, her screaming unnerved me but the closer i got the less of a physical threat she seemed. I had 6 inches and a hundred pounds on her atleast. 

Why haven’t any of these people living across the street so much as walked out into there yard?? I thought as i looked around cautiously making my approach. 

I was about 10 feet from her when i first attempted to speak to this hysterical stranger. “Mam?? Are you ok???” I tried to seem as calm and confident in the face of the situation that admittedly terrified Me. She glanced at me only a millisecond before turning her head back to the empty window and running to me like I had offered her a bottle of ice water in the middle of Death Valley. 

She gestured up the to the same window bony trembling hands, now at arms Length of me. 

“I didn’t take it” she said to me in a surprisingly normal volume. “I didn’t take it so they found me and took me” 

I wasn’t sure what to make of this, the window was empty, nothing to be seen but the vague outline of some houseplants stunning just inside its glow. 

“I don’t understand” I choked out, “do you need help?” 

She darted back to her original spot without much of a response, still screaming at the empty window I could make out more now of what exactly she was saying 

“I love god”

“It’s not fair”

“They took me”

At this point I was growing more terrified, time seemed to stop, no cars on the street, no people jogging, not even a stray squirrel. 

I noticed myself instinctively backing away, trying not to just bolt. Trying to come to some kind of logical end to this interaction but there was no use. She was back inches from my face before i could gather a thought. “They took me, and I loved god” she was holding onto my shirt now. Eyes to bloodshot eyes, the smell of her breath was sour and thick, I instinctively pushed her hands away but her grip was more than i could have imagined. I broke away somehow, not even noticing till I was clear on the other side of the building that my shirt was shredded. She followed me only to the corner, constantly glancing back to the front on the building like she was watching a pot inches from boiling over, before disappearing around the side wall back to where I had foolishly approached her. 

I made some more distance between us before i called the police. My Newly acquired front yard gave me a feeling of safety. My wife didn’t come out until the police car finally arrived, it felt like hours. She was understandably upset but my brain wasn’t able to process that I might have wanted to let her know what was going on. 

The conversation with the cops was repetitive and invasive. They combed over details of my account of what happened forward and backwards, I prayed i wasn’t to frazzled to keep my story straight.  They informed me that I lived in a very nice area but it wasn’t super uncommon for the unhoused to wander in. And my best bet is to avoid confrontation. 

They were gone in 30 minutes at best assuring me they’d do everything they can to find this unhinged woman that had terrified me out of my wits and ripped me out of my Zach Bryan T.  But I didn’t hold out much hope, she was long gone. Probably behind some 7/11 rambling her insanity’s by now. 

In the days that followed my anxiety was high, seeing the down on there luck men and women pushing there shopping carts, even from the safety of my wife’s car as we drove down the street filled me with a new kind of discomfort and terror.  

But time served to heal my nerves and soon I was enjoying my walks again and the peaceful neighborhood was back. I was granted definitely more vigilant and i still can’t bare the thought of weakening my alertness with headphones, but all in all things were back to normal by last week. 

It was then that a i knew what i know now to be either an awful truth or a symptom of my deteriorating mind.  

Something is wrong with that community center. 

It was about 2 am when our dog woke me and wife from a dead sleep. He needed outside, or our restful night was over. We begrudgingly rose up and through on some house clothes, I was fine with taking him myself but the wife insisted I not go alone, we toddled around the yard for a minute for him to do his business. My anger at the disturbance and my wife’s assumption I was too scared to go outside alone at this hour after what happened growing by the minute. 

“I’m going to walk down the 7/11 and pick up some ice cream” I told her, as a way of being defiant of this fear I presumably had. She was hesitant but I know she can’t resist a good pint of strawberry, I wanted to cool off anyway from our faithful companion’s disturbance. 

The walk was going to take me past the community center twice but it wasn’t very long and I just had to prove my unspoken supposed fears wrong.  The trip down was a breeze, the store clerk friendly as a graveyard shifter can be expected. And the trip back was looking uneventful. 

I was steps away from being past what I know suspect to be the hive of some unknown evil we call the north side community center when a scream from in the buildings darkened walls peirced my ears. 

I froze

Breaking my trance quickly to look around

The silence was deafening. 

I was seconds away from running when primal snarls from the darkened corner behind me made the decision for me. 

From there to my living room was a blur of darkness and panic. My wife had luckily drifted back to sleep. I sat on the edge of our bed, breathing heavily. Unsure of what was reality. 

I’m still unsure of what terrifying things I came so close to or perhaps did encounter that night. But i know now that that place, a fraction of a mile from my home i thought to be heaven holds some kind of evil. 

Any suspicious I had of a possible bad dream or hallucination were shattered the next morning when I found my newly erected Halloween decorations slashed to bits. 

My wife is now on alert for a bear in the neighborhood, in her mind the only logical conclusion concerning I didn’t want to worry her with the story of my walk to the store that night. But i know better, it was a message. And one i received loud and clear
