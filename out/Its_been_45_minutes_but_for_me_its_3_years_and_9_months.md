It's been 45 minutes, but for me it's been 3 years and 9 months. Today I will tell you my story.

  I was 15 years old at the time. It was a simple Monday morning. I was at school, talking to my friends and getting ready for my first lesson. And the first lesson is math. It was half-light outside, as it was February. The lesson was supposed to start at 8:00. The time was 7:55.

  I was sitting in the second row, at the last desk. The teacher came into the classroom, the bell rang and I got up. Get up. One stood up. For some reason, everyone was sitting and not moving. They didn't even blink. It's like time has stopped. I looked at the watch I had on my hand. It was 8:01. 

"Strange," I thought. I took out my phone, and it read 8:00 on the phone. Suddenly, it became unbearable for me in class to listen to the sound that was there. Have you ever seen when a movie shows footage in slow motion, and you've heard the sound there? So, here it was 100 times slower. 

  My ears hurt, and I didn't know what to plug them with. I found my wireless headphones in my pocket and put them on. It was a lot easier in them. I went up to my friend, he had a frozen smile, he was looking ahead. "Time has stopped," I thought to myself. 

  I clapped in front of my friend's face. Zero reactions. I began to think about what it was: "So, time has stopped completely, like in the movie. But if it stopped, what kind of sound is that? Well, maybe he'll stop too?" I had two versions of what was happening: either I became a superhero who could stop time, or I fell into an anomaly that defies scientific explanation. 

  Everything was strange to me. I looked at my wristwatch. The time was 8:05. And it's 8:00 on the phone. And so, as I understood, the watch with me got into this anomaly, and therefore did not stop. 

  I stood there for a minute and realized that I had a huge advantage.: I can do whatever I want. I went up to the class bully and slapped him on the back of the head. He didn't do anything to me. I chuckled. I realized that I could do anything and no one would do anything to me. I walked out of the school and onto the street. Have you ever felt free, as if you had passed the most difficult 5th grade test and you could walk until nightfall. So, then I felt completely free, as if the whole world was in my hands.

  I went for a walk around the city, it wasn't dark or bright outside, so I could see where I was going. I went into one of the grocery stores and took a pack of chips, I didn't even think that I was stealing. The salesman stood there and did not move. Soon I went to the KFS. I picked up a variety of delicious food, but harmful. 

  I've arranged a celebration for myself. In short, he became arrogant. I tried to make a video to show off to my friends later, but the video just hung on my face, so I tried to take a picture of myself: the same thing. "Damn, what a mess," I thought. 

It was already 12:00 on the clock, but it was 8:00 on the phone. I got used to the sound, and I wondered why it never stopped. I went to the shopping malls. After that, I found a gelik in the city, somehow pulled out the driver, and got into the driver's seat. I tried to go, as it was wound up. But the car was still there. I've been having fun all day.

 So the whole day passed for me, as I realized by the clock that it had already been more than 12 hours. It was 20:00 on my wristwatch. It's 8:00 on the phone. But, there were changes on the time in the phone! I remember perfectly well that it was exactly 8:00:00. But now it was 8:00:01. The time has changed by 1 second. I concluded that time is moving slowly. 

  I got cold, so I went back to school to my classroom to get a sweatshirt. I walked into the classroom and noticed that everything was frozen in a half-sitting position. "They're getting up." I also noticed that my friend was sitting still, and there was a puzzled look on his face. I remembered that I had clapped in front of him. I looked at the class bully, he was also sitting, his hands were on the back of his head, and his face was wrinkled. "They notice my actions," I thought.

  I'm wearing a sweatshirt. It was already 21:00. And for some reason I wanted to sleep, so I lay down and fell asleep. The night passed without incident, although it was morning all the time. I woke up in the morning, and at first I didn't understand why I was at school. I looked at my wristwatch, the time was 7:59. Then I remembered everything that had happened to me. I took out my phone and saw that 1 second had changed to 2 seconds. It was 8:00 on the clock, as well as on the phone. 

  I started thinking. Time stopped, but no, it just slowed down. I'm basically trapped. Most of the things I can't do. I do not know how long I will stay in this anomaly. Why should I have fun and so on? I took out a blank notebook: "I'll write down everything that happens

to me there." A day of time has passed for me, but two seconds have passed for them. I started counting. If 2 seconds is equal to 1 day, then 1 minute is 1 month, and 12 minutes is already a year. I got scared: "What if I stay here for 10 years, and it only takes a few hours for them, what should I do?" 

  I wrote down my thoughts in my "diary".  I decided to watch the video on my phone, but I wasn't surprised when it just stopped at one frame. I realized that I couldn't help but play on my phone, watch YouTube, or watch TV. Then I remembered about the books: "Exactly! Books! I can read books, but I'm not that bored yet." 

  I started having fun with my class: lifting things into the air and watching them stop in the air. I knew that in a day, my classmates would be terrified. Also, I removed the chairs from my friends, since they were only standing. At the end of the day, I sat and imagined their reactions. 

  So a month passed, I guess, I counted the time by my watch and was guided by the calendar. It was 8:01 on the phone. All this time I've been living at school, in the city, or in my apartment. I was doing all sorts of stuff, swapping people's hands or their positions. He picked up things, took whatever he wanted from the store. But gradually I got bored. But I came up with the idea to travel the world. But then this idea was cut short, the cars could not drive. And it's not a good way to travel on foot. 

  But still, I decided to walk to the neighboring town. In my city, I took everything I needed: a tent, food, etc. The neighboring town was about 400 km away.  When I stood on the threshold of my house, I was wondering if I was doing the right thing. I wanted to change my mind, but I went. On the way out of town, I found a bike and tried to ride it. And I could, I rode a bike, but it was hard for me to drive because of the snow. Thanks to the bike, I made a discovery: time does not affect the objects with which I interact. 

  I was driving, everything was fine until it became even harder for me to drive than it was. I looked at the wheels, the rubber on them was completely worn off. What happened? Time didn't work only on the pedals, so the wheels just got worn out because they made thousands of turns in a few milliseconds. Now I had to walk. "Okay, I'm going for a walk," I thought. 

  And so I'll tell you what happened in 2 months. I walked halfway to this city and got sick. I had to stay in a village to get better. I also concluded that the temperature of the air also affects me. The time on my phone changed to 8:03. When I was able to recover from my illness, I began to miss my family and went back to my city. In 2 months, I've already gotten used to nothing moving, got used to the constant morning. 

  When I was walking back, I saw various animals peeking out of the bushes, they didn't blink or move. I hadn't noticed them before. 

  

It's been two months again. It's 8:05 on the phone. By the way, the phone is never discharged. Although it pleases, it doesn't do much good. When I got to my apartment, I lay down for a week, as I was very tired. 

  It's been a week, and I thought: "So, in fact, time passes slowly, but my body lives with me in this time. And that means it's growing. So now I'm skipping the school course, and if time goes back to normal, let's say in a year, then I won't really want to study for the second year."  So I went to the local library and started studying subjects. 

So a few months passed, and I also started playing sports. The time on the phone was 08:10. Everything was fine until I began to notice that I lacked human communication. Gradually, I stopped studying and playing sports, and I became depressed. 

  The days went by very hard for me. I just wanted to talk to someone, tell them my feelings. I started talking to myself, reading books, and judging the characters in the books out loud. 

When exactly one year has passed since time became slower. The time on the phone began to show 8:12. I started writing a book about time travel adventures. He also continued to study and play sports. The depression went away, and I felt better.

  2 years and 9 months later. 

I was sitting in my classroom, talking to my friend. I told him how I live, etc. In response, he did not move and did not answer me. The time on the phone was 8:45. It's funny, but the lesson has passed, and for me it's been years. I turned 18, I became an adult, not a teenager.

  I sat down in my seat and imagined myself sitting in class again, like I was a teenager again. I just wanted everything that was happening to me to be a dream. It was my main dream to end it all. 

  Suddenly, the bell rang for recess. I heard surprised exclamations all around me. My classmates and teacher came to life. My friend jumped away from me. "It's not over yet," I thought. 

"Who are you?" How did you end up here?! – the teacher asked me.

  Now I'm sitting in the principal's office, waiting for the police and trying to explain what happened, my surprised parents are sitting next to me. I also quickly figured out what had happened to me. It's been 45 minutes for them, but 3 years and 9 months for me.
