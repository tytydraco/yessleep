The air felt off even before we stepped foot into the venue. Something about the day was heavy, like the world had leaned a few degrees too far, and no one but me seemed to notice. I shrugged it off. I’d convinced my best friend Chloe to come, promising her an unforgettable experience at Astroworld 2021. The way she grinned as we walked through the gates made me feel like I’d done a good thing.

We got there early, the sun still high, baking the asphalt under our sneakers. The energy was electric, kids running around with festival merch, sipping overpriced drinks, laughing, shouting. But then I noticed something odd: the faces in the crowd. There were moments when people would just stop, mid-laugh or mid-conversation, and look around, puzzled, like they’d forgotten why they were there. And then they’d snap back, laughing again, but it felt forced.

“I think it’s just the heat,” Chloe said when I pointed it out, shrugging. But her eyes lingered on a guy who stood motionless for too long, his lips moving soundlessly, staring at the main stage. I laughed it off, trying to shake the eerie feeling creeping up my spine.

By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, the crowd had swelled. The air was thick with sweat, weed, and excitement. The bass from the earlier acts had shaken the ground beneath our feet, but it was nothing compared to the rumble that started as Travis’s set approached. People surged closer to the stage, the pressure of bodies tightening like a vice. Chloe clutched my arm, her face pale, but she was smiling.

“This is crazy!” she yelled over the noise.

I tried to nod, but something was wrong. The crowd wasn’t just excited—they were desperate. People’s faces looked…hungry. I saw a girl shove another to get closer, her eyes wide and wild. A guy elbowed past us, his teeth clenched like he was in pain. The energy wasn’t excitement anymore—it was something darker, something primal.

The stage lights dimmed, and a roar erupted. Chloe grabbed my arm tighter, and I felt her nails dig into my skin. The screen lit up with visuals—twisting, hypnotic spirals of fire and shadows. It was mesmerizing, like staring into a black hole. My stomach twisted. I glanced at Chloe, and her pupils were blown wide, her mouth slightly open.

The first beat dropped, and the crowd exploded. Bodies surged forward, a wave of flesh and sweat. I tried to hold onto Chloe, but the force was too strong. We were dragged into the pit, the ground vibrating with every step.

“Chloe!” I screamed, but my voice was swallowed by the music and the roar of the crowd. I caught a glimpse of her, just ahead, her head whipping around, searching for me. And then she disappeared.

The visuals on the screen became more chaotic—skulls, flames, and flashes of faces that weren’t…human. The bass seemed to pulse in my chest, too deep, too heavy, like it was trying to sync with my heartbeat. My breath came in gasps as I struggled to stay upright. Around me, people were falling, tripping, getting trampled, but no one stopped. No one even seemed to notice.

And then I saw him.

He was standing at the edge of the stage, silhouetted against the fire-red lights. Travis. But there was something…wrong. His movements were jerky, unnatural, like a marionette on strings. His eyes glowed faintly, reflecting the screens behind him, and when he looked out over the crowd, it felt like he was staring right at me.

I tried to look away, but I couldn’t. His gaze pinned me in place. The music pounded harder, faster, and the crowd surged again, pressing tighter. I couldn’t breathe.

People around me were screaming, but it wasn’t from excitement anymore. It was terror. I saw a guy clawing at his throat, his face turning blue. A girl next to me collapsed, and her friends didn’t even try to help—they just stared at her, slack-jawed, as if they couldn’t move.

I looked up at the stage, and the visuals had shifted again. The spirals were back, but this time they were spinning outward, reaching toward the crowd like tendrils. The air felt heavy, suffocating, and I realized I couldn’t hear the music anymore—just a low, pulsing hum that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

People started falling faster, collapsing like dominoes. I tried to push back, to get away, but the crowd was like quicksand. The harder I fought, the more it pulled me under. My vision blurred, and for a moment, I thought I saw shadows moving among the bodies—tall, twisted figures with glowing eyes, darting through the chaos. But when I blinked, they were gone.

I don’t know how long it lasted. Minutes? Hours? It felt like an eternity. And then, suddenly, it was over. The lights went out, the music stopped, and the crowd fell silent. People around me were gasping for air, stumbling over bodies, but no one spoke. No one screamed.

The stage was empty.

I found Chloe hours later, sitting on the curb outside the venue. Her knees were drawn to her chest, her eyes vacant. She didn’t look at me when I called her name.

“Chloe?” I knelt in front of her, shaking her shoulders gently. “Are you okay?”

She finally looked at me, and my heart sank. Her eyes were bloodshot, her face pale, and her lips moved soundlessly, just like the guy I’d seen earlier.

“Chloe?” I whispered.

She blinked slowly, and for a moment, her pupils flashed red.

“Don’t you get it?” she whispered, her voice hollow. “We weren’t just watching. We were the show.”
