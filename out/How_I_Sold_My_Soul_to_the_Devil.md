The average person did not wear a two-piece suit to a dinner with someone he’s about to divorce, but if I was leaving Grace, I might as well play the role of the high-class husband for a last time.

Usually in these scenarios, the mere sight of one’s partner could vex a person, and I did not expect Grace to be the kind who wanted to end things on cordial terms. She had always been the sentimental type and held grudges with half the people she knew. But considering the things her family was capable of; a dinner didn’t seem so bad. It was rather good that I was getting a closure of the whole damned affair.

Of course, Tracy was hesitant about me going. I had to swear on our child to assure her that I would indeed come out alive. ‘Keep texting me, ok?’ she said, stroking her belly. I kissed it. ‘You both can bet on it. I’ll be back by ten.’

Saying this, I left for the devil’s lair.

My marriage to Grace was the perfect example of an underdog triumph. While she was an amicable woman, I couldn’t say that I married her for love. The truth was that I badly needed the money. How many marriages were based on love anyway? Even after my need subsided, I didn’t think my being with her would harm anybody. That is, until it started harming me. I still don’t understand what happened with her, but every day turned into a slow torture. Her presence became such a beastly source of irritation and unpleasantness that it could be ignored no longer. I was an outcast in her world with nobody to lean on. Except perhaps Tracy.

When I stepped into the dining hall after months, nostalgia hit me. Far from the flaunting of sophisticated elegance I knew it as, it was dimly lit, quiet, and intimate. She rose from her chair and hugged me- the kind of hug she would give if we were still together.

‘Thank goodness! For a moment, I feared that you wouldn’t come,’ she said cheerily. I took her hands off me, smiled, and sat down on the chair opposite her.

She had dressed for this occasion- a mauve gown, styled hair and bright, scarlet lips. The red of the lips was in fact so bright that it made me nauseous, reminding me that everything around was artificial. Her saccharine voice and grateful face was even more pathetic. I was glad that this was the last time I was seeing her.

The waiter poured champagne in our glasses and served us a plate of steak. Quite odd, considering that one of the habits Grace had developed simply to catch up on the trend was veganism. Since I knew her, she abstained from touching meat, saying that she cared about the well-being of animals. Well, did she care about people as much?

‘How come you’ve started eating meat?’ I asked casually.

Her eyes lit up, almost surprised that I’d said something to her. ‘I grew out of it. You loved steaks. My beliefs were nothing in front of the wish to hold on to your memory.’

I ignored her response and resumed eating. I didn’t know whose steak it was of, but it was scrumptious. Rich, tender, and much more pleasant than the woman before me could ever be.

Perhaps she sensed my displeasure, for she shifted the subject. ‘How is Tracy?’

‘Good.’

‘When are the two of you getting married?’

‘We’ll set up a date as soon as our divorce gets finalized. She is nearing six months and I don’t want her to be uncomfortable at the wedding.'

‘God bless you all.’ She fidgeted with the folds of her dress. ‘I know that I can never bear you a child, and how much it means to you…b-but I can’t help I have polycystic ovarian syndrome! I tried. I wish I could be a normal woman for you, but I can’t. I’m sorry that I can’t be the wife you need- ‘

‘I never said it was your fault. Tracy…’ I breathed deeply, ‘she is the one meant for me. She’s the love of my life.’

There was a pause. Grace’s eyes stayed fixated on her plate, but the fork in her hand was shaking. ‘Is that the case? Then why did you marry me, you betraying, unfaithful idiot!’

I flinched. The fork was thrown onto the nearby wall, from which it fell to the floor with a clang. She looked like she would scream more but restrained herself. The waiter brought another set of cutleries to replace the discarded fork.

‘I’m sorry,’ she said, sitting down. ‘I cannot lie to you.’

‘Nor can I.’

‘I’ve always loved you.’

‘I never did.’

‘And when I found about you and Tracy…I refused to believe that you really did it. If it was just being with her, maybe I would’ve still forgiven you, but having a child? I can’t remember whether I wanted to cry or strangle you.’

‘Grace, I have apologized. I never meant to hurt you, but we cannot be. I just am not made for your sort of world. And now, it’s far too gone. It would be an injustice to the baby if I even see you again.’

She lowered her head, and soon, a strange, cruel smile took over those scarlet lips. It was a smile I’d never seen on her before. Only her gaze lifted to look at me- and what a gaze it was! The soft blue of her eyes had turned cold as ice. ‘Oh, how can I believe another word of you ever again?’

I felt a sense of unease. ‘What do you mean? I *do* love Tracy. Nothing will change that.’

She turned back at the food. ‘I just thought that you would want your child to be well-provided for. Can you manage it with her?’

‘Since when did you start caring?’ I said dryly. She didn’t reply. My heart rate was quickening. I took large bites of the steak and washed them down with champagne. Then she chuckled.

‘Do you have confidence that you’ll find a good job without me by your side? I wouldn’t be so sure. What will Tracy think of you then? Maybe she would wish that you never left me. That way, you could’ve spent your life without worrying about money again.’

‘I will find some way. I must, for our child…’ the words weakly escaped my mouth. ‘No matter how hard it is, I’ll find something.’

Grace nodded. ‘I root for you. Well, in that case, there’s no need for me to bring up the settlement.’

I stopped eating. ‘Wait, what settlement?’

‘You are determined to find a job. You wouldn’t need it,’ she said casually.

‘No.’ I put down the cutlery on the table and looked at her with complete attention. ‘Tell me. What settlement had you planned?’

The look in her eyes grew soft. For a moment, she struggled to answer my question, then said, ‘Tear the divorce papers. Do not marry Tracy.’

I blinked. ‘Do not marry her? But she’s carrying my child- ‘

‘Keep her believing that you’re going to marry her till the child is born. Delay the divorce, make excuses about legal complexities or something…but don’t marry her. After the baby is a couple of months old, bring it here. We shall raise it as our own. It’ll be like nothing ever happened.’

Another long pause. I stared at Grace. She shrugged her shoulders.

‘It’s the best for everyone involved. I will not beat around the bush. Once news spreads that you are in a relationship with our house help, you’re done for. There will be scandal, and it’s you who shall suffer. People shall call your child a bastard. Let me not mention what they’ll call Tracy. As for you, no firm will hire the man who ruined our family name. Is that what you want?’

I did not know what to say. My voice had gotten stuck inside my throat. Grace was right; yes, for once in her life she was absolutely right. I never should’ve messed with a family as influential as hers. My career, my dreams, my ambitions…all would go to waste if I left her now. This wasn’t fair. I’d worked to get this far, and I couldn’t ruin my child’s future due to my mistake. I couldn’t.

I sank into the chair. Sweat formed and fell down my temples in the form of beads. It seemed like even the half-eaten steak and the glass of hurriedly-drunk champagne were staring at me, waiting for my decision.  I couldn’t bear her presence. I couldn’t bear it. But it was the best for me. For my future. For my child. For my child’s future. It was the best for everyone.

‘Don’t you love Tracy?’

Grace’s tone was dripping of mockery and derision at my helplessness.

Tracy wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. She was young, she was naïve, and she had faith in me. But hearts got broken every day. She was my support in the days I’d been forced to spend with Grace…but what was she more than that? Grace just wanted me married to her. Even as I had to bear her presence, I could continue loving Tracy in secret. Or better, I could find another woman to love me unconditionally, whom I could start afresh with. A woman who had no clue of the sins I’d committed to survive in this world.

‘I,’ my throat croaked. I cleared it. ‘I accept your proposal.’

As if by cue, the waiter walked up to the table and served something which wasn’t food. I bent forward to see that it was some sort of document. The divorce papers.

‘Are you certain?’ asked Grace sweetly.

‘Absolutely certain.’

I held the papers and ripped them till they were but white ribbons and threw them in the fireplace. They caught fire immediately and turned an ugly red before becoming ash.

Grace was satisfied. ‘Good choice. Finish up your meal now.’

I picked up the fork and knife. ‘Have I just sold my soul to the devil?’

‘What you have to decide now is if the price was worth it.’

I chuckled slightly and focused on the steak. It had gone cold by now, but was no less tender. Such succulent meat! Chefs at this place never skimped on seasonings as well. I made a mental note to have it made regularly once I returned to the house.

I had taken in the last bite, when she whispered, ‘Darling, do you have love for anybody at all?’

‘Why?’ I asked midway chewing. Something hard hit my teeth. I wrinkled up my nose. After swallowing whatever meat there was, I put my hand to my mouth and spitted the thing out.

It was a ring. A ring made of rose gold with a studded diamond in it worth 1.5 carats. I knew this information, for I had bought that ring.

It was an engagement ring.

Tracy’s engagement ring.

A chill rushed through my spine. The fork began trembling and soon dropped to the floor. My stomach churned. I knew it was too late to throw it up but I tried anyway. Grace laughed; her lips as bright of a scarlet as ever.

I couldn’t believe it. As the horror seeped in, I found the hall spinning around me, engulfing me into a world where there was only the feeling of regret and the sound of Grace’s laugh. Then came a cry which was too bloodcurdling to be mine.

‘How dare you…IT WAS MY BABY!’
