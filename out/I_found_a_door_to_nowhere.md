I’m posting this because I don’t want to forget. Forgetting’s a terrible thing. My friend would always say that. Once, I asked him why. It was late, the two of us were sitting in this field, and he said something like:

“That’s when things really die.” He was staring up at the starry night sky. A million pinpricks of silver on a pitch black canvas.

“What do you mean *really* die?” I looked over at him. He was an eccentric guy, always seemed like he was off somewhere else. Maybe somewhere up there, among the sea of stars.



“You see that?” He pointed at the sky.



“The stars?” I gave him a puzzled look.



“It takes forever for their light to get here. Some of them probably aren’t even there anymore, but we can still see them.”



“What’s that supposed to mean?”



“Those stars might be long dead, but they’re still shining up there.” He laid back on the grass, a melancholy smile on his face.



A few weeks later, we were hanging out in that field again, stargazing. Whenever he wasn’t talking about something vague and philosophical, he’d be talking about the stars. Ever since we were little, he said he wanted to be an astronomer. Sometimes, he would get this glint in his eye, and say he wanted to see what else was up there.

That adventurous side of him always got us into trouble. He must’ve dragged me to abandoned buildings a million times. In all honesty, I loved every second of it. He was my best friend for as many reasons as there were stars in the sky, and that was one of them. 

It’s just that our latest adventure wound up being more than trouble. Somehow, something caught his eye more than the stars that night. It was a door. It wasn’t on the ground, toppled over. It was standing there: a few feet from where we usually stargazed.



“When did that get there?” I asked him, half joking.



“I’m not sure...” I could always tell when something piqued his curiosity, just by that glint in his eye. Something about it always got me worked up too.



“Wanna go open it?” I wasn’t really asking, just saying what we were both thinking.



We walked over to the door. It was painted a glossy black, speckled with shining silver. Its handle shimmered dimly in the moonlight. We’d never seen this door on any of  the countless nights we spent here. And suddenly here it was: a solitary door, standing in our field.

My friend didn’t waste any time, reaching for the handle as soon as it was within arm’s reach. The handle turned with a satisfying click, and he promptly pushed it open, but what we saw on the other side wasn’t more of the same old field. No, on the other side there wasn’t any grass, or the distant glow of fireflies.

An inky black sky painted with streaks of silver stretched endlessly outward. If the sky here was a sea of stars, what was behind this door must’ve been the other six. Needless to say, my friend was on the other side without a second thought, and I was soon after.

What felt like sand crunched beneath my feet, an ivory white expanse surrounded us. Towering glossy black structures dotted the landscape in front of us: some of them looked uncannily similar to abandoned warehouses we’d visited, and others were towering obelisks, bent over and sinking into the sand.



“Holy shit.” He said what both of us were thinking this time.



“Yeah.” 



“Where do we go first?” He looked back at me, with that glint in his eye.



“How about there?” I pointed at the closest structure. It was a large rectangular building, dark and imposing.



We walked for a while, and quickly realized it was farther than either of us thought. It towered into the sky, standing at its base made it seem like it went on forever. Its walls were smooth, and on closer inspection, marbled with a brilliant silver. It shone dimly like cracks of sunlight through the curtains on a lazy summer afternoon. What stood out more to me than all of that, was that it didn’t have a door. A rectangular hole abruptly interrupted its otherwise seamless surface.



“We gotta see what the inside looks like.” He was starting to sound more and more worked up. That glint in his eyes was less of a glint now, and more like a shine. Like the silver marbling, like the silver speckled sky, like long dead stars that refused to be forgotten.



We paused for a moment, peering into the enigmatic structure before us. An endless dark sat inside. Not an inky black like the sky, but a strange foreboding emptiness. It was as if the darkness in that place was more than an absence of light, I guess I should say that it was less than that.

A soft crunch coming from the inside pierced the silence of that moment. Then we realized something was there: two silvery pinpricks of light. No, it wasn’t quite silver. There was this yellow tinge to them that gave them an otherworldly glow.

Another soft crunch. We stepped back. Something was wrong. The novelty of this place had run its course and we began to realize just how alien it was. It was like I was little again, standing at the bottom of the stairs just as I had shut off the light. These stars that stared at us from the dark were not ours. Not the ones we had watched for years on end. Those ghastly, yellow will-o-wisps stared back at us.



“What… is that?” I couldn’t answer his question then. I still can’t.



In an instant, or maybe even less than that, they were gone. Those strange yellow lights. Him. I whipped my head around frantically, wordlessly. I tried to call out over and over, but one thing escaped me: his name.

I wandered that barren place for what felt like an eternity, searching for something, anything to point me toward that glint in his eye. That light like long dead stars.

I couldn’t find it. Couldn’t find him, anything of him. Just as I had given up it was there, in its awful glossy black and sterling silver. Not toppled over on the ground, it stood there, waiting: that door.

Before I knew it, I found myself turning that handle and stepping through. There it was. That serene field. The quiet chirp of crickets and the soft glow of fireflies. But something was missing, there was this indescribable emptiness to the moment. A bottomless nothing that lurked there.

I looked up toward the sky one last time before I left. The brilliant silver I had become so accustomed to was stained yellow. He said forgetting’s a terrible thing, but how can I remember when I never even knew what it was in the first place? I’m sure both of us thought that door would go nowhere.
