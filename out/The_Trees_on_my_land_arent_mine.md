One time when I was around 24, I was collecting some fire wood for the harsh winter that was coming, normally I go to the forest in my back yard to find the perfect old trees that i felt right to chop down, the place I lived in was passed down from generation to generation i owned about 200 acres of land and about 80% was a dense forest that was there from my great grandfather who was devoted to make this land filled with trees so I wouldn't really ever run out but just in case i replanted all the trees. 

But this time was different, I walked deep into the forest and found the normal spot i chop trees down and checked on the saplings that I planted down last winter, they were growing well thankfully. I sat down against the tree i had planned to remove and use as firewood to read a book, its like a ritual for me to sit down with the tree and enjoy a couple of hours with it by reading a book. After about 2 maybe 3 hours I get up and pick up the axe that I lugged all the way to this tree and swug it right into the side almost as if the entire couple of hours I spent with this tree never happened and I swung my axe into the tree a couple of more times until I heard creaking. The same creaking from a falling tree but the tree i was in the middle of removing wasn't even close to being done, the noise came from a different tree.

Normally you hear the tree slam onto the ground but nothing, I turn around to see if a tree was caught on another instead of slamming into the ground but nothing, all the trees as far as I could see were standing, swaying with the wind, so I turned back around and continue.

To skip some really boring parts about me lugging the wood back to my house using my half alive old white 1989 Chevrolet K-1500 given to me by my dad ill just talk about the next encounter with that noise.

I was laying in bed continuing that book I was reading it was 4:30pm and that noise came back, but it sent chills down every inch of my body this time as there wasn't a tree near the house for while, around the house is a clear field and takes about 5 minutes just to get to the first tree so this noise should not of been this loud especially when I'm inside the house, I go outside to check on this mystery noise as see nothing, and well of course, I was probably hearing things but from my next encounter I dont believe I was.

It happened again around 6:00pm, the sun had set and my dinner was on the fire place getting its first couple of logs thrown on, I love cooking stew in a pot that a I place on the fire place, it was one of those old metal square ones, not an open fireplace but like a metallic box, anyway the noise happened again a couple of minutes after the first log was burning with passion and was half gone warming my house up, it came from the outside again and I ran outside to try and see if it was a bunch of idiotic teenagers playing a prank on me but again nothing.

Nothing.
Nothing but two white dots staring at me from the trees piercing into my eyes and directly into my brain, instantly I got a headache but I didn't think much of it since I get headaches on a regular basis, once again I thought it was teenagers playing a prank that had hid in the tree line after playing that noise and had ran away, I hopped into my Chevy and drove out to the lights but mixed with the white head lights the white dots left my vision and with that I didn't see again, by the time I got to the tree line I got out of my car and looked for the lights but nothing and I was hungry so I wanted to get back home and finish cooking and so I did, I went back to the house and the noise nor the lights reappeared at all for the rest of the night, or the next two days for that matter.

It wasn't until my next journey into the forest for fire wood did i hear it again, I did my normal ritual of reading with the tree, or trees this time as I wanted to chop down a couple of them that day but around the 3rd tree I heard it again and the creaking, but no slam, no sound of the tree hitting the ground, and I turned around instantly after hearing the creaking and this time I saw the lights again, it reached into the deepest part of my brain yet again and I was sweating but as quickly as I saw it, it moved, it moved behind the tree and the lights disappeared but that's not the final time I saw it in the forest that day.

On my way back to the house in my pick-up truck the radio turned on and the creaking sound played through it and it scared me so I rushed to turn it off but as I looked up to keep the car straight, the white lights appeared, but not just the white lights a figure, tall slender, with only white dots for eyes and the only actual thing I could make out was the bull skull it was wearing. As I looked up to the road I saw it and it was standing there and used its shoulder to ram into my pick-up truck and i blacked out.

I re-awoken and it was now night, my pick-up truck flipped and my entire body in aching pain and my spine felt like I was an ex contortionist and retired 5 years ago from that job, in other words I was in unbearable pain. But I unbuckled my seat bet and fell onto the roof of my car and crawled out of my broken window, as I stood it was quiet, almost peaceful but I needed to get back to my house, and of course I'm a working man or was as I retired early from me getting this house and enough money to retire from inheriting it. Anyway I went to get my wood from the truck or what was able to carry from the 4 trees I chopped down but it was all gone, but I couldn't care really I was in pain and just wanted my bed so I hobbled home and finally got into my bed after walking for an hour and half due to my entire body aching.


I layed in bed for hours having that image of that creature in my mind when i drifted off to sleep but I woke up to a book by my feet on the bed an old hand crafted book, I quickly learned that this book was a journal written by my great grandfather who I inherited this house from him, I loved books, still do, so I quickly read it but it got my attention around the time he got sick, see he noted down every time something notable happened and had wrote the date down and this one page was written around the time he got sick and it documented the same experience im having, the creaking, the tall slender figure wearing the bull skull, that's also when i learned this land was originally used to breed and sell bulls but a tragic sickness sweeped the land and killed most of the bulls that was bred by my great great grandfather who i obviously never met he died before my dad was born. 

After the book mentioned what I experienced I stopped reading for a while and with me not reading the book and healing in the house for next month, the creature and sound never returned, not until the winter was just over the hills, the next couple mornings of that early month was particularly harsh, I woke up half on the edge of becoming hypothermic so I needed to go out to get some wood.

Again my normal ritual, read, chop tree, but this time without my pick-up truck I carried all I could using a wheel barrow and nothing unusual happened except for the feeling that I was being watching but nothing was following me and I check multiple times like I was a paranoid person and I'm normally not but that day I was. 

Got back to house, warmed it up and my next few days were normal, eventually I got my pick-up truck fixed and it was ready to go, and since it would of been a month since the incident by the time my truck got fixed I thought whatever it was, was gone, but I didn't need wood yet so I decided to continue reading that journal but the next couple entries shook me to my core.

"Dont remove the trees" that's all one page said, great grandpa was an advid writer he loved journalism but all of a sudden during his sickness he only wrote once a month along side his sickness getting worse, each page only a couple of words, the next entry.
"Its owns the trees, dont touch" 
And the next
"The it moves with the trees"
And the next all followed with warnings about how the wood was dangerous and how the trees weren't his even though he planted them on his land. 
Eventually even though I was told by the journel not to use the wood, it got really cold so I had to go out to get more wood, once I hopped into my car i started coughing. I was getting a cold or had got one, it was to be expected since I basically forced myself to freeze but I needed this wood.

Normal ritual and I ended up finishing the journal, its last entry read "dont believe them, this thing is killing me, I burned the wood, I burned my life, I burned my lungs, it accursed me for ruining its home, its a sickness, it wants me gone but won't let me leave"

But I didn't think anything of it, the doctors did say he was dealing with heavy schizophrenia in the late stages of his sickness and on top of his emphysema, and died only a day after that entry. Eventually I drive my truck back to the house but the sky seemed black like a thick black, I left the house at 6:00 am that day and spent the next 4 hours in the forest it shouldn't of been dark but it was dark for a more unbelievable horror, the sky was black with smoke, I drove into the field and as I saw ahead of me the house. It was the reason for the black sky, the think black sky was caused by smoke, my house was burning, fully on fire, and in front of the house was the creature staring right at me and as soon as locked eyes with the creature the sound came back and made my almost black out and lose control of my truck, I was freaking out and my vision went black, kind of how people with low iron when they stand up too fast they get dizzy and lose their vision for a second, I swerved out of the way of the creature and quickly gained my vision back.

I stopped my truck and ran into the house trying to also get away from that creature, it was stupid at the time but I needed my books and my revolvers, my Smith and Wesson snub nose, but as soon as I entered the house the creature stood outside but that's the least of my worries once I entered i found a site to behold, a bull corpse, seemed to be fresh with its blood on the floor saying 
"It was my land remove yourselves"
With a skeletal remains laying with the bull on top of it depicting to ride it, wouldn't of taken a genius to know that was the remains of my great great grandfather, and my books burning in the living room with more of my great grandfathers journals, all 3 previous owners of this house, all of their professions or loves all burning in the living room, I quickly grabbed my revolver and ran back to my car shooting at the creature but no reaction it only chased me and screamed at me as I leapt into my truck and drove out of the 200 acred land blind firing at the creature.


Some years later I'm living fine and happy but from the smoke of the house I spend my days having cough attacks and getting check ups, the doctors say I have the lungs of a person who has smoked for over 20 years although I've never smoked a day in my life, I even went to the police about what happened, they checked the land but when they arrived they had reported to me that there was no house. Just pure forest, nothing else, no signs of a fire of anything burning down and definitely no creature. 

I now spend my days reading and enjoying city life in an apartment building but I know what I saw i know what happened despite what the police and doctors tell me. Im not crazy I know I'm not since anytime I go to a forest i hear the creaking again, this time low and almost like a warning 
Its telling me stay out and I will listen.
