What is it like being a SAR officer? A lot would argue its an amazing job but a terrifying one at the same time, However as someone who's been in the profession for more then 1 third of my life... I'd argue its just terrifying. After a while it gets weird too, You get desensitized to things you would usually be scared shit-less by, While things that wouldn't seem scary like the dark become ominous.. I'm getting off-track, I've decided to share some of the stories of what I've gone through as a SAR officer.

**1.** I've seen a lot of veteran SAR officers discuss places bodies **shouldn't** be, And I can vouch to this. It's downright crazy. My first experience with this is also one of the most impossible ones I've seen. A family of four were camping out in a basic site, It wasn't too far from the lot and It was usually full of people.

The kids, 3 and 6 are having fun by a tree swing when the 3 year old comes crying. Obviously mom asks whats wrong and the kid says that his brother just fell off the swing, Obviously if this were true this wouldn't be really troublesome, However the kid phrases it "He went into the ground" Obviously we chalk it up to this kid just being young and not knowing how to word things. also to note, The reason we are searching for this kid is cause he is prone to hallucinations, Some sort of disorder fuck if i know. We think he took a hit to the head and ran off. Story cut short he is never found. We tell the parents and they are obviously devastated.

Here's the weird part. Cut to 3 months later and there was construction being done around 11 miles from the site, Should note the forests here have quadrants of where they cut off, This was downright the furthest and hardest one to get to for this kid, He was 6 with an obvious mental disability, There was no way he could cut through 11 miles including rivers. Right?

Anyway, We are called to the area along with police. We obviously don't know why and honestly I don't know why they didn't tell us. Anyways.

As we arrive we immediately have questions, They have a small hole in the ground, Along with tape around it and some scaffold sitting surrounding the area. They ask us to have a look and so we do. Sure enough here is this kid sitting in the ground, Hes in perfect condition, Body doesn't even look 2 days old. Coroners take the kid and confirm he hasn't been dead for even 2 days. That's when we question all this. How could a 6 year old manage to be buried on a construction site that is active, While in the middle of an active scaffold, Without being noticed not while it happened, But after. The ground would be interrupted.

Coroners got back to us a week after and there's some news. The kid hadn't had any liquid or food in his system for 3 fucking weeks. 3. A human cant go even 2 weeks without any liquid. How did he die that long into dehydration. Our first thought is obviously murder. However the coroners pointed out there was dirt under his nails that was pointed upward, In other words they were able to tell us this kid had dug it himself. How? I still think about that one a lot man, Its fucking crazy.

**2.** As a SAR officer, You usually have to get close to wild life everyday, Its the norm. I used to despise squirrels cause of rabies, But I eventually got along with the idea of being around them all day, I was out on a small mission to get to a man who had broken his leg when I smelt something, It wasn't like rotting meat but it was like very old canned food, You know that aluminium smell? It's kind of like old blood. I looked around thinking I might have found the guy when every single hair on my body stood up immediately. I immediately started sweating as I looked around. I heard a crunch behind me of an obvious pile of leaves being stepped on. I didn't want to look but I did. It was a small litter of wild bob cats, The mom was perched on a rock near them. I realized they had just caught some un-identifiable rodent and they were eating. I got out of there ASAP but I was so happy to not be ambushed by something worse.  


**3.** We got a call to a guy, He was in his early 20's and had been going for a hike when he went missing, This was a well established path so the fact he had managed to disappear was a bad sign off the bat. And so we went off searching. It was a big search, One of the larger ones of the season as it was winter. Snow was falling everywhere. We looked for around 5 days and all we found were some snapped twigs heading into the forest. We obviously knew he wasn't gonna survive after around the 5 days of searching and so we quit. Queue to 2 months later when the snow melts. The heavy fir trees lost all there snow and the fog had settled. We are called out to a large tree in the area. One we had passed while looking for the guy, And we found him. He was pretty much at the top of this tree, It was around 60 meters. He had been hugging the tree, There were no branches below him so there was no way he was able to manage the way to the top, There were no marks showing he had used a sharp tool to climb it. When we managed to get someone up there to extract him, They pulled him off the tree and all his insides poured out. He was pretty much fully decayed and these organs looked fresh, As in they were red not just disgusting blobs.  


He had a massive cut going up from the bottom of his stomach to the top of his neck. By the start of his chin. First thought was a bear but a bear wouldn't let him sit like that to die, Nor would it have done that precise and simple of an attack. The coroners took him in and we have not heard anything since.  


**4.** A lot of people seem to mention the staircases, While I personally have never seen them, I do have something like that, In our ops or I guess you could say team. We encounter these power station things, Not like massive ones, I mean like cubicle sized, Different colored metal and the sizes can be a bit more large or small from the default I've seen. In other words there is all different variations of these things. Whats so special about it? They disappear in the same spot we find them usually just hours or even minutes later. I've seen some of them unlocked although most have a heavy duty padlock with chains on the door. I've never open or gone near these things. When I was new to SAR operations, I was being trained by someone we will call Will, That's not his real name but its what I chose. When we were practicing trails and whatever shit it was. Will was talking to me about some random stuff when he looked over to a clearing and stared straight ahead. I followed his gaze, And there sat a green metallic cubicle which had a power box on its left side, With a door covered with chains and a lock. I kinda on instinct started to walk when he said "stop" In a very low voice. I stopped and turned to him confused. Will said "Don't go near them.. Just.. Don't" I was immediately aware it was serious and I decided to not go ahead and defy that. That is my first experience with those things. And i have plenty more.  


This is my last story for now. If you want to hear more I'd be happy to share. Please be considerate that this job is serious so I cant exactly post updates quickly. Thank you.
