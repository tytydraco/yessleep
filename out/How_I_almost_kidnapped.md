It was the autumn of 2009. The time when that famous, depressive weather of Ankara settles in. We were living in the Ayrancı district—those who have read my other memories know this. For those who know the area, picture it: back then, Ayrancı wasn’t the sparkling place full of shopping malls that it is today. There were the Mesa apartment blocks, but between them lay vast, neglected fields and bushes... Once the evening call to prayer was recited, the streets would be deserted; everyone would retreat to their homes.

I was in the first year of middle school back then. I had a red bicycle, and I thought I owned the world. One day after school, I didn't go inside; I thought,  Let me ride around a bit more. It was getting dark, and the streetlights were just starting to flicker on but you know those old yellow lamps? They cast more shadows than light.

A little ways away from our complex, there was a long walking path that ran parallel to the main road. One side was a dense thicket of trees, a secluded spot. As I was passing by, I saw a gray Renault Toros Station Wagon parked on the side of the road. The engine wasn't running, but the parking lights were on.

There was a man standing next to the car.

Now, when you say  pervert or creep, what comes to mind? Someone with stubble, dirty clothes, looking sinister, right? That’s the scariest part: The man wasn't like that. He was wearing a beige coat, dress pants, glasses... The guy looked exactly like a math teacher, or maybe a banker. He looked trustworthy.

He had a roll of tape in his hand and some papers fluttering in the wind. He was trying to tape something to the trunk of a tree, but the wind wouldn't let him; the paper was curling up, the tape was sticking to his hand. When he saw me on the bike, he waved with that helpless demeanor.

Young man, could you look here for a second? he called out.

Normally, I wouldn't stop. My mother had warned me. But the man looked so much like "one of us." And there was such a sad, miserable expression on his face... I slowed down. I stayed on the bike, didn't get off.

Yes, sir I asked.

The man adjusted his glasses. "Oh, son," he said, his voice trembling. "My daughter's dog got lost today. A Golden Retriever, still a puppy. It has its collar on and everything. My wife and I are devastated, we've been looking since morning. I’m trying to hang this flyer, but the wind won't allow it. Could you give me a hand so I can stick this up? It would be a good deed (*sevap*), son."

I looked at the flyer from a distance. A black and white photocopy. It said  TARÇIN MISSING, with a picture of a cute dog underneath. My heart sank. Our budgie had died around that time, so the love for animals hits differently as a kid.

"Okay, sir," I said. I laid the bike down on the side and went over to him.

I held the end of the tape, and he stuck the flyer up. "God bless you," he said. He took a deep breath and wiped his forehead with his hand. Then he turned to me and looked deep into my eyes. In that moment, I felt a disturbing dullness in that gaze, but I couldn't put a name to it.

"You have sharp eyes, you're a bright kid," he said. "If it's not too much trouble... There should be some dog food and a spare leash for the dog in the trunk of my car. While I go hang this flyer on that tree across the way, could you check the trunk and find the leash? Maybe we can hang that next to the picture too, so people might recognize it."

Look, even as I tell this now, it sounds illogical. You'd say, Go get it yourself right? But in that moment, in that atmosphere, you get hypnotized by that man's authoritative yet pleading tone.

Okay sir I said.

The man acted as if he was walking toward the opposite tree. I walked around to the back of the car. Since it was a station wagon, the trunk lid was huge. It wasn't locked; it was slightly ajar.

I reached out and lifted the lid.

The inside was dark, but the light from the streetlamp was hitting it. My eyes looked for a package of dog food. Looked for a leash. Looked for a toy. But the trunk was empty, man.

Or rather, there were no *items*. But the floor was completely, meticulously covered—right up to the corners—with thick transparent nylon You know, the kind they spread on the floor when painting. But it wasn't wrinkled it was spread taut

And right in the middle of the nylon, only two things sat: A huge roll of box tape. And a thick, hemp rope.

Time seemed to stop in that moment. A smell from the trunk hit my nose. That heavy smell of plastic... and underneath it, a faint smell of dampness. I felt it in my marrow: that nylon wasn't laid there for cleanliness. That nylon was laid there so the trunk's carpet wouldn't get dirty,**so fluids** wouldn't leak through

Did you find it?

The voice came from right beside my ear.

I don't know when he came back, or how he walked that distance so silently. I felt him behind me. His breath hit the back of my neck.

I turned around. The man was right in my face. That sad, miserable expression was gone. His face was rigid as stone. His eyes behind the glasses were shining like a wolf looking at its prey. He had one hand raised, holding it in the air as if he were about to throw it around my shoulder.

"The leash... was all I could say. My voice didn't come out.

He reached his hand toward me. "Give me your hand. It's there, it's deep inside," he said. His voice was ice cold.

Whether you call it survival instinct or reflex... I pulled the trunk lid down with all my strength, right onto the man. A loud thud rang out. I think the lid hit the man's shoulder or head; he staggered for a moment and groaned, Ah!

In that split-second gap, I threw myself to the side. I left my bicycle and everything there, I didn't care. I started to run. But the way I ran... I thought my lungs were going to tear apart. I didn't hear footsteps behind me, but I heard the man screaming.

Come here! You brat! Wait!

That tone of voice... That monstrous bellow coming out of that "teacher-looking" man...

I ran all the way to the security booth of our complex without stopping. The security guard was surprised to see me. "What happened, son?" he asked. I couldn't speak from gasping for air. "Dog..." I managed to say, "A dog chased me..."

I couldn't tell the truth. I thought no one would believe me. Or I was scared that man would come and find me. My dad went and got my bicycle from there the next day. I even got scolded: " The chain came off and you just left it and ran away? Why aren't you more careful?"

Do you know what the most terrifying part is

A week passed. I was coming home from school. I saw a flyer on the window of the neighborhood grocery store. My heart nearly stopped; I thought it was the dog poster

I got closer  It said  missing. In the picture, there was a kid, maybe 10 or 11 years old, from the school in the next neighborhood. Underneath it, it read: *"Last seen on Tuesday near the park."*

That Tuesday was the day I met that man.

My knees gave way as I looked at that flyer. That nylon in the trunk... Those ropes... That preparation was for me. When I escaped, he must have not wanted that preparation to go to waste. He found someone else.

That child was never seen again. It barely even made the news properly.

Since that day, whenever I see a station wagon, whenever the smell of fresh plastic hits my nose, I involuntarily look behind me. And I swear, I never, ever stop to help anyone.
