Diary Entry 1 - March 15th
Today was amazing. I woke up feeling great, fresh and ready for life! Mrs. Delilah delivered me her famous Gumbo and it was great. Life has never been better! I'm feeling tired after a long day of work, so I'll take a nap.

Diary Entry 2 - March 15th (continuation)
So..I woke up just as any normal person would do after nap. But, something wasn't normal. My room is dark right now and I'm currently using the flashlight Mr.Norman gave me. All my furniture is gone for some reason..am I getting evicted? I mean, I pay my rent on time and it's always the designated price. I'm scared. My phone is gone too it's like all my stuff vanishes. I doubt I'm getting evicted. The room is cold, empty and eerily quiet. I found a piece of paper that was in the place of where my phone would've been. It looks like it was ripped and written in a hurry. It read 'Do you know where you are?' What the actual hell? What does this creepy note mean? Where are my things? Where am I?

Diary Entry 3 - March 16th
Finally got the courage to leave my room today. The hallway outside was..unrecognizable. The lights kept flickering, it emitted a haunting buzzing sound, casting eerie shadows on old, yellow painted walls. The carpet was semi-wet and it had horrible, musty old odor.

I don't think this is my apartment building..it can't be. I walked carefully down the hallway and the only sounds were the buzzing of lights, creaky carpet floor and echoes of my own steps. I reached to Mrs.Delilahs door, and my heart sank.

Mrs. Delilah, the kind elderly woman who lived in-front of my apartment door, was like a second grandmother to me. She'd always greet me in a warm smile while music of the 40's would play in her room. Her favorite song was 'Where Or When' by Benny Goodman. She loved Benny Goodman, like a lot. This time, her door wasn't answered. Its like she also vanished.

Diary Entry 4 - March 17th
I've explored the entire apartment, but there wasn't any trace of someone..or someTHING. Its like I got transferred  to a place I'm not familiar with. The entire building is empty, all hallways seems so..endless. The only sounds still are the horrible flickering lights and its loud buzzing noises. 

Miraculously, I found my phone! But, when I tried to call 999, nothing happened. Theres no internet nor any signal. I'm trapped here with no way out.

Diary Entry 5 - May 20th 
It's been 5 whole days ever since this fucking nightmare started. The solitude is so unbearable. Is this hell? I don't know where I am, how I even got here or why my world seems so strange and replaced with this hell of a nightmare. 

I've knocked on Mr.Norman's door countless of times trying to find at least one person, but no answers. I did the same with Mrs.Delilah's door, but theres nothing. I'm truly beginning to believe I'm alone in this hell.

The walls are like closing into me, I feel like I'm being watched when theres nothing in sight. I've searched this building multiple times and no one is here but me. I feel so much pressure in my mind, I'm starting to question my own sanity.

I don't think I'll be able to write anymore. But I just hope that someone, somewhere, will find my Diary and find out what happened to me. But with each day passing, I think I'm going more mad. I don't think theres a way back. My only solution now is to end it all and set my soul free. I've hurt myself on purpose so many times to see if this was reality. If you find this, my name is Michael and I'm 34 years old. I want to get out of here.

Diary Entry 6 - March 25th
I'll set my soul free. My journey ends here, I'm stuck in oblivion, but I'll soon be free. ANIMUS LIBERABITUR ET VIDEOBO FELICITATEM!
