I went into work the next day only thinking that I was so ready to clock out I would fake dying if need be. It was a Saturday night, there was a party going on at Sarah Carson’s house, and I didn’t want to be here, dammit.

Not like I had heard anything from Dustin yet, either. There was no telling what I was walking into, with nobody else set to close with me. Things only got more complicated when I walked in at two that afternoon.

Why Cal didn’t give us a heads up when new stuff was coming in, I have no idea. But lo and behold, I walk through the front door that afternoon and sitting by the back wall, now squeezed in tight between the doorway to the adults only room and the Sega games, were two arcade cabinets. 

The first one I can’t really say was a bad idea. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is still a safe bet, even thirty years later. Turns out, Cal saw how important fighting games were getting and decided getting a cabinet for tournaments was a way to make some really good money during the slower months. Man was fucking right, too, because that MvC2 game made more than I ever did at that job.

The second cabinet though… it was different. The art was surreal, like Dahli took way too much acid and had the worst trip ever. The way it was installed made it hard to see though, with one side blocked by MvC2, but the other side had this huge face painted over it, except excruciatingly detailed. It reminded me of one of those cutaway gags from the Nickelodeon cartoons, where they would suddenly make Ren or Stimpy hyper-realistic. The face was screaming in a mix of rage and agony, sharp teeth inside dripping with neon blue. The eyes were closed, but every pore on the green skin was insanely clear. Almost thousands of them, each a detailed eye right down to the irises and pupils, with some of the most attention I’ve ever seen put to art. The setup by comparison was simple, just a two bright blue light guns, and a big screen. Over the top the name of the game was visible in bright green and red colors, “NEON GOD”.

I didn’t have much time to check things out before I had to clock in, but I did stop for a second to check it out closer. The title screen was flashing, showing a massive, neon blue and red giant in the middle of a huge pit, darkness engulfing it. Chains trailed from around the wrists, ankles, and neck of the thing, anchoring it to the sides of the pit. A text on the screen read “Can you free the NEON GOD?”

It was some of the cleanest graphics I had seen at that time in my life, too. Way above the 32-bit stuff that was getting big right around then. The Neon God was just sleeping, chained to the pit around it as the camera revolved, revealing runes carved in red and green on his skin. Even on the pixelated LCD display of the cabinet, I could make out the shapes almost without effort. Though there wasn’t much detail on anything other than the God.

Work went by mostly without incident that afternoon. It was pretty quiet, and I mostly just worked on returns. Had the misfortune of finding another homemade porno, this time recorded over a copy the Power Rangers movie. The Megazord battle was just getting to the good part when it cut in, too.

A few people came in throughout the day to play the new games, but most of them just stuck to MvC2. Neon God sat there, the same title screen constantly on loop. After a few hours I noticed that there were slight changes to it though. The Neon God was no longer sleeping, now raging against the chains that held him, furiously roaring through the low volume on the cabinet. The runes on its skin were brighter as it became more angry, desperately trying to break the chains that bound it. Despite all it gave though, the chains wouldn’t break, only rattling. I shrugged it off as part of the title sequence I had missed earlier, just not noticing since I didn’t look at the right time, but the more I watched, the more I noticed. The movements of the God didn’t repeat like other game title screens. Everything seemed fluid, not like any prerender, and if it was a prerender, it was putting this machine to work with how long it was. Before I realized it, thirty minutes had passed and it never fell back into the slumber I first saw it in.

It wasn’t until after the sun was down that someone decided to play it. This guy named Dante, quiet dude, kept to himself, always rented JRPGs on the first day they released, to the point where he asked us to special order some a few times. He brought a copy of Phantasy Star up to the counter and started talking to me around seven.

”I get the Marvel, but what the hell is that other game? I haven’t seen it in any arcades.” He mentioned, pulling out his wallet.

”Not sure, it just got put in this morning, I haven’t even had a chance to play either of them yet.” I mumbled, scanning the game box and putting his info into our crappy computer system. “How long this one going to take you?”

He laughed, but I was serious. This man rented Grandia around the time it released and only took three days to go through and complete everything, side quests, hidden bosses, all of it. An absolute menace when it comes to JRPGs. Eventually I guess he realized I was serious, because his look changed, “Just the five day rental is fine, the usual.”

”Yeah but I don’t want to charge you for five days then find it in the return basket tomorrow. Plus these older Genesis RPGs are way shorter than the ones coming out on Playstation. You’re in here all the time as is, don’t pay Cal extra.” I said, handwaving him. “I’m putting you down for five on the return book but charging you for an overnight. Plus it’s an old game, so that’s gonna be… dollar fifty, please.”

”Dude it’s fine, I don’t want you getting in trouble with Cal. I’m going to take my time with this one. Plus I only brought a five and don’t have any change.” He said, holding up the bill and his Cal’s Cosmically Loyal Customer card, which I threw two punches on before changing out his five. Look, I can’t say I was concerned with being a model employee at this point, especially considering the events of the past few weeks, so forgive me for a little business sabotage. 

“Thanks man, I really appreciate it.” Dante stuttered, taking back the change and card before stuffing them back in his beaten wallet. “So you haven’t had a chance to play that one yet, right? The graphics look pretty crazy. Like the FMV stuff they’ve had on the Saturn almost.”

”Yeah, it looks wild. I’m not really good at the light-gun stuff though. Jurassic Park and Time Crisis always kicked my ass.” I mentioned, leaning over the counter to look at the game cabinet a few dozen feet away. From what I could see, the Neon God was still raging, bellowing loud curses through the shitty speakers of the cabinet. Dante pulled one of the quarters back from his pocket, walking toward it and picking up one of the guns. 

At the time I thought I was going crazy, but the God looked through the screen at him as he approached, roars and curses beginning to calm as a possible player approached. No way this thing was advanced enough to have any kind of sensor on it, but I swear it knew he was coming. He slipped the quarter in, squeezing the trigger to get past the title screen. The Neon God howled with anticipation, a massive grin on its face as the runes grew brighter. The entire screen bloomed with the light before fading into something new.

A dingy bathroom. The camera looked up into an empty mirror before looking back down at a sink. I didn’t even realize I was walking toward the game for a better look at the time, but I was invested. As the camera panned down to the sink it revealed a standard 9mm, which was promptly picked up before turning to the door. Dante readied himself, pointing the light gun at the screen, before the door was kicked open and the on-rails shooter began. There was just a normal woman sitting on a bed, looked like a dingy hotel, but she raised her hands in terror as the door burst forward.

I was impressed. Haven’t seen many FMV style games with a shooter focus, but this one was nearly seamless. Nowhere near the horrors that NightTrap had put me through years ago, with cheesy acting and short, clipped reactions. This was smooth. Grainy, not great quality, of course, but smooth because I never noticed the scene clip. The woman on the bed started begging for her life, pleading that she would do anything, anything to stay alive, just let her go.

Whoever they got to play her should’ve been paid well, or at least… I still hope they were an actress. Her voice had genuine fear, actual panic that these were her last moments. This shit was Oscar worthy, I’m not kidding.

Dante only let her get a couple of lines out before delivering a headshot that would put Bud Dwyer to shame. The body slumped over, a small bit of blood visible over her right eye, as the player turns back to the bathroom, facing the mirror once again. This time though with a picture of Dante superimposed onto the body in the mirror. Pretty shittily, I’ll add. This didn’t look good, more comedic in just how bad of a job it did. The photo was low res, colors all inverted by what I’m assuming was a screen hiding the camera. But it was Dante in the mirror nonetheless, his face stretched across the basic model of a human body, now raising the gun to his own temple. 

“If I shoot myself is it game over?” Dante asked me. All I could do was shrug though, still feeling uneasy about the woman he had just shot. Something about her pleas just felt too real.

”FREEZE! DROP THE GUN!” A voice came over the tinny speaker again. The player character does a swift turn, finally getting rid of that terrifying stretchy Dante face, and faces two cops with guns up. “Drop the gun!”

Dante fires then, hitting one before the other hits him, sending him tumbling to the ground with a GAME OVER screen. 

“Well, that was weird as fuck.” Dante said, shrugging and holstering the light gun. “Not really sure what that has to do with a Neon God.”

”Yeah, that’s… not my thing.” I said, shaking my head. Everything about the game just seemed off now. The screen was still active, one cop calling in backup for his partner that was bleeding on the ground a few feet away. The lighting onscreen began to flicker, fading to red as lights began to flash through the motel door. Then it faded to black, returning to the screen where the Neon God was before, now raging once more. The language was incomprehensible, but it was definitely angrier than before. Dante simply shrugged it off, moving back to the counter and taking his rental before giving me a wave and shouting a farewell. Awkward as ever.

I couldn’t get the woman out of my mind. The Neon God just kept ranting on the screen, screaming in that unknown language,just guttural shouting. 

Sirens cut through my thought before I was even back to the counter, an ambulance and cop cars racing past Cal’s, heading down the road like the hounds of hell were on their asses. Before I knew it they had turned a corner and were gone out of sight, but the wailing was still audible, fainter by the second. 

Things went to hell business-wise shortly after that, with seemingly half the town coming in to rent a video or game. Some kids stopped ot play MvC2, but nobody really touched Neon God. Before I knew it, closing time had arrived and it was time to lock up. I ended up having to wait out a few stragglers, one guy that was a little too indecisive about his dirty tapes ended up getting run out with none, but finally I was able to get the hell out. I was exhausted by that point. 

It wasn’t until I read the newspaper the next morning that the uneasy feeling came back again. The front page had a story about the old Cozy Inn, a motel a little ways from Cal’s closer to the main highway coming through. Some guy apparently hired a prostitute, killed her, then shot the cops who responded to a call about the shooting. Officer was in a coma for a few weeks before eventually passing. 

The next day when I went in someone else was playing Neon God. I took over on shift from Dustin around four.

“Ever talk to Cal?” I asked him, though we didn’t have much of a chance to talk considering the massive rush already coming in. This town wanted every damn copy of Pretty Woman we had for some reason. He ended up mumbling some excuse about not having a chance yet before clocking out a little bit later.

I ended up seeing a few people come and go with Neon God, but thanks to the massive amount of people coming in I wasn’t able to pay close attention. Those that played it didn’t stick with it for long, usually walking away in disgust or confusion. There were only maybe two or three, but they all had the same looks like they wanted their money back. One even spent the next hour running through MvC2 afterwards.

Time kind of blurred for a while as I was working on returns, but I started hearing from a few customers that came in how there were rumours floating around about laced drugs or something in town. Apparently there were a few different cases across the town of someone either shooting someone else before killing themselves or just shooting at responders and getting killed. Still gives me a shiver years later to think about that, but it wasn’t long before there was a tremor in town, power surging.

It was off long enough most people ended up putting their movies back and leaving, with only me sitting at the counter, thumb up my ass waiting around to either leave or get back to work. 

Lights came on around ten or so, but at that point I was ready to just lock up and head out anyway. Lo and behold, Dante comes walking in, pale and muttering to himself.

”Hey man, already finish Phantasy Star?” I asked. He simply shook his head, moving past me toward the arcade cabinets, pulling a quarter from his pocket and loading it in. I followed behind, trying to get his attention, and noticed he was pale, “Dude… you okay? You don’t look so great.”

”I need it to stop.” He muttered, putting a coin into the slot and picking up the light gun. There was a small trickle of bright red coming from his nose, much brighter than blood’s normal color. The Neon God roared onscreen, and I noticed the chains on its arms were finally broken, dangling off of his wrists. His ankles were still captive, and one around his neck looked like it was still hanging on relatively well, but the runes on his skin were glowing so much brighter than before. The void he was standing in was different too, seemingly filling with a substance that looked an awful lot like blood. As Dante squeezed the trigger things changed, the screen flashing bright before going dark.

It wasn’t the bathroom of before, but this time a dark parking lot. There was someone sitting in a car just a few feet away. The player got out of their vehicle, ammo count appearing in the corner again, and began walking toward the parked car. They barely stopped before the two people in the car began screaming. Dante pulled off two shots, killing both despite their pleas, before the player character kept moving. It walked toward the building from the parking lot, sign becoming clearer as lights began to break through the dark- “United Market”.

My blood ran cold when I recognized the sign, and Dante just kept on going, playing the game without giving it any mind. He stepped through the doors of the grocery store, walking into the grimy, dimly lit aisles. A worker stepped forward, asking if he was okay, before Dante emptied off another shot at him, catching him in the leg as he fell, scrambling behind a nearby aisle. 

“Dante, stop!” I shouted, trying to wrestle the light gun away from him. He wouldn’t budge though, shrugging me off. I went for another approach as he squeezed off another shot at someone who shouted at his in-game self. I recognized these people’s voices, the same ones I heard when I would go grocery shopping for mom. These were real people on that screen. Scrambling behind the cabinet, I kept trying to unplug it, but just couldn’t get far enough behind to reach the damn cord. It was too heavy to move, too, and the screams coming through the speakers only made my heart beat even faster. There’s not telling how many people he had shot by now, but the bright trickle of blood from his nose was coming out faster now, dripping first on his shirt then on the floor below. 

One option left, I ran into the back room and nearly ran into the breaker box, throwing it open and flipping the main switch. Lights went out and Dante screamed from out in the main room.

”No! He won’t leave me alone until he’s free!” He ranted before I heard the light gun hit the screen on the cabinet, shattering it inward. “No! NONONO! Damn it!”

I grabbed a box cutter from the shelf nearby, keeping it held in front of me with no idea of what Dante could do. The entire shop was dark, but I could hear him bumping into the wall as he tried to find his way back toward me, likely wanting to turn the power back on. I held my breath, hoping he wouldn’t be able to hear my heart beating through my damn chest as he thumped around the back room. A metal shelf fell, making him scream out in pain. Working with the dark, I slid my way through the back room of the shop, away from the breakers and toward the back door nearby. I would slip out that way, get to my car, and get the hell out of here. Cops could pick Dante up for trespassing or whatever, but I wasn’t dealing with it.

I saw his pasty face in the dark charging toward me like a damn disembodied head, a phantom ready to take my soul. He was screaming, but I could fucking swear that his blood was glowing, almost neon, and now not only coming from his nose but the corner of his eyes. Both eyes were bloodshot by now, but the way his blood was lighting up like a strip club sign, it was like a damned vampire in the dark. He charged toward me, making me dive off to the side and knock into the back door hard. The metal bar dug into my back, almost making me scream out as I pushed against it, limping out into the brisk night air.

It was dark, but I could hear him coming from behind, hitting the door and lunging out after me. His voice was almost feral now, a deep, primal violence emanating from his throat. Moments after I rounded the corner to the parking lot, a blinding light shined on me, making me stumble over a stone parking spot liner and hit my knee hard on the concrete. Turning to raise my box cutter at Dante, I was surprised to see something hit him right in the chest, causing him to fall over.

He shook for a minute before stopping, and a man in a suit came over to check his pulse before picking him up. I looked over to see two huge vans, bright lights atop one of them, sitting in the parking lot. Another man in a suit came forward, offering a hand to pull me up off the ground. 

I had seen Men in Black earlier that year so I was pretty quick to ask if that’s what these guys were. They fit the stereotype at least, with the black suits on and mysterious vibe. Unmarked vans didn’t help, either. The guy just introduced himself as Peters, said he was part of something called the Collective, and started asking me if I knew anything about the violence around town.

I knew that nobody would ever take me seriously, but this guy actually seemed serious. Everything about Neon God came rushing out, from the odd appearance of it to how everything in it seemed way too real. The guy just nodded along, confirming everything I said while taking some notes. After about twenty minutes though, an old, beat up truck rolled up and a new horror began.

Cal arrived. Cranky ass old redneck as he was, and ever the businessman, he only wanted to know why his business was closed when it was supposed to be open. Wasn’t until he got a good look at the guys in suits that he puckered up a little bit. 

”Calvin Seppel?” Peters asked. He only nodded. “Been a while. We have a few things we need to discuss.”

”Yeah, like higher pay for watching this place.” Calvin muttered back. Peters sighed, turning back to me. 

“I’m going to have to apologize. It seems you and others have been put in danger. We’ll get things taken care of. You can go home.” He said, extending a hand for a handshake. “I’ll also make sure Mr. Seppel is adequately compensating you for your risk.”

”Risk?” The ache in my knee was screaming by that point and I was starting to get frustrated. These people were telling me things without actually telling me anything about what the hell happened. Peters sighed again, looking at me directly.

”If you have any other things you’d like to report about your time here, by all means.” He said, direct this time. That was it, the flood gate was open. I told him all about everything- the tapes, the corrupted game, all of it. He just kept growing more pale as I told him more. By the end of it, he called one of his friends over, whispering to them something about a quarantine before they nodded, walking away.

”Look, if I’m going to be working for shit pay at least tell me I’m not going to die doing it. I’d join the military if I wanted that.” I said. He simply shook his head, motioning for me to follow him inside. The lights had been turned back on by that point. Glass from the screen was shattered on the Neon God cabinet, yet there was still the sound of rage coming from the speaker. Despite being broken seemingly beyond repair, the Neon God was still demanding his freedom. We walked past it though, into the adults only room where the man pushed a poster on the wall, pressing right on a blonde woman’s massive chest and causing a panel to slide away. He motioned me inside before pressing a small button. The elevator began to lower.

”Worked here long?” Peters asked me. I nodded.

”A year or so.”

“Good, good. Plan on being here for a while?” He asked again.

”Depends on what you’re about to show me.” I replied.

The lift door dinged then, opening to a massive, empty space below the video shop. There was a small door about fifty feet away across the room, but with no handle to open it.

”That right there,” Peters began, “Is what we call an Aberration.”

”Okay…” I said, just staring at it.

”It’s a door to nowhere. And everywhere. Depends on the day.” He continued his story, stepping out of the lift and moving towards a panel on the wall. The dark, dimly lit room looked creepy, yellow wallpaper peeling and absorbing the light with an eerie tint. Peters started fiddling with something inside the wall panel, pulling a small part from his suit pocket to replace a part inside the wiring. “Now, it looks like the dampener hasn’t been doing great. Things should calm down from here on out.”

He stepped back, pressing a button and watching the panel suddenly light up green. 

“Fantastic, all fixed.” He said, entering the lift with me again. “Sometimes the door leaks, things get through. Not actual physical things, mind you, just things that can… corrupt. You don’t have to worry about all the strangeness anymore. Just needed a replacement part.”

The lift went back up. My mind was racing at his explanation, and I think that’s what he was counting on. The Men in Black have their little mind eraser, but that’s just flashy tech. In reality, nobody’s going to fucking believe me because this all sounds so insane. Peters was practically laughing at it by time we got back to the surface. 

“Just keep an eye on things. If there’s more we’re cleared to tell you, you’ll know.” He said. 

Neon God was getting loaded into their van now. Cal arguing with them that they better reimburse him for taking an item he bought legally. Peters guided me to my car, waving me off. 

There were three deaths that day, and pretty sure about a dozen people ended up hospitalized. All from that damned game. I saw Peters again a few times, but that bastard never gave me a straight answer on anything. Cal didn’t show his face around the shop again for weeks either. Meanwhile all I could think about was that door downstairs, and whatever may be [behind it.](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/ng4iAR4K7W)
