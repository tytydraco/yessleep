I wasn’t supposed to be there that night. No contract. No objective. No instructions waiting in some encrypted message. Just me, parked across from his building, engine off, watching. Not out of duty. Out of curiosity, maybe. Out of boredom.

He wasn’t important. At least, not to anyone who mattered. Just a name I’d been given weeks earlier, with no follow-up. A placeholder. Someone to look into, not someone to remove. I’d already finished my last job. Wasn’t even on the clock. But I followed him anyway. Something about him stuck.

He kept to himself. Lived a simple life. No wife, no kids. Some finance job. Walked the same route every day. Same sandwich shop. Same coffee. Carried a reusable water bottle. Like he was proud of that. He moved through the world like it owed him nothing and he expected even less in return.

And for whatever reason, I kept watching.

That night, I sat in the car longer than usual. It was cold, but I didn’t feel it much. I didn’t feel anything much. Just a stillness, and that small pull that had been getting stronger each day. Something in me wanted to see it play out. No reason. No justification. Just a feeling.

At some point I stepped out of the car. Didn’t think about it. Didn’t psych myself up. The gun was already in my coat pocket. I crossed the street. He was just ahead, walking like he always did, earbuds in, keys in hand.

Three shots, mid-step. He collapsed. No sound, no struggle. It was over in seconds.

I turned around and walked back to the car. Drove two towns over. Checked into a motel under a name I didn’t use often. Sat on the bed for a while, staring at my hands.

I didn’t feel panic. No racing heart. No shaking. If anything, I felt calm. Completely calm.

This wasn’t like the others. There’d always been rules before. Plans. Escape routes. Timetables. Clean entries and cleaner exits. I took pride in that control. I thought that was what mattered.

But this—this felt better.

Not because it was easier. Not because it was messier. Because it was mine. I wasn’t following orders. Wasn’t acting on someone else’s decision. I chose it.

And I liked it.

I liked the way it cut through the noise. The way everything else—money, people, time—just disappeared for a moment. All that existed was the movement, the act, and the silence that came after.

I keep seeing his face. Not in a way that haunts me. I remember it like you’d remember a painting. Something still and complete. That flicker of awareness in his eyes just before he dropped—it stuck with me. It wasn’t fear, not really. Just surprise. That something could actually be happening to him.

I think about that moment a lot. The way it felt. How natural it was. How right.

And I know I’ll do it again.

It won’t take much. Another face. Another quiet street. Another evening with nothing on my calendar. That feeling will rise again, and I’ll know it’s time.

I won’t need a reason. I don’t want one.

Because I don’t regret it.

Because I liked it.

And because part of me is already waiting for the next time.

i didn’t stop after that night.

I thought it might. Thought maybe it was a one-off impulse—something dormant that pushed through the cracks and got what it wanted. But after a few weeks, I could feel it again. Not loud. Not urgent. Just there, like a low hum behind everything I did.

At first, I tried to ignore it. I went through the motions—small jobs, cleaning weapons, prepping gear I wasn’t using. I ate at the same places, walked the same routes, kept everything controlled. But under all of that was this steady pressure, not coming from outside, not coming from me either.

It’s hard to explain without sounding like I’ve lost it. But it’s real.

It’s not a voice. Not a hallucination. Nothing cinematic like that. More like... a suggestion. A weight in a specific direction. A nudge when I see someone on the street. A whisper of attention drawn to a face, a location, a specific moment.

And when I follow it—when I let it guide me—things fall into place. People are where they’re supposed to be. The environment opens up. Timing aligns. It feels like cheating.

I thought I was imagining it until it started happening more often. Too precise to be coincidence. I’d walk out of a diner with no reason to turn left instead of right, but I’d turn anyway—and thirty seconds later I’d see someone I’d noticed in passing a week before. And I’d know.

I don’t know what this thing is. I don’t pretend to. It’s not telling me to do anything. It’s not giving orders. It’s just... making space. Creating the shape for something I was already going to fill.

That’s the part that unsettles me. It doesn’t feel foreign. It doesn’t fight me. It fits. Like it knows what I am, maybe better than I do.

I haven’t told anyone. I don’t talk to people enough to try. But I’ve tested it. Ignored the pull. Stayed inside when I felt that push to go out. It doesn’t punish me. It waits. Quiet. Unmoving. And the longer I resist, the more... strained everything else starts to feel. Like the world stiffens up.

When I give in, things loosen again. Everything flows. There’s no fear in it. No punishment. Just tension and release. Like tides.

The last time it happened, I was in a city I’d never been to before. No job brought me there. I just woke up, packed, and drove for five hours. Didn’t question it. Booked a room near the edge of town. Walked until my feet turned me toward a run-down office building. I waited outside for fifteen minutes.

He came out with a briefcase and an old limp. Looked tired. Didn’t see me.

Three shots. No rush. No mess.

I walked away feeling something I can’t name. Not happiness. Not clarity. Just... alignment.

Whatever this thing is—it’s not haunting me. It’s not hurting me.

It’s shaping me. Quietly. 

I'm scared
