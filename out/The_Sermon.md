Poets have often spat the rhetoric that in life, only one truth remains promised to us: we are born alone, and we will die alone. I would argue instead that the one truth that binds us to this existence is that from the moment we draw our first breath in this world, we learn suffering—until our last breath departs us from this world, we remain suffering.

Through all my faults, I once believed escaping the run-down hillbilly town I was born into would somehow fix my life. As if running away from my past could forbid it from haunting me any longer. The memories that so often plague my nightmares, the screams that jolt me awake each night, soaking in sweat and terror. I wasted a lifetime before learning that no matter how hard one tries to outrun the past, it will always catch up to them in the end.

Fate waits for no one, and death does not like to be cheated. So I find myself here in the reminisce of that old forgotten farmhouse long since withered by time. A place I swore never to return to once I fled that fateful summer night. The warm breeze caught my hair, sticking to my skin in the humid air that only southern nights carried. Cicadas shrieked their endless song as wheat stalks slashed against my bare legs while I ran.

"Keep going! Don't look back!" her faint voice said behind me. The last time I would ever hear that voice in flesh again.

A shotgun blast rang out into the night, followed by a rattling wail. I had no time to turn back to steal a glimpse at the commotion, so I kept running. I ran until my legs could no longer carry me, until the first bird chirped a morning lullaby, and the sun peeked its head over the mountains.

She was gone.

—

Twenty-three years. Twenty-three long years had passed since I last saw this place, and it almost looked exactly as I remembered it—if you could call the rotting skeleton of what once was a home "exactly the same." The white paint had long since peeled away, leaving behind weathered gray wood that sagged under the weight of neglect. Windows stared back at me like hollowed eye sockets, their watchful gaze felt sentient, and the glass either shattered or so thick with grime they might as well have been painted black.

But it was the smell that hit me first as I sat in my idling car, windows down despite the oppressive heat. That sickly sweet scent of decay mixed with something else—something I couldn't quite place but that made my stomach turn all the same. It clung to the air like a living thing, seeping into my nostrils and coating the back of my throat.

I should have put the car in reverse, should have driven the hell away from this cursed place. But something pulled at me—the same invisible force that had dragged me back here after all these years. My hands trembled as I turned off the engine.

The boards of the front porch creaked under my weight—some things never change. I reached for the door handle, my hand trembling despite the oppressive heat. The metal was ice cold against my palm.

"You came back."

I spun around, my heart hammering against my ribs. But there was nothing there. Only the empty yard, overgrown with weeds that swayed in the still air. No breeze to speak of, yet they moved like fingers beckoning me forward.

"Sarah?" The name escaped my lips before I could stop it. A name I hadn't spoken aloud in over two decades.

Silence stretched between the cicadas' drones. Then, from somewhere deep within the house, came the sound of footsteps. Slow, deliberate steps across the floor above. Back and forth, back and forth, like someone pacing.

Like someone waiting.

The door handle turned beneath my grip, and the door swung open with a prolonged creak that seemed to echo through my bones. The darkness inside was absolute, swallowing the late afternoon light as if it were hungry for it.

But I couldn't step inside. Not yet. Not like this.

My knuckles went white against the doorframe as panic seized me. I stumbled backward, nearly falling off the porch, and somehow found myself at my car again, fumbling for the door handle with shaking hands.

I couldn't face my past all at once—not if I wanted to stay sane. My hand found the bag in the passenger seat, fingers fumbling through its contents blindly until they grazed the top of a prescription bottle. I grabbed it like a lifeline, twisting off the cap and popping one pill into my mouth. It had been a while since my nerves had been this bad.

Taking in one deep breath after another, the tenseness that held my body loosened. With it came a new realization—one that threatened to have me tense up all over again: I desperately needed sleep. Two things were certain: I was not sleeping in my car around here, and I was not camping out near my dilapidated childhood house with haunted memories.

I drove around almost aimlessly, looking for any roadside motel to pull off for the night. My thoughts wandered to the locals—whether any would remember me, or recognize me. I hoped that enough time had passed for people to look at me without offering a second glance.

Finally, I saw the familiar blaze of neon up ahead: Macy's Motel. I pulled into the near-desolate parking lot, bulbs humming with electricity that sounded ready to pop at any moment.

The front office door chimed as I opened it, revealing an empty check-in desk. The AC buzzed to life, followed by a scent of mustiness in its wake.

"Hello?" I called out. When I got no response, I hit the ring-for-service bell that sat collecting dust.

"Just a moment, dear!" came a frail voice, followed by slow, dragging footsteps and raspy breathing. An elderly woman appeared around the corner, her wrinkled features kind despite her obvious exhaustion.

"Can I help you, dear?" she asked, her voice gravelly and aged.

"I'd like a room for one, please."

"Cash or card, dear?"

"Cash. I might be here a few days, actually. Maybe three?"

"That's fine, dear. Fifty for three nights." Her shaky hands wrote out the receipt. "If anything changes, just let me know."

After checking in, I immediately flopped onto the hard, lumpy mattress in room 111. I could already feel the pain my back would feel tomorrow, but right now I was completely exhausted. Sleep was quick to overtake me, though it wouldn't last long—it never did.

Father's voice reverberated through my dreams again, and there he stood in his Sunday best, white knuckles gripping the pulpit, his eyes blazing with practiced insanity as he preached promises of hellfire and brimstone.

"Beloved congregation, tonight we turn to Matthew 7:14—'Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it!' But I tell you something more terrible still—wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and MANY there be which go in thereat!"

His voice dropped to a whisper. "Tonight, we speak of that broad way... and where it leads."

"Picture, if you can, a great bridge spanning a chasm so deep that no eye can see its bottom. On one side stands the world you know—your comfortable homes, your Sunday dinners, your Saturday night pleasures. On the other side... eternity."

He began to pace, his voice rising. "Every soul in this tent tonight is walking that bridge. Every breath you take carries you forward. Every heartbeat is another step. But here's what you cannot see in your comfortable blindness—the bridge is ROTTING BENEATH your feet!"

Thunder rolled outside the tent, almost as if on cue.

"The planks are giving way! One by one, they snap and fall into the abyss below. You hear that thunder? That's not the storm outside—that's the sound of souls falling through eternity, screaming as they plummet toward the lake of fire!"

"And you—yes YOU! Sitting there fanning yourself with your church bulletin—you think your good deeds are holding up those planks. You think your Sunday attendance, your tithe envelope, your kind words to the neighbors are keeping you safe on that bridge."

His voice became a roar. "But I tell you the TRUTH! Those planks are held up by NOTHING but the mercy of Almighty God, and His patience is wearing thin!"

"Look around you! See that empty chair? Last month, Old Man Henderson sat there, same as you. Thought he had time. Thought tomorrow would come. Where is he now? The earth covers his bones, but his soul... his soul stands before the judgment seat this very moment!"

He started pointing directly into the crowd. "And you, young man in the back row—you think your youth protects you? Death doesn't check your birthday! The fever that took the Miller boy last spring—he was younger than you!"

"You, mother, bouncing that baby on your knee—you think God's love for children makes you safe? What legacy are you leaving that child? What path are you teaching those little feet to walk?"

His voice became urgent, a desperate plea. "This very second—THIS VERY BREATH—could be your last chance! The bridge is shaking! Can you feel it? The very ground trembles beneath your feet!"

"Every second you sit there, every moment you delay, another plank falls away. The chasm grows wider. The flames grow hotter. And you... you grow more deaf to the voice of God calling you back from the brink!"

"I can see them! I can see the souls who ignored this warning! They're reaching up from the pit, their fingers clawing at the air, crying, 'We didn't know! We didn't believe! Give us another chance!' But there WILL BE no more chances when you've crossed that FINAL plank!"

His voice broke with performative emotion. "But tonight—TONIGHT—mercy still flows! The bridge still stands! Jesus Christ himself reaches out His nail-scarred hand to pull you back from the edge!"

"Come forward! Don't wait for the hymn! Don't wait for your neighbor! The Holy Spirit is calling FOR YOU! Can you hear Him? That stirring in your chest, that trembling in your hands—that's God's final warning!"

"Come now! Come while the bridge still holds! Come before another plank gives way! Come before the thunder drowns out His voice forever!"

Extending his arms toward the congregation, he made his final bargain for the night. "Who will choose the narrow gate tonight? Who will step off the broad way that leads to destruction? The altar is open! The Savior is waiting! But He will not wait forever!"

I watched as his eyes landed on Sarah, burning into hers with practiced callousness, a threat. She dipped her head down, tugging at her Sunday dress. I glared back up at my father, hatred evident in my expression. But he didn't notice, or care. His attention was always focused on Sarah.

The dream shifted, fragments bleeding into one another like watercolors in rain.

"We need to get away from here, Gabriel, now!" Sarah's voice in hushed urgency. "Oh, God, he's coming! Run!"

"Keep going! Don't look back!"

Running. The sound of a shotgun being loaded, then a click, and the blast that ended everything. An endless echo of a death rattling wail.

—

I awoke drenched in sweat, and the first hours of sunlight were still absent in the dead of night. I looked over to check the time on the clock: 3:07 am. Already stirred and certain sleep would not find me again, I sat up, gripping the corners of the motel’s mattress. 

Yet one thing remained certain in my mind, I’m afraid my nightmare had only just begun to unravel.
