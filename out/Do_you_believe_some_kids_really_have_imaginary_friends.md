I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid. 



Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 



The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 



“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 



I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”



“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”



“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”



“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”



Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 



I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 



I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 



Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.



That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.

We shared a kiss and went to bed.



For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.



As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.



When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.



“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.



Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”



“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”



As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.



“Hey dude, how’s school going?”



“It’s soooo good dad”



“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile



“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”



“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”



“Whatcha mean daddy?”



“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”



Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.



I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 



It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 



I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.



“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”



“No.”



“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”



“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.



“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 



Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.



“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”



Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.



“Who are you talking to?”



“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”



“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”



“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”



I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.



“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”



There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.



“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”



“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”



That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 



The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.



“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”



“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 



“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”



“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”



I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.



“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”



“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 



“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 



“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”



A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.



“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”



“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”



I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 



What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.



“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.”
