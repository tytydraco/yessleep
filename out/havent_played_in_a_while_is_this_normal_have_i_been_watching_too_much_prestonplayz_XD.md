ok so i made this world with my friend and before i start, this is on xbox xs. but anyways a quick back story:

  i bought a nintendo switch to watch youtube on when my daughter is asleep, and i found prestonplayz (i think that’s how you spell it). i really started to enjoy the horror side of his videos and even came to reddit to see ppls opinions and saw a lot of mixed reviews of fake or not. it didn’t turn me off to watching the videos because even if they are scripted in a way he’s really good at making content regardless and i still enjoy the content and i don’t wanna know the truth tbh. 
    so to start i use to play minecraft vanilla all the dang time for years and years and before it went to cross platform i kinda died out form it.
from time to time i would still play on the cross plat version (still am now, re installed it) but i kinda lost interest. 
well thanks to preston, my minecraft interest is back in full peak! thanks man if you somehow see this (i doubt it). 

STORYTIME/EVIDENCE
// /: - ok so i make this world with my friend. we’re both very excited to play, we remember buying minecraft on xbox 360 when if first drop on console and we have had a blast through the years. i wouldn’t  say im a crazy expert guy but ive played for hours and days on end and even built the titanic all the way to full on cities that could honestly be posted and get plenty of gain. 
besides that, back to the point.
we start paying and kinda make a noob move and start not to to far away( i prefer to go really far and get deep in the game). but we decide to settle near a nice village. after a few hours in our first playthrough we found that eveything around us was perfect. almost too perfect…. now my friend doesn’t watch youtube minecraft stuff and doesn’t understand the crappy side. well me on the other hand, i eat it up like candy. I LOVE IT! but things seemed really normal. mind you i have mobs off and on peaceful but still in survival. we get tired. end the game and talk before getting off and decide we wanted to make it a realm because beside the creepy side, this is a great seed with plenty of resources. anyways today i make it a realm and hop on and this happens… im not sure if this is normal. no enderman because mobs are off. maybe this is normal and i haven’t played in a while and thinking to deep about it. but it’s fun to think something is stalking my minecraft world in a weird way XD. 

seed is: 924017630 
coordinates: -428, 97, 129

my days played are at:12

anyone that wants nerd stats , let me know a good way to send the deets. thx guys/gals/beautiful ppl! 

ps. if anyone wants to play hit me up! 
i’m thinking about getting P.C soon becuase i started on that years ago and it’s just cooler for minecraft and maybe i’ll turn my almost 100k youtube channel into minecraft videos! i love creating content and meeting new ppl!
