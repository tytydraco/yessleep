*Part 1*

Hi, my name is Caleb and I’m an addict. Not only a deadbeat drug addict that just came out of rehab, but also a convicted felon. After spending several years behind bars and immediately relapsing when released, I was admitted to rehab by my parents. Staying in the town where I grew up was not an option anymore. Everyone knew I had been imprisoned and labeled me as the dirty heroin junkie, so I decided to move as far away as I possibly could, somewhere no one would know me, to a town by the name of Whitersgate Falls.  

Obviously, moving to a new town didn’t nullify my criminal record. Getting a job, or even a halfway decent apartment, was a struggle. I found an ad on Craigslist posted by some guy named Dex Malone that needed a roommate since he, according to his parole officer, is required to maintain housing but must prove income and decided to rent out a room to stay afloat. I took it. After all, I’m used to spending time around hardened criminals. It was far from luxurious as my excuse for a bed was an old, stained mattress on the floor surrounded by used foil, needles and other obscenities. Honestly, I preferred the prison. However, I was in no position to be fussy as I had ten dollars to my name and half was soon to be given to Dex for rent. I desperately needed to get a job, so I decided to ask the only person I knew. I walked up to the bathroom door, my roommate immediately going silent as he heard me approaching. I knocked carefully.

“Hey Dex, you mind opening up for a moment? I need to ask you something”

“Gimme a moment dude!” he shouted, rustling around in the bathroom. The door swung open after about a minute of waiting and then there he stood, in his boxers and sweat stained white tank top, scratching at his forearm absently like something was crawling underneath. His arms were a patchwork of scabs and faded prison tattoos, like a wall in a bathroom stall covered in old graffiti and peeling paint. My eyes drifted behind him to the mess of a bathroom, the buzz of the fluorescent light the only thing audible as we stood silent in the doorway. There was a damp and nauseating smell emitting from the bathroom, rust colored stains adorning the walls. Among the dirty clothes and other trash sheathing the bathroom floor like the first snowfall of winter, I saw the pipe and foil he had lazily tried to hide. I could not care less; he and I were quite similar after all.

“So what’s up dude?” he asked impatiently, looking at me with eyes wide open, pupils like pinpricks, as if just waiting for me to leave so he could go back to his delinquent behavior. His breath hit me like a truck; metallic, sour, and thick, like he’d been chewing pennies in his sleep.

“Do you know of any shop close by hiring? … Preferably without background checks” I said with an inquiring and slightly sheepish look on my face

“Oh I get it” he said with a smirk “I think that toy store in town is your best bet, that old dude hires new people like every week”

*Every week?* I thought to myself. Dex was probably exaggerating, after all he wasn’t the most reliable person. I thanked him and before I could even turn to walk away he had shut the door to go back to his pastime.

“But hey, be careful dude” I heard him shout through the closed bathroom door “I have heard he’s a real hard ass, and kind of a fucking creep”

It was a strange warning, especially coming from a person with the infamous name Dex “The Grin” Malone. However, it wasn’t enough to deter me. I decided I was going to pay this toy shop a visit first thing in the morning.

 

*Part 2*

I made my way down the street towards the toy shop, shifting as I walked trying to get Dex’s old pants to stop drifting up. When I moved to Whitersgate Falls I hadn’t taken much with me. My parents were quite frankly sick of me, like the rest of the town, and I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. I hadn’t brought more than a backpack of necessities and absolutely no clothes fit for a job interview. Dex was kind enough to let me borrow some old clothes he had stored away from before he was arrested. I wore an oversized blazer with a white tank top underneath and pants that were slightly too tight fitting. Frankly, I looked like an Italian mob boss. It was far from perfect, but at least it was something.

After walking for a couple of minutes I saw the storefront of the toy shop, it looked like it could fit right in on an old street in New Orleans, next door to a Voodoo shop or fortune teller. An old rusted “Help Wanted” sign hung out front. I walked up to the large wooden front door and grabbed the embellished handle, looking up before I entered. The fading letters on the stone wall above the door read “*Old Man Thorne’s Toy Shoppe*” in an old fashioned font. *Here I go*, I thought to myself as I opened the door. As soon as I entered the shop a strong smell of incense hit me, the bell attached to the door rang out loudly, a shrill chime that echoed through the store far longer than it should have, as if the walls were holding onto the sound.

The shop was quite small, every wall furnished with old wooden shelves with dozens of dolls sitting on top of them. The shelves were dusty and covered in cobwebs, however the dolls were in pristine condition, not a speck of dust to be seen on them. Each doll’s glass eyes gleamed in the sunlight, too bright, too focused. One blinked, or maybe I just imagined it. The walls were a dark burgundy color, and multiple oriental mats covered the floor. The sunlight shone through the small rosette window, casting an enchantingly beautiful light on the walls of the store.

“Hello?” I carefully spoke, my own voice slightly startling me. The shop was eerily quiet.

I decided to enter further and sit down on the red velvet sofa that sat in the middle of the store, feeling watched by all the dolls. As I sat down a large cloud of dust rose from it, floating around in the air and highlighted by the sun. I coughed and waved my hand in front of my face, no one had sat here for a long while. *Great sign,* I thought. The sound of the wooden floorboards creaking from around the corner interrupted my coughing fit and a tall, lanky old man appeared in front of me. He wore a well-tailored dark brown suit, no wrinkles, not a thread out of place. Like he’d been stitched into it. Sitting atop his head was a bowler hat made from the same fabric, and a golden monocle on his left eye. He staggered forwards, using his cane to support his weight. I stood up, ready to introduce myself, however I was interrupted.

“Well hello there sonny!” the old man exclaimed, his voice warm like a cup of newly brewed tea. “I assume you are here for the work opportunity?”

“How did you —“ I started, but was again interrupted by the old man

“My goodness, how rude of me not to introduce myself. Silas Thorne, at your service, Mr. Thorne, if you please!**”** He gave a slight bow, the monocle glinting in the light “Come, come! Let me take a look at you, my boy”

He came closer and took me by the arm, leading me up to the front of the store again, like a stray dog being inspected for fleas. He adjusted his monocle and looked me up and down, slightly nodding. I started to get slightly self-conscious, being observed like that, especially when I looked like I’d rolled out of a Salvation Army clearance bin. His skin was white and pasty like porcelain but heavily textured like old leather. I would like to think I’m decently blessed in the height department; however Mr. Thorne towered over me, his lanky frame almost completely covering me. He smelled strongly of wood varnish and formaldehyde, burning my nostrils as he leaned closer.

“Well, speak up sonny! What may I call you?” he finally spoke after investigating me thoroughly. It felt as though he did not look *at* me, but rather *through* me.  

“I’m Caleb. I saw your ‘Help Wanted’ sign outside and I desperately need a job. I just got out of rehab.” *Why the hell did I say that*? I thought. I did not mean to be quite so frank, however something about him made it hard to carefully plan out my words like I usually did.

“Ah,” he said, nodding slowly. “Life is a long road, my boy. Sometimes the best employees are those who’ve already walked through fire.” He smiled, his thin lips stretched wide across his pale face, and for a moment, I wasn’t sure if it was kindness or something else. “Well of course, you shall work here my boy! Can you begin tomorrow?”

“You don’t need to see any qualifications?” I asked, knowing very well that I had none, if it didn’t involve needles or pipes that is.

“That is certainly not necessary! You seem like a well put together young man. I expect to see you here at 9 tomorrow, we shall talk details then. Everyone finds their place here eventually. Good day!” Before I could say anything further, he turned on his heels and started making his way towards the closed door down the hall with a small sign that read “Workshop: Do Not Enter Without Permission!”. I was left standing alone in the shop that would now be my workplace for the foreseeable future. I felt a sense of accomplishment as I exited, but also slight unease, as I could swear the dolls eyes followed me.
