My wife Nina and I (Samuel) have been married coming up to 10 years this year, we’ve had what you would call a pretty standard run of the mill happy marriage up until this point, occasional fights, tender moments, but most importantly a mutual love and understanding of each other. That was, until recently.

Nina had started to develop something I have never seen from her; she’s starting to whimper in her sleep. Now, she has definitely mumbled in her sleep and maybe even outright said a few words over the years, but maybe every other month or so, never frequently like the whimpering has been.

I believe it started a few weeks ago when I woke up in my sleep from what felt like a jolt of movement, from what I assume was Nina just moving in her sleep, but that was when I noticed a soft whimper. We have all the lights completely out in our house at night as we both can’t sleep without the room being completely dark, so when I looked over to check on Nina, I could not see a thing, but I could tell it was coming from her.  At first, I was disoriented from being shocked awake, so it took me a few seconds to process what was happening. Initially, I had thought of waking her to make sure she was okay, to make sure she wasn’t having a nightmare, but I knew she had to get up early in the morning for work, so I figured it was best to let her sleep, as it was so late into the night, I left it at that and I fell asleep shortly after.

The first few times I had awoken to this whimpering I had looked past it as I know how much stress she had been under recently, so I assumed this was a biproduct of that. However, my concern grew immensely tonight as the whimpering had developed into crying.

Upon waking up from Ninas crying, I was startled, we had just watched a horror movie before bed, so I was already on edge. Adrenaline kicking in, I started shaking Nina’s shoulder trying to wake her, perhaps too harshly, as when she awoke, she started hyperventilating and sat up rapidly.

“Oh fuck!” I shouted.

I quickly got up and ran to turn the light on.

When I look over to see Nina, she looks dazed and before I can say anything, she throws up forcefully. I rush and grab my phone to call for an ambulance, but Nina interrupts me bluntly yet weakly before I can even open my phone “No.”

I quickly sat next to her on the bed to check on her, sitting in the pile of vomit.

“Nina, are you okay? Don’t move, please just let me call an ambulance.” I said.

“No.” Nina growled at Samuel.

Startled, I reply “Y… you were crying in your sleep, I had to wake you, let me get you some water, Nina? Please, I’m sorry. Are you okay?”

After what felt like minutes Nina angerly speaks up.

“Why would you do this? Do you know how dangerous that was? You could have seriously hurt me.”

Confused, I reply “I only meant to make sure you were okay, you had started crying, how could I not do anything?”

“Just let it be, it was probably just a nightmare, you did more harm than that would have ever done” Nina replies.

“I’m sorry. You can go back to sleep on the spare bed, I need to clean up this mess and have a shower. I am sorry again, I love you.” I reply.

“I love you too.” Nina says softly before she leaves to rinse off in the shower and head back to bed.

I change the bedding and place it in the wash then have a shower before heading back to bed.

The morning comes and I wake up alone in my bed for the first time in years. I get out of bed as quickly as possible to go check on Nina. When I go to look into the spare room Nina is nowhere to be found, and the bed has even been made. Typically, it is a battle to get my wife out of bed in the mornings, so this took me by surprise, especially with her feeling sick last night. After checking the rest of the house, there was no trace of her, no dishes from breakfast, no fruit from the fruit bowl missing, even her keep cup was still in the cupboard. Now, she doesn’t start work for another hour and a half and it only takes her 10 minutes to drive there so there is no way she has already left. She works at a sleep research center so there are never any calls to come to work early, there is never anyone at the facility at this time anyway. Realizing something might still be wrong with her from last night I tried calling, but when I did I heard her phone ringing from the spare room under the bed. Nina was acting like a completely different person, first her being out of bed before me and now her disappearing without her phone, she’s always been pretty attached to her phone especially with the rise of TikTok and the endless barrage of cat videos she sends me.

My only option now was to try calling her best friend and coworker, Abby. If she was going to be anywhere else, it’d be with her. Maybe she was still mad at me from last night and headed to her house to have someone to console in. Thankfully when I called Abby she picked up almost immediately, she seemed to be expecting my call. She very quickly let me know without me really even saying a word that, yes Nina was with me, and yes she is okay, she just needed to get out of the house for a little bit. I was both concerned and relieved.  

“Can I speak to her, please?” I asked.

“Nina is having a shower right now, I promise you she’s okay. But she really just needs to forget about this, and you guys can chat about it later. Our project at work has taken up so much of our time that we are both just needing to have that as our only focus right now, sorry” Abby informed me.

I love and trust my wife, so as much as it hurt me that I couldn’t talk it out right now I had to trust it was going to be okay and that we could soon work this out.

 

 

Since I had some time on my hands now I figured it was a good idea to try and set up something nice for Nina and I for dinner tonight, to hopefully smooth over things between us. I’m currently on long service leave from my job as a veterinarian and I’ve been using this time to get things done that I have put off for far too long. Being with my wife for so long I have learnt a few tricks along the way that has always seemed to help with situations like this, where I have typically idiotically done something to upset her and for some reason in the moment not rectified it straight away. Nina has always appreciated the small things, so my idea is to set up the dinner table with her favourite dish sinigang, have a bouquet of some native flowers from our garden and rose pedals leading up to the table. I have never been the best chef but luckily her dad is an amazing chef, I always call on him to help whenever I need to make sinigang, he also helps in giving it that flavour of nostalgia.

Nina arrives at the house hours after she would have normally finished work. I hear her open the door and rush over to her to greet her.

“Hello, my love, how was your day? Here, come here.” Before she can even reply, I cover her eyes and walk her to the kitchen.

“Ta-daaaaa!”

“Aww, baby, you know it’s not our anniversary today, right?” Nina replied.

“Of course! But this is just my apology for how I was the other night, I was just trying to help but I can see that I could have done better, I’m sorry again.” I replied

“Please, it’s okay. I am sorry for how I acted as well, I know you were just trying to help, work has been so stressful, and this project is just draining my body. But I should be finished before the night of our anniversary!” Nina exclaimed.

We sit down and enjoy our dinner together, then settled in for the night with a movie. At this point I had already forgotten to bring up her arriving late, but I didn’t want to ruin the night, so I decided it was best to let that go.

It was Nina’s night to choose what movie we watch so she picked Mean Girls, it was one of her most watched films. I pretended to not enjoy the movie in front of Nina, but secretly it was a favourite of mine as well. At some point during the movie, I couldn’t help myself but bring up the crying from the night before.

“So, do you see stress related crying in sleep a lot at work?”  
“W... what? Oh, I mean, yeah you can see all kinds of response to stress in your sleep, vocalizing isn’t that unusual.” Nina replied.

“Oh, well that’s good then I guess. Is there anything I can do to help?” I asked.

“Not really, just finishing this project is the only thing that can remove this stress, you’ve done everything you can. I appreciate you. I love you” Nina said endearingly

“Well, then I cannot wait for that day to come. I love you too” I replied.

We went on to finish the movie.

 

As we started getting ready for bed, Nina brought up that she thinks its best for both of us if she just sleeps in the spare room while this project is still underway, so we don’t disturb each other through the night. I agreed and once we were ready for bed we kissed each other goodnight and went to our separate rooms.

I wake up feeling more refreshed than any time in recent memory, perhaps Nina’s stress crying was affecting me more than I had thought originally. To my surprise when I got up to say good morning to Nina, I noticed a coffee and toast on my bedside table. Nina must be reciprocating my token of appreciation with another one back. After finishing my toast, I brought the dish with me and my half drank coffee to find Nina smiling more than ever and cleaning all the dishes from last night.

“Well, someone is in a good mood, am I that much of a hassle that sleeping without me gives you that much energy?” I jokingly asked.

“Of course not my dear, I am just feeling like I am making strides on my project. Did you enjoy your breakfast?” Nina gleefully replied.

Before I replied, I had noticed Nina’s eyes. She looked so tired, like she hadn’t slept at all, yet she had such high energy, and I swear for a split second I could even see what looked like a shimmer come from her iris.

“Uh ha-ha, yes it was great. Thank you for that. Hey, did you get much sleep last night? You weren’t working on your project all night, were you?” I replied concerningly.

“Oh! No, well, yes. You see I was, but I also wasn’t, it’s kind of hard to explain but I did get some work done!” Nina replied

I gave her a look of confusion before I broke out into a smile again seeing Nina happy again.

“Well that’s good. I guess? So anyway, what’s your plan for the day? Do you think you can bring home some dinner for us since I cooked last night?”

“Of course, I’ll grab some drive-through on the way home. I’ll grab us the usual. Anyway I have to go to work. I’ll see you later” Nina said as she kissed me rushing her way out.

The day went quickly as I had decided to do some chores around the house since Nina’s vibrant energy rubbed off on me and motivated me to finally get some stuff done. While I was cleaning the study I was looking through the bookshelves and noticed some books that seemed really out of place. Nina and I had typically only kept books that related to our work but what I was looking at was a book on ancient occult rituals and another one on physic connections. Now Nina and I are both very disconnected from any spiritual parts of the world especially within our work so there is no reason for us to own these books. Although since I was in such a good mood I was able to overlook this as I could write it off as personal interest or some nuanced research.

The rest of the day was pretty uneventful, when Nina got home her energy was still high and she seemed even happier than before. The one thing that bothered me still is that her eyes still looked so tired and I swear her face is starting to look a little gaunt. I had to push past this as I didn’t want to push again and ruin what we had built back up to with each other even though it hurt me to see her like this. We did our nightly routine getting ready for bed and still deciding to sleep in separate rooms until her project is done, we kissed each other goodnight and went to our rooms.

We had burritos tonight which is our go to for when we are just having a lazy dinner, but this nights one has not sat well with me. I rush to the bathroom almost struggling to make it to the toilet, the second I take a seat it was like a shotgun blast out my rear end. It was the worst stomach-ache I had ever had but the forceful expulsion did provide almost an immediate relief at least. Unfortunately for me I think my diarrhoea woke my wife as I could here what sounded like a giggle from her room. I was blushing red as in the moment I had prayed she did not hear it. After cleaning up I decided to check in on her seeing as I had already awoken her. As I approached the door she had continued to giggle. Now I did think it was a funny moment, but I had taken a shower in that time since. Confused, I opened the door to her pitch-black room, only her muffled laugh emanating from the room. I had expected her to have stopped by now and react to me opening the door, but she kept laughing. I turn on the light, only to see her staring at the ceiling, holding her mouth trying to contain her laughter. She looked almost giddy with excitement. Creeped out now I walk over to confront her to settle down now. As I grab her arm, she doesn’t look at me, she doesn’t acknowledge me. She just sits staring, only looking at the ceiling. I can see in her eyes that shimmer I believed I had once seen. I shake her to try and get her to respond to me. The second I shake her she snaps out of it, she sits up and sways like she has vertigo, once again she goes to forcefully vomit, thankfully this time holding it back.

“Nina what the fuck, are you okay? I need to take you to the hospital.” I shouted.

Nina in such a daze doesn’t even register that I am talking.

Noticing this I pick her up and speed all the way to the hospital.

It’s 5am now at the hospital. Nina has been undergoing various tests and yet everything so far is coming back completely normal. The only abnormality so far is her stress leukogram. After the final lot of testing the only other thing they find is that she has some muscle atrophy throughout her whole body and some rapid weight loss. We’ve been in the hospital for 6 hours total now and the whole time she’s been in this pseudo-comatose state where she is just staring, unblinking, unresponsive, unaware. It would take another 6 hours until anything changed, I had sat with her the whole time. It had just hit lunch time, so I decided to take a quick break from watching over her and grab some food, but just as I was about to stand up Nina speaks.

“Hi! How are you? When do we get to leave the hospital?”

I freeze. I can’t even turn around to look, I feel like this mustn’t be real.

“N… Nina? You’re awake?” I say shakily as I turn to face her.

Her eyes are brighter than ever; I see that same shimmer shine across her eyes as if tiny gold flakes flowed through her iris’s. Her soul seemed vibrant, but her body was still weak.

 “Yes! Of course! My love, I’ve missed you. Can we please leave now, I think my project is ready.” Nina says with such vigour you would forget that her body looks like she hasn’t slept for months.

“We can’t, you need to rest. You had some sort of seizure, the doctors can’t find anything noteworthy from the tests, but your symptoms are concerning enough they are sending out your case to get second opinions from neurologists.” I told her with concern.

“I can explain it all later, lets just leave! C’mon!” Nina had already jumped to her feet before she could even finish her sentence.

I went to object, but she grabbed my arm and started walking us out of the room, seeing her happy and awake again blurred my judgment letting me just accept the situation and take us home. On our way out the nurse tried to flag us down to get us to stay but this just motivated Nina to move faster as she linked arms with me and started running. Before I knew it the nurse was shouting for help over the PA as they had Nina’s wellbeing on their mind to keep her in hospital. But it was too late, it was only a small hospital, and Nina was hauling ass so by the time anyone was close we had already made it outside to the carpark. Against my better judgment I brought us home, it felt like we were teenagers again, doing things we weren’t supposed to, doing things without thinking of consequences.

When we arrived home, she wouldn’t stop staring at me and smiling. I can’t help but smile back and ask.

“Yes?”.

“Do you know what today is?” Nina says with a huge smile and shimmering eyes.

“Today… Oh my god. Nina. Our 10^(th) anniversary. I am so sorry, I didn’t realize, I was so confused with waking up in the middle of the night, the hospital trip.” I stumbled over my words.

“It’s okay, I finished the project. I can’t wait to share it with you tonight.” Nina says with her unbreaking stare.

“You did? I don’t understand, I haven’t seen you work on your notes or bring anything back with you from the research centre, how can you be done?” I ask confused.

“Well, this wasn’t technically a project for work, yes Abby and I worked on it at work, but it was sort of our own thing. We didn’t want to share it with anyone, as, well, it’s hard to explain.” Nina replied.

“Please, explain it to me then.” I begged.

“It isn’t something I can explain, it’s something you have to experience. This is my gift to you, for our 10^(th) anniversary” Nina said, still smiling and staring.

“So I really can’t learn more until tonight?”. I asked sadly

“No, it is worth it. Trust me. I love you.” Nina replied

“I love you too.”

We pass the day by making food together, embracing each other, reminiscing, and by dinner time, Nina was ready to reveal more.

“So you know how I have been crying in my sleep?”.

“Yes! Do you think that’ll stop now that you’re finished with your project?” I said excitedly

“I wasn’t actually sleeping. Abby had been researching some interesting old documents about types of dreams and how different cultures could use them for spiritual guidance, and how they would use some herbs to enhance them. We had been working on modernizing this process and seeing what science we could find behind it. It took us a while, but we had both been working different angles to try and figure out what methods work and what produces any results. We ended up stumbling across a method that was so potent, we couldn’t share it with the world.” Nina replied.

“But you’re going to share it to me” I replied concerned

“This isn’t just some old school ritual, this is something different, paracausal, I can’t explain it. No one can explain it. You have to experience it. When you first pulled me awake, I was just first experimenting with this method, they weren’t tears of stress, they were tears of joy, and when I finally got it, I couldn’t help but laugh with overwhelming excitement and happiness, and I want that for you as well.” Nina said lovingly.

“I… I don’t know that I want that. I love you, you make me so happy, and I can’t ask for anyone else in this world. I get that this is a positive experience, and that it is life changing. You have to understand, you don’t even know the consequences of this. What implications it can and will have. I need you to understand, I just want you, I don’t want a psychedelic high that will alter my perception of reality, I just want you.” I said as a tear started to well in my eye.

“Please… do this for me. Once you do it, you’ll understand. I’ll be severing my connection tonight, to my body…” Nina smiling, but with a tear in her eye.

Before she can even finish what she is saying I cut her off yelling.

“Are you fucking crazy? Why would you ever do that? Nina, you cannot do this I…” Now in full tears, chocking up, unable to get my words out.

Finally catching my breath.

“Please, my love. I don’t know what I can say, you know how much I love and adore you and just want my life with you. This cannot work, even if it is a godly experience this is not going to work, what about our physical connection? What about our future? Our future kids? Friends? Family? Abby?” I say softer in the hopes of getting through to Nina.

“I know it’s hard.” Tears now fully enveloping Nina’s eyes.

“I love you Samuel. You have done everything you can for me. You can join me; in the nightstand there is a diary with instructions on how to join me. I will see you soon my love. I love you. Goodbye.” Nina standing, collapses in an instant, the gold shimmer leaving her eyes, her body going cold in an instant, her eyes losing all colour. She is gone.

Samuel completely breaks down into tears collapsing to the floor grabbing onto Nina’s body, begging, praying for her to come back. It feels like a dagger penetrates right into his chest as every breath feels like it plunges deeper and deeper. Screaming into the universe he holds her body. Nothing can separate them, he loved her. She loved him. It is over now, she is gone, he knows how he can join her, but his body refuses to move, he can’t leave her.

Nothing else matters if she isn’t there. My wife, my only sole mate. Gone. Hopelessness doesn’t even begin to describe life without her. I have to join her. I drag myself across the floor, the pain too much to handle but the love for her too strong to hold me back. I get closer, crawling. I lay by the nightstand and read the instructions.

This is it, I am sorry for what I leave behind, my responsibilities, my future, my failures, my family, my friends. I cannot go on in life if it is one without Nina. Please understand, I know this is selfish, but this is my choice.

 

I write this story to you from where we shimmer, you may be reading this from here, earth, past, present, future, it’s all the same. I can say the word now, now, and you will have read it before my existence and after. I leave this book with my body, if you wish to read it and use it, you can, I will be here. I can see my body now, as well as Nina’s. Both shimmerless, lifeless, husks. I can see us before we knew each other, before we loved each other, before we were sole mates. I cannot describe what Nina could not, I can experience what Nina could.

Nina, tell me to join you, I will see you soon my love, I love you. Goodbye.

I am with Nina now and she is with I.
