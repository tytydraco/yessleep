When I was 10 Years old I used to live in rural Utah with my mother.

 I loved it there because I used to be a huge biking enthusiast and the mountainous terrain was so fun to ride through.

 but that all changed when one day I was riding my bike when one day while I was biking a huge man in all black suit stop me while I was riding down a huge hill.

 I told him to get out of my way I riding my bike yeah I was kinda a prick back when I was younger.

And well this man in all black asked me if I’d like some candy now I was stupid back then but I knew that you should not take candy from strangers so i told him to fuck off .

The man in black said oh I’m sorry I didn’t know you were such a bad kid I said what ever and rode back to my house and told my mom. 

My mom said that I did the smart thing and that I was safe now that I was home but unfortunately she was wrong. 

 This part of the story is one I don’t want to much on because it still makes me feel violated.

For you see it was at night when I heard this man’s deep and rough voice tell me to wake up. And when I open my eyes I saw the man from earlier naked.

I yelled out for my mom but the man grabbed me by the mouth and and told me that she can’t save me.

And well he proceeded to fucking rape me and I was powerless to this hulk of a man as he did his perverted business and stopped when it was sun rise he walked out my room as I was completely frozen in shock. 

he told me this isn’t the last time you will see me before living my house and walking off to the mountains 

And when I regain my consciousness I walked out of my room and saw my mother on the floor with her head missing and also violated.

After this incident I was in my aunt’s custody in Texas and as I lived in Texas the same man kept sending me letters saying how I was like a son to him .

 Okay so fast forward to 10 years and I met a girl in college and we started dating and because of her I became less of a prick and started doing therapy to help me get past my trauma.

And a few years later she gave birth to my son to say I was over protective of him was an understatement.

Because I wanted to make sure that he never suffers the Same ordeal that I had so I installed cameras all around the house and I was a helicopter parent.

But unfortunately 10 years later I heard my son screaming and I grab a gun and ran to his room and saw the same man now raping my son .

I shot this man with several rounds in the chest and walked up to him and yelled why the fuck are you doing this 

This man told me the most fucked up thing I heard in my life and that broke me he said because your dad paid me to.

At that moment i lost it I screamed at him my father died this sick fuck said your father is still alive and he then gave me a paper whit a phone number before he died. 

I called the number and heard my father voice saying hello son I dropped my phone and froze but unknown to me my wife was standing there in complete terror.

Me my wife and son are staying in a motel and are currently trying to think of what to do I called the police but they haven’t helped I can’t sleep or eat.

All I am thinking is why is my father doing this to my family and is this the only man he’s hired  will I ever truly be safe I’m scared I have no idea what to do will somebody please help.
