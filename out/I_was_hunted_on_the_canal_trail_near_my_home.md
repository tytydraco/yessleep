I live in a safe town. They say it’s “great for raising kids” but what people mean is it’s pretty boring. We do have one thing though. There’s this amazing gravel trail that goes along a canal for miles and miles. For about seven miles there’s a lake on the other side and you’re rewarded with beautiful views of water on both sides of the canal. In the fall the leaves drift down onto the stagnant water of the canal and the colors are unbelievable. In the winter, you sometimes get this mist that rises from the water and envelops the stark branches that hang over the trail like a skeletal canopy. It’s almost magical when you’re there alone, and the only sound is your breath and your heartbeat. Some people do get creeped out by the fog but the seclusion has always been comfortable to me.

It’s only a problem if there’s a flock of geese or something on the trail and there’s no way to get around them. I only mention all this because it’s important to understand that you can’t really get off this trail once you’re on it. In the winter the water is freezing and there are miles of forests on the canal side. So if you’re on a run and you’re halfway along the lake, you can’t just bail out.

There was this one incident when I was little, though. Another kid, Riley, was playing along the path one afternoon and didn’t come home. A few days later the police found his body deep in the woods across the canal. He had swum through the canal, wandered through the forest for a few miles, and curled up beneath a tree to die. His clothes were blocks of solid ice, frozen to his body.

I have the image etched in my mind of his bike still being locked up at the trailhead when I walked down to look for him with everyone else. Except he was never gonna come back and get it and nobody knew the combination to the lock. I didn’t even know Riley that well but that realization really set me off as a kid, and I cried myself to sleep for days. All these years later, that image still really gets to me. 

After that the town started closing the trail at night, but we eventually came to terms with it as a freak accident and every kid knew not to go in the cold water. Though, I always wondered why he so abruptly went into the woods like that. He was a smart kid and he was only half a mile from the trailhead.

If you grew up in a town like mine, you probably forgot to look over your shoulder every once in a while. I know I did. On one cold December day, I pulled out of my parents’ driveway even as the shadows lengthened and the sun started to dip behind the row of trees at the end of my street. I was pretty serious about cross-country back then, and with regionals coming up, there was no chance I was skipping my workout. I didn’t think about the trail curfew, which I had ignored so many times anyways–and regardless I wasn’t planning on taking a swim. When I got to the trailhead in the fading light, the parking area was already closed. But I parked off the road, hopped out of my car, and set off at a blistering pace along the narrow trail. 

I’ve done a lot of runs along that trail. It was always very simple–I had so much familiarity with the trail, with the gentle curves and rolling of the gravel beneath my feet. I should have been on autopilot, as I had been every other time. But this time, I became keenly aware of the empty trail stretching behind and before me, the trees seeming to encroach from either side. The mist started to rise from the canal, but this time, it was anything but comfortable seclusion, and the trailhead started to fade away behind me as I pushed further ahead. Maybe it was because I had left my earbuds behind this time, and the silence was just a little more oppressive than usual. I checked my shoulder. What am I even looking for? The trail is empty. I turned back around and reminded myself that I was just being a chicken. The most important thing was to crush this workout.

As I kept going, I started to feel more comfortable. The fog had started to thicken, but I could barely make out the moon above me, lighting my way forward. My breathing and heartbeat stabilized as the mile markers passed by one after another, my feet churning at the ground below me. I started to smile as I passed the midway point–just one more mile before I could start the journey back home, to the warmth of a home-cooked dinner. 

In the fog, things appear slowly and then all at once. My nerves started to come back when I first noticed something in the mist. Nothing more than a shadow, still about 100 meters in front of me. My stride faltered, but at this point I still thought it was probably some stupid deer or another harmless jogger out for a late run. 

Just a few moments later, I was proven wrong. It wasn’t a deer, or another jogger.

It was a man. Tall, hands in the pockets of his oversized coat, walking in my direction. He wasn’t running or anything, but there was something deeply wrong with his movement. His stride was leisurely, but looked almost rehearsed. Like he was trying to act inconspicuous.

My stomach started to turn and I could feel the intensifying chills running down my spine. He’s probably just a guy out on a walk, I thought, the logical part of my brain straining to regain control against my rising panic. I pretended to check my watch, turned around, and started back the direction I came from. I surreptitiously checked my shoulder. Is he walking faster now? Holy shit, he definitely picked up the pace just now. The internal alarms became tornado sirens as I started panicking, my breath becoming ragged. No normal person would speed up like that.

I was running fast now, and he wasn’t, so he started to recede into the fog. For the first time, the black and freezing water lying on both sides of the trail was no longer just a beautiful view–it was a reminder that there is only one way out. 

This time, I didn’t get into a rhythm. It was uncomfortable, but I was pretty sure that if I pushed hard, there was no chance he could catch up before I got back to the trailhead. There is only one way out. Forward. My unease rose even further. I had been nervous from the beginning, before this creepy dude had blocked me along the trail. What put me on edge like that? 

And then, at the two-mile marker, the horrifying realization hit me all at once. There is only one way out. A fragment of memory, from the start of my run, exploded into focus. Yes, there was the uneasy glance over my shoulder, looking back towards my car. But this time there was also a faint beam of light, almost swallowed by the fog, barely visible as the trail fell away behind me. The faraway sound of an idling engine, cutting out, and then the silence. At the time I hadn’t even noticed it. Was there someone behind me back there? 

For the second time, I stopped short. The adrenaline was pumping through my body, I was gulping in air in ragged bursts, and my heartbeat hammered against my ribcage. I couldn't see the trailhead from there. I mean, I couldn’t see more than fifty meters down the trail in either direction, so it was hopeless. The fog was no longer comforting, in fact, I was now effectively blind. Behind me, the lake may as well have been an ocean stretching into the fog. The black water of the canal opened up in front of me, mirroring the thickly packed trees on the other side. 

Calm down. Control your breathing. At first, I couldn’t hear anything over my own heartbeat, only the shroud of silence in the fog. And then, barely audible, was a faint rhythmic tapping, or a scratching on the gravel. 

Footsteps.

Coming from the direction of the trailhead. 

The blood turned to ice in my veins. And the steps were getting louder now. Not running. Deliberate. Leisurely. Sinister. Just like before. The fog was so thick, I wouldn’t have been able to see someone until they were essentially on top of me. 

I was trapped. No way out. Except for Riley’s way.

At this point, I realized there was very little time before someone would appear on the trail in front of me. If they turned out to be harmless, it would have felt pretty stupid to do what I did next. But my paranoia was all-consuming by this point. I left my shoes on the side of the trail, took off my shirt, and braced myself. 

And then, I dove into the canal, the icy water rushing up to meet me.

The shock as I hit the water was awful. It took all the breath out of my lungs. My entire skin burned on contact, stinging deeply. I had expected to get numb at some point but it only got more painful. If I had gotten a muscle cramp, I would be dead. But, somehow, after fighting through the viciously cold water, I clawed myself up the opposite bank. I was shivering uncontrollably. And I looked back across the canal.

They were looking back at me.

Two men. Both tall. Standing next to each other, the darkness and fog almost enveloping them, but now only 40 feet separated us. 

If they’re harmless, they’ll call 911 right now and get me medical attention. I was still hoping.
They just stood there, still and seemingly controlled. Heads slightly tilted. There was an robotic blankness there, behind their eyes, like you would see in a bad animation. 

But their faces twitched frantically, their expressions shifting from one incomprehensible emotion to another, as if there was a violent and unpredictable current tearing their minds apart from the inside. 

I was mesmerized, unable to tear my eyes away from theirs. Something inside them was deeply wrong, in a way I’ll never be able to understand. 

I still see those twisting faces in my nightmares. Those broken, empty eyes staring out from the darkness. I’ve never seen anything like that again.

And then, the waves of pain and adrenaline came rushing back, and I staggered backwards. I inhaled the icy air, fighting back to life, knowing beyond doubt that they could and would stand there all night to watch me freeze to death. Just like Riley. 

But now there was only one way out–through the miles of thick forest. I was pretty sure there was a county road on the other side, or maybe a farmhouse. I gathered the last of my strength, and forced my aching body to limp towards the treeline. The downed branches tore at my feet, but quickly, I was swallowed by the forest and fog. 

Before disappearing entirely, I looked, one last time, over my shoulder at the other side of the canal.

There was now only one man standing there. 

I don’t know how long I was in the forest. I faded quickly even as I was pushing forward on my numb and rubbery legs. And every snapping branch, every rustling of the leaves against the wind became the sound of footsteps in pursuit. But I didn’t look back again. The stinging cold was slowly replaced by a radiating warmth that was almost worse, since that meant I was going hypothermic. They taught us the symptoms of hypothermia after Riley died.

And suddenly, there was the treeline.

The fog had cleared up at some point, and as I stumbled forward, I could see the moonlight on the open fields. There was a road, too, winding between the barren fields. I could feel my heart soaring as I pushed through the last few trees. Freedom. I was going to make it back home. 

Then I saw the car. 

It was parked beneath one of the tree breaks, and I almost hadn’t noticed it at first. The lights and engine were off, but I could make out a figure hunched over the steering wheel. As if he were waiting for something. What was he waiting for? I watched for a while, but he was perfectly still, his head turned towards the opposite field. I breathed a sigh of relief–he hadn’t seen me. 

I started retreating back into the shadows to stay out of sight. The headlights suddenly flickered on, illuminating the field in front of me. I was paralyzed, my chest tightening, hoping not to be spotted. The headlights started swinging around, in an agonizingly slow arc, until the trees around me were ablaze, and the piercing light blinded me. Shit. There was no way I hadn’t been spotted now. 

I tried to find more energy, but my breathing was becoming shallower, my legs giving way beneath me as I pushed back into the trees. It felt like the trees were becoming even thicker, if anything, and I could no longer feel any of my extremities. I could see the disgusting blackness of frostbite consuming the flesh on my fingers, and had to fight down the bile rising in my throat. My vision was becoming blurry, and I finally knew I had nothing left to give. 

And the ground suddenly gave way beneath me. I spilled out of the trees into a roadside drainage ditch. As the darkness creeped in, I heard the roar of an approaching engine.

A tear was welling up in my eye as I imagined Riley’s bike locked at the trailhead. Had this been what his last moments felt like? I felt the sensation of rough hands hoisting me off the icy ground, and then it all faded to black.

The Aftermath

I woke up at the hospital two days later. I was very lucky, the doctors said. If I hadn’t been picked up by a local farmer on his way back from town, I would have died in that ditch by the side of the road. In any case, I lost two fingers and four toes to frostbite. Obviously I didn’t run in regionals, or ever again. 

But I hadn’t been the only one to be out on the trail that night. 

It was one of my friends on the team, Gavin. Apparently he had gotten to the trail about two hours after I did and hopped the fence. They never figured out the details, but he didn’t even make it into the forest.

When they found his body off the side of the trail, the detective on the case threw up at the scene. I didn’t ask for specifics and didn’t want to know. 

The police never tracked down those men. They took a statement from me, but I don’t think I helped that much, and I never got the license plates on that car. In any case, the men had been clever enough to leave barely a trace. No DNA, no tire treads, nothing. “They probably skipped town,” one officer said, but the waver in his voice betrayed him.

I’m not so sure either. 

The town did finally close the trail. They dumped a bunch of concrete over the entrances, and now the only way to get onto that seven mile segment is by kayak. I don’t think people will stay away for that long, though. Memories fade, and someday it’ll just be an urban legend. 

You probably have a place like this near you. And it’s probably in a safe town, where nothing ever happens. All I’m trying to say is this.

Always look over your shoulder. And always ask yourself:

Is there only one way out?
