*The worst thing I ever did was save a mouse from drowning...*

*Now.*

“My favorite color is yellow” the pudgy thirty some year old woman to my left thought out loud. With her skin I would not be surprised if she never saw the sun before. “My name is Helga and I like sour things” she added, finishing her turn playing the game Two Truths and a Lie. A game that I suspect we are only playing because I’ve been here for eleven months and havent “opened up” like the doctors hoped. 

“That's great Helga” says the doctor who is also sitting with us in a circle to make us feel as though she is one of us. To further illustrate the point she tells us to call her “Phyllis” instead of “doctor” or “doctor” whatever their last name is. 

She isn't the only one here who does that either. 

“She doesn't like sour things” shouted a short haired blonde woman who is bordering on being too skinny and being far too wrinkly for her age. I don’t know her name because she is new here

“You're right” Helga says, impressed with her roommate.

“How about you?” Phyllis asks me.

I look up from the same four square tiles on the floor that I’ve been looking at since I was first wheeled in here on the wheelchair. When I see that she is indeed talking to me I point to my chest hoping that there is someone behind me or her eyes went crossed.

“Yeah, why not?” Phylis laughs. “It's easy. Tell us two truths and one lie about yourself”.

I think about how to respond. So far I have given them nothing during my stay here and I don’t want to give them anything they don’t already know. I have to participate to some extent however because being here is better than being in jail. Just as soon as I can feel the awkward silence set in my mouth moves into action without the consent of my brain. “I used to have a dog named Wyoming, I never drank imported beer and the worst thing I ever did was save a mouse from drowning”. 

“Why was it the worst thing you ever did?” asked Casey, the youngest of the guys here by at least five years. He came in here right after me. During my time here in the hospital I’ve learned not to get attached or to bond with anyone because this hospital is a waystop for people about to get rotated out to go to who knows where? Maybe a real prison? 

“That's the lie” Gene answered. A ‘no doi’ apparent in his voice.

“Are you a Capricorn?” Missy asks quietly between the noises where there was silence. I shake my head. 

She is about to ask more but Phyllis speaks up.

“That's good” Phyllis delivers this in such a way that I am the only one who thought it was said coldly. When I look back at her she does not look entertained and her eyes are locked on mine. “Its good to see you are getting your sense of humor back” she adds. Her face and attitude changes completely when she turns to the man on my right “How about you, Greg? Two truths and a lie.”

I force myself to look back at the same four black and white squares on the floor to pass the time. 

*Then*

It all started when I was ten and moved into Gray Hill. By the time that I was locked up I had lived there for so long that I hardly remember where we moved from.

Home was a small hobby farm with enough room for a small field, a garden and some chickens. 

Gardening was a learning process because the chickens would always pick the seeds from the ground. Once we got the fence set up around the garden to protect it we focused on a better coop for the chickens. 

We planted alfalfa in the fields and the first year was pretty much a bust as far as my dad was concerned. To me it was impressive though I had less to compare it to than my father did and I was at the age where it did not take much to impress me.

“It looks good to me” I said to my father, looking at the silo full of silage and the bales of hay in the shed. “Why do you think it isnt enough?” I added.

“This might be enough for our own stock this winter” my dad answered with a shake of his head. “But I was hoping that we could sell some hay for a profit”.

Thankfully the following years were more fruitful than the first because we started killing the mice that were eating our profits.

My dad figured that the best way to kill them was a bucket half full of water. Put some bait on the end of a string, tie it to a stick and then lay that stick over the width of the bucket. By the end of the week we would have close to two dozen dead mice in each of the traps we placed around the property. 

I felt bad for them at first but stopped when I saw the damage they could do.

My dad taught me a lot. Not just about the barn but about life and how to be a good person. So when he died my senior year by slipping on the ice while doing barn chores it was really hard on me. In order to take my mind off the pain I focused on doing things around the farm while my mom handled it by drinking. 

Before I graduated highschool she died while driving drunk.

That summer I went into the shed to retrieve the lawn mower and saw one of the buckets we use to catch mice. Balancing on the string was a mouse and as soon as it saw me it must have surprised the bastard because it fell into the water. 

Giving it no mind I decided to mow the parts of the lawn I was planning on doing that day. Usually each day I do a third of the lawn and it takes the better part of an hour. When I finished I returned the lawn mower and looked in the bucket. There was the mouse, struggling to stay afloat.

Feeling bad I picked it up by its tail and lifted it to the table beside me. Even if it does eat some of the crops which we were dependent on I still could not let it suffer like that. 

As I laid it on the table it just laid down where I put it, exhausted and breathing rapidly. Even for a mouse its breath was heavy and I swear I could hear it even as I left the garage. Before I left I shot a glance behind me and when I did I swear that it was thanking me.

Some time later, maybe the following week an uncle of mine came over to the house to drop off a trailer and store it in one of the sheds. An arrangement he had with my father.

“Hey, can you help me?” my uncle asked after I answered the door.

“Sure” I said with a smile and went to fetch my shoes. 

I really don't like my uncle because he likes to belittle me whenever he gets the chance. I think its his way of over compensating for the fact he was abandoned by his biological parents when he was a baby. Still though, he is family so I felt that I needed to help. 

“Will you be here later today?” he asked after I helped him back up the boat into the shed.

“No” I answered. "I have plans with Marilyn this afternoon."

“Well I am going to be here between two and five to drop off a boat and again a few hours after that so you will have to be here to help.”

“I got plans”.

“You said that” my uncle said, “but you are going to have to be here during those times”.

 I was really close to telling him off then but then it occurred to me that he likes to show off his money whenever he could so I decided to say, “I don’t remember you paying for storage this year”.

“Well” he said laughing. “I, well...”

“That's just storage and doesn't include my labor fees” I said with a smile. For far too long this asshole has taken advantage of the generosity of both me and my father. That stops now.

“Whoa, hold on a second” my uncle said before getting back in his truck.

“This year has been tough on me. Dad dying and all that” I say as I make my way back to the house without looking back at him.

“I know, but—”

“And money is tough” I said, tired of hinting that this was a demand. “And since you are a good Christian who looks out for your fellow man, plus the fact that you didn’t make it to your brother-in laws funeral, I think that maybe these fees should increase, don’t you?”

“What?” my uncle laughed. “No”.

“Well I do” I said, turning back around to head to the house.

My uncle left a short while later. That was the last time I saw him alive. On the twenty minute drive to his house his brakes went out and he got wrapped around a tree.

At his funeral I was told that this accident happened because a mouse chewed on the brake lines.

*Now.*

“What do you see?” Phillis asks as she flips over another Rorschach inkblot. 

I see an orange glow over the hill after a night of drinking.

“A man in a gangster hat.” I say trying to read the books on the shelf. “You know, Capone in the movies?” 

The books in her office don't appear to be related to psychology in any way. ‘Bacteriophage: Biology, Correction, and Display’, ‘Anatomy of American Pan Fish’ and ‘Superconducting Fibrification Of Neural Dendrites: Shielded Bioelectric Conduction’ among dozens of others. 

“And this?” she asks as she flips over another card. This time I see the last time I saw my mother alive.

“A beret,” I answer.

I hear a soft squeak somewhere in the walls but I ignore it.

Phyllis flips the next card without talking.

I see the fire which brought me here to the nut house and the paramedics who had to sedate me.

“A large straw hat”.

“This?” she asked, bored with how little information I was giving her.

I look at the card she layed out. I see everyone calling me a murderer as I get dragged into the courthouse. 

“A hard hat” I answer, almost saying “firefighters helmet” a second time.

“Lots of hats today” she says with no hidden disappointment.

“How much longer” I ask with an equally bored expression.

“You gotta be anywhere?” she asked, snarkily.

“I gotta make a tin foil hat” I joke.

She sets down the card after giving me a hurt expression. Another moment of silence as she was putting the cards away in her small bag I hear another squeak in the walls. I almost ask her if she hears it but before I do she asks me if I wanted to talk.

I shrug even though the answer is a hard no. Still, there isn't much else to do in Goose Creek Sanitarium so I ask her “What about?” 

“I don’t know. Anything” she suggests. She leans forward and smiles before setting the pen on her lip and adds “You pick”.

“Is today Wednesday?”

“Yes. Why?” she asks, confused.

“It's meatloaf,” I say disappointedly. “I don’t like the meatloaf here”.

“Want to talk about your uncle” she asked suddenly. Her question startles me because they usually ask me about Marilyn. This was the first time they brought him up and it is more than a little surprising.

“Which one?” I ask. “I have six of them.”

“The one that died” she says a little more firmly.

“What about him?” I ask playing dumb. “Went off the road and hit a tree”.

“How did his death make you feel?” 

“Terrible thing.”

She nods. “Any good times with him?” She adds after a moment.

I am very still and I am unable to think of one good time I had with the man. Finally the doctor changes the subject.

“What about Marilyn?”

I know that a shot of anger must have been seen in my eyes when I looked up from the tile floor because my doctor flinches, then she smiles. I hate her for that fucking smile.

“I love her” I say, nearly breaking down and rambling. If I started I would not be able to but I stop myself so I don't say anything. In that silence I think of all the things Marilyn and I did together. All the times we made love, laughed at the same dumb jokes, building chicken coops, swimming in nearby lakes and rivers as well as eating the lunch I packed for our picnics. Whenever she picked the location it was the small airport where the small single engine planes would fly over once every few hours. I didn't know what she saw in the location or why it was her favorite place at the time, but Marilyn would later explain to me that she loved the sound of the plane engines. To her it was freedom to go wherever she wanted, to do whatever she wanted. 

To finally leave that dead end of a town once and for all. 

Remembering this about the love of my life my chin trembles. I think of all the things I never said and all the things I would never get a chance to say again. 

Squeak.

The water works kick in and the tears flow.

None of it is an act. 

I know that she is going to want to talk about this ‘major step forward’ at our next session as she tells me to let it all out and that crying is healing.

“How did she die?”

I tell Phyllis two truths and a lie.

*Then.*

Marilyn always accused me of never listening to her but never seemed to remember the little things I did for her. I know I did things that annoyed her too but we loved each other. 

It was about a month after my uncle's funeral that I planned to pop the question. My plan was for us to go canoeing on one of the last good weekends of the year. Once we got to the right spot I acted like finding a small waterfall was an accidental discovery. We crouched under the waterfall and when we were behind it I went down to one knee to propose. 

When she said yes I became the happiest man on earth.

I kept my nose out of most of the planning since Marilyn was better at these kinds of things. The only thing I wanted was the location of the wedding to be at the church I went to since I was a kid, Jesus on Main here in Gray Hill. However Marilyn had her heart set on it being a destination wedding.

We argued about it. She said a destination wedding would be more romantic than a church that smelt of ammonia and vomit. While I agreed with that point (and argued that it could be held outside) lots of the people we knew wouldn't be able to go if going meant getting a plane ticket. 

Maybe I am not wording that correctly. We didn't argue. We disagreed. It never got louder than talking. In fact Marilyn would get quiet when she got mad so people would quiet down in order to hear her. 

I never yelled. At least at people. I shouted at equipment failures and inanimate objects when things didn't go my way but I rarely shouted at people.

What really made everything come to a boil was when her mom wanted to micromanage everything. Not only that, she wanted to come and stay with us for the months before we got married for some reason. I’ll admit, this caused me to shout because her mom was nice but only in small doses. 

I told Marilyn that I didn't want her mother staying here. If she wanted to micromanage the wedding that was one thing, but I wouldnt allow that vile woman in my house. We talked about this at length and I thought I convinced Marilyn of my way of thinking. Then one day I was coming into the house from raking the alfalfa fields only to see the two of them unloading her mothers car. Obviously with the intention of an extended stay considering how many bags she brought with her.

I pulled Marilyn aside and spoke with her. Quietly at first but soon I started to yell about the goblin she has as a mother in the other room and I didnt give a damn if she heard me. 

Marilyn said that it was her house too but I countered this by saying we were not married yet and the house was in my name. I wanted that woman out of my house and when this was refused I had to leave to clear my head. 

When I left the house I didn't have a destination in mind so I drove straight to Moes Bar. 

While there I was pretty vocal about my distaste for Marilyns mother. I was there for perhaps two hours by the time I heard the fire engines roaring past. 

The more I drank, the more I spoke ill of her until finally I was cut off and told to go home.

Begrudgingly I did just that and even though I was drunk as a skunk I was allowed to drive home. Something I should not have done but at the time I didn't care. 

Around the twists and turns so commonly found in Gray Hill an orange glow came into view. The closer I got home the brighter it got until I finally saw my house on fire.

I pulled into the driveway and when a firefighter told me to turn around I pushed him out of my way, explaining that it was my house. I screamed for Marilyn. I even shouted for her mother but then someone told me that they didn't make it out.

Between the screaming and the crying the rest of that night is a blur. I must have passed out because the next thing I knew was that I was in the police station and being charged with arson.

*Now*

It used to be that the mouse would come around occasionally but now it comes around every night.

I know it sounds dumb, worst case makes me sound crazy, but I try speaking to it when I am alone. Thankfully I was given a room all to myself so no one ever sees this. 

“Do you think you're helping?” I ask the cursed thing as it just sits there in the duct. “Is that why you're doing this? Get me out of this room, this building you dumb son of a bitch” I beg, hoping it understands. With this the mouse scurries off, where to I don’t know.

I nearly laugh. Did I really expect it to understand me? Am I really insane or am I just that lonely?

I want to cry, instead I sit in the corner of my dirty cell and feel sorry for myself because there isn't much else I can do under the circumstances. 

Without a clock or a window I have no idea what time it is or how much time has passed before the mouse returns. This time with the lanyard of an orderly who I remember overhearing lost his some time ago.

I don’t know how the mouse managed to obtain it and I have no idea what I should do with it. It's not like I can unlock my cell from the inside. It leaves again the same way it came, through the vents. 

Perhaps an hour later I [caught a whiff of smoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/comments/wsvf49/headline_goose_creek_sanitarium_sold/).

A few agonizing moments pass and I wonder why I’m not hearing an alarm. Shouldn't the doors open if there is an emergency?

Other patients start waking up to the smell and start screaming. This only wakes up the others who also start to scream. Soon the sound is ear piercing. 

The smell of smoke is overwhelming now. There is a very good chance of this being the end. I consider praying even though God and I aren't on the best terms considering everything that led to me being here. 

Right when I am about to kneel and clasp my hands together in prayer I hear a familiar squeak at the door. It's the mouse that has haunted me ever since I saved its life. 

For a moment I think it's here to gloat about my impending death but a moment later the door begins to open up. At first I thought the mouse had somehow opened it but how could that be? There must have been an emergency switch that was pulled that released me. 

I rush for the door and am greeted by blinding smoke. As I start to cough I remember the lessons I learned while on a school trip to the firehouse: Smoke rises so I should crawl on my belly so I dont inhale the smoke.

I get on my belly and crawl to the exit but soon I get turned around.  I should know where the exit is, God knows I thought about rushing towards it and running away enough times. Perhaps it is the new perspective of being on the ground, the adrenaline of being in a fire or both?

Just before I start to panic another squeak is heard. 

Exhausted of options I crawl towards the sound and after far too many hallways I come to a door. I reach up to open it and when I do I realize that I am not where the inmates go to get some fresh air. I am in the employee parking lot. 

A man runs to me and helps me up. 

“Is there anyone else?” he shouts.

All I can do is cough. I don’t bother shaking my head.

In my hand he sees the orderlies ID and when I see him trying to look at it I show him the picture of a man who with a beard and a heavier face.

“Alright Bob” he said pointing to the cars behind him. “The fire department should be here soon. Take my keys and move my car so they can get to the fire hydrant” he says while jabbing his finger to the blue station wagon. “I’m going in” he adds as he turns to run into the building.

As my coughing fit subsides I look at the keys in my hand, the ID in the other and wonder what the hell just happened. Behind me his car is next to the fire hydrant. He must have seen the fire and parked wherever so he could help those inside. 

That’s when I hear a squeak by my feet. When I look down I see the mouse looking up to me. Its eyes are big and black. It reminds me of my dog, Wyoming, after it brought a dead bird in the house and wondered if its a good dog for bringing it in.

I told myself that if the day ever comes when I get the chance to kill it I would. If I wanted to I could easily stomp it but I don’t.

It's the only friend I have left in the world.

“Alright buddy” I say as I kneel down to let it run on my hand and up my sleeve where it rests on my shoulder. “Let's get out of [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/)”
