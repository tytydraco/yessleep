I live in a moderately sized town, since I was born I always felt that in my town nothing ever happened and I always wished for some sort of event that would put a lil bit of spice in that boring and dead town. I was so wrong.

One day out of nowhere hundreds of men started to come to our town, buying buildings, houses, stores etc… the first thought I had was that there might be a money laundering business going on since the stores they bought were almost empty and only had really cheap and often expired food + all the men seemed shady as fuck and when talked to they would often respond cursing at you or simply staring, as if they were robots. They often had a necklace with a strange symbol, similar to the zodiac (the killer) symbol but I always thought it was just a religious symbol of their community

I did some research on them and online they basically don’t exist, I heard one of them refer to another by name and searching them up revealed that they don’t have any social media or any kind of trace online so I suspect they might use fake names or they don’t use internet at all. All I found was a weird site with that symbol I talked about earlier, although I can’t find It anymore (this research was a couple months ago and my job requires lots of google search, I’m a programmer, scrolling back in my search history would require lots of work)


 Recently people have been disappearing in my town and it’s all over the news, the strange thing is that the police said that the culprit might be a secret organization similar to a mafia hidden within the town, as soon as I heard that I immediately knew who was responsible for the kidnappings or possible murders; and it seemed like the police suspected the weird community too, but a few days later the investigations for all the murders and kidnappings all ceased, and every case was declared closed for “lack of evidence”

Yesterday something important happened
I was walking down a street when I saw a well distinguished gentleman with a walking cane, dressed extravagantly with pink and purple, once he started walking, from the shadows a few men dressed elegantly started to follow him staring intensely at his back as if making sure he was safe. The strange group then stopped at a hotel where I saw them take a strange substance from under the carpet, they then proceeded to ride the elevator to an unknown floor. Luckily a friend of mine is a security guard there and he let me access the security camera that has a clear view of the elevator(I know it’s illegal as fuck but he was as interested as me as to what these strange people were doing), I’m gonna post the photo I got from the security footage.

My friend also told me that they come here every day, but since the substance (which looks like white powder, I guess it’s prob cocaine) is hidden in a blind spot of the camera they never got caught by him. Looking back at footage of the hotel he noticed how a janitor every night gets into the hotel at 5 am with an unknown set of keys that he shouldn’t have and he briefly stands right were they take the substance before exiting the hotel again

This is honestly creeping me out and to know the things I know I did so many violations of privacy and looked at so much footage of cameras that I shouldn’t look at. i fear that if I tell the police I might be the one getting in prison since they seem to not give a shit about the crimes these people probably committed 
Do I alert the authorities?
