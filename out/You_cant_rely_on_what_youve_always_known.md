I ran away from home at fifteen. In my parent's house lived a friendly spirit; this spirit watched over me as I slept, ensuring that I would be far out of my father's violent reach while I drifted off each night. 

At fourteen years old this spirit vanished. I like to believe that they were finally able to move on, but their eternal happiness resulted in me being sentenced to what felt like eternal hell. Growing up I was beaten for "standard" things. I forgot to rinse a dish. I received an A- on my report card. I dared to ask my father a question when he "wasn't in the mood" to deal with me. 

I only lasted five months in that house without my guardian. After a brutal beating I found myself alone in my room focused solely on trying to stop the bleeding from a particularly nasty split lip. I pulled the paper towel away from the injury, noting how blood welled upon the surface of the wound, immediately dripping toward my chin, turning rapidly into a waterfall of crimson that I could not quell. As a drop hit the sink, I felt in my soul that my existence in this house was complete. My eyes drifted upward to meet my reflection, a stranger staring back at me as I tried desperately to bring thoughts forward and found instead silence burning in my brain. The silence was replaced by static, white noise, as I continued to stare into my own eyes. No decisions were reached, but a bag was thrown onto my bed by the "me" I saw in the mirror and I, a ghost of myself acting as my own guardian, decided that enough was enough and anything was better than remaining in that house. 

As an adult who has dealt with an unknown number of spirits, I now understand that I truly was my own guardian that night. My own, living, spirit understood that if I did not escape that house at that exact moment, I would never escape alive at all. I liked to believe, in a way, that it was the friendly spirit I grew up with intervening one last time. Still protecting me. I didn't realize at the time that I was instead protecting myself. 

Since that night I have somehow, with an insane amount of grit, managed to carve out a little paradise in this unrelenting world. It's not much, but I've managed to always live alone, slightly below my means. When it's time to move I specifically seek out real estate listings that feel just a little off. These listings are usually discounted because a lay person can still feel a general sense of unease when touring the property, meaning that the space is particularly hard to find a lessee for. For me this has been a saving grace, allowing me the opportunity to always find an affordable place to call home.

Once you've lived with a spirit you can increasingly sense all others. You become more in tune with their energy. You no longer write off that cold pocket of air in the kitchen; you notice when objects are no longer where they should be, even if they've moved by just a millimeter. If you're as in tune as I am, you can even sense the spirit itself trying to move the object and watch in real time as it manages to slide the littlest plate by just the slightest degree. 

I'd always assumed all spirits are friendly, and perhaps it was because they could, on some ethereal level, sense the despair that surrounded me and decided I was a sister in their misery. Perhaps they sensed I was as unwillingly on this plane as they were and instead of aggression chose to show me some form of otherworldly compassion. That is, until I moved into my most recent home.

The home was built in 1812 in downtown Boston, one of the most haunted cities I've encountered in my moves across this country. The moment I walked across the threshold I was hit with a wall of energy, a wall so strong that it seemed to try and forcibly repel me from the dwelling. Despite this barrier being built with no tangible material I felt as though I'd literally walked face first into solid stone. Instead of being frightened I felt a sense of familiarity; I felt as though this was a hot bed of activity and, for once, I'd have not just one "roommate," but many. I incorrectly assumed that I'd finally be welcomed home into a vibrant and lively spiritual community. I signed the lease that same day, barely noticing the look of relief on the leasing agent's face as I did so.

I went about life as usual for close to a month before the haunting became sinister. The home I'd usually come back to simply felt alive. One day I made my way home, zig zagging through my usual alleyways, visiting my favorite bar, and as rain began to gently pitter patter on the cobblestones around me, darker clouds rushing in to block out all light from the sky, I reached my front door. I struggled to insert the key, but once I'd finally gotten it and heard the now familiar click, the door swung open, a little too forcibly, on its own. 

Instantly, crushing silence met my ears. I could no longer hear the rain, though I felt it pelting my face as the storm whipped up. The wind met my hair and threw raindrops into my eyes, forcing me to squint, but no whooshing could be heard. There was no rustling of leaves, no footsteps of other passers by hitting my ears as they sloshed through the growing puddles on the sidewalk. Just like my thoughts on the fateful day when I left my home at fifteen, I was met again with sheer nothingness as I stared into the black foyer of my home. 

Despite my desire to step forward I stood frozen on the stoop, continuing to stare into the blank, black abyss before me. I strained to decipher any noise, but none met my ears. I could detect no movement, nothing nefarious ahead of me, and so I attempted to step forward across the threshold, my feet feeling as though they were encased in concrete, struggling to make one single, solitary movement.

I managed one step. Another. On the third I'd officially entered my home and with my entrance my ability to hear came back, tenfold. Noise assaulted me. Every winded breath I took, every movement of each vehicle, each raindrop, thundered within my ears, reverberating until I was weak in the knees, descending into a fetal position, clutching my hands over my ears in an attempt to make it all stop. 

The moment my side hit the floor my sense of hearing seemed to stabilize. I looked up, hands still steadfast, protecting my ears, still seeing no movement in the perpetual blackness before me. I slowly drew them away from my head and noticed the gentle, familiar drip drop of the rain once again. 

Tentatively I rose from the ground, taking a step, my feet markedly lighter, allowing me normal movement. I made my way toward the light switch and flipped it, filling the hall with a warm glow. I breathed in, and as I went to release my calming breath the light flicked off of its own accord, plunging me into darkness once again. With my hand still on the switch I flicked it on and off again and again with no effect. I spun on my heels, looking toward the outside, hoping to see each light snuffed, expecting a power outage, but instead was met with all streetlights and neighbor's windows emitting comforting light, reflecting off the puddles in the street. As I craned the front door slammed shut, cutting off all light that had been streaming in, and I heard the deadbolt slide into place with a deafening echo filling my ears, making me feel as though I'd been shut within with little hope of escape.

Without thinking I rushed toward the door, attempting to release the deadbolt, but was met with so much resistance that I quickly understood the attempt was futile. I felt droplets of sweat begin to breech my brow, slowly dribbling down my forehead stinging my eyes with salt.  

I turned on my heel, launching off my back leg through the hall toward the kitchen. As I breeched the archway all cabinet doors flung open, emptying dishes onto the floor in a deafening crescendo, all ceramic clattering and crashing against the floor. Splinters of plates, bowls, cups all flinging themselves into the air and against the floor as if a silent explosion had occurred, some seeming to come pointedly, directly for me, shrapnel slashing my skin and covering me in small cuts, barely missing my eyes, causing my flesh to ignite in pain as each small piece made contact with my body.

I quickly covered my eyes, scanning my brain for a next move. None came to me, and I acted on instinct, fleeing toward the sunroom, knowing the doors would be locked and I would have to break through them, no longer fearing for my own safety. All my brain was focused on was finding my escape. This was an entity, the likes of which I had not encountered before when dealing with ghosts. This entity felt like my father, filled with rage and vengeance, fueling my need to escape. I felt a familiar, protective, presence encapsulating my body, kicking in, taking over, driving my body to find any possible way out.

No longer in control, I continued to run at a full sprint, launching myself toward the glass, feeling the same feeling of concrete encase my body, attempting to stifle my escape. Despite the immense slowing of my projection, I broke through the glass doors of the sunroom, and, before the entity could encase me again, I continued, launching myself through the final glass barrier, landing on the soft grass, my flesh aflame, fresh cuts from the glass making themselves known as if my body were on fire, the raindrops once again hitting my face.

I lay there gasping for air for what felt like an hour before I finally looked up toward the sunroom window and saw a black figure staring directly toward me. The figure was still but not stagnant, there was a billowing of smoke off each appendage despite the figure itself standing still as a statue, continuing to stare me down as if daring me to reenter. 

I never entered that house again. I no longer seek out haunted homes, though I do feel some comfort when I encounter spirits in my daily life. That day my safe haven was severed, and I have since distanced myself from the spiritual world. The troubling thing, though, is the ever-present desire to return to that house, as if the figure is calling me. As if they're trying to draw me in. But I think it's time to move on from my connection to the spirit world.
