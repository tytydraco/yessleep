When my wife Sarah died of pancreatic cancer, everything changed in ways I couldn't even begin to imagine. I could no longer afford the house we bought together on my income alone, so I had to sell the property at a loss and re-locate to an older, smaller home on the edge of town. The weeks blurred into months as grieving members of her family came by to collect belongings left behind in the will. Friends stopped by to offer a shoulder to cry on and help move me into the new home.

Having a job that allowed me to work from home used to feel like an incredible perk. Without Sarah around and little to no reason or motivation to leave the new home I found myself living in, that perk began to feel more suffocating. At first, I dismissed the subtle shadows moving around in the peripheral of my vision as just a side effect of my grief stricken mind. I'd oftentimes hear odd noises emanating from somewhere in the house, but I'd ignore it, thinking it was just a byproduct of how old the place must have been.

One night I asked an old high-school buddy of mine, Donny, to help move in some old furniture with his truck. Even without offering to pay for the gas, he seemed happy to help and offer his condolences. After his decade old pickup made the trip down that old dirt road for the last time, I invited him inside for a drink.

We were at the table, catching up on old times, when he offered up a suggestion:

"Y'know, Mike, this new place of yours is kinda creepy. I think it could use a remodeling."

I let my gaze sweep around the kitchen before offering up any response. Faded floral wallpaper and warped wooden floorboards reinforced his point.

"Yeah, I'll probably get around to it eventually."

"Hey, if you ever need me, man," Donny said, placing a hand on my shoulder. "I'm here for you, buddy."

A weak smile was the best I could muster. We talked about old friends and new hobbies and for a moment I almost forgot Sarah was gone. But Donny needed to go home eventually, and once again I found myself alone in a home I couldn't seem to feel familiar with.

Well beyond midnight, I sulked in the living room and gazed out at a full moon that brought a subtle glow to the backyard. An overgrowth of tall grass and weeds choked the ground outside, reminding me of yet another chore I'd need to address. It was during this thought I caught a faint shimmer of my own reflection in the window, and the shadow of a person standing behind where I sat on the couch.

I spun around, heart nearly exploding into my throat, only to see the empty kitchen illuminated by faint moonlight. Glancing back at the window, the shadowy image I saw was gone. Realizing I must have been way too tired and overwhelmed, I headed off to a nightmare filled sleep that only lasted a few hours.

After six full months had given Sarah's passing all it needed to fully sink in, I slipped into a daily routine. I'd wake up at the crack of dawn, get my work done just in time for lunch, and spend the rest of my day outside of the house. Not just because my friends recommended hobbies and doing literally anything to keep my mind off of the grief, but because there was just something about being alone in that house.

I couldn't stay outside forever, of course, and eventually I'd have to come home and put in earplugs to drown out the creaks, scratches and occasional soft whispers that would randomly resonate from within the walls. Donny even laughed when I told him I'd gotten into the habit of sleeping with the lights on because I was tired of shadows moving around in places they shouldn't.

Things took a sudden turn for the worse when we began remodeling. Donny showed up one night with his truck full of paint, tools and other stuff and we got to work doing what he suggested just half a year prior.

"What the hell?"

Donny exclaimed, nearly making me bump my head on the pipes underneath the sink as I crouched down to clean the rust.

"What?" I asked, turning to see the color drain slightly from his face.

"Something just moved in the hallway over there, Mike!"

He pointed down the dim passage that connected the kitchen and living room to the two bedrooms. I didn't see anything there, but after experiencing the creeps for months on end, I didn't have any reason not to believe him.

"Was it a shadowy figure?"

"Yeah, how'd you know?"

I sighed and took off the rubber gloves that were soaked with rust removing chemicals.

"I've been seeing stuff like that since I moved in, thought it was just my mind processing everything, but I guess not."

"Mike, do you believe in paranormal stuff? Because whatever I saw seriously just gave me the creeps."

I pondered the question for a moment. In another life, I would have told Donny I was a hard skeptic; that facts and logic could explain away anything.

"Man, after the last six months, I don't know what's possible."

After Donny left that night, I decided to do some research about the house online. Couldn't find much, other than the fact it was foreclosed in the 70's because the owner couldn't make payments on the mortgage. There was one curious detail, however: online it was listed as a three bedroom house, yet I only had two.

In the following weeks, activity ramped up as Donny and I got more work done on the house. The day we replaced the old floorboards in the kitchen, a mug somehow fell out of a closed cabinet and shattered on the counter tops. Random splotches of blood appeared on the bathroom walls and Donny denied any involvement of it being there. The worst experience had to be the night we replaced the busted window in the guest bedroom; because we both heard loud and heavy footsteps coming from the kitchen. When we went to investigate, hundreds of dead flies were sprawled across the floor even though I've never had a fly problem.

"Man, I can't do this anymore, Mike. This is freaking me out."

That was all Donny had to say about the flies that night before grabbing his things and stepping out for the last time. I decided that night to list the house for sale with a realtor online. Unfortunately, because this house was an old fixer-upper that sat far away from town on a lonely dirt road, I'd never see anyone interested in buying. Not even after lowering the price several times.

One day, I looked into acquiring the old floor plan for the house to figure out the layout for some plumbing issues. That's when I noticed the diagram showed a third room that didn't seem to exist. This room, according to the floor plan, would sit between the guest bedroom and the kitchen, connected by a third door in the hallway where Donny saw that shadowy figure one night. Sure enough, I took a tape measure and calculated the square footage for the guest bedroom and the length of the hallway and discovered there was more than enough space accommodate another room.

I called up Donny to try and convince him to check it out with me, but he remained firm on never stepping foot into my "haunted" house ever again. Resigning to the fact I'd have to rent some of my own tools for the job, I began tearing down the wall that would hide this supposed third bedroom.

Picking the central most spot on the hallway, I slammed a sledgehammer into the drywall and found success with a fist-sized hole. Crouching down, I peeked into the hole, only to find pitch black on the other side. After smacking the wall a few more times to make the hole bigger, I retrieved a flashlight and directed it into the darkness.

Ice rushed into my veins when I saw what lay beyond in a mostly empty room. Hanging on the wall and reflecting the beam of my flashlight was an ornate mirror with gold trim, appearing like a relic from the past. It wasn't the mirror that caused my blood to freeze over, however: it was the human skull that sat directly underneath it on the floor.

It took the police all night to investigate that room and search the property for any additional remains, but that skull was all they could find. They tore a doorway sized hole in the wall during their investigation, leaving that mirror on full display whenever walking down the hallway. I put the mirror up for sale online, but I didn't have any more luck selling that old antique than I did the creepy house it was found in.

Every night since opening that hidden room, I'd swear there would be a figure in the mirror every time I walk down the hallway to get to my bedroom. One night when I got up to use the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of an emaciated, bony arm protruding out of the hole in the wall leading to that room, only to be gone when I did a double take. That's when I had enough of that damn mirror. I took it down and put it in the closet where I wouldn't need to look at it anymore.

When I awoke the next morning and saw that mirror hanging back on the wall, I knew I had to get the hell out of that house. This wasn't grief or faulty memory or even a carbon monoxide problem, something was deeply wrong with the house I had purchased and I couldn't stand being there anymore.

I was an hour into packing my bags for a long extended trip to go somewhere, anywhere else when I heard a soft cry coming from the hallway. If it didn't sound like her, I would have given that hallway and by extension that mirror the bird.

"S-Sarah...?"

The crying stopped, but I knew it was her voice, there couldn't be any mistaking it that was *her* voice! My heart beat a million times in the few moments it took to slowly walk over to the opening in the hallway. Standing there at the precipice of a room that had not existed until just a few days ago, I found my gaze drawn to the mirror. That's when her face began to materialize...

Her red hair, freckled face, and arresting green eyes. A deep longing tugged at my heart and sank it into sorrowful depths as I blinked and the apparition of my wife vanished from the mirror. I stood in a deeply uncomfortable silence for what must have been ten full minutes before the smoke alarm snapped me back to reality.

Rushing out of the hallway, my jaw dropped at a wall of fire that erupted out of the decades old stove and began consuming the walls and cabinets around it. The gravity of the situation didn't dawn on me until I had grabbed what little belongings I could and escaped from the smoke that rapidly began filling the home.

According to the firefighters, the blaze was caused by some fault in the gas lines that combusted when an old wire somehow came into contact with the gas line. Yet, when I looked at the roaring flame that consumed that old house and I swore I saw a twisted face materialize in the heat and ash, I wasn't so sure.

It's been a few years since that all happened, and I live in a new house in the city now. A cozy one bedroom, one bathroom flat that accommodates everything I'd ever need. Part of me is still grieving, of course. What brings me to tell this story is the fact I got a package in the mail yesterday, marked with no return address. When I opened the package and saw the color draining from my face in a mirror that should have been melted years ago, I knew right then and there I shouldn't have tampered with that old house.
