The Auto Stalker rolled over its side with a shrill rending of metal, and I shut my eyes, both arms around the unconscious Lucille.

*Splat.*

Wet mud broke my fall, and the truck inverted to cover us like a trash can lid. My head swam, the submachine gun jabbed me in the ribs so hard I wondered if they’d crack, and my back flared in protest from something hard under it. Branches snapped from the rollover, twigs rained down on the underside of the disabled pickup, and a new sound cut through the chilly air.

A deep, carnivorous roar.

I blinked from where I lay in the gloom of the truck bed, only a few slivers of light on either side where it didn’t completely touch the muck, and caught a flash of gray somewhere outside.

My blood turned to ice, and I fought to draw air into my sore lungs.

*So, that’s what you were running from.*

Even with my limited field of view, I would have recognized the smooth gray skin anywhere, along with the crocodilian lower jaw on a log-shaped head, several yellowed teeth poking out the side the size of steak knives. These were the stuff of nightmares, spoken of in whispers by our guards even within the safety of our fortress, strong hunters, smart, and wicked fast.

Fast enough to make a herd of Auto Stalkers stampede in blind panic.

Long black claws gripped the bedside of the truck mere inches from my grimy face, and the upside-down Auto Stalker let out a long horn blast of pain as unseen jaws ripped into its exposed metal belly. Sinews squelched and popped, rubbery flesh squished between teeth, and thick dribbles of an off-orange fluid began to trickle down between the rusted holes in the truck bed, the lifeblood of a sunlight-adapted Techno. The predators outside chewed the alien meat hidden beneath the charred hood of the fallen red pickup, and more of their clawed brethren padded closer across the mud as the rest of the Auto Stalker herd fled into the distance.

*Birch Crawlers.*

From where I huddled in the cold muck, I could smell their rancid breath, hear their chittering reptilian grunts, and sense triumphant glee in how they tore at the pickup above us. Mutants preyed on each other for food, but wouldn’t pass up an opportunity for a nice, crunchy human if given the chance. If they flipped the truck for any reason, the beasts would be right on top of us.

Heart pounding in my chest, I scuttled on my side with Lucille in tow until I reached the back of the truck bed and fumbled for my pistol with one tingly arm.

Above me, the chewing stopped, and a muffled sniff made the pulse roar in my eardrums.

*They know.*

Born without eyes, Birch Crawlers were still top-tier predators, and some of the fiercest Organics that existed in the zone. Their log-shaped, twig-fringed heads bore enough sensory glands to smell the pheromones released by an animal in fear, and their smooth skin could pick up the slightest movement in the ground beneath their feet. Strong as a gorilla and fast as a horse, they could only be brought down by a hail of well-placed bullets, and in the cramped wreck of the Auto Stalker, my Type 9 lay stuck behind my shoulder blade. Even if I could empty my handgun into the first one, it wouldn’t be enough for an entire pack of these monsters, and from what I could tell, there were easily four or five out there. I had only one option left . . . and it almost frightened me more than the mutants did.

Almost.

A long row of jagged yellow teeth lowered into view, the red gums in between signifying yet another sunlight-adapted mutant. They were all slowly doing that, molting their nocturnal restrictions, and soon would spill out into the wider world. Not all survived their first step into the sunshine, but enough did, and this one had passed that test of biology. I could sense the hunger in its throaty growl, the anticipation in how it’s foreclaws twitched, another valuable kill ripe for the taking. They likely had young somewhere, I figured, little ones that needed feeding, and I would make a nice addition to their food horde.

Holstering my pistol, I slid both dirty palms over Lucille’s ears and forced myself to breathe slower. I couldn’t run, had no hope to resist for more than a few seconds, but I refused to go without a fight. Unlike the Auto Stalker, I wasn’t some witless grazer this thing could devour with impunity. If the beasts wanted my flesh, they’d pay for it . . . because I wasn’t as human as they thought.

I licked my dry lips, tasted metallic blood, and clenched my teeth.

*Alright then freakshow, you leave me no choice.*

Both my eyes drifted shut even as the truck bed lifted away, and I ignored the sickly-sweet breath that gushed hot against my face. Every muscle relaxed, and I put all my remaining energy into concentration, the prehistoric teeth poised on either side of my head, death a hairsbreadth away. Every fiber of my body vibrated, my skin wriggled, and the blood burned within my veins like fire. Sockets popped under my ears, tendons in my face stretched, and from deep within myself rose a powerful foreign tide as *the focus* took over.

My jaw elongated, each lung swelled, and like a bomb I erupted with a high, piercing scream that ripped the air apart.

In my mind’s eye, I saw again the road from so many visions before, a rain-soaked gravel spit in the darkness, stretching on forever between the dripping trees. Cold rain kissed my skin, thick clay earth squished between my bares hands and feet, and thunder above called to me like cathedral bells. For the briefest of moments, I thought I glimpsed a shadow against the dream-state horizon, a tall lumbering figure that made whispers course through my brain.

As the long, alien screech reached its height, a single bolt of lightning slashed through the otherworldly memory, and the forest around me tumbled into eerie silence.

*Crunch.*

Unsure how much time had passed, I craned my neck to one side, eyes still shut, my energy drained from the screech. Static hummed in my skull, my pulse throbbed, and I fought the overwhelming urge to pass out. Like a statue I seemed frozen in the seated position I’d taken, rubbery and numb from the sheer exertion of the past five minutes. This always happened, a constant side effect to my unusual capabilities, and the chief reason I hadn’t dared to use it in defense of the convoy. The sound could easily pop eardrums, make someone pass out, or even kill them, but never before had something dared to approach *after* I’d let loose one of my screams.

*Crunch.*

Despite the ringing in their depths, my extra-sensitive ears picked up the footsteps not far to my left, a pair of bipedal feet that trampled the underbrush with slow, methodical steps. Could they be human? I didn’t need to reach for Lucille to know it wasn’t her; she lay by my side, her unmoving head propped against my right thigh. No, it had to be someone else, and from how they moved, I decided they couldn’t be one of our rangers coming to my rescue.

*Crunch.*

Deep inside, the shrill voice of common sense begged me to run, to open my eyes, to look and see what was so close it could have reached out to touch me, but my body still refused to fully awaken. I’d overdone it this time, could feel it in my joints, muscles, and lungs. Only on a few occasions had I used the scream before, and even then, never with such intensity. It occurred to me that it would be a great tragic irony if I died from my own desperate attempts at survival, and on the heels of that thought came a chilly realization.

What if I knew *exactly* who stood not six feet in front of me in the autumn muck?

The footsteps fell silent, and my weary heart skipped a terrified beat.

*There’s still too much light, it can’t be him.*

Heavy boot soles creaked, and someone crouched down to be face-level with me.

My fuzzy mind whirled with the sensation of a pair of eyes that watched my haggard face, enough to send a river of frigid adrenaline down my spine. There was no mistaking it, *he* was there, had been there from the start, waiting until I was too weak to fight. I’d given him the perfect opportunity, immobilized myself, and I fought with ragged despair against my exhausted paralysis.

Something solid and heavy settled in my lap, placed there by unseen hands, and I tensed to await the inevitable. With how vulnerable I was in this half-sedated state, Vecitorak couldn’t possibly pass up such a chance to finish what he’d started weeks ago. Surely he’d see my new-found life as an insult to his power, the silver tattoos covering my scars a taunt, the flits of honey-yellow in my hair a challenge, and the semi-luminescent gold in my irises enough to invoke abyssal rage in the name of his dark god. It was his fault that I’d ended up like this in the first place.

It had been by Vecitorak’s cruel wooden blade that I ceased to be fully human.

*Vroom.*

Somewhere in the distance, engines roared, growing closer by the second.

The boots in front of me shuffled in the carpet of churned clay and wet leaves to tramp away into the forest. I couldn’t so much as utter a confused gasp and they were gone, leaving me alone in confused silence.

*What just happened?*

As if on cue, Lucille’s head stirred from its place on my hip, and she let out a small grunt of pain. “Where . . . where are we?”

A dam broke loose in my head, dizziness swamped my brain in a wave of static, and I gasped for air. It took a monumental effort to open my eyes, but I found myself staring up at the red, orange, and pink streaks of sunset, and a red-haired figure that peered at me in concern.

“Gotta move.” I pushed the words through set teeth and dragged myself to my feet, head spinning. “Can’t stay here past dark. You okay?”

Truth be told, Lucille looked about as bad as I felt. Having pulled off the steel helmet mass-issued to our recruits from the old militia stockpiles of New Wilderness, her crimson hair lay in a tangled mess around her pale face. Darker red blood coated her lips from where it ran out of her nose, and she had a nasty bruise welling up under her right eye. Mud, pine needles, and dead leaves smeared the forest-green uniform jacket that the women of Ark River worked hard to make, intended to replace our old New Wilderness polo shirts with something more practical. One of her boots had come unlaced, and Lucille’s rank patch on her right arm, a single brown chevron stitched to the cloth, had torn enough that it would need restitching.

Lucille hefted her olive-green helmet to stare at a large dent in the back with wide brown eyes. “I think so. My head hurts, though. Can . . . can you check and see if my brains are coming out?”

At that, I let a tiny ghost of a smile creep across my face. Lucille had come a long way from the sulking 13-year-old who left Black Oak, and at times I almost forgot that she was seven years my junior. So many of our force now consisted of people who wouldn’t have legally been able to buy a beer in the normal world, but carried rifles in a war most adults hadn’t survived. It was cruel in some ways that their childhood had been stolen from them, but I supposed it beat dying with the thousands who fell in the early days of the Breach.

*Instead of school field trips, she’s going to remember raids on trenches. Crazy. What a crazy world we live in.*

Turning her around, I probed the back of her ruddy head for any soft points and gave Lucille a small pat on the shoulder. “You’re fine. If your brains were coming out, you wouldn’t be standing, much less talking. *That’s* why we wear the dorky helmets.”

At that, Lucille made a sheepish, red-faced grin, and blinked at the carnage around her. “Yeah, I guess so. Thanks, for coming back for me. I-I thought I was a goner.”

*You and me both, kid.*

The red Auto Stalker lay on its side a few feet away, the metal body shredded like a potato chip bag, glass shattered into tiny crystalline bits, and the engine compartment a mess of greasy brown sinew. All the freaks all had some level of mutated black tissue that held them together at their core, either plant-based or animal-based. Like most other species when they adapted to sunlight, it turned color to become healthier and more docile. Granted, ‘docile’ for mutants often just meant slightly less aggressive, but since the forests were crawling with them, we would take any break we could get.

Relieved to be in one piece, I went to take a step forward, and my foot kicked something dense.

Looking down, I frowned at a square object, covered in a tight wrapping of dead leaves.

*What the . . .*

Ice tingled through my veins once more, and the strange footsteps echoed in my mind to remind me that even with the mutants gone, we still weren’t safe. Bending into a stiff crouch, I scooped the object up and peeled away the leaves to unleash a horrid stench of wood rot, mold, and damp earth.

Lucille covered her nose with one hand and coughed at the smell but inched closer to peer over my shoulder. “Where did that come from?”

Puzzled, I didn’t answer her and narrowed my eyes at the strange new thing in my hands. It was a book, old and decayed, with a stiff cover that seemed to be fashioned of some kind of rough leather. Something about it made my skin prickle, the scars under my tattoos wriggled in disgust, and I wanted nothing more than to throw it as far from me as possible. However, against my better judgment, I pushed the dead leaf wrappings way and pried the cover open.

Thick musty paper lay scrawled with rusty-red markings in sharp, jagged clusters. In long rows of manic scribbles, they covered the page from top to bottom, with no discernable pattern. They didn’t resemble any kind of language I’d ever seen before, the figures more like spider’s webs than anything else. For some reason, the ink color made my stomach churn, and the more I squinted at the odd writing, strange whispers rose in the back of my head like ghosts on the wind.

My fingertips brushed over the dried red ink, and I went rigid in an instant from a dry whisper that seemed to echo right in my ear.

*“Lost . . . lost . . . lost . . .”*

Without my goading, *the focus* slid into place inside my head, all my senses sharpened, my mind whirling into a cacophony of strange emotions. The tangled scribble seemed to unweave themselves before me, and I found my eyes widening in shock at the cold words that rang in my mind like footsteps on a flagstone hallway.

*I have been chosen. The pain is immense, but from it I will rise to new life. This old form I cast aside with glee, for I know the future awaits my exultation. I am a servant of the one who called me from the clutches of death, the eye of the void, who seeks to bring about his great conquest. Even now, the sky draws close, the shadows embrace me, and I shed my blood to capture the truth essence of this moment. I will awaken the Master. I will resurrect the broken vessel of the Nameless One, and line his path to the gates of this corrupted world with the bodies of his scattered children. I will answer my calling with joy, on the road to the Sacred Grove.*

“Hannah?” Lucille’s voice seemed far away, muffled, as if she were standing on the other side of a closed doorway. “What’s wrong? What is that thing?”

Frozen in place, I forced each breath in and out of my sore chest, my heart racing at the terrified realization of what lay in my hands. This . . . this *thing* was evil, a word I hadn’t put much thought into during my old life in Louisville, but one that made a sickened knot twist into my guts in this new life I’d found here in Barron County. For I knew those words, recognized some of them, and recalled the visceral hate with which they were spoken aloud.

*‘You think you’ve won? You cannot hide. Your world will fall.’*

“A warning.” Broken from my trance, I shuddered at my own raspy tone, and another cold breeze rose on the air like the chuckle of a cruel voice from the frigid sky. “This was done on purpose, the stampede, the Crawlers, all of it. Only one person could have written this.”

“Who?” Lucille glanced around at the trees, fear in her gaze, and she groped on her war belt for a stubby knife I’d given her.

Beneath the silvery ink of my tattoos, the scars ached with phantasmic wriggles, and I glared at the darkened trees with growing apprehension. In the distance, the engines of our backup roared closer, the Auto Stalker herd blared their aged car horns from some new grazing area, and the Birch Crawlers were nowhere to be seen, but none of it comforted me. The sun sank low in the horizon, almost out of sight, and we still had several miles to cover before we were safely across the ridgeline, and into friendly territory. Even then, nowhere was safe after dark.

Eyes locked on the murky shadows of the forest, I let the cursed name slip off my tongue like it was sour stomach bile and groped for my Type 9 in reflex.

“Vecitorak.”
