I have made this post before a long time ago on a different subreddit, but I think it was on an old account from my younger years as it's not in the history of this one. This sub seemed like a good place to repost it for my current account as the criteria fits. Because there are several things that have happened there, I'll be posting each of the events altogether. But the main story focus will be my encounter with The Black Shuck. 

I have always believed in ghosts and have seen several and one with video evidence, and even seen what I think may have been a demon one time. But those are all different stories. The reason I mention them is that the events I'm going to describe only cements my belief in the paranormal. 

The Black Shuck: 
It was late one night sometime between 12 - 2 a.m. (the exact time and date is foggy in my memory) in the late summer of 2009. I was 15 at the time. A few friends and I had planned to meet up at the park, namely Brentwood Park, to smoke and hang out for a little while. 

There were several entrances to the park, but the entrance we were going to meet at was on a street called Mockingbird. This entrance, like the majority of the others, was somewhat hidden. Just an obscure sidewalk path that goes in between two houses. It comes to a large, narrow staircase down, with a canopy of trees from the sideskirts of the yards on either side. 

At the bottom, a sewer exit pipe was immediately to your right, with a stream coming out of it that led to the nearby creek. There was a patch of woods directly ahead, and an opening to the sewer on the left a couple meters away. At the landing of the stairs, you find yourself on a patch of land above the sewer pipe that has lost any chances of growing grass and has become a dirt patch. The canopy of trees from the stairs conjoins with a canopy from the patch of woods ahead and the surrounding area which is also partly to blame for the dirt patch. 

Right where the sewer pipe opens into the open stream, the dirt patch stops and the canopy opens up to what used to be a small baseball field, basically abandoned with grass having grown over the diamond. Across the field from the sewer pipe is the creek, and far off to the left past the baseball diamond's fence is the rest of the (basically abandoned) park. Over near the creek at the edge of the field was a massive old tree. 

These descriptions of the envrionment of this setting are important for most of these events. Some things are different about it now, basically just a giant flower field as everything was removed and let grow out, but this is how the park's setting was for all of the following events. 

So me and another friend waited for our other two friends to come along, standing at the sidewalk that led between the two houses. After about ten minutes of waiting, they showed up. I've always been a little socially distant, so after a couple minutes of conversation I separated myself from the group, eager to go down to the park to smoke and disinterested in the topic they were talking about. 

The moment I reached the bottom of the steps and turned to the right to head out from the canopy and into the park, I saw it. Even in the dark, the moonlight giving light to the open space of the park showed it to me clearly. Just where the dirt patch and canopy ended, in the path to the opening of the park. 

A giant black wolf stood there. It looked to be the height of my shoulders while on all fours. (I'm 5'7" now, have only grown 1 inch since then). It stood facing me, yet with its body to the side as though it was trying to block the entire path, its front legs in a position of attack/defense. 

It made no sound or movement toward me at all, but it was snarling or baring its fangs at me. The teeth themselves were sharp as are any canine's, but its front fangs seemed extra long. The teeth also seemed to be the only tangible part of its body, the only things I could touch if I were to reach out and try. I could see through it, its body and fur retained shape but seemed to be comprised of thick, swirling, black, smoky mists or fog. Its eyes glowed a deep and bright blood red. 

I was terrified, and I barely ever get scared of anything. I immediately turned and ran up the steps as fast as I could and out to my friends who were still chatting and just beginning to make their way to follow me down. "GUYS, DON'T GO DOWN THERE, THERE'S A GHOST WOLF DOWN THERE!" 

They questioned me nonchalantly in disbelief and I begged them a second time not to go down there. But they, again, disregarded me. I reluctantly followed them down. But once we were down there, it was gone. Unfortunately that only served for my friends to shrug me off in disbelief with even more conviction. I know what I saw though, it wasn't some illusion or a trick of my mind or sight. 

I play a game called Runescape, and I was telling this story to a friend of mine I'd met on there who lives in New Zealand. (I'm USA). 

He said, "Bro, that wasn't just some ghost wolf, that was a black shuck." 
I asked, "What's that?" 
"Look it up," he said. 
So I proceeded to look into it. 

For those who do not know, black dogs, The Black Shuck, Hellhound, other names it's known by, (there are quite a few names and a real Hellhound is not the same thing as a black shuck) is an entity that is the equivalent of a dark omen. Oddly, the only reports of anyone ever seeing it have been located in the British Isles, yet I'm in the USA. Typically, it's said that if you encounter a black shuck, it means either you or a loved one will die within a year. This was where it really sunk in for me. 

My grandmother on my mother's side passed away in October of 2009, a couple months after my encounter with the black shuck. And it's because of that encounter that my belief in the paranormal was permenently cemented. 

I know this is long, but bear with me for more creepy things. 3 other things have happened to me in this park. The first thing I'll describe happened in the literal exact same spot as I'd seen the black shuck. 

A Brilliant Eagle:
Two or three years before the incident with the black shuck, it was a nice and warm, beautiful spring day. I was going to cut through the park to meet up with some friends to hang out. I went down those same steps and in the exact same spot the black shuck was standing in, there was a giant, bright white eagle. As soon as I got down there, it noticed me before I noticed it. 

As soon as I noticed it, its back was facing me and it was turning its head back forward, away from noticing me. It began to start taking off. Before it did, I took note of its colors and size. It stood around 4' tall off the ground, and was a brilliant bright white in color. After it took flight, I noticed its massive wingspan, looking to be around 7-8' across. Its physique looked akin to an American bald eagle, just way bigger. 

I've spent a long time trying to research what exactly it was that I saw, and have come up empty handed. The only birds on the planet with a relative size are harpy eagles and albatross, which neither of those are the same thing as what I saw. The only other eagle of similar coloration is more gray and much smaller. There are no myths, legends, tales or lore that I can find describing anything like giant white eagles. If anybody can tell me what I saw, please do so. 

My Odd Sensation: 
This one happened sometime after seeing the eagle, but long before my black shuck encounter. A much shorter story, a group of my friends and
