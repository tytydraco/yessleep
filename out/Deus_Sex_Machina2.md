*Once again, I don’t have much time. I’m going to continue where I left off—I have to get everything down. People need to know. Also—I know it can be confusing that I write my flashbacks in present tense; that’s because the only way for me to get it down is if I relive the entire experience, detail by harrowing detail. If it bothers people too much, I’ll try past tense in the future. Haha, get it? Past tense…in the future…? Ahem. Anyway.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Have you ever seen something so bizarre that it takes your brain a second just to figure out what’s going on? Something that just defies every law of physics, something that bends every idea you have about the very nature of reality?

There’s no good way to describe what I’m seeing in the window. It sort of looks like a person—*very* loose description, by the way. It has two arms, two legs, and a head, but that’s about where the resemblance ends. Its features are…all wrong. Like, *very* wrong. There’s no face, for one thing. Its head is a hollowed-out mess of gore where its face should be, like someone just ripped off the flesh and the front of the skull, leaving the inside of the head completely exposed. It’s a mess of pulsing red organs that *don’t* look like they’re supposed to be in a human head—and there’s thick, dark blood splattering against the window. I don’t look at it for long, but I’m pretty sure I can see *wires* in the back, piercing up through the brain.

It slams its head into the window, over and over again. I run to the door, trying again to open it—but of course, it’s still locked. The thing raises its hands and slams them into the window alongside its head, and I’m afraid the window is going to shatter any second.

When I say ‘hands’, I’m using that term *very* loosely, again. Its hands are not…hands, per say. They’re just fleshy blobs at the ends of its arms (which bend at about six different places, all of which seem to somehow be in the wrong direction), with dozens of long, writhing, worm-like appendages sprouting from the ends. I assume those are supposed to be fingers.

The ‘fingers’ wave around like limp noodles, probing at the glass. If I look closely, the fingers almost look transparent, and I swear I can see steel cables running through them, poking out through the fingertips like nails.

I feel like I’m losing my mind. *Should I scream for help?* Probably. But then again—Zoe said I’m a liability, and Chris and Avery seemed like they just wanted to torture me. None of these recent developments seem particularly promising, so I’m pretty sure I’m on my own.

There’s a loud *BANG* from somewhere else in the building, and the creature pauses. It cocks its head to the side, like it’s listening for something, though I’m pretty sure it doesn’t have ears. There’s another *BANG*, and the creature just—disappears. I don’t even see it move; it’s just *gone*, leaving behind nothing but disgusting bloodstains and a cracked window.

I collapse onto the floor of the dorm and just stare at nothing, trying to calm myself down. It doesn’t work.

I’m not sure how long I lay on the floor and dissociate, but I’m snapped out of it when the door to the dorm room slams open. I see Zoe standing there, covered in blood (she doesn’t seem wounded, so I can only assume the blood isn’t hers) and pointing something at me. It looks like a gun, but I don’t see a trigger or even an opening in the barrel for a bullet to exit through. It’s like a poorly made prop gun. Her gaze is cold. Calculating. When she speaks, her voice is hard. “River,” she says, “you need to tell me exactly what you saw.”

“Um,” I begin, “I don’t know.”

Her gaze hardens, and I try again. “A person? Sort of? But without a face? And its arms were all wrong, and it had like weirdly long, noodley fingers? Fuck, what is *happening*? What *is* this place?”

Zoe nods, lowering the prop gun. “Yeah, that’s not good.”

*No shit.* I’ve been here like three minutes and even I know that. “Zoe, you need to give me some information. What *is* this place? Why am I here? Why are you covered in blood?”

She sighs. “Alright, follow me. We’re going to the third floor lounge; it’s time you met some people. I don't think it's safe for you to be alone right now.”

I nod, just excited to leave the room.

The lounges are where RAs called meetings to discuss things with their residents, so I suppose it makes sense that that’s where these people would convene as well. As I walk in, I see Chris and Avery sitting next to each other on a checkered couch, holding bowls of what looks like some kind of soup. There’s two people sitting near a whiteboard against the wall, playing what appears to be tic-tac-toe on a 6x6 board drawn in marker.

Another person sits in an armchair in the corner of the room, reading a book with plain black covers and a black spine. I can’t see any title or author written on it.

I notice that none of them have any blood on them, except for Zoe.

They all look up at Zoe and I as we enter. Chris gives a half-hearted wave, and Avery stands up and sets their soup aside, walking towards me. My vision is suddenly tinged red, and all I can think about is how they laughed while I screamed.*The pain. The needle. The agony.* “Look, I’m sorry about earlier,” they say. “I didn’t mean–”

My fist slams into their solar plexus, and they begin to double over in pain. I interlace my fingers behind their head, yanking it downwards and bringing my knee up into their face, angling it so as to avoid the metal side.

I feed them a knee–-one, two, three times. As I let go of their head, it snaps backwards, blood spraying upwards in an arc from their now-broken nose. I bring a leg up and kick them hard as they fall backwards, my heel grinding into their windpipe and driving them into the ground.

It all happens in less than two seconds—and then an instant later, I’m being held back. Zoe’s arms close around my neck in a rear-naked choke, cutting off my air. Chris jumps up and pins my arms to my sides, saying something to me that I can’t hear over the blood rushing in my ears. Avery coughs and spits a mouthful of blood onto the lounge floor, and I notice that a couple of teeth come out too.

It takes me a few seconds to stop struggling, and Zoe cautiously lets go of me. Chris eyes me warily, like he’s afraid I’m going to attack Avery again. Which, to be fair—I might.

The others in the room are on their feet, gawking at me. *Probably not the best first impression,* I realize. *I need to say something to diffuse the situation.*

“Fuck you,” I hiss at Avery. “You *stabbed* me!” *Shit. That was not it.*

Avery is on their feet, pressing some sort of cloth to their face to stop the bleeding. “Yeah,” they say. “I’m sorry about that; it’s…standard procedure when someone first gets here. Sort of. I know I shouldn’t have been so psycho about it; I’m working on that. But fair enough, I guess I deserved that.”

Nobody else says anything, even Chris, who just looks apologetically at the floor. In fact, it almost looks like they all expected me to act this way. *Weird.*

I scowl, my fists balled up at my sides. Zoe and Chris are still standing close to me, tense—ready to restrain me if I attack. So, I unclench my fists and walk over to a chair, plopping myself down. “Whatever,” I grumble. Hopefully that’s enough of an apology, because that’s all I got.

“*Anyway,”* Zoe says after a moment of awkward silence, “this is River! She’s new, and I hope we can all welcome her to this…fucking nightmare. Hooray!” Her cheery, smiley facade is back on, and the abrupt shift in tone is honestly a bit frightening, especially when coupled with the blood splattered all over her clothes.

“Well,” says the guy in the corner reading the plain black book, “I’m Nick. Nice to meet you, River.” He stands up and walks across the lounge to shake my hand, which seems…unnecessary. I take the opportunity to examine him. Nick is a dark-skinned, skinny guy with almond-shaped eyes and dark, messy hair. I don’t see any weapons on him, which is good.

I don’t see any weapons on Chris or Avery either, though, so maybe the lounge is just a no-weapons zone or something.

“I’m Mukesh, but everyone just calls me Muck,” says one of the people playing 6x6 tic-tac-toe by the whiteboard. I wave at him. *What a terrible nickname,* I think.

Mukesh is an Indian guy with glasses. He wears a sweater, jeans, and an awkward smile.

“Zackie,” grunts the girl playing tic-tac-toe with Mukesh. She wears a t-shirt with the sleeves ripped off, combat boots and camo pants. She has a buzz-cut, and I see two knives in her belt. I guess the lounge is not a no-weapon zone after all. I nod at her, unsure how I’m supposed to respond to these people introducing themselves.

“I’m River,” I say. “Good to meet you, everyone. I have…*so* many questions.”

“Right,” Zoe says. “I have to go out on patrol, but you guys help River get acclimated! Bye!” With that, she’s gone. And everyone’s staring at me—except Avery, who has run off to find a first-aid kit or something. Good riddance.

“Well,” begins Chris, “Welcome to UNX.”

“Yeah,” I scoff. “Great to be here. But seriously, what the fuck? What just happened earlier? What were those noises?”

“The Machine,” says Zackie matter-of-factly, toying with a knife. “They don’t usually send anyone this far in, but whatever. Zoe’s crew is killing the stragglers right now.”

“I don’t know what any of that means.” I shake my head. “What’s the Machine? What are they sending? What do you mean by ‘this far in’? What stragglers?”

“The Machine,” Chris cuts in, “is a group of…hostile folks. Most of them *used* to be people, at some point. Some of them still are. But the ones who aren’t? Now they’re…*reprogrammed*.”

“Wait. *Reprogrammed?”* I shake my head again. “What the fuck *is* this place?”

“Look, newbie,” Mukesh says, “just take a minute to rest, yeah? You’re probably hungry, right? Do you want some soup? I’ll get you a bowl from the kitchen.”

I don’t want any soup, but he’s gone before I can say that. “Earlier, Zoe told me that all the drugs in my system will always be there. Is that true?” I ask.

Chris and Zackie nod. Nick just reads his book, ignoring everything. “It’s true,” Zackie says. “Why, you tweaking or something?”

I shake my head. “No, I just…have some stuff I need to take every day. But if it’s permanently in my system, I should be good, right?”

Zackie raises an eyebrow, flipping a knife in the air a couple times. “You should be. What are you, a junkie?”

I shake my head. *Just on antidepressants,* I don’t say.

Chris speaks before I can embarrass myself. “River, did you see anything…odd, earlier?”

*Oh, you mean besides literally every single thing I’ve seen since I got here?* “Yeah, I saw a weird…thing, trying to get into my window.”

Chris nods. “Okay, so…that’s what we call a *construct.* They’re…people. Or they used to be. Nothing really dies down here, so when the Machine kidnaps new folks that aren’t willing to join freely, they force them to by cutting them open and *reprogramming* them into constructs. There are different types of constructs, but hopefully you never meet any others.”

A million ideas form in my brain at once, each one dumber than the last. “So,” I say, “what’s stopping us from controlling a construct? Can *we* program them?”

Zackie laughs, Chris chuckles, and Nick just shakes his head. “No,” Chris says. “It’s not possible.”

I frown. “Someone does it though, right? So it’s obviously possible.”

“Well—yes. But the one who does it isn’t really…a person. We don’t know exactly *what* it is, but…members of the Machine refer to it a God of some kind. A God that creates and controls all the constructs.”

I don’t bother asking how he knows these things. I don’t really have the luxury of doubting what I’m being told. I chuckle, rolling my eyes. “A God from the Machine, huh? A literal Deus Ex Machina.”

“What?” Chris asks.

“Nothing.”

“Anyway, I have to go. Good luck, River.” And with that, Chris is gone too. Now it’s just me, Zackie, and Nick. Neither of them seem to be in a talkative mood, so I take a moment to just mull over what I’ve been told.

*This place reprograms people. That thing I saw…used to be a person?* It’s still hard to wrap my head around it. That bizarre amalgamation of flesh and steel was a *person?*

Is that what Zoe meant when she said killing things just brings them back worse?

Mukesh returns, holding a steaming bowl of…something. He hands it to me, beaming. “It’s good! Just try it,” he says.

It certainly doesn’t *look* good. It looks like someone shat in a bowl, heated it up, pissed in the bowl, and then threw up in it for good measure. It’s the least appetizing thing I have *ever* been asked to eat. And I’ve eaten a lot of nasty shit.

“Uh—I’m not that hungry,” I say.

“Just eat it,” says Mukesh. “There aren’t that many choices here in terms of food, so…better get used to it.” He hands me a plastic spork.

I take a bite. It tastes…bizarre. If you’ve ever licked the spine of a spiral-bound notebook, that’s…sort of what it tastes like. A metallic, artificial flavor that confuses and upsets me for reasons I can’t quite articulate. I take another bite. *Yep, still nasty.*

I force myself to keep eating, although I’m not sure why. 

“By the way, newbie…I have to warn you.” Mukesh leans closer to me, and his next words come out almost as a whisper. “If you have dreams here—they’re not just dreams. Nobody believes me, but I swear they *aren’t*. There was a guy here a while ago, talking about dreams. Talking about some grand vision, talking about how someone was offering him something great. He walked out, down towards south campus, past the bus stops—never came back. Everyone thought he was just insane, since nobody else has any dreams here…but then I started having them. Nobody believes me, but *you* might. I got a feeling about you.”

I have no idea what to make of any of that. “I haven’t tried to sleep yet,” I tell him.

Mukesh nods. “You will, though. And if you see someone in your dreams…they’re real. Just be careful, newbie. This place has a way of getting in your head. Don’t trust anybody. Not even yourself. *Especially* not yourself.”

I take another bite of the “soup”, saying nothing.

“I know the soup is ass,” Mukesh says with a grin. “But it’s all we got right now. Speaking of which, me and some of the guys are going on a food run tomorrow…do you want to come?”

“I don’t know what a food run is,” I tell him.

Mukesh shrugs. “It’s when we go out and get food for everybody. Pretty self explanatory, newbie.”

“I know *that*. I mean, I don’t know exactly what that entails in this…place. Where do you guys even get food? What do you eat? What *is* this soup?”

Mukesh gives a dry chuckle. “You’ll see.”

I hear a door open and slam shut downstairs, and footsteps come up the stairs. Mukesh notices my alarmed expression and laughs. “Relax, newbie,” he says, “it’s just Zoe and the patrol squad coming back. Jeez, you’re so jumpy.”

Sure enough, the door to the stairwell slams open and Zoe strides through, followed by five others I haven’t met yet. All of them are covered in blood, like they’ve gone on a slaughtering spree or something. They’re in the middle of a conversation, which I try to overhear as they walk further down the hall, away from the lounge.

“-did good work today,” Zoe is saying to her squad. “Constructs are getting bolder. It’s strange of them to come this far in. But that new girl, I saw her beat the shit out of Avery earlier—it was actually pretty nice to watch someone put that prick in their place. I think she could join us. I’ll talk to her later. Anyway, I-” Her voice fades as she gets too far away for me to hear.

*I think she could join us.* What exactly does she do? Do I *want* to join her? Absent-mindedly, I continue eating my soup, lost in thought.

*Is this hell? Am I dead?* Nah—I don’t even know if I *believe* in hell. If this is hell, it’s definitely a weirder one than I would have imagined. Shaking my head, I try to gather my thoughts.

*So, this place can reprogram people. Cool. It seems like there’s weird robot monsters here, and I was told that this whole section of dorms is safe but that appears to be untrue. I still don’t know how I got here, or if there’s a way out. There may or may not be weird dreams in my future, which may or may not be vaguely prophetic in nature, so that’s just fantastic. The food sucks, and I have no idea what’s in it. I don’t know where to get food, or how the food is made—although I guess I’ll learn about that soon enough. I don’t know what Avery injected me with yesterday either.*

So—*what’s the play here?* I just don’t know. I don’t really have that many options; I could get up and try exploring the dorm, or I could leave the dorm and try to explore this section of campus. I could just sit here and eat my soup, or I could try to talk to people. I could try asking questions.

Every option feels shitty, so I just finish my soup in silence.

The rest of the day passes uneventfully. I wander around the dorm building, and I find that it’s largely the same as I remember all UNX student housing being. The key differences are that a lot of the walls are black metal, and the furniture is a weird mishmash of flesh and steel, which is quite disconcerting. But honestly, after my run-in with the construct earlier, it barely even registers as weird anymore.

Nobody really says anything to me the rest of the day. Zoe finds me and tells me to come to the lounge for dinner at one point (it’s more soup), and then she tells me she’s found a room for me to stay in. Apparently, I’ll be rooming with someone. Everybody has to share rooms, because somehow sleeping alone makes it easier for people to be taken by the Machine. I don’t really understand why, but I also don’t question it. It’s just another thing about this place that I don’t get.

“You’re in room 337,” Zoe tells me matter-of-factly as she tosses me a key. “Here’s your key. Don’t lose it.” And with that she’s gone, before I can protest or ask any questions.

I don’t like it. This is going to sound incredibly stupid, but…I don’t like prime numbers. As a math major, that’s really dumb. I know. I’m not going to get into why, but suffice it to say that prime numbers make me very uncomfortable. 3 and 7 are both prime, and 337 is also prime. A prime number, made of prime numbers. It just feels like another subtle *fuck you* from the universe.

I walk to room 337, feeling tired and disoriented. The room is empty, which I’m thankful for. The blinds are shut, so I can’t look out the window at the night sky—and I’m grateful for that too. Somehow I feel like looking at this alien version of my campus in the dark would chill me to the bone.

There are two beds, both with frames made of that hideous flesh/steel mixture—but suddenly I’m overcome with a wave of exhaustion that makes me far too tired to care.

The second my head hits the pillow, I’m out like a light. Unfortunately, that’s when the dreams start.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m in an arena of some kind. Plain stone floor, with steel railings running around the edges. It’s like a boxing ring the size of a football field, with everything outside the railings being pitch black.

I remember what Mukesh told me: *If you have dreams here—they’re not just dreams.*

What did that mean? What *is* this?

The arena starts shrinking, until I’m in a square that’s maybe 10 feet to a side. I stand there, waiting for something to happen…but nothing does. *Is this it? Is this the whole dream?*

After all the warnings I’ve gotten from Mukesh, it’s a bit anticlimactic. Just an empty square? Really? *What a letdown. Or is it a relief?* I stand at the edge of the square, staring into the void beyond.

“Hey,” says a voice from behind me.

I spin around, finding myself face to face with a woman, probably about my age. She’s stunning. Gorgeous. But something just seems *off* about her. Her hair is a shimmering, silvery blue color (I think it is, anyway—I’m colorblind, but I’m doing my best to paint a picture for you guys), and her skin is a dark, midnight blue.  Her eyes are a gorgeous, shimmering silver just like her hair. Looking into those eyes, it almost feels like I’m sinking, getting lost in them until I'm too far in to escape—like I’m neck-deep in a pool of quicksilver.

“Who are you?” I ask.

Her full, perfect lips part to reveal razor-sharp, silver teeth glinting in the light as she smiles. “Does it matter, baby?” she purrs, walking towards me. “Haven’t you ever had a good dream before?”

*This place has a way of getting in your head.* Is this their master plan? To *seduce* me into joining the Machine? Fucking pathetic.

“River,” says the woman in a breathy voice, “I know what you are.”

Now, *that* catches me off guard. “You don’t know me,” I retort reflexively. Even as I say it, I realize it’s probably not true. If this woman is in my dreams, there’s no telling whether or not she’s been in my head. There’s no way to know *what* she’s learned about me.

Her gorgeous smile widens. “Oh, but I *do*. I know that’s not your name. Not what your parents named you, anyway.” She giggles—it would be adorable, if it weren’t so…*twisted.* I can see the malice in her eyes.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I say evenly.

She gives me a sexy pout, crossing her arms. “Don’t lie to *me*, Riv. You can lie to everybody else here, but not *me.*”

I glare at her.

“How do you think the others will react, when they find out what you are? How long do you think you can keep it hidden from them?”

I shrug. “I doubt they’d care. I feel like there’s bigger issues to worry about right now than me being gay or trans or…whatever it is you think they’d hate me for.”

She raises her eyebrows. “Are you sure? You’ve been saying that your entire life.” She then speaks in an embarrassingly good imitation of my voice: “*Surely they won’t care that I’m gay. Surely they have better things to do than tell me to kill myself for being trans. Surely people are too preoccupied with their own lives to call me slurs outside a waffle house. Surely everyone I’ve been friends with for the past eight years won’t ghost me just because my name and pronouns changed. Surely people are better than that.*”

I scowl. “Okay, point taken. Even so—it’s not like there’s really an alternative here.”

The woman smirks at me, her voice back to normal. “Oh, but there *is.* Because here’s the thing, gorgeous—*I* accept you. I will *always* accept you. Isn’t that what you want? What you’ve always wanted? Acceptance, unconditionally? I can give you that. The Machine can give you that. We aren’t so different, you and I. We’re both just outcasts, fighting for our place in a world that has no space for us. Join me. Join someone who will actually *understand.*”

A mirthless chuckle claws its way up my throat. “Is that what you think? You think I’m a kicked puppy, running to the first pretty girl who tells me I’m not a freak?” I scoff. “I’ve had people throw rocks at me, pull their kids away from me in grocery stores. I’ve had friends walk out on me, and I’ve been told to kill myself a million times by a million people *every day* for the past decade. If acceptance was all I wanted, you think I’d still be out? You think I’d bother staying out of the closet? My god…do you know how many times I’ve been threatened? How many times I’ve been punched in the face or kicked in the ribs or shoved into walls? More than you’d believe. And you know the worst part? I *like* it that way. I *like* to see the wariness in their eyes, the hate, the disgust. I *like* it when they scream slurs at me, because it means I have power over them. It means they’re *afraid.* Of me, of what I represent, of what I mean for them and their family. I am a symptom of change in a stagnant world, and they *hate* me for it.”

She’s still smirking at me, biting her lip. “Wow,” she breathes. “It’s *hot* when you get all passionate. Tell me more, baby.”

I roll my eyes. “Oh, fuck you.”

She giggles. “Oh, I’d love that…but sadly, you just won’t be *honest* with me. See, I know you like to hide behind that anger and self-righteousness…but you’re scared, underneath it all. Scared of being alone, of being unloved. You stay up at night, looking at your self-harm scars, looking in the mirror and wishing your jawline wasn’t so sharp and masculine, wishing you were curvy like those other girls you see around campus. You *hate* the way you look; all bone, lean muscle and sharp angles. You don’t think anyone could love you the way you are, because women aren’t supposed to *look* like you. They’re supposed to be graceful, and soft, and feminine. They’re not *supposed* to have the type of muscle you do, built from years of training. They’re not supposed to be so…*hard* around the edges. You hate yourself. And you can fool everybody else with your false bravado, but *I* see it, Riv.”

I fix her with a glare, saying nothing.

“Okay,” she sighs. “If that wasn’t enough—there are other aspects of you that people can’t stomach. For example…what you did to that boy last year? What do you think your precious new friends would think if they found out about *that*?”

Immediately, I deflate. I stare at the ground, unable to hold eye contact. “I…uh—listen, it’s…” my voice trails off.

She laughs—it’s a beautiful, sexy laugh…or at least, it would be, if not for the *scorn* I hear in it. “Yeah, you didn’t think *anybody* knew about that, did you?”

I shake my head vigorously. “You don’t understand,” I say defensively. “It’s not what you think, okay? I–”

“Oh, it’s *exactly* what I think,” the woman cuts me off. “He hurt your friend! Of course you just did what you had to do to protect her! The police said there wasn’t enough evidence, and he went unpunished…and you couldn’t just let that stand. I get it, babe! You just stopped him from doing it to anybody else, ever again. See, I’m totally on your side, gorgeous…but I might be the only one.”

*It’s not that simple,* I want to say. But—I don’t. What would be the point? *You didn’t see her,* I want to scream. *You didn’t see the light leave her eyes, the joy vanish from everything she did. You didn’t see the way she cried every night, the way she sobbed so hard she almost threw up. You don’t know what it’s like, to see the man who did that to her just walk free. You didn’t see the cuts start to appear on her wrists after that day. You don’t know what it was like, when she just stopped smiling. Stopped laughing. Stopped doing anything, really. Like someone had flipped a switch. You don’t know what it was like to just watch her slowly break apart into a million pieces while I just stood there, completely unable to help..*

I did help her, I think. At least, I tried. The only way I knew how. I know you’re all going to judge me for it. I know that it’s awful. But seeing that fear in his eyes, his mouth hanging open in a silent scream as he realized what was happening…it was incredible. I felt like a *goddess.*

The woman in front of me smiles, licking her lips. “You *liked* it, didn’t you? I can smell it on you…the *ecstasy* of the kill*.* I like that. I’d love to see that raw power, that bloodlust, *unleashed.* Mmm, you’re such a gorgeous beast. Why hold yourself back? Why not let that rage out? I can see it in your eyes, in the way you carry yourself, the way you speak. I could help you, baby. I could help you *channel* that. I could make you *strong.* Stronger than you’ve ever been. I could give you a new body, a new form…a perfect one, whatever you want. Come on, sexy…all you have to do is say *yes.*”

I take a shuddering breath, trying not to think about what she was saying. Trying not to think about how badly I *want* to say yes. So instead, I change the subject.. “It’s you, isn’t it? The one who runs the Machine? You’re the god. The Deus Ex Machina.” I take a step backwards, as though distancing myself from her will make a difference.

She smirks, amusement flickering in her silver eyes. “People call me all sorts of things…but yes, the God of the Machine is one such title. You can just call me by my name though; Kovah.”

*Kovah.* It’s a pretty name.

“Looks like our time is almost up, Riv. I’ve gotta say, I’ve had a *wonderful* time chatting with you. Of course—we could have done more than just *talk*, if you’d just been a little more open to it…but hey, I get it! Not everyone puts out on the first date. Good on you for having boundaries. Although maybe next time you’ll let me…*help you out*.” She winks, that smirk never leaving her face; I stare firmly at the floor, waiting impatiently for this whole experience to end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next thing I know, I’m waking up…but something doesn’t feel right. I try to open my eyes, but I see nothing. After a few seconds, I realize I’m blindfolded. Something cold and sharp presses against my throat.

“*Morning, asshole,”* hisses a voice from behind me. “*Don’t you fucking move.”*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*I’m out of time again. As always, I’ll update you later if I’m able to. Otherwise—it’s been real. Peace.*

*-Riv*
