I was thirteen when it started—seeing things that weren't there. Shadows cast by the lights on the walls, dancing like puppets. At first, they stayed in place, imprisoned by the light that created them. But then, they began to move, shifting from wall to wall.

I ignored them for the longest time, their presence, their power. How naïve I was to think I could avoid them forever—their whispers, their cries. It's terrifying how much time has passed since then, all while they lingered in the dark corners of my mind, watching, waiting, biding their time. All I had to do was say it, admit it: “Yes, I see you.”

Some call them “shadow people,” those fleeting, dark figures you glimpse out of the corner of your eye, standing still when they shouldn’t be there, moving when nothing else is moving. But for me, they were more than just mere shadows. It felt like I was looking into another world coexisting with ours, like I had somehow been granted access to an overlapping reality that most people could never see. I knew from the start they were more than figments of my imagination.

I remember the first time clearly. I was sitting in my room, hunched over a book, the pale glow of the evening sun casting eerie shadows through the window. That’s when I saw one of them—tall, thin, black as ink—standing in the far corner of my room. It didn’t move, didn’t even breathe, but I could feel its presence like a weight pressing down on my chest.

At thirteen, I didn’t understand what I was seeing. It scared me, but only for a moment. I told myself it wasn’t real. Just a shadow. Just a trick of the light. But as the days and weeks passed, I kept seeing them. In the corners of rooms, outside my bedroom window, even reflected in mirrors. They never did anything, never interacted with me. They were just... there. Doing their own thing, existing in that strange way they do.

So I ignored them. I told myself they weren’t real. I pretended not to see them and, for a while, they seemed content with that. They didn’t bother me, and I didn’t bother them.

But that all changed when I started talking about them.

I don’t know why I started—maybe it was because I was tired of pretending, tired of lying to myself. I told a person once, just in passing, that I could see something strange sometimes, that it felt like I could see a world just beneath ours. I didn’t go into detail, but that moment of weakness, of opening up about what I saw, seemed to change everything.

It’s as if by acknowledging them, I made them aware of me. Suddenly, they weren’t content to just linger in the background. They became more... intrusive.

They started to notice me. Or maybe they always noticed, and I was only now seeing it for what it was. Either way, their presence grew heavier, more oppressive. I could feel their eyes—or whatever they used to see—on me constantly. Sometimes, I’d catch them in broad daylight, standing in the middle of the street or at the foot of my bed, just staring, their forms indistinct but undeniably present.

Then the nightmares began.

At first, they were just fragments of fear—dark shapes moving in the periphery of my dreams, silent figures watching me from a distance. But soon, the dreams became vivid, more real than they had any right to be. I’d wake up, gasping for breath, only to turn around and see myself still lying there, still in bed, as if I hadn’t woken up at all.

In one dream—if you could even call it that—I saw my grandmother walking past my bed, her arms full of laundry like she used to carry before she passed away. I tried to scream for her, tried to ask for help, but no sound came. My throat was dry, closed off. I felt like I was drowning in air, gasping, struggling to move even the smallest part of my body. My toes, my fingers—nothing responded. All I could do was watch as the shadows moved closer and closer.

As I grew older, they became more and more intrusive. They didn’t just watch anymore. They started... communicating. They started telling me things. Telling me to *do* things. At first, it was nothing specific, just whispers at the edge of my mind. But the more I ignored them, the more persistent they became. And the louder their demands grew.

I tried to ignore them. I did. I pretended not to hear, not to see. But pretending could only last for so long.

By the time I was eighteen, I joined the Army. I had learned to shove them into the back of my mind. There were real things to worry about—real nightmares that came with war. The things I saw during those years... the things that etched themselves into my brain like scars... they made the shadow people seem almost benign by comparison. Almost.

But not quite.

War changes you. You see things you can never unsee. You do things that gnaw at the edges of your soul. For some, it hardens them, makes them numb. For me, it was different. I wasn’t hardened. I wasn’t numb. I was... vulnerable.

Something happened during one of our deployments—something dark. I can’t explain it clearly. One minute, everything was chaos—gunfire, smoke, the deafening roar of explosions—and the next, it was like everything had gone silent. It was as if the world itself had muted, leaving me standing alone in the midst of it all.

That’s when I felt it.

A presence. Not just the shadow people, no. This was something darker. Something deeper. Something that I’d been ignoring for far too long. It was like all the years of pushing them to the side had finally caught up with me, and now they were demanding to be acknowledged.

That night, something took control of me.

I don’t know how to describe it, but it was like I opened up to something far darker than I ever thought possible. I stopped being myself. I became a vehicle for something else. Some other force. It wasn’t like I had been possessed—not in the way you read about in horror stories. No, it was subtler than that. It was like I had *allowed* myself to be taken over.

At first, it was small things. It would whisper commands, and I would follow them without question. It told me to say certain things, and I said them. I didn’t feel remorse. I didn’t feel satisfaction. I didn’t feel anything. I was just... a passenger in my own body.

Days, weeks, months—it all blurred together. The shadow people were always there, always watching, but now it felt like they weren’t alone. Now it felt like something more had joined them—something that had been waiting in the dark corners of my mind, waiting for me to break.

They no longer just whispered. They screamed. They ordered. They laughed.

I remember one mission in particular—nothing out of the ordinary on the surface, just another routine patrol. But something snapped inside me that day. I stopped feeling the weight of my rifle in my hands. I stopped hearing the voices of my comrades. All I could hear was the shadows. All I could see were the dark figures surrounding me, their mouths stretched wide in silent commands.

Do it. Do it. Do it.

I can’t say exactly what I did that day. Not because I don’t remember, but because I can’t bear to speak it aloud. The blood, the bodies, the chaos... it was like I was watching from a distance, detached, as if I was watching someone else act on my behalf.

And all the while, the shadows stood around me, their forms flickering in and out of existence like they were feeding on my actions, growing stronger with every wrong I committed.

I don’t know how long this went on. I don’t even know when it stopped. But one day, I woke up and found myself sitting in the dark, my hands trembling, covered in dirt and blood. I was back in my bunk, but I didn’t remember how I got there. The whispers had quieted. The shadows were distant again.

But I knew they were waiting.

It’s been years since then, but they’ve never really left me. I see them every day—at work, at home, in my dreams. Sometimes, I catch their reflections in mirrors, standing just behind me. Sometimes, I feel their cold hands on my shoulders, pressing down, reminding me of what they made me do.

And the worst part? I let them in. I allowed it. I gave them the power, and now, I can never take it back. The shadows—they were always with me. They were always waiting for me to slip, for me to give in.

Sometimes, I wonder if they’re just in my head—if everything I’ve seen is just the result of some deep-seated trauma. But then I see them, standing in the corners of my room, waiting for the next moment of weakness. I hear their whispers, faint but ever-present.

They’ve taken everything from me. And the worst part? I’m still here. Still watching. Still waiting for them to take control again.

Because deep down, I know that one day they will.

And this time, I won’t fight them.

I won’t even try.
