This happened years ago but I need to clear my conscience.

I live in a small town and was coming home from my AA meeting when I saw the sign in the window.

HELP WANTED.

It was your run of the mill mom and pop hardware stores. Every town’s got one. I needed a job and I needed one in the worst way. After a string of bad luck and bad decisions, I was desperate. I needed to turn my life around and I needed to do it fast. 

I walked through the door as the bell chimed above my head. 

“Good afternoon! How can I help ya on this beautiful day!” The man behind the counter said.

“I saw the help wanted sign out front. I was just wonderi-“ 

He cut me off. 

“Ah yes! We are in some serious need of extra hands around here!”

He walked from behind the counter and held out a hand. I tried my best to give a firm handshake but I stood no chance as his monstrous hands engulfed mine. 

“I’m the owner of this bad boy.” He said as he patted the counter top. “I’ve been looking for some extra help around here but it seems like nobody wants to work an old fashioned job in this damn town.”

“Well I can assure you I will work any kind of job. I need the money and quite honestly I need the discipline of a steady job.”

“Outstanding! Just what I like to hear! Listen, give me your I.D I got a buddy on the force. He owes me one, I’ll ask him to run a quick check of you and if everything goes according to plan I’ll hire you on the spot! Just give me a few minutes.”

I handed over my I.D. Maybe this was the start of my luck turning around.

He took it and disappeared into the back room.
I could hear him talking on the phone, though I couldn’t make out much of what he was saying. Just a few muffled words, “Yeah… run it for me… no, just curious…”

The longer he was back there, the stranger it felt.
I remember looking around the shop. Rows of tools, half empty shelves, a layer of dust on everything.

After a few minutes, the door swung open again.

He was smiling wide.
“Everything checks out! You’re good to go!”

He handed back my ID and slapped me on the shoulder hard enough to sting.
“You can start tomorrow. Early. I open at six sharp. You get in, I’ll show you around, we’ll get you settled.”

I couldn’t stop smiling.
It felt like I’d finally caught a break.

The next morning, I showed up ten minutes early.

He greeted me like we’d known each other for years.
“Punctual! I like that. Come on, I’ll give you the grand tour.”

He walked me through the aisles, pointing out tools, supplies, stockroom doors.
When we got to the back, I noticed a heavy steel door with a massive padlock on it.

I tried not to stare, but he caught me anyway.
“Storage” he said quickly. “Nothing you need to worry about back there.”

That was the first time I felt it.
That tiny knot of unease in my stomach.

After our walk around the store and a quick run down of the register he told me to go put on the “uniform.”

The uniform consisted of a canvas apron with the stores name on it. Nothing special.

“You never know what kind of mess you’re gonna find yourself in! This right here will keep you clean. I’ll be in the back working on some things. Any customers you come and find me.”

I nodded and he went off to the back office. I wasn’t sure how this first day was going to go but the job seemed simple enough. 

I began to walk around the store just pacing the aisles, taking a mental inventory of everything I saw. Trying to get a feel of where things were in case anyone needed any help finding something. Just as I was passing the hammers my eye caught that steel door again. My mind wandered. Why would a storage area need to be locked that tight. I was startled by the noise that came from the back office.

A grunting sound, sounded like someone using all their effort to do something.

“Hey, need any help back there?”

No answer at first.

“No, uh no, just moving some boxes around! My age is starting to creep up on me! You just keep an eye out for any customers!”

I proceeded back towards the register. 

I was staring off into space when I heard the bell from the front door.

“Hey, hows it going. Anything I can help you with today?” I said in my most customer friendly voice.

“Yeah I’m looking for a hose and some gardening tools.”

I could not remember where any of that was. I didn’t want to lead the woman down the wrong aisle so I was honest. 

“If I’m being truthful this is my first day. I’d be glad to walk with you and see if I can find it for you!”

She smiled and seemed to be thankful I was so willing to help her out. We ended up finding exactly what she was looking for. We were headed back towards the front so I can ring her up. 

“I thought I told you to let me know when we had a customer.” My new boss said in an angry whisper.

“Sorry, I just wanted to help her out and I figured you were busy.”

He smiled blankly. The expression behind the smile was absent. 

“Ring her up, then come have a word with me.”

It was my first day and I was already going to get fired. 

After sending the customer on her way I made my way to the back office. The door was slammed behind me. 

“This is my store, you understand me? I tell you to do something, you do it. You don’t do what you want. You listen to me and only me.” He began approaching me. “Do I make myself clear?” 

I didn’t notice the hammer in his hand until he was steps away from me.

He slammed the hammer on the counter top. “DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!”

“Uh yeah, yes! Sorry! Won’t happen again.” 

What in the hell did I get myself into. That was the first thought that popped into my head. 

“Glad we have an understanding. Now listen here, I have to run to the bank. If we have ANY customers. You call me! Got it?”

“Yeah, call you, got it.”

He was gone a few minutes later. 

That was easily one of the strangest and scariest interactions I ever had.  How bad did I need this job? Enough to stick around.

Surprisingly no other customers came into the store while he was gone. I did some more walking around the store but kept finding myself drawn to this metal door. I had to know what was behind it. 

 I will forever regret what happened next. 

I went to the back office, I needed a key to get in the “storage room” and the only place I was going to find it was the office. I didn’t have to do much searching. It was hanging on a key ring I spotted as soon as I walked back there. Awfully convenient, I know. 

I headed back towards the storage room. My pulse quickened. I was getting nervous, he clearly didn’t want whatever was behind this door to be accessed. And here I was about to open it. I placed the key and turned. The padlock fell to the floor and the door slowly creaked open. A small set of stairs leading to a dark room. 

“Oh excellent! Right on schedule!” I heard from behind me. “I was hoping you wouldn’t wait long. Follow me, I’ll show you what’s down here.”

I was confused. Scared, but confused. I reluctantly followed down the stairs. 

“Welcome to my favorite part of the store!”

Claw marks on the floor, dried blood on the walls, a chair in the center of the room with enough straps to hold down a horse.

“What the fuck, what is this?!” I yelled.

“This is paradise. If you haven’t figured it out by now. Yes, I kill people. It is a BLAST! I see the look on your face and no I’m not going to kill you, I would’ve done it when you walked in.”

Still in shock I said nothing.

“You my friend are exactly who I’ve been looking for. I’m getting older and I need help. An extra set of hands. You will bring my victims to me!”

“The hell I will.” I turned to run up the stairs.

“Stop! There’s no use in running. I know where you live. I know where your parents live. Hell, I even know where your AA meetings are. I know people. I know a lot more than you think. I know everything about you that I need to know.”

“I’m not helping you with any of this.”

“That is where you are mistaken. You will help me. You have no choice. I will kill you if you refuse and I will make your family watch and then I will kill them.”

“Why? Why choose me? I’m a nobody.”

“Don’t say that. You are very important. And just desperate enough to do anything I need.”
