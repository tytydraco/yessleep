My friend, Ava is quite shy and quiet, but when you get to know her she’s quite a talkative person. She saw me sitting alone on the bench at lunch and decided to talk to me. That’s how we became friends. For some reason, if you’re quiet people in my school think that you’re weird. Stupid, I know. She loves to talk about the things that happen to you after you die, and murder cases, which honestly fascinated me. Well, what I didn’t expect was for her to murder someone. Well 2 people. 

She’s really beautiful, with long, thick brown hair and green eyes with a few hints of brown in them. Although she’s deemed as the weird kid at our school, many boys still ask her out. She rejects them though. This is mostly the reason why a lot of this happened. 

These two girls, Heidi and Khloe realized that she was getting attention from boys and got jealous since they couldn’t fathom the fact that Ava was being asked out by boys. So they started bullying her. It was subtle, at first. Just small jokes about how ‘weird’ she is. Then it became worse. Constant jokes about her appearance. `Accidentally’ tripping her. I told them to cut it out, but they didn’t stop. So I told the principal, who of course didn’t do anything about it. He just said he would look into it. He never did. 


Although Ava was being badly bullied, she was still nice to Heidi and Khloe. She’d laugh at their degrading jokes and told me not to worry whenever I tried to defend her. Two weeks ago, however, Ava’s demeanour changed. She was more quiet, and less lively than she normally was. And the two bullies weren’t in school, which was quite unusual, since they both never miss a day of school. I honestly didn’t think much of it. Maybe the principal finally did something about the bullying, and finally got them suspended. Well, at least that’s what I thought happened to them...

Last week Ava didn’t come to school. I was seriously worried about her. She wasn’t answering any of my texts. Today, at 4 am I was about to go to sleep after mindlessly scrolling through social media. But suddenly my phone rang. It was Ava. She sounded drunk, her voice was slurred. 

“I fucking killed them, both of them. I’m a horrible human being and I know you hate me too. There’s no point of me living anymore.”

She ended the call, and I immediately rushed out of my house and drove to hers. I’m lucky I didn’t get pulled over due to how fast I was driving. I banged on the door, and there was no answer. I banged again and she opened the door. There she was, a sharp knife in her hand. I quickly ran to take the knife out of her hand but she pinned me down and put the knife to my neck, as her soulless eyes looked into mine. 

“Ava…” I said, my voice shaking with fear, “You don’t have to do this. Tell me, who did you kill?”

She didn’t say anything, she just got up and pulled me to her kitchen, where her freezer is. She opened it and to my horror, there were the heads of Heidi and Khloe. Their eyes were perfectly cut out and Ava had carved their names on their foreheads. I looked at her as my heart almost stopped in fear. 

“Ava, what is this?” My voice was loud but shaky. “Ava. You know you can get in a lot of trouble for this, right?”

Once again, she had no response. She just stood there, staring at me. 

“Ava. Answer me. Please.” My voice was more desperate now, as I yearned to get an answer from her. 

Suddenly, she ran to her living room and I quickly followed her there. She buried her face into one of the pillows on the couch and began to sob. As heavy sobs filled the room, I wish I could say that I comforted her, but I didn’t. I just stood there, watching her. I can’t describe how I was feeling at that moment. After 30 minutes, her crying stopped, and I realized she was asleep. I picked her up and placed her on her bed. I went back to the living room and lay on the couch, staring at the ceiling until I slowly fell asleep. 

I was shaken awake by her in the afternoon. I was quite groggy from all that happened, and as I woke up, I was met by a happy face smiling at me. I slowly sat up and she sat next to me. 

“Hey, what happened? I don’t remember you coming to my house..” She said.

“What do you mean? Do you remember what happened? I went to your house at around 4 am because you called me saying something like I killed both of them.”

“Huh? I think you had a bad dream.” She said, looking at me with concern. 

I was quite confused since she quite literally confessed to a murder yesterday. No one forgets about that. 

“No, no I didn’t.” 

I led her to her freezer, where she showed me Heidi and Kloe’s severed heads. Except.. they weren’t there. Ava was looking at me, seeming confused but there was a small smirk growing on her face. She must’ve thought I was hallucinating or something.  

“So, why’d you bring me here?”

“You led me here to show me Heidi and Khloe’s heads.” 

“What? I have no idea what you’re talking about. I think you need some rest… how about I make you some tea?” 

“Ava. I know what I saw. I don’t know where you put them but I know you killed them. It’s not my mind. I know they were bad people but they didn’t deserve death. You need to turn yourself in, Ava.” 

She started boiling the water in the kettle and didn’t respond to me. I knew she was guilty, and she was silent as she made tea for the both of us. 

“Can you just sit down on the couch for a minute? I just need to process this.” She said. Her voice was quiet and somewhat calm. I sat on the couch and waited for her as she placed 2 cups of tea on the table. 

“Cinnamon flavored. It’s quite different, I know. We’ll talk about this later, right now I really can’t.” Before I could answer she went to her room and shut the door. 

I knew she put something in my tea. Cinnamon flavored? Really? Does she think I’m stupid? I got up, tipped the tea’s contents in her kitchen sink and placed it back on the table to make it seem like I actually drank it. Then, I tried to find what I saw. The heads. 

I realized there was one locked cabinet in her kitchen. Only one. “Suspicious,” I thought. I looked everywhere for the key and when I opened the freezer I found it. The key. How could she be so careless? I opened the cabinet and there they were. Their heads were in a big plastic container, filled with some liquid I’m guessing to slow down the decomposition process. The way they were slightly tilted really creeped me out. I shut the cabinet, quietly with a shaky breath and locked it. I put the key back where I found it.

Now, I’m sitting down, staring at the 2 cups of tea. I don’t know when she’s coming back…she’s taking quite long. But all I know is that I need to get out of here before I become one of those severed heads.
