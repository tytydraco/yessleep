  
I bought a house outside of the city after my 18th birthday. The owner said his daughter was murdered in there and that's why he's selling it now. I then went in and started putting everything away so I could sleep in there that night. I've already managed to put away the first load. I actually wanted to continue, but it was already 10 p.m. and I was tired. So I went to bed and fell asleep. It was the middle of the night when I was startled by a loud noise.  
It sounded like something heavy was falling. My eyes opened and I looked around in the darkness. The moonlight shone through the curtains, creating ghostly shadows in the room. A cold shiver ran down my spine when I suddenly heard footsteps approaching. My heart started beating faster.  
  
I hardly dared to breathe and tried to figure out where the noises were coming from. They seemed to be coming from the hallway outside my bedroom. I slowly sat up and listened intently. The footsteps grew louder and I could hear the old wooden floorboards creaking as if someone was slowly walking towards them.  
  
The door to my bedroom was closed, but I could sense that something strange was happening in this house. My first thought was that it might be a burglar, but then I remembered the dark story the previous owner had told. The house was supposedly cursed because his daughter was murdered in it.  
  
I snuck out of bed and tried to be as quiet as possible as I made my way to the bedroom door. The footsteps in the hallway stopped, as if the person had stopped outside. My heart was pounding in my ears as I slowly opened the door.  
  
What I saw made my blood run cold. In the faint moonlight I could see the figure of a young woman. She was wearing an old, bloodstained nightgown and had long, dark hair that covered her face. Her eyes were empty and cloudy.  
  
I stared at her in shock and didn't dare move. The young woman didn't seem to notice me and slowly turned away from me. Then she began to walk down the stairs, still so quietly that her footsteps were barely audible.  
  
I cautiously followed her down the stairs, still in a state of shock. The figure led me into the living room, where it stood and stared at something invisible. She seemed to be talking to someone, but I couldn't see anyone else.  
  
Then, suddenly, the figure turned and looked directly at me. Her eyes pierced my soul and I felt the cold seem to take hold of me from within. She reached out to me with a bloody hand and I screamed in fear.  
  
At that moment I woke up from my nightmare, panting and sweating. It was just a dream, I thought with relief. The house seemed quiet and I couldn't hear any noise or footsteps.  
  
However, I sensed that something was wrong in this house. The dark story the previous owner had told me had captured my imagination, and I couldn't deny that I felt uneasy.  
  
I decided to investigate in the daylight the next day to see if there were indeed any signs of the supernatural in this house. The story of the murdered daughter and the strange dream had unsettled me, but I wanted to find out the truth.  
  
What I discovered the next day would surpass my worst nightmares and lead me into a world of horror I never imagined.  
  
The next day I woke up with an oppressive feeling. The nightmare and the eerie events of the night before had left me deeply disturbed. But I was determined to find out what this house and its dark history was all about.  
  
The day brought dull light and I set out to explore the property in daylight. The first thing I did was look at the room where the previous owner's daughter was supposed to have been murdered. It was a small, gloomy room filled with an oppressive atmosphere. The memories of the terrible night literally hung in the air.  
  
While searching the room I came across some old photos and documents. They bore witness to a happy life once lived in this house before the curse changed everything. I wondered what might have happened back then and why the previous owner's daughter ended so tragically.  
  
I decided to reach out to the neighbors to find out more about the history of the house. They told me about inexplicable incidents that had happened here, about strange shadows and eerie noises in the night. Many of them avoided the house
