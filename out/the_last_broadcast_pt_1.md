I've always been a skeptic, the kind who'd laugh off conspiracy theories and doomsday prophecies. But then came that night, the one I can't scrub from my mind, no matter how hard I try.

It started like any other evening. The sky was a deep, untroubled blue, with stars beginning to dot the horizon. I was on my porch, sipping a cold beer, enjoying the tranquility. Suddenly, a loud, piercing siren shattered the calm. My phone buzzed with an emergency alert: "SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS NOT A DRILL."

My heart pounded as I ran inside and turned on the TV. Every channel was the same: a grim-faced newscaster explaining that a massive asteroid, undetected until the last moment, was on a collision course with Earth. Impact was imminent.

Panic set in. I grabbed my emergency bag and headed for the basement. The world outside was a chaotic mess of blaring car horns, screaming neighbors, and distant sirens. In the basement, the air was thick with fear. I could hear people shouting and crying through the thin walls.

Then came the impact. The ground shook violently, throwing me to the floor. The noise was indescribable—a deafening roar that seemed to tear the world apart. The power went out, plunging everything into pitch darkness. I could only hear my own ragged breaths and the muffled screams from above.

Hours passed, or maybe it was days—time had lost all meaning. The basement was stifling, the air heavy with dust and fear. I finally mustered the courage to venture upstairs. The sight that greeted me was nothing short of apocalyptic.

Everything was in ruins. The once vibrant neighborhood was reduced to smoldering rubble. Fires raged uncontrolled, casting an eerie glow against the ash-filled sky. Bodies lay strewn across the streets, and the air was thick with the stench of death and destruction.

I stumbled through the wreckage, searching for any sign of life. There was none. The world had ended, and I was alone. The silence was deafening, broken only by the crackling of distant fires and the occasional groan of a collapsing building.

Days turned into weeks as I scavenged for food and water, always haunted by the specter of my own mortality. The loneliness was a crushing weight, the silence a constant reminder of the life that had been ripped away. I kept hoping I'd find someone—anyone—who had survived, but each day brought only more desolation.

One night, as I sat by the flickering fire in what was left of my home, I saw a shadow move in the corner of my eye. My heart leapt with hope. But when I turned, there was nothing. Just the darkness, closing in around me.

I don't know how much longer I can survive in this wasteland. The food is running out, and my will to live is fading. Sometimes, I think I hear whispers in the wind, calling my name, urging me to give up. Maybe it's the ghosts of the dead, or maybe it's just my own madness. Either way, I know the end is near.

I used to fear the end of the world. Now, I fear the endless, empty silence that follows.
