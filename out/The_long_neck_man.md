The diner was almost empty, the kind of quiet where you could hear the ceiling fan squeak with every rotation. Neon from the buzzing sign outside spilled through the window, painting pink stripes across Maddison’s cheek.

She was twirling her straw in her Coke, staring at the melting ice. “Top three dreams,” she said suddenly.

I grinned around a mouthful of burger. “Dreams like goals, or dreams like the naked kind?”

“Goals,” she said, smirking. “But not boring ones. Don’t say ‘pay off the car.’”

“Alright,” I said, pretending to think. “One: cabin in the woods. Real cliché, but I want quiet. Two: travel. Not Instagram travel, but somewhere ancient. Walk where people lived a thousand years ago. Three…” I hesitated. “Open a pizza place.”

Maddison laughed loud enough that one of the truckers at the counter turned. “You? You’d eat all the stock.”

“Fair. Your turn.”

She bit her lip, thoughtful. “One: finish school and make it mean something. Two: write a book people actually read. Doesn’t have to be famous, just… important. Three: live somewhere alive. A big city. Lights, noise, people awake at 3 a.m.”

“Opposite lives,” I said.

“Guess so.” She smiled, but then her expression shifted. “My professor said something weird today.”

“Don’t they always?”

“Collective delusions,” she said. “Whole groups of people believing in something until it becomes real. Witch trials, dancing plagues. He said it can still happen. Anywhere.”

I raised an eyebrow. “So if everyone here believed I was an NHL goalie…”

“You’d still trip over your skates,” she shot back.

We both laughed, and for a while, everything felt normal.

Then the lights flickered.

The diner’s neon buzzed louder, the ceiling fan groaned. A sudden gust rattled the windows so hard the blinds clattered. Outside, clouds swallowed the moon in seconds, plunging the street into shadow. The waitress paused mid-pour, frowning.

That’s when Maddison stiffened. “Davis.”

A boy stood in the crosswalk. His bike was on its side, one wheel spinning lazily. He wasn’t moving. His arms hung limp, head tilted back, mouth open like a scream with the sound cut out.

The waitress bolted outside, apron flapping. She shook him. Slapped him. Nothing. Then, just as suddenly, he blinked, picked up his bike, and pedaled away like nothing happened.

The waitress stayed frozen in the street, pale.

“What the hell was that?” I muttered.

Maddison’s hand tightened around mine under the table. She whispered, “My grandmother used to tell stories about kids… freezing like that. Like they were being watched.”

“By who?”

“She never said.” Her voice shook. “She said it meant something was coming.”

We left the diner an hour later. The air outside felt heavy, damp. The streets were too quiet, as if the whole town had gone inside.

Halfway down Main Street, I stopped.

A poster clung to a telephone pole. Bright yellow, paper curling.

Circum Show of the Crazies – One Night Only.
Step right up, children free.

The drawings were frantic. A Ferris wheel bending in half. Clowns with sewn mouths. A carousel of eyeless horses. And in the center, a tall shadow with a neck spiraling skyward.

“Guess the carnival’s in town,” I joked weakly.

Maddison tilted her head, eyes narrowing. “We don’t get carnivals here.”

“Maybe it’s new?”

She didn’t answer.


---

The air grew stranger as we walked.

At the gas station, an old man leaned against the ice cooler, giggling. His eyes darted back and forth like he was tracking something invisible. “He’s stretching,” he muttered. “He’s stretching, stretching, stretching.”

When he saw Maddison, the laughter died. His finger shot out. “He sees you.”

Then he walked into the road. Horns blared, tires squealed. He never flinched. He just kept walking into the dark.

Maddison’s grip on me tightened. “Davis… I don’t like this.”

My ears rang. A faint tune drifted through the night, slow and warped. A carnival waltz, each note dragging until it cracked.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

“Hear what?” Maddison frowned.

“Music,” I whispered.

Her face went pale.


---

We weren’t alone. Families wandered the streets, moving like sleepwalkers. Children skipped ahead barefoot, giggling in sharp, broken tones. Their parents clapped softly, swaying.

One boy turned toward us. His eyes caught the streetlight, glowing faintly. His lips split into a grin too wide.

“Come play,” he whispered.

Maddison yanked me away. “Don’t look at them.”

But my mouth watered. I smelled popcorn. Funnel cake. Cotton candy. My stomach twisted with hunger.


---

By the time we reached the edge of town, the field was alive.

Tents striped in red and black loomed tall. Strings of flickering bulbs ran from pole to pole. The Ferris wheel shrieked as it spun, lights flickering in sickly colors. The smell of sugar and smoke was thick, but underneath it was damp soil and rot.

We were already walking toward it. I don’t remember deciding.


---

Inside the carnival, it almost looked normal.

Children ran laughing between games. Parents swayed and clapped, faces slack but smiling. The air thrummed with warped calliope music.

We passed the first tent. A carousel spun slowly. Painted horses bobbed. For a moment, it was ordinary. Then one horse turned its head. Not mechanically — it turned. Its glass eyes rolled white, fixing on me. Its jaw creaked open, teeth long and human. The child riding it tugged at its mane, giggling, oblivious.

“Keep moving,” Maddison hissed.

The second tent held a Ferris wheel, smaller than the one outside. Couples swayed in the seats. Their faces were too smooth, like masks. Some weren’t people at all — mannequins, plastic hands resting on each other. Yet every pair of eyes, real or glass, followed us.

My legs wobbled. Maddison yanked me forward.

We passed a game booth. Balloon darts. Ring toss. But the prizes weren’t toys. They were jars, cloudy with liquid. Inside, tiny hands pawed at the glass. Little mouths gasped bubbles.

Children lined up to play, smiling blankly. Their parents clapped in rhythm.

Maddison tugged me harder. “Davis, don’t stop.”

I could barely hear her. The music was louder, pounding in my chest. My skin tingled. I smelled caramel apples. My tongue felt sticky.

“Don’t you taste it?” I whispered.

“Taste what?” she demanded.

“Sugar. Butter. It’s—”

She shook me. “There’s nothing there.”


---

We stumbled into the main tent.

Jugglers tossed jars filled with twitching shapes. Acrobats swung from ropes that pulsed and dripped. Clowns’ painted grins stretched over stitched mouths.

The crowd of children clapped in perfect rhythm, eyes glassy, lips murmuring something too quiet to hear.

And then everything stopped.

At first, I thought it was a pole rising behind the tent. But then it bent.

The Long Neck Man.

He rose taller than the Ferris wheel, skeletal body hunched. Vertebrae cracked as his neck stretched skyward, swaying like a snake. His head dangled, jerking in sharp spasms.

His grin split ear to ear, lips torn and bleeding. His eyes rolled until they locked onto us.

The music cut out. The air held its breath.

With the sound of splintering wood, his neck bent down. Lower. Lower.

Until his face hovered inches from ours. His breath was damp, stinking of soil and rot. His jaw cracked, unhinging wide until it was nothing but a pit of jagged teeth.

His tongue slithered out, brushing Maddison’s cheek. She whimpered, clutching me.

Then his voice came. Not from his mouth. From everywhere. From inside my skull.

“Daaaavissss… Maddiiisssonnn…”

The children turned, eyes glowing faintly, chanting in flat voices:

“Join us. Join us. Join us.”

Maddison pulled at me, screaming, but my legs wouldn’t move. The music throbbed in my head, louder, faster. My mouth watered. I smelled sugar, smoke, dirt.

I wanted to join.

And for a moment — I swear I felt my neck stretch.
