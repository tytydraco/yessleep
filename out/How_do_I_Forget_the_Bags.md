My mom would tell me she felt an obligation to Aunt Lily because they were close growing up. Lily had a difficult time with money, and was the sole caretaker for a son from her divorce. Isaac was twenty-three and couldn’t live on his own. After Lily stopped taking him to his appointments he talked less and put on weight. I remember the footbaths Lily would set up for him while he watched TV. He’d soak there for hours, making the whole living room smell like epsom salt and skin.

I spent a lot of time at aunt Lily’s house. Isaac had a habit of collecting garbage in various containers. His largest repository was of empty tissue boxes, taking up nearly three whole plastic tubs near the fridge. If you touched them he would refuse to move for several hours. The loft was the only place that Isaac wouldn’t stash things. It was a simple room with a guest mattress. I didn’t like to sleep on it because it sometimes had weird stains. My mom let me play Wii up there while she and Lily talked. Our visits started becoming more frequent. Eventually we started going every Saturday.

Lily came up to the loft once. She sat very close to me on the bed and started telling me about her medicine. The smell of rancid coffee on her breath was distracting. She pressed a small brown glass bottle into my hand. There was a clear liquid inside which she said to drink a capful of every day. I showed it to my mom when we got home. Worry flashed on her face and she told me aunt Lily had different ideas about medicine that weren’t necessarily true. She said that even if Lily talked like she knew what was right, that only doctors who’d been to medical school had the knowledge to diagnose and prescribe remedies properly. Taking things that Lily gave me could be dangerous. I don’t know what she did with the bottle.

Our visits kept up for two more years and I graduated middle school. My mom got me a few Pokemon booster packs as congratulations. One of them contained a shiny Charizard, which became my most prized possession. I put it in a plastic sleeve and would take it with me places just so I could look at it. Around this time, Isaac’s complexion started to turn a shade of gray. The smell of whatever Lily rubbed on him stopped wearing off. I’d catch him walking out of the loft as I went up sometimes, sweating and breathing heavily.

I brought Charizard with me on my last visit to Lily’s. I was admiring it in an attempt to ignore the rumbling in my stomach. Aunt Lily only had PB&Js which I had grown tired of months ago. Eventually my hunger tore my eyes away from the card regardless. I left it on the bed as I went downstairs.

It took me a while to realize that Lily was out of peanut butter. Navigating Isaac’s various collections slowed my search. I heard his heavy footsteps on the stairs up to the loft as I opened another cupboard. A minute or two later, as I slathered two slices of white bread with a generous helping of grape jelly, I heard my mom call up to me. She was upstairs and hadn’t realized I was in the kitchen. Before I could respond, she started to yell my name a second time but stopped short.

Her footsteps raced down the stairs. She grabbed me by the arm and yanked me away from my sandwich fixings. I tried to ask her what was going on, but the look on her face silenced me immediately. I’d never seen her eyes so wide. As we raced out the door she mumbled a lie about a work project to aunt Lily which only confused me more. In the commotion I didn’t get a chance to go get Charizard.

I wanted to ask my mom about what happened on the drive home, make her turn around so I could go get my card, but her pursed lips and fixed stare intimidated me. In the end I said nothing. After that day whenever Aunt Lily would call, my mom would make an excuse as to why we couldn’t go over. It took about a week for Lily to stop reaching out. Whenever I tried to bring up her or Isaac, my mom’s face would grow dark and her responses would get kurt. I learned to stop prying.

Two months later Isaac died. They said it was a heart attack. At the funeral Aunt Lily kept opening and closing her mouth. Her teeth hitting each other made this awful noise. My mom didn’t look at her. Lily went to stay with friends on the east coast. It was supposed to be temporary, but I never saw her again.

A friend offered me sixty dollars for my shiny Charizard recently. It was the first time I’d thought about it since my last visit to aunt Lily’s. I knew my mom kept a spare key. Part of me was screaming to not go, but I was saving up for an Xbox and I wanted that money. I waited for my mom to leave for work that weekend. As soon as I was alone I took the key from its dresser drawer and got on my bike.

The house stood silent and unchanged since I had last been there. On the ride over a terrible weight settled in my stomach. I had pushed it down somewhat, but I couldn’t hold it back anymore when I tried the front door handle and found it unlocked. 

Isaac’s garbage was still neatly piled in the living room: Cigarette butts, used coffee filters, empty lotion bottles. Something dripped from the bottom of the fridge door into a murky puddle on the linoleum. An oppressive feeling washed over me. I felt watched, judged. I made my way to the stairs.

With the electricity off, the light of the overcast afternoon outside was all there was to see by. It colored the walls and carpets gray. The stairs ascended into darkness. I turned on my phone flashlight before going up.

I paused before the last five steps to the loft. The feeling in my stomach grew heavier. I hadn’t gone high enough to see into the room, the window was the only thing visible to me. Dust hung in the air. It took a lot of courage to push myself forward. I stopped on the penultimate step.

The mattress was covered with a wide sickly yellow stain. I didn’t see my Charizard where I’d left it. My heart started pounding in my ears. As soon as I stopped holding my breath I noticed the smell.

It was thick, invading my nostrils, making my eyes water. I’d never experienced anything like it before: Chlorine air from a stagnant pool, sweat, sink mold. 

There was a plain paper grocery bag in the corner. Top folded down, its sides bulged; overfull. Another identical bag sat next to it, but this one was still open. The stench emanated from them. I could almost see it in the air. Isaac had collected something in this room.

I biked home so fast that I could taste blood in my teeth. I couldn’t explain to my mom why I was crying when she got back. Now whenever I think about my time in that loft, the smell comes back to me. The bags I always just looked over burn into my memory. How do I forget them? How do I stop feeling sick?
