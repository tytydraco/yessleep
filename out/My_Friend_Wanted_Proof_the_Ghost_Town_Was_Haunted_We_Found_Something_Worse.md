I didn’t go because I believe in ghosts.

I went because my friend wouldn’t stop talking about “the town.”

He said it the way people say the mall, the diner, the spot. Like everyone’s supposed to know. Like it’s a rite of passage if you live within driving distance of the mountains.

“It’s not even that far,” he told me for the third time that week, leaning on my passenger window while I was trying to pump gas. “Old mining town. Abandoned. Still has stuff left behind. Tools. Cans. Maybe signs. And it’s supposed to be haunted.”

I made a face. “Haunted by what. Miners with pickaxes?”

He grinned like I’d walked into it. “Exactly.”

He was the kind of guy who could make you say yes to things without trying that hard. Not in a manipulative way. More like… he’d already decided it was going to be fun, and you didn’t want to be the person who wasn’t fun.

Also, if I’m being honest, I’d had a rough month. Too much screen time, too many nights falling asleep with my phone on my chest, the usual modern rot. A day in the mountains sounded like a reset.

So on a Saturday morning, we met up with coffee and a cheap breakfast sandwich, and we drove.

The last stretch was gravel road and patches of snow in the shade even though it was spring. The kind of road that makes your car sound like it’s complaining. The kind of place where you pass one rusted “NO SERVICES” sign and you start doing mental math on how far you are from cell signal.

He had the directions on his phone, but when it dropped to no bars he didn’t even blink. He’d printed a screenshot like it was 2009.

“See?” he said, tapping the paper. “We’re basically there.”

The abandoned town wasn’t marked with a sign. There was just a break in the trees where the road widened into a flat, rocky area—like a turnout that used to be a parking lot before the forest decided it wanted it back.

From there, you could see it: low shapes half-swallowed by brush, collapsed roofs, the dull angle of a corrugated metal building, a line of poles that used to carry power but now just stood there like dead matchsticks.

It didn’t look haunted.

It looked forgotten.

We parked and stepped out. The air was cold enough to bite your ears, but the sun had that bright, clean mountain glare. Everything smelled like pine and damp earth, and somewhere far off there was running water.

He hopped around the car, already excited, like we’d just rolled up to an amusement park.

“You ready?” he asked.

“I’m ready to be disappointed,” I said, and he laughed.

We started in what used to be the main strip, if you could call it that. A dirt road cutting between a handful of buildings. Most of them were just frames now. Weathered boards, broken windows, doors hanging from one hinge.

There were old goods, technically. Empty tin cans. Rusted nails. A cracked wash basin. An iron stove with its door open like a jaw.

He kept pointing things out like artifacts. “Look at this—branding iron. Old bottles. Dude, that’s a ledger.”

He was right about the ledger. It was wedged in a drawer that had half-fallen out of a desk inside one of the buildings. The pages were swollen from moisture. The ink had bled into soft lines.

He didn’t touch it. He just leaned in and took pictures, like he knew the unspoken rule: take only photos.

That’s when he mentioned the hiker.

He did it casually, like he’d been holding it back until the mood was right.

“You heard about that guy that went missing?” he asked.

I glanced at him. “What guy.”

He tucked his phone away and lowered his voice, like the trees might listen. “Last summer. Hiker went off-trail near here. They did a search. Dogs and everything. Nothing. People online said he’d been posting photos, like… ‘I found a ghost town,’ stuff like that.”

I snorted. “People go missing in the woods all the time.”

“Yeah,” he said, and his tone shifted a little. Less excited. “But this one was close enough to this place that—”

“That you wanna LARP as a rescue mission,” I finished.

He smiled, but it didn’t quite land. “I just wanna see if it’s real. Like… if there’s anything here. Any sign someone’s been camping or—”

“Or you wanna be the guy who finds the spooky clue,” I said.

He held up his hands. “Okay, yeah. Maybe.”

We kept moving.

There was a general store with the front wall mostly gone. Inside, shelves were tipped over. A cash register sat on the floor, half-buried in dust and mouse droppings. The glass display cases had been shattered long ago.

As we walked through, I felt that quiet pressure you get in places that used to hold a lot of voices. Like the air remembers.

Then I saw something that made me stop.

A handprint.

Not on a wall. On a pane of glass still clinging to a window frame. Dust-covered, but the print was clean, as if someone had pressed their palm there recently.

Five fingers. Normal size. A smear at the base, like someone slid their hand downward.

“Hey,” I said. “That—”

My friend leaned in. “Sick. Someone’s been here.”

“Recently,” I added.

He shrugged like that didn’t matter. “People explore. That’s the point.”

We moved on, and I told myself not to start doing that thing where my brain manufactures a threat because it wants the story to be better.

But then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

It was just a flicker in my peripheral vision. To the left, between two buildings, deep in the shadow.

It looked like… fingers.

Longer than they should’ve been.

And dark at the tips, like they were stained.

I turned my head fast and saw nothing.

Just a slat of broken fence and brush and a hanging strip of cloth that might’ve been part of a curtain.

“You good?” my friend asked.

“Thought I saw something,” I said.

“A bear?” he said, sounding excited again.

“No,” I said, because the word bear didn’t match what my body had done. My body hadn’t gone “predator.”

It had gone wrong.

We kept walking, and I kept glancing at the gaps between buildings like I’d left something behind.

We found the school after about twenty minutes, farther down the dirt road where the town thinned out. It was a low building with a collapsed roof on one side and a busted bell tower that leaned at an angle that made me want to step away from it.

The front doors were gone. Inside, the hallway was open to the sky in places where the roof had caved. Sunlight fell in hard rectangles on the floor.

We walked in anyway, because curiosity is a disease.

There were old desks—some stacked, some broken. A chalkboard still clung to one wall, stained and blank. A row of hooks for coats. Someone had painted a faded alphabet above them.

It felt like the kind of place that should’ve had kids’ voices, and not having them made the silence heavy.

We sat outside the school on the broken front steps to drink water and snack. He pulled out his phone and started taking pictures like it was a tourist stop.

“Hold up,” he said. “Get in one.”

“No,” I said. “I’m not posing in front of a haunted school.”

“It’s not haunted,” he said, smiling. “It’s history.”

I rolled my eyes and stood anyway, because he wasn’t going to let it go.

He stepped back and framed the shot. “Okay, look just past me. Like you’re thinking about how sad it is.”

“Shut up,” I said, but I did it.

He snapped a couple photos. Then he did one of us together, leaning in with his arm around my shoulder, both of us grinning like idiots.

“Perfect,” he said, scrolling.

Then his smile faded slightly.

“What?” I asked.

He turned the screen toward me.

At first I didn’t see it. Just us, the school behind us, the hallway dark.

Then I saw the two white dots.

They were in the background, deep in the hallway darkness, symmetrical like eyes. Not reflective like animal eyes that catch a flash. These looked like they were lit from inside. Clean white circles, too round.

My throat tightened.

“Probably a raccoon,” my friend said quickly.

“In a school hallway,” I said.

“They’ll go anywhere,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself. He tapped the screen, zoomed in, and the image blurred. The dots stayed.

“Maybe it’s dust,” he said. “Or like, lens flare.”

“It’s in the shadow,” I said.

He locked his phone and shoved it into his pocket with too much force. “Okay. So we leave. Happy?”

I was about to say yes—yes, let’s leave, let’s go back to the car and pretend this was just a creepy photo—when I heard it.

Not a scream.

A sound like crying.

Soft, broken, like someone trying to breathe through it.

It came from deeper in the town, beyond the school, where the trees were thicker and the buildings were less intact.

My friend froze, mid-step.

We looked at each other.

“Did you—” he started.

The crying stopped.

The silence that followed felt… staged. Like someone had turned the sound off.

Then we heard it again, farther away. Softer. Like it was moving, or like it wanted us to think it was.

My friend swallowed. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, we’re leaving.”

We started walking back toward the main strip, fast but not running. Running would’ve felt like admitting we were scared, and pride is another disease.

As we walked, I kept catching glimpses of movement at the edge of the buildings. Not clear shapes. Just a shift. A shadow that didn’t line up with the sun.

Then we heard something else.

A scream—this time not a woman. It sounded like pain. Like a person being hurt.

It was short and jagged, cut off abruptly, like someone had been grabbed mid-sound.

My friend stopped and turned his head like he was trying to triangulate it. “That’s… that’s not—”

“It’s not real,” I said, but it came out weak.

Because the scream had sounded real in the way your brain recognizes whether something is performed or not.

My friend’s hand went to his pocket like he was checking his phone. No signal, obviously, but he did it anyway. “We should call—”

“Later,” I said. “Get to the car.”

We hit the general store again, and I saw something that made my blood go cold.

The clean handprint on the glass was gone.

Not smeared.

Gone like the dust had been disturbed over it, wiped away.

As if someone didn’t want us staring at it anymore.

I kept walking.

We rounded a corner between two buildings and I saw it again—this time not just fingers.

A hand, fully, gripping the edge of a wall.

Long knuckles. Pale skin, almost gray in the shadow.

And the nails—

They looked like claws. Not sharp like a cat’s. Thick and cracked, dark at the tips like dried blood.

I saw it for less than a second.

Then it withdrew.

I stopped so hard my friend almost bumped into me. “Did you see that?”

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Yeah.”

That was all he said.

That “yeah” had weight.

We didn’t talk after that. We just walked faster, trying not to look like we were running, even though every nerve in my body wanted to explode into sprinting.

The crying started again behind us.

Closer.

Not loud. Just persistent. Like it was following at a pace that didn’t require effort.

We passed the school again and I looked into the hallway without wanting to.

The two white dots weren’t there.

The hallway was darker than it should’ve been for this time of day, like the light had drained out of it.

I could smell something faint and sour—like wet pennies, like meat left too long.

My friend whispered, “Don’t look.”

We walked.

We walked.

Then the town went quiet in a new way, like even the wind stopped moving through the gaps in the buildings. The silence pressed in so hard it made my ears ring.

And then I heard footsteps behind us.

Not ours.

Not crunching like boots on gravel.

More like something dragging its weight through dirt, then pausing. Like it was listening.

My friend’s breathing changed. He glanced over his shoulder and didn’t slow down, but his whole body tightened.

“Don’t,” I whispered.

“I have to know,” he whispered back.

He looked over his shoulder again.

Whatever he saw made his face drain.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t swear. He just whispered, “Oh my god.”

Then he ran.

He broke into a full sprint, and my body followed before my brain caught up, because when the person next to you bolts, your survival instinct doesn’t ask questions.

We ran toward the turnout where the car was parked. The path wasn’t straight. We had to weave between buildings and brush and fallen beams.

Behind us, the crying became a sound I can’t describe without my stomach turning.

It wasn’t crying anymore.

It was something mimicking crying, like it had learned the shape of that sound but not the meaning. It turned into a wet, breathy thing with these little jerky breaks, like laughter trying to be sorrow.

Then, above it, that screech.

The same kind of screech you hear in horror movies and roll your eyes at because it’s too much.

In real life, it’s not “too much.”

It’s too true.

My foot caught on a piece of wood and I stumbled, catching myself before I fell. My friend was ahead of me now, maybe fifteen feet. He was looking back, running blind.

“Don’t look!” I yelled.

He looked anyway.

That’s when it hit him.

It didn’t pounce like an animal. It didn’t tackle him like a person.

It came out of the gap between buildings like it unfolded from the shadow, and it moved with this awful smooth speed, like it didn’t have to obey the same rules of momentum we do.

My friend went down hard.

He hit the dirt on his side and rolled, trying to scramble up, his hands flailing for purchase.

He screamed then—one sharp, shocked sound.

I stopped, because my brain did the stupid heroic thing where it tries to rewrite the ending.

I ran toward him.

I saw the creature, full, for the first time.

It looked like an emaciated deer, but not in any way that felt natural. No fur. Skin stretched tight over bone, pale gray like old ash. Its spine and ribs were too visible, like it had been starving for years. Its legs were long and jointed wrong in places, and its hooves—if they were hooves—were split and cracked like they’d been forced into shape.

Its head was the worst part.

It was deer-like in outline, but the face was wrong. The muzzle looked peeled back, too much bone showing. The mouth opened wider than it should have, not full of neat teeth, but jagged, uneven teeth like broken glass set into gum.

And the eyes.

Not animal eyes.

Those two white dots I saw in the photo weren’t reflections. They were the thing’s eyes, and they were blank and bright like dropped coins.

It looked at me and held my gaze for a second too long.

Like it was deciding if I was worth the effort.

I shouted. I don’t even remember what I shouted. Something useless.

It didn’t flinch.

It snapped its head toward my friend, who was trying to crawl backward on his elbows.

Then it moved again.

One fast step.

A blur of pale limbs.

My friend’s scream turned into a sound of pain that cut off halfway through like someone had shut a door on it.

I saw his legs kick once. Twice.

Then nothing.

I stood there frozen, my brain refusing to accept that the person I’d eaten breakfast with an hour ago was suddenly… gone in the most final way.

The creature’s head turned back to me.

It tilted, like it was curious.

And then it came for me.

I ran.

I ran so hard I couldn’t feel my lungs. I ran like the ground was pulling away under my feet. I ran toward the turnout, toward the car, toward any place that wasn’t behind me.

Something hit my back.

Not a full body slam.

Just the tips of those claws raking across me like it was testing how deep it could cut.

Pain exploded across my shoulder blades. Hot and tearing. It stole my breath and made my vision blur.

I stumbled but didn’t fall. I kept running.

I heard the creature behind me—its footsteps didn’t sound like hooves. They sounded like wet wood snapping.

I made it to the turnout and saw the car like a miracle, parked where we left it. Sunlight hit the windshield and for a stupid second it looked normal, like this could still be a story about exploring an old mining town and laughing about a creepy photo later.

I fumbled the keys out with shaking hands.

I hit the unlock button. The car beeped.

I yanked the driver’s door open and dove in.

My friend—his seat—was empty, the way it should be, and that made my throat tighten because it shouldn’t be.

I slammed the door, shoved the key into the ignition, and turned.

The engine coughed once, like it was offended at being asked to work.

Then it started.

I threw the car into reverse without looking and backed up hard enough that gravel sprayed. The tires spun, then caught.

As I swung the car around, I looked up.

The creature stood at the edge of the turnout, half in the trees. It wasn’t charging the car. It wasn’t frantic.

It was watching.

Its ribs rose and fell slowly, like it had all the time in the world. Like it could wait for me to make a mistake. Like it knew roads didn’t matter as much as people think.

Then it opened its mouth.

And the sound it made wasn’t a screech this time.

It was a sob.

A perfect sob.

A human one.

The same type of broken cry I’d heard earlier.

It came out of that mouth like a practiced line.

I hit the gas so hard my foot cramped.

The car lurched forward and I tore down the gravel road, bouncing over ruts, not caring what it did to my suspension. My back burned with every movement, and when I lifted my shirt at the first straightaway, my fingers came away wet.

Blood.

I drove until I hit cell signal and didn’t even realize I’d been holding my breath the whole time until my phone chimed with a notification like it had just woken up.

I pulled over and called 911 so fast I fumbled the digits.

When the operator answered, my voice came out wrong—too high, too tight.

I told them where we were. I told them my friend was gone. I told them something attacked us and I knew how it sounded and I didn’t care.

They asked what the attacker looked like.

I said, “Like a deer,” and I hated myself for it, because it sounded insane.

But then I added, “No fur. Gray skin. Wrong mouth. Eyes like… like headlights.”

I heard the change in the operator’s breathing. That moment when someone is trying to stay professional while their brain goes “what.”

They said deputies were on the way. Search and rescue, too.

I sat on the side of the road with my shirt pressed to my back, shaking, watching the tree line like it could step out anywhere.

Hours later, a deputy took my statement and an EMT cleaned and bandaged the claw marks. Four long cuts across my upper back. Not deep enough to kill me. Deep enough to prove I wasn’t just making it up.

Search and rescue went out there that afternoon.

They didn’t find my friend.

They found the town, of course. They found our footprints. They found the school.

They found the spot where he went down.

There was blood.

There were drag marks.

Then the drag marks stopped in a patch of brush like the earth had swallowed him.

They also told me something else, quietly, like they didn’t want me to hear it.

There was a missing hiker report near that town. More than one, if you went back far enough. People who stepped off trail. People who followed a sound. People who went looking for “a place.”

I asked if they thought the mining town had anything to do with it.

The deputy didn’t answer directly. He just looked at me for a long second and said, “Don’t go back.”

I haven’t.

But sometimes, when my phone shows me old photos the way it likes to—little “memories” it thinks I want—I see that school picture again.

And I zoom in.

And I look at the two white dots in the dark.

And I think about how my friend said, Probably a raccoon.

And I think about how fast “probably” becomes “too late” out there.

Because the last thing that creature did—before I hit the gas and left my friend behind in that town—was cry like a person.

Not because it was sad.

Because it knew it worked.
