It happened again last night. Another poltergeist episode. Followed by another podcast episode. This one went a little different.

I was so afraid to hear anything, so I put in ear plugs. A wadded-up newspaper did the job as a door jam.

When the creaking of the stairs started, my heart leapt into my throat. Again, something walked up the stairs and down the hallway to my room. I watched the doorknob turn and the lock open, but the door didn’t budge. It only pushed against the jam. Success, I thought, and tried to take a deep breath.

It walked through the door. I couldn’t see anything visible, but I just felt the presence enter the room through the door. My shaky breath came out as fog, and I bit down on my tongue to stop myself from yelling.

An invisible hand traced a dark red stain into the wall as all time dropped away. Below the previous message, a new one appeared. I had all the time of eternity to drink it in: GET OUT.

The presence faded from the room, the temperature returned to normal, and my eyes were stuck on the message. My mind subconsciously braced, a dam waiting for a tidal wave of dread. It hit. I heard it through the ear plugs.

“Nice. Good second part,” said Isaac.

“Yeah, I like the escalation of the ghost walking through the door,” said Harris.

“I love how the author is using the space. I like the atmosphere of this cruddy old house that creaks and groans.”

“I’m waiting for, like, some creepy doll to show up. I feel like that’s the way it’s going.”

“Like Annabelle or Raggedy Ann?”

“What the hell is Raggedy Ann?”

Isaac then took the time to explain to Harris about the original Annabelle doll some stupid movie was based on was originally a Raggedy Anne doll, but Harris insisted that couldn’t be true because he had seen the movie and it didn’t look anything like that. I didn’t know what the hell they were talking about, and at some point, my spectral listen-in faded to the background of my mind. I started brainstorming how I was going to deal with the poltergeist.

As I laid awake, I ran through my options. I didn’t have any money for a psychic, and I don’t trust priests as far as I can throw them, but this poltergeist hadn’t thrown anything at my head yet.

Maybe it’s peaceful. If I try talking to it maybe it will answer.

“What do you think?” said Harris. “Is he going to be smart and actually get out?”

“No, he won’t heed the warning. I’m predicting it not that the poltergeist is gonna, like, change into a monster and kill him.”

“Dude, what if he’s the monster and he’s haunting the poltergeist? That’d be some Edgar Allen Poe type shit.”

“This is nothing like Poe! It’s more like Lovecraft.”

“It’s got Poe written all over this story!”

“What are you talking about? Why do you compare everything to Poe?” Isaac scoffed.

Harris replied with “Why do you compare everything to Lovecraft?”

They went on to debate for what felt like hours. Maybe once I get rid of this poltergeist, I can get rid of these idiots too.
