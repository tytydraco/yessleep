My wife and I had a fight earlier. Although I'm not the type to share every detail and nuisance of my life, let alone my marriage. I just want to get something off my chest. I came to understand that this space of the internet is a safe place to share personal anguishes, feelings, and traumas because people are genuinely willing to help, even to strangers. So, allow me to share mine.

You see, she wanted our bed against the wall, meaning the wall would be touching the bed. That sounds simple and not like a big deal because it's a common setup. But I don't want that. Why? Because I have a phobia of sleeping on a bed that touches the wall. I want the bed to be in the middle of the room. Why? I want to share my horrifying experience.

Back in college in 2009, my ex and I broke up and she kicked me out of her apartment. Fortunately a buddy of mine was kicked out at the same time so we agreed to become roommates.

After a night of drinking we dragged our luggage through the narrow streets in the inner part of the city and moved among the subdivisions and residential areas near our universities to look for a place. Somehow, despite being drunk, we found a good one. It was a duplex unit at the back of a residential area near the sea and the few remaining mangroves in the city.

We met the owner. He was a young businessman who had inherited his grandparents' house. He was a somewhat rebellious fellow. He told us that his grandfather and his father had refused to sell or destroy the land and their ancestral home, even when all the other original owners of that piece of land were selling to developers for huge sums. His father's last wish had been for him to inherit the property,  because he was the eldest of eight children, and was to preserve the house. So, what did this man do? After they died, he renovated the large house. He put a wall down the middle, added bathrooms on each side, made two bedrooms, and invited students to rent rooms at low prices, although water and electricity were not included, and must be shouldered by the tenants. 

The unit was freshly painted, furnished with new furniture because he had sold the antiques, and had renovated amenities such as an air conditioner, a faucet, and an in-house refrigerator. Although my friend and I had side hustles and could have afforded other apartments, we chose this one primarily for its calm atmosphere and its distance from the busy city.

As you might guess, strange things happened on the first night. My friend and I took separate bedrooms. I was awakened by a tapping noise. When I checked the time, it was midnight. I initially thought it was my friend and brushed it off. On the second night it happened again, and on the third night of happening, I went outside to confront him but I discovered him sleeping soundly in his bedroom. It was strange because the tapping did not stay in one place. Instead it seemed to follow me and was always louder on my right side. 

The next day, I told him and he laughed, saying he had not heard anything and I must be having these hallucinations from overdrinking. However, seeing how upset I was, he agreed to help me figure out what might be causing it. We listed possible causes, including a leaking water pipe, an exposed electrical wire, and rats. We even joked that it might be gravity, though I do not know why we thought that. We searched the house, checking every corner and crevice. We also inspected the other side of the divider wall, which was unoccupied at the time - but found nothing that could explain the noise. We ended the day by agreeing that if it happened again that night we would investigate together.

That night, I woke up again because of the same tapping noise. I scanned the room for the source of the tapping but found nothing. I woke my friend,  and we searched the house and the grounds. It was strange because all that time he heard nothing. 

After our second sweep he joked that maybe something was wrong with my ear. I sat at the dining table while he used his stolen penlight from his ex, who was a medical student, and examined my right ear. As soon as he peaked my right ear,  he shouted. He hurriedly lit a cigarette, took a long drag, blew smoke toward my ear, and tilted my head downward. To my horror a huge housefly fell out. It writhed naturally on the ground. I screamed and nearly fainted. How did it get in there, and how could it have made that tapping sound?

He immediately stepped on it and the jet black fluid from its body spilt out the ground. After the chaos, we sat down silently for a few minutes. 

“Maybe your brain is rotten inside because the fleas tried to eat it.” His grotesque joke lightened the mood. We laughed, trying to brush off what had just happened. He offered me a drink from the refrigerator and shared his few opinions about the incident, especially how the fly had gotten into my ear. Whilst listening, I stood up, and walked to my bedroom to turn off the light and close the door because I did not want mosquitoes to come in.

However -

As I reached to close the door, I glanced into the room and froze. Above the head of my bed a naked woman was pressed into the wall, as if her upper torso slipped through the wall. Her hair fanned out like spilled ink, crawling across the ceiling and pooling along the floor. Her skin had a sickly, purplish pallor with black roots of veins visible.  and the tips of her fingers were black, like burned twisted twigs. Her face was a perfect oval facing toward mine - her eyes sealed shut and her mouth stretched open and I could only see hollow, pitch‑black inside without any teeth and tongue. 

What troubled me most was that her open hands faced the pillow where my head lay each night, which made me feel she might have been touching, or worse, holding my head.  I also noticed holes in her palms, and then my stomach turned and I vomited as soon as I saw flies crawling out of them.

As I was throwing up the contents of my stomach - I saw her mouth open wider, tearing at her cheeks and exposing the black flesh within. Black, sticky fluid dripped from her mouth onto my bed. Then, without warning, both of her hands stretched out, her icy fingers pressing gently against my cheeks. The smell was unbearable, like a rotten rat carcass. In my head, at the moment, I heard a sweet, soothing voice: 

*“Come back to sleep.”* 

I immediately collapsed to the floor, feeling the life drain out of me. My friend saw me and ran over - he saw her too, but he was braver than I was. He didn’t waste time dragging me outside the house. I regained my strength once we were off the property, and we ran away, spending the night at a friend’s house.

As soon as daylight came, we asked our friends to help us gather our belongings and left the house for good. For years my friend didn’t talk about it. Last year, however, when I visited his house at Christmas, I tried to ask him what he thought or what he might know about the incident. He leaned back on his leather sofa and sighed.

“I didn’t really see the fly when I peaked at your ear.” He said. 

He then faced me with a serious look. 

“I just saw a pair of glowing eyes.”

That made my skin crawl.
