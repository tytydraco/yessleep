I’ve been hallucinating since I was eleven years old. I’m twenty-two now, fresh out of college here in the middle of Wyoming. I got my bachelors in Education with a major in Fine Arts, which is where this story starts, but unfortunately not where it ends. 

I was a sophomore in college when we got medication that would actually work for me. My doctor and I had tried multiple prescriptions before we found the golden ticket: Aripiprazole. Abilify for short.

The meds helped, a lot. However, they didn’t *completely* quell the hallucinations. I would still see things out of the corner of my eyes or in the shadows of a dark room. With the help of Abilify, they don’t scare me. At least, they didn’t.

I live in a one bedroom apartment, alone. I got the place back in May, right after I graduated and left my claustrophobic dorm room. Anyway, it’s now November, meaning I've been living here for six months.

One of the biggest fears I’ve had regarding my hallucinations is seeing someone I know, deformed and mutilated. I’m also afraid of seeing huge bugs or uncanny animals. Somehow, through some graceful turn of fate, none of them came true. But, what I’ve experienced is much more terrifying. 

Back in late September, a friend of mine, Delilah, crashed over for the night. She was my roommate in college, for three out of four years. With that being said, she knows all about my hallucinations and my issue with the antipsychotics I’ve been on.

As the night was closing in, she asked me if I had an extra set of sheets for the air mattress I was letting her use. I made my way to the bedroom to look for it, as I knew I had one somewhere. I looked in the closet, but there were only old boxes of some shit I had never unpacked. I thought about the space under my bed. Surely, it was under there. Where else would I put something I thought I’d never use? 

I walked to my bed, getting on my knees with the purpose to search. I let my hands hit the cold wood. I tucked my hair behind my ear, and tilted my head to be eye level with the blackness in between the box spring and the floor. My eyes wandered through the space until they met with someone else's. Mine. 

I whipped my head up as quick as my neck would support, banging my head on the metal bars of my bed frame. Delilah called from a couple rooms over, asking if everything was alright and if I had found the sheets. I told her everything was fine, and that no, I hadn’t.

Still on my knees, I started at the floor. I rubbed my head with my hand. She was smiling. This was the first time I had hallucinated myself. 



At the start of October I got a new –and honestly better– job. I would be a high school drawing teacher. My students and I would be working mainly with charcoal and graphite. I was extremely excited, as this was the job I had always envisioned for myself. I was told the former teacher had to resign. Why, I wasn’t too sure of. 

I was six days into my position when I saw it again. I got home around four in the afternoon, and I was eager to take some sort of power nap. As easy as it may seem, teaching was exhausting. 

I laid down on my bed. I thought of my day, the kids, and my lunch. This was exactly the life I wanted.

I put my phone on my side table, but immediately thought it would be better to charge it as I slept. I dropped my head off the side of my bed, allowing my hair to touch the floor. It was getting quite long. I felt the charger between my fingers, but as I was bringing it up, I dropped the cable back onto the floor. I turned to look at the charger. I noticed pieces of hair on it that certainly weren’t mine. I trailed my eyes down, following the strands. She was peeking out from underneath the bed. I could only see her eyes, but holy shit were they the worst thing I have ever seen. I turned my whole body back onto the bed. I shut my eyes as tightly as I could, inwardly reminding myself that it wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

But she had *my* eyes. The exact same colour, and the exact same shape. I counted to five, taking slow, deep breaths. I hesitantly opened my eyes, looking very carefully to where she had just been. 

She was gone. 



I would see her from time to time while at work. Or the gym. Or anywhere, really. Just quick flashes of her wide smile.



Recently, I saw her as I was teaching a class of juniors. I had just started telling them about the art history course I was required to take in college. One of my students piped up, and he asked how boring the class had been. I smiled at him, preparing myself to give him the appropriate answer. I looked past him to the back of the room. 

Usually, my hallucinations tend to be vague outlines and silhouettes. No defining features, no nothing. Just shapes and shadows. 

She, however, was not. 

As she stood at my height near the door, I could see her in full. Same hair, same eyes, same nose, mouth, and some-fucking-how, the exact same clothes I had been wearing that day. A white t-shirt with brown slacks. Her grin was inhumanly large. I stumbled over my response to the student. At that moment, I felt like I'd never felt fear before. I was unexplainably scared. But, as soon as I blinked, She was gone.

I invited Delilah over that upcoming weekend. I couldn't be alone. Not with her– *me*. These hallucinations were getting out of control. I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to get my prescription either changed completely or to a higher dosage. 

When Friday rolled around, I opted to stay in my car that was parked in the teacher lot. No way in hell was I going back to my apartment alone. I stayed there for two hours, watching my phone die as I scrolled on facebook, twitter,  instagram– Just anything to keep the other me out of my mind.

Delilah texted me around five thirty that she was on her way. I drove home.

I felt insane. What was happening? Why was now the time my meds stopped working? Were they just becoming less effective?

My mind raced a thousand thoughts at once as I pulled up to my apartment. Delilah was outside, a smile on her face.

“How were the kids today?”

I smiled weakly in response. I unlocked the door and the two of us walked inside. After some catching up, I got to the point.

“You know how I… see things?”

Delilah quirked her head as if confused. “Yeah? Are they getting worse?”

“I– I guess I’m not too sure what's going on with them.” I had said, embarrassment creeping its way up my cheeks.

She nodded in understanding. “Here, let me make you a drink. It’s the weekend anyway…” 

She trailed off, her voice getting softer as she stood up and walked through the hallway and into the kitchen.

I sat there in uneasy silence. My appointment is in a week, which isn’t soon enough. 

I felt like the meds were working, but obviously they’re not. Why did it have to be me? Why couldn’t I hallucinate a cute puppy following me around? Or a regular person– *that wasn’t fucking me.* 

Delilah came back from the kitchen, two glasses in hand. When our eyes met, her face twisted with confusion.

“Hey! How did you get in here so fast?” She asked, setting down a glass on either side of the coffee table.

“Hm? I never left the couch.” I replied, taking my drink in hand.

She looked even more confused, “What? I just passed you in the hall?” 

She chuckled as she said this.

I saw something move behind her. It was me.

No, no this wasn’t a hallucination. This was a real, tangible person. A fucking person. It was so obvious to me now.

“You know it's not nice to lie.” She laughed.

“Delilah...” I whispered.

“Aren’t you going to try your drink? I just picked what you had in your fridge so I’m sure you’ll like it–”

“Delilah.” I said, as the other me came closer to her. 

“–and I do know you like your alcohol, if your twenty-first says anything.”

“Delilah, please.” I begged, wishing she’d stop and look behind her– or move or just *something*.

With no warning, the other me brought her hands out, one hand on the top of Delilah's head, the other on her jaw. I screamed out. She smiled. A small, menacing smile. 

I closed my eyes, terrified of what was about to happen. In the dark of my eyelids, I heard it. The snap.

I opened my eyes in a fit of panic. Delilah was splayed out across the floor of my living room. My drink was staining my carpet. In my fear I had dropped the glass. Her head was facing the ceiling, but so was her back. I felt sick to my stomach, trying to keep the bile from making its way up.

I quickly darted my eyes through the layout, trying to find the other me. I never did.



It’s been some time since all of this went down. I called the police and they’ve started a whole investigation. It looks like I'm going to be put on trial for her murder. I know it’s a losing battle, as the parking lot footage shows no one entered other than her and I. I’ve started cleaning out my apartment. Moving some stuff to my parents. I ended up moving my bed to the other corner of my room. In the mess of dust and old tattered blankets that have been wasting away under my bed, I saw a folded set of sheets.

I still see her. She’s in every passing car, she's in every aisle at the grocery store, every window in the businesses downtown… I don’t know what I did to deserve it, but dear God I hope she goes away. I just want her to go away.
