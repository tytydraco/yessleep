I started working this job when I was in my mid thirties. I had been working retail for a long time, doing the same old shit, I just wanted a new opportunity. I never expected what I was getting into for a little adventure and a few extra bucks.



I never went to college, never had good grades, well outside of kindergarten. All “A”s there. Fingerpainting and shit was top of the class. Did good during recess, always sharing my toys with the other kids. If only my kindergarten performance could count towards a good job. 



Anyhow, based on circumstances I kind of created myself, like I said before I just ended up working dead end jobs. Retail was where I remained mostly. Started from a mom and pop shop working in a deli, to running around the back rooms managing stock in a big chain supermarket. Either one barely paid.



I was walking out to my car after a late night when I got approached by some weird guys. Tight suits, bald heads. Now that I think about it, they sorta looked like those guys showing up around my apartment lately, although minus that plastic look. 



“Hello Mr. Davis.” They greeted me.



“How you *almost* know my name?” I laughed a little. I was a little spooked too though, I can’t lie.



“It’s on your shirt.” One of the guys pointed stiffly at the tag I still had on my shirt. “Forgive me, I meant David. It’s a little dark out here, and my eyes aren’t so good.”



“Oh, right.” But when I reached to my chest to take my tag off, I didn’t have it on. It was in my bag. Now I was really spooked. 



I looked over to the other guy, who was just standing staring at me. He had these bright blue eyes, shining like the stars in the night sky. Felt like the dude was looking right into my soul. 



They quickly shifted gears into their little proposal. 



Their words were full of promises. Which were kept to an extent. I was promised great benefits and pay, provided housing, all the goods. But the biggest thing was a promise of doing something great, getting to be a pioneer. Be an aid to a new discovery, a big one too. And that's exactly what I wanted.



I was tired of being someone who just existed. I always wanted to be something cool. I always saw my high school mates on social media, doing all sorts of things. Small things like taking vacations to foreign countries or learning something new. Or big things like opening a business or starting a family. So their offer seemed alright, and “alright” is what I wanted. But I was in my own way.



So I stupidly decided to take the job. Not a moment's hesitation. While sure the benefits were nice, what was nicer was the idea of doing something great. Greater. Greatest. 



I quickly learned why they approached me. I met a lot of folk just like me, some wanderers, but most downtrodden and beaten by the system. Those who were beaten by themselves. People who wanted something new. People who wanted to be something. 



I also met a few people who came here for a different reason. Lots of foreigners, looking to get citizenships, green cards. I think Jose might have been one of them, but I never asked. Guess it’s a little racist for me to assume that though. 



It was that very first time I saw that maze, hanging high above us all, looking down on us like it was God, sometimes I wonder if it might be. It was beautiful, and terrifying. But it was my Oregon Trail. My path to a new life, a new world. Little did I know I was gonna be locked in my new world. I’m starting to wonder if the retail work, life between the shelves, was better.



I had a dream of the first death I saw last night. 



Everyone but me in the group that day was a veteran. That's normally how they like to pair new guys up. Cause, if you see that shit in the maze, and half of your group is newbies, nobody is making it out. Everyone would be panicking. I’ve only seen it once or twice, where they’ve sent in a full group of new bloods, nobody ever comes out. It’s probably those one or two times that told them that sending a bunch of new guys in grouped together is a bad idea.



We were laying a fresh line from a new entrance. Often when you do this, you hit a dead end pretty fast, and that we did. Maybe only a mile or two in. 



The dude in front of me started sinking all the sudden, he couldn’t step out, nothing. He started panicking, as to be expected when you start sinking into concrete. He kept looking at me, begging for help. My head was spinning, I stood still watching him for a moment, not sure what to do, while the people in front of me turned back, and started walking back. 



“Just leave him, ain’t nothing we can do.” One of my groupies that day said to me while he placed the marker for the dead end before wandering back from where we came from. But when I looked back at the sinking man…



“Don’t leave me, please…” He asked me so calmly, although wincing a little. He had these big ol’ puppy eyes. Dude couldn’t have been more than 20 years old. “It’s starting to hurt.”



So I grabbed his arms and began pulling, but he never budged. At one point I pulled so hard there came this poppin’ sound,  I had dislocated his shoulder. He began screaming from that pain, and once he had sunk deep enough in, to where his torso was beginning to be covered, that pain made him scream too, even harder. 



I couldn’t pull on him anymore because one: it was evident it was futile, and two: I couldn’t keep pulling on his dislocated arm. I woulda kept trying, but I didn’t want to cause him no more pain.



I just had to watch him sink. When it reached his chest it really started crushing him. His screams turned to gasps and airless chokes, his face started turning purple, and his eyes began to bulge out his head. Seemed the deeper he went the tighter the ground squeezed.



It was like he was a stress toy for the maze. Eventually the maze squeezed too hard, and his head popped. He was already dead I’m sure, his screaming stopped when his neck went into the ground. It was only a few seconds after that moment when it popped. 



I just sat there on my butt, staring at the bloody mess surrounding where he had sunk. I was breathing so hard, my eyes were getting fuzzy, and I couldn’t feel my face. It was about there when I woke up. Sat up so quick the dude always watching me sleep got spooked and ran.



“Sorry.” I called out to the weird man. He was already gone, so my apology went to nobody. 



Another one of those weird watching guys showed up in my apartment today. Making three in total. He just stands in front of my stovetop. Leaves when I push him aside. I gave him a little apron that I got from my mom a long long time ago, when I first moved out on my own. I was maybe eighteen I think. 



She gave it to me for when I would cook, although I never used it, it had value to me. It's just a simple blue checkered apron. Nothing special. Thought since I never used it, I’d give it to the new chef in my house. He still wears it, just like the elevator dude still carries that can of beer I gave him.



I’ve actually given him some other stuff too. I gave him some hats and a scarf that I bought from a little clothes store in the town, and I’ve also given him more food items too. One thing I gave him was a bag of vegetables, but they’ve all gone bad and are starting to stink a little. 



Now, the elevator always has this sour smell. I tried to take the bag from him but his grip on it is so tight. He’s white knuckling that shit, if that's how he's holding the can too, then I’m surprised that he hasn’t crushed the can of beer. I’ll probably come back with some scissors and cut the bag so I can trash the bad vegetables from his hand.



I’ve been going to Lar’s more and more. I’ve had a few times the guys from the groups I’ve worked in invite me out, but I’ve found I’d rather drink alone. I don’t want to talk about work, I don’t want to get close to anyone.



More and more I realize why I shut my brain down, set it into work mode. I don’t know why I keep wondering about Jose. We barely knew each other, but even the few times we went out together, that was enough to make me worry about someone, about him. Couldn’t care less about that gal though. 

  


I’ve thought about stopping the journaling stuff too. I feel like it’s bringing some stuff back up. Well, I know it’s bringing stuff back up. I’ve never really thought about how weird this all is, how wrong this all is, until now. Even when I first started working here,  I didn’t really think much of everything going on. 



I feel like I’m just repeating stuff. This happened and that happened, and I’m not doing nothing about it. I watch someone die, some weird plastic dude shows up at my apartment, and then another one the next week. 



Now, more people are disappearing. I mean, people die everyday, that's the job, but this is different. I’ve had a few moments where people are showing up when they get called in, stuff like that. Also, a bunch of the girls at Lar’s have been replaced. Nobody seems to care, now we got more of those fit girls, all natural, all pure beauty. Sure it’s way better to look at, but something seems off about the whole thing. They all kinda look the same.



We’ve also had more of the more fit, young dudes showing up. Just as the new girls at Lar’s look the same as the new girl we got a bit a go, they all kinda look the same as the new guys me and Jose saw a couple weeks back. 



It reminds me a little of the weird bald suit dudes showing up to my apartment recently. There are features that are obviously different between each other. For the suit dudes it's their head shape, the new young bloods coming in seems to be height and muscle mass (although all of them are very tall and very buff), and for the girls it's their boobs and butts. Everything else about them is like carbon copies. They way they move and act, the way they speak.  



When it comes to the guys not showing up for work, it seems the dudes at the camps outside the maze don’t really care. They almost seemed to have expected it. 



I’m not that guy who wants to be a pioneer anymore. I’ve fallen into the same slog that I was in when I was working retail. And I’m tired of it. Tomorrow marks my sixth year working here. And I’ve decided it’s gonna be my last. I’m done acting like all this is normal, I’m gonna figure out what the hell's going on.
