I wanted to get on here and warn you all of something that never crossed my mind until what happened to me 3 months ago. I worked for a fairly big corporate grocery store here in the states, and had been there for roughly a year. I worked the first few months in produce, before having to be switched over to a store clerk after a co-worker came back from maternity leave. I would not say I love the job, but it's definitely the best one I've had so far. Me and my boss are pretty chill, or at least I think so. He's a millennial, and is just trying to be cool. He lets me take smoke breaks, listen to music when we aren't having a rush of customers, and even buy some snacks and sit outside for a few minutes while on the clock.

It all started when he asked me if I would be willing to work on Friday night, which was one of my days off.

"Come on Mikey, after all I let you do on the clock, you can pickup just one shift during the holiday season for me, man," my manager Tristan said with a sigh, after I had told him that I preferred not to work on a Friday night. "I see you online gaming all night on your days off anyway, dude. It's not like you have anything going on."

He was right, there was nothing I would love doing more after a long four day week than hopping online and playing for hours on end. It was easy to forget my life stresses by doing so. 

"Well, I mean, I do like to game on Friday the most, all my friends are usually playing pretty late." Tristan seemed slightly annoyed with that response.

"Look man, this is usually the busiest day for our location every year. We need you to work the night shift. You are the only cross trained clerk that we have," Tristan said, trying to level with me. "Alright, here is what I am going to offer you Mikey. If you work this 8-4 Friday night, I'll give you a paid day off after the new year. You can call it in whenever you like."

I pondered the deal, work Friday and have an even longer weekend later? "Sure, why not." I said. "I need money to buy some gifts anyway, I've been slacking."

"Alright, I'll let James know to expect you Friday night."

As Friday approached, honestly, I was slightly nervous. I had never worked a night shift here so I did not know how to do closing tasks, although I assumed it's pretty similar to anywhere else that I had worked. All you have to do is just clean and stock up whatever stations you are told to, simple enough. The night before Friday, I told my friends I wouldn't be joining them in any games, as I am gong to be covering at work for the one time. I was met with expected huffs and puffs about it but they moved on within minutes, so it worked out just fine.

Friday approached and I sighed as the clock struck 7:00pm and I had to hop off the game to go get ready for work. I arrived at 8:07 which is late but it truly was never a problem. As soon as I got in I got right to work.

Tristan was not lying, I had to hop on the register not even ten minutes into my shift and took customer after customer for just over two hours straight. I asked James, the night manager, about a break. He told me I was not getting one and only a lunch, since I had to go catch-up on clerk duties. I went out and fetched well over 100 carts before having to go in to sweep the entire store. As I went to the back to get the broom to sweep the whole store I decided that I'm going to go sneak a drink from the walk in cooler. Now, I know what you are probably thinking, and yes, I do mean sneak one. There are no cameras in the walk in cooler because it is too cold for them to work, which meant that I could grab a drink from back there and have it, as long as I put it in the "destroyed items" claim bin.

As I got back there I ran into the other courtesy clerk, William.

"Oh whats up, Mikey? I did not expect to see you working a night shift, never mind on your day off." He said, as he was filling up the mop bucket, on the opposite side of the walk in door.

"Yeah, Tristan said that he needed coverage just this one time and I could use the cash so I figured why not," I replied, hoping my desperation for him to leave so I could go snag a drink wasn't apparent.

"Oh definitely, the new guy already quit, well not even. He showed up to one closing shift and then left during his break, didn't even clock out or anything. The rush wasn't even as bad as it usually is, but then again, this isn't for everyone," William said with a sigh "Well, I don't want to hold you up for long, I got to go mop up some spilled milk. I swear these parents do not watch their children in this damn store."

Fantastic. As William walked away I checked down the hallway to make sure nobody saw me, then I entered into the walk-in.

I looked through the shelves at my limited options, and decided on my usual strawberry milk. I hopped onto a pallet and reached for it off of the top shelf. I sat down, cracked it open, and began to chug. I had done this at least a dozen times since I'd started working there. Nobody was ever in here, and if they were it was usually all before 9 a.m., so that everything was stocked up and ready for the first morning rush of customers. As I was taking a big swig I heard the walk in door handle being grabbed and faint talking on the other side. In a panic I immediately got up, swung open the freezer door a few feet away, and ran in there.

I pulled the door shut as quickly as I could without making any noise. The lights in the dark cold freezer flickered on after a couple seconds, lighting up the room. I immediately pressed my ear against the thick door to see if I had any luck hearing anything. I heard the faint thud of the walk in door closing and some muffled talking. I could not make out who was talking or what was being said due to the thickness of the freezer door. As I pulled my ear away from the door I heard somebody try to open the freezer door. I heard the handle being pulled but the door wasn't moving, followed by pounding on the door and faint calls out for me to come out.

"Shit," I thought. They must've been watching the cameras to see where I went, and I still had the drink. I looked around in a panic to try and see where the freezer claims bin was located when I noticed something very strange. There, across the cold metal room, was another big freezer door. I had never seen a third freezer here, or at any job I'd worked at. I tried filing through my memories of being in here, maybe there was boxes in the way before, maybe I never really paid much attention and just didn't notice it before.

\*SLAM\* 

"MIKEY, COME OUT HERE NOW!" I heard a voice yelling to me through the cooler door. I took one look back at the mysterious third door, and immediately ran to it and went in

I let the door shut behind me as I turned around to look at what was going on in this third freezer. The lights flickered on, slower and more dim than the regular freezer. It looked like nobody had been in there for a long time, a bunch of webs in the corners and on the ceiling, a bunch of empty boxes scattered around the floor, and dirt running along the walls. I heard a very faint slamming sound coming from the first freezer, I wondered why they wouldn't just open it. It's not like it's the bathroom for Christ sake. I sat on the dirty old floor and took a couple swigs of my milk, enjoying every drop, since it was the reason why I was so deep into the freezer. After what felt like a minute or two, the knocking stopped, and I felt confident to at least go back into the freezer. As I went to push the door handle the knob wouldn't budge. I tried to push it in again and it was stiff, I couldn't believe that it was frozen.

I started to look around to find something in there that could maybe help break the ice. All the boxes were way too big, and I already had tried to use my milk bottle to no avail. All the shelves were empty and riddled with webs, except for one in the corner of the room. It had a tarp on it for whatever reason, but I was too desperate and cold to care why. I walked up to it and pulled the tarp off of the shelf. In that moment I realized that the tarp was not hiding what was on the shelf, but it was hiding what was behind it.

I almost fell on my ass as I stumbled backwards in shock. Right behind that shelf, was another freezer door. 

"There is no way in hell this is happening, the store is nowhere near big enough for another freezer," I thought, as I began to have a sinking feeling in my stomach. I immediately grabbed the blue vinyl tarp and brought it back to the frozen door handle. I wrapped it around the knob and started rubbing my hands as fast as I could, pulling them off every few seconds to blow on them for any warmth whatsoever. I was hoping that I could create enough heat from friction to thaw out the handle and get out. I tried for a few long minutes before attempting to open the door again. No luck.

"SHIT!" I yelled out, slamming my fist onto the door knob, which only brought immense pain to my cold and brittle hand. "HELP! ANYONE, HELP! I CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE! SOMEBODY, PLEASE!" I was yelling at this point, knocking and kicking the frozen thick metal door. I fell to the floor and began to sob. There was no other way to go but through the next door.

After a minute of trying to warm my hands up and emotionally preparing myself, I got up and made my way across the room. The shelf that was in my way was about six-feet tall, but very thin with nothing on it. I moved the shelf out of the way with ease and stared at the door for a second. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe this door would lead to a secret exit outside, or maybe even a hidden bunker that only the owner of the store knew about. I grabbed the handle and it was stiff. I ended up yanking on it and a thin layer of ice broke and fell off as the big metal door opened with a loud crack, a rim of thin ice broke off and fell in front of me. I went ahead and stepped into the dark room.

The even colder air hit me immediately as I stepped in the room. The regular freezer was usually right at zero degrees Fahrenheit or slightly below, but this was even colder. All of the hair on my body immediately stood up and I got goosebumps from head to toe. After a solid 10 seconds or so in the complete darkness the lights audibly crackled on. Half of them did not even turn on, while the other half were pretty dim. I looked around in a daze when I heard the freezer door behind me slam shut.

"Dammit," I cursed out loud. "I should've left that damn door propped open, I'm going to freeze to death in here," I thought. I began to break out into shivering tears when I noticed something across the room. Way in the opposite side in the corner, it looked like a cloth bag was sitting in this otherwise empty box. I slowly approached it, barely keeping my breathing at a normal place when I realized, that's not a bag, that's a human.

"Oh my god," I yelled out as I covered my mouth and stumbled backwards, unable to really process what I was looking at. I stared at it for a second. It looked like a teenage boy, body swollen from head to toe, blue and puffy, wearing the same uniform as me with a name-tag that read "Jesse". The name was barely familiar to me, I didn't quite recognize him but in the state that he was in, I don't think anyone would be able to. Just then, I realized that he had on a sweatshirt underneath his work uniform. At this point my survival instincts were already kicking in so I rushed onto the floor right next to him and began taking off the clothes on his torso.

His work uniform was a couple sizes too big so it came off pretty easy, minus the few cracks and one large snap from his arms. The sweatshirt was a different story though. I pulled out his puffy arms, one sleeve at a time, trying to hold my breathe so that I wouldn't gag as much. The left arm came out with only a few cracks, but the right arm I had to really pull the sweatshirt off of since it was slightly more swollen. POP, his shoulder was completely yanked out of place and the arm really went limp, making it easy to slide off the sleeve. Now, his neck was extremely swollen, and I mean to the point where there was lumps everywhere and his neck was about the same thickness as my head. I pulled and pulled and the sweatshirt was not coming off without a fight. I decided to stand up to gain more leverage. I planted my feet and yanked as hard as I could, even putting my full body weight into it. Just then I heard a loud SNAP as I slammed my ass into the freezing metal floor. I got up to see his headless torso slam sideways into the ground, I then looked down at my hands and saw his head right there in between my hands.

I yelled out in terror as I dropped his head and the sweatshirt, his head rolling a couple feet away as it slammed onto the floor. I immediately vomited up all my milk into a disgusting pink puddle onto the floor next to me. I wiped my mouth and got up, grabbing the sweatshirt, while avoiding looking at any of the body to avoid vomiting whatever was left in my body at this point. I threw it on and immediately felt some relief from the freezing cold, but was still shivering a bit. I realized my fate, that I was going to die in here like Jesse. I sat down and stared at the floor emotionless, feeling defeated, regretting not just stepping out and taking whatever punishment it was for being in there stealing a drink on the clock, there is no way it could be any worse than what has happened to me now.

After what felt like an eternity I heard a loud slam and crash come from across the room, I looked up to see what it was when the lights completely cut out. Another slam and crash from across the room followed by what sounded like faint footsteps. Then another loud THUD came from the last freezer behind me, with what sounded like almost an animal yelping out in pain. The lights cut back on and across the room I saw a floor hatch slowly close, with Jesse's body being dragged down. At this point I had no idea what in the hell was going on, I got up and pressed my back to the door as I stared at the hatch. I hadn't noticed it before, but it was pretty discreet. It matched the rest of the metal floor with barely any visible creases indicating that there was a hatch. As I was looking at it, a loud SLAM came from behind me, causing the freezer door to vibrate a little bit. I turned around in horror as I heard a painful groan come from the other side. It almost sounded like a zombie, that's the closest thing I could really compare it to. This next decision was by far the most stupid one I made that night, I went towards the floor hatch.

In a panic I searched for where in the hell I can open this thing from as I heard whatever it was groaning in pain in the last room. I found the crease just big enough for two of my fingers to get a hold of. As i lifted up the heavy hatch, I saw a bit of a ladder that led into nothing but darkness. As I was looking, I heard the freezer door start to open. I looked up to see it being pushed open, when someone or something yanked me down the hatch. That was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up on the floor, my head was throbbing and my body was aching in pain. As my vision started to come to I slowly sat up and looked around. I was in a very dimly lit area with torches on the wall far and few between. As my eyes focused more, I realized that I was in a very, very long tunnel. I looked around and saw bodies upon bodies, all of them skeletons. My head was in too much pain to get up and run, but where would I run anyway? I slowly started to realize that there was a noise coming from a room across the long dim hallway. It sounded like somebody was eating something very, very crunchy. The snapping and crunching sounded the exact same way as it did when I ripped Jesse apart for his sweatshirt.

Just then I heard a creak come from above me, I looked up to see a bit of light coming in from the ceiling.

"Mikey? Mikey? Ah shit, man, are you there? Please, God, say something if you are." I heard a very familiar voice break through. My eyes focused to see my coworker, William, way up at the top of the hatch.

"Ugh, yeah I'm here, I-"

"SHH," he said in a concerning manner, "DO NOT MAKE ANYMORE NOISE, IT WILL COME EAT YOU."

I was in shock at this point, what the hell was down here with me? I had way too many questions swirling in my mind when I heard William again.

"Mikey, I need you to get up here as fast and quietly as possible, I have all the freezer doors open, hurry before it comes." I forced myself up, still in a daze and began climbing up the ladder. As I was up the first few of a dozen rungs, I noticed that the crunching across the long hall had come to a stop. It had been replaced with a sound of something that was galloping, slowly growing louder. I forced myself to climb faster, almost missing a rung or two in my daze.

"UGH Shit, man, hurry. Fuck, my leg," William called out. I looked up at him to see him only about four feet above me now. It all began to make sense as I saw that he had his uniform tied around his leg with what looked like a whole chunk missing from his thigh. He had filthy bloody hands reaching down to me with scratches on his worried face. As I climbed up the last six rings, I heard the galloping at an alarming rate now. It sounded like it was halfway down the hall and was making insane timing. I forced myself up to the last rungs, as I now heard something panting like a wild animal below me, beginning to climb the ladder.

"Grab my fucking hand, NOW!" William was screaming at his point. I grabbed it and he pulled me up with all his might. I made it out and back into the freezer just in time, we both looked down and saw a large, hairy, dark creature, running up the wall at inhuman speeds.

"HURRY! SHUT IT!" William yelled out while grunting through his pain. We slammed it just in time as the creature was only about a few feet away from the opening.

"What the fuck was that?" I demanded William, with what little breath I had left. "And how did you know I was down here?"

William sat down on the hatch, he was trying to catch his breathe. While tightening his makeshift tourniquet, he began, "Never go past the first freezer, ever. It lures you in with curiosity, then drives you further in with fear."

I looked at him even more confused. "What do you mean?" I asked him. "Did you guys not see me go into the freezer? I swear I heard you yelling for me once I went into the second freezer."

William looked at me with worry. "No, Mikey, that's the creatures way of driving you deeper into his domain, by using fear. It can only feed on you if you get close enough to where its den is, and will use any means to get you there." He paused to take a few deep breaths, then continued. "I realized you were in here five minutes after I saw you while I was getting the mop. I cleaned that mess the kid left, and when I came to put the mop away, I saw that the broom hadn't been moved at all and the door to the walk in cooler wasn't fully shut." he stopped again to catch his breath. "Mikey, please go get help. Tell James that we went into the second freezer. I don't care if we get fired, follow the rope that I tied to all the door handles to get out. Make it fast Mikey, I can-"

BOOM!!! The metal hatch below William EXPLODED into thousands of pieces below him, and in an instant William was yanked into the depths of darkness. That lit a fire under my ass, I ran faster than I've ever had, following the rope that he had laid out, Heart thumping in my ears with each passing second. When I finally got back to the regular freezer, I removed the end of the rope that William tied up from the shelf post, causing the slack to go FLYING into the backrooms, freezer doors slamming one by one in the distance, before, finally, the one in front of me slammed shut.

I ran all the way out of the store and took off home and never looked back. I'm sorry William, but there was no way in hell I was dealing with anymore of that.

The reason why I've come to tell about these events is more so a warning. My managers never called me after that night. In fact the store was shut down the next day, surrounded by yellow tape, as the news claimed that the store had failed health standards so bad that it was unsafe for anyone to go in there. Over these last few months they've been moving trucks in and out of the parking lot, before ultimately tearing down the whole store. Today it was announced on the news, that the biggest grocery store chain in America has bought out the company, and plans to build one of their stores in that exact spot.
