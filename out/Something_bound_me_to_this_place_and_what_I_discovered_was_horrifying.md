When I woke up, I found myself in a storeroom that I didn’t recognise. Stumbling through boxes I stepped outside. It was a long hallway of an old house.

I headed to the main door, trying hard to remember how I got here. The whole thing felt like a dream, how my house was burning, how he chained me and dragged me out of my house and everything after that was a blank. If I got abducted then why was I roaming free? 

I opened the main door and took a step outside. As soon as my feet touched the ground it was like someone flipped the light switch and everything went dark. After a few moments, I was able to see again but something was not right. I was standing in the storeroom. 

Freaking out I ran straight to the main door trying to escape but to my horror as soon as I crossed the doorframe I stumbled into the storeroom, again. I could not believe what was happening to me. I felt like the whole reality was warping around me. I tried to escape from the backdoor of the kitchen, windows, toilet exhaust, air vents but always ended up in the storeroom.

Not knowing what to do, I saw a phone hanging in the hallway. I immediately grabbed it and tried calling my husband. He answered but could not hear my voice. I tried to call my parents, friends, even the cops, but none of them were able to hear my voice. I thought the phone might be broken. 

Feeling helpless I went to the window. I looked outside and there were people walking. Feeling they could help me I just started screaming. Nobody reacted. I got frustrated and began banging on them. Few of them actually stopped after hearing bangs but did not proceed to do anything. It went on like that for hours and suddenly I heard the garage door opening. I ran to the main door and stood there hoping someone would come.

The door opened with the creek. I saw a tall old man step inside with his wife trailing behind him. I felt so relieved. I leaped towards him and began crying for help, not able to formulate a coherent speech. But as you might have guessed, he did not react to anything.

In anger I tried to jolt his arm and to my horror, my hand just passed through his arm. At first I could not believe it. I thought I might have just missed it and I tried to touch him again. I stretched my hand towards him and they went right inside his chest. I stood there shaken as he hung his coat, removed his shoes and walked right through me.

I screamed. I screamed so hard my throat hurt and I just fell on the floor crying.

After about a week I was wandering in the hallway, trying to rationalise whatever was happening to me. At that time, my best theory was that I had died and became a ghost and somehow I was tied to this place. Being a ghost was not that different. It’s just you cannot interact with certain things and the living beings, most of them, can’t see, hear or feel you. It also depends on the time of the day. Because if you try to move something in the daytime it is impossible to do it, but if you try this at night, based on the weight and size of that thing, you will be able to move it. But it will be more like you pushing the water. Your hand will still pass through it but there will be some resistance. That’s how I walked through thin walls and was able to bang things.

I also got to know the family. The tall old man was the father, around sixty years old. His wife was also of the same age. They had five children, three sons and two daughters. Oldest and youngest sons lived with their parents while the rest of them left home to work outside. I don’t know what father and sons did to earn, but I occasionally saw the older son wearing an apron and a belt on top of it with a bunch of tools hanging. They also had a grandmother who always stayed in her room and rarely left it. They also had a dog. It was pretty annoying since it was the only one who could see me. Every time it saw me, it would start barking. If I moved somewhere else, it would follow me. The only thing I could do is to just go upstairs in the attic or in the basement where it could not enter. Apart from the dog I felt like grandmother could also sense me but on as much as the dog.

I would have these intense emotional episodes. After failing so many times trying to escape and not understanding why and what had me tied up in here, I would get frustrated and crash out. I would wail for hours. I was experiencing panic shocks where I would suddenly feel intense dread. It was so strong that it would start radiating. I could see the family getting affected. They would also start feeling unease, sometimes they would clash out and fight among themselves. It was infectious. One time I screamed so hard the window started shaking and everyone stared at my direction like they heard something. That’s the closest I got to communicating with them.

One mid-night, It was around 1 AM when I started feeling sharp pain in my stomach. I fell on my knees and clutched my belly. I got nauseous and began vomiting black liquid. Rather than spilling all over the floor, the liquid started moving and clumping together. It formed a pillar which stood tall well above my height and began taking the shape of something I recognised.

It was that hooded figure. The one who had kidnapped me. I recognised those bulging eyes and velvet blue skin with sharp teeth hanging from its mouth partly covered by its red lips. It quickly covered its face and body under black cloak. My heart was pumping so hard I thought my chest would burst. The room also began heating up. I felt the same dread which I felt seeing him the first time. It stared at me with a blank face for a few moments and then left the kitchen.

I could not move. I was too afraid, almost paralysed from fear. I could hear him going inside the master bedroom where parents slept. I could hear him speaking in a strange tongue. It went on for a while then I heard the bedroom door open. I quickly got up and ran into the storeroom and hid in the closet. I could hear his footsteps coming down and going in the kitchen. After a brief silence a deep growl came from the kitchen. I could feel he was not angry, but frustrated. He started running and I could hear his footsteps coming straight to the storeroom. He came inside and stood right in front of the closet. He knew I was in there.

He flung open the closet and grabbed my mouth with both of his hands. It stretched it wide open and its body began melting into a fumes, flowing directly inside my mouth. I stood there until I completely swallowed it. I felt sick. 

I realised why he kidnapped and locked me in this house. I was just a door through which it entered the house and left, whenever it wanted.

The next day the old man fell sick with high fever and they took him to the hospital. The next day his wife also got sick in a similar manner and got admitted to the hospital. After a few days, the old man died and on the same day the wife also passed away in the same manner.

The family began preparing for the funeral. The old man did not have living family members outside their children and mother, same with his wife. Some neighbours and friends came to pay their respects. The three siblings living outstates came home. Losing both the parents on the same day was tragic for the children. Knowing that I played a part in it, even though unwillingly, was devastating. Visitors came to visit the family for a week and after that they stopped coming. The daughters left soon after completion of all proceedings. The middle-son stayed with his two brothers. All of them were taken back by what happened but nobody thought something paranormal was at play. I distanced myself from them, it was hard enough for them without me infecting them with more sadness.

The scars were not healed yet and it happened again. This time I was in the attic, sitting at the window looking outside while the same sharp pain ran through my stomach and chest. I pressed my mouth by hand, trying not to vomit. I was not letting him out again. Pain grew more and more until it became unbearable. My chest and neck felt like they would burst if I did not let it go. I threw up. There he was, standing tall in front of me still taking shape. I was exhausted due to resisting too long. I tried to stop him by grabbing his cloak but could not hold it longer and my hand slipped. He descended into the hallway and headed towards the youngest son’s room. This time, I followed him.

Stumbling on the hallway I reached the bedroom and I saw him. The figure was hovering above the son, mumbling in strange language.

There has to be something that I can do, I thought to myself. Suddenly an idea struck me like lightning. I gathered all my strength and ran back to the living room. I couldn't find what I was looking for. I searched the kitchen, hallway, everywhere but met only disappointment. There was only one place left to search which I usually avoided to visit. It was grandma’s room. I went and slowly opened the door, and there it was, sleeping peacefully in the corner, the dog.

I crouched and tried to wake it up. I put my hands inside its chest and tickled its insides. It woke up terrified and shaken. Seeing me it started barking and I ran towards the son’s room knowing very well that the dog would follow me.

When it went inside the room and saw the hooded figure hovering, it started barking louder. My plan was to wake up the son before that filthy cloak finishes whatever he is doing. It worked and the son woke up.

He opened his eyes and unlike me, he was able to see that cloaked figure. He froze out of shock. He tried to scream but his throat didn’t make any sound. He was paralysed with fear. The dog kept barking louder and it woke up other members in the family.

But sadly before they could do anything the hooded figure had finished the ritual and it jumped right into my throat, trying to escape. He stretched my mouth beyond its capacity and broke my jaw. He tore my skin, and it started bleeding. After a hard struggle I swallowed it. I was so weak I fell on my knees and lied there.

The son was traumatised. His body was boiling hot and shivering all the time. They gave him sedatives to calm his nerves but still he did not talk to anyone and kept quiet. Doctors kept him at home for some reason rather than going to hospital. Seeing him I could not help but wonder if I made things worse by waking him up. I knew he saw that figure and I wished before death took him, he could tell what happened to him to any family member.

My wish was granted. The next day grandma would appear with some incense, red cloth and a tiny bag. She went inside the son’s room and began doing some cleansing rituals. I could not hold my happiness, finally someone was thinking in the right direction. 

Remember when I said I had a feeling that grandma could sense me. It was because whenever I was sitting or wandering in the room. She would stare in my direction. Even if she passes by me accidentally, she would come back and assess the whole area. It became so uncomfortable that I just avoided meeting her. After the old man’s death, she began doing remedies as per her old methods. It made my existence harder because whenever I went near her, I would have an aching feeling all over my body. It was like a thousand needles poked my skin.

After getting done with all proceedings she sat beside him and began praying. After a while the boy’s shivering got slower and he slowly opened his eyes. His fever was still unaffected but he seemed more in control and at peace. He told everything that happened that night to the grandma. She was visibly shaken. She immediately went outside and told other family members, the remaining four siblings.

The next day grandma created the shrine of some deity. It was placed in the middle of the living room. All members gathered and started offering their prayers to the deity. Though it was forbidden to worship if someone recently died in the house, they still went forward with the prayers. I can understand what they were going through. Those who left us, were not coming back, but those who are with us, we should protect them. The whole family prayed that day without a break.

Even though it hurt, I also sat and prayed with them.
