There she goes again, her black  suv tearing down the road with reckless abandon. She doesn't care about you or anyone else, she is a narcissistic bitch that thinks she is a fricking super model. But I know the truth, she isn't human!

I work for a pantry in our local town and have curbside service, a new service we added due to covid. So we are supposed to take the cart of food out to the car and place the groceries in the trunk. It's a rule our supplier placed on us to help make it easier for the customer and lessens the contact.

For nearly a year things have been our usual level of crazy. Customers wanting to shop in our tiny pantry like it's a grocery store, demanding specific items, wanting to know our entire stock, screaming at us for not bringing them food when they don't have appointments, etc.

It was 2 months ago when this new patron began coming. To follow company privacy protocols we will call her Karen. Karen first introduced herself in a kind and friendly manner. We brought the food out and we immediately saw how beautiful she was. She had long silky blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and a figure to make any girl jealous. 

Something felt off about her though, something I couldn't put my finger on.

As far as you could see, she seemed like a caring and beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. It was the way her eyes made you feel if you stared too long. This creeping dread that slowly grew inside your stomach. 

I pushed it off as just some odd feeling and went on with my day. 

A week later she returned and again addressed us with her candid almost sing song like voice. But my buddy Ray went up to her and apparently she hit on him. When he told her he had a girlfriend she got angry and told him she was a far better lover than she was. Ray immediately came back and told our boss what had happened. Our boss didn't like that at all, and said if it happens again to immediately call security. 

Sure enough the next Tuesday came again and we got another call from her. This time however, she asked for Ray by name and that got our attention. Our boss took the phone call and told her that it was inappropriate to talk to employees like that. She insisted on talking to Ray and only Ray. Our boss finally told her to leave and that she was banned from our Pantry. 

What we heard next made our blood run cold.

She screamed with a high pitched shrill that almost sounded like a dying animal mixed with a woman's absolutely terrified wail. We could all hear it coming from the phone, even at the other side of our front office. We all stopped dead in our tracks and looked at each other in utter disbelief.

"What the f*** was that?" and "Did you just hear that?" were asked between the various employees. I stood there in shock, trying to comprehend what we just heard. I didn't even know a human could make a sound like that. 

Our boss hung up the phone after another second of silence and then she immediately called security. They came by a minute later and asked what had happened. We told them what had just transpired and they left to check it out. Of course by the time they made it to the street she was long gone. They said they were going to check the footage and get a license plate number. 

It's been 3 weeks and no word from security. But mysteriously, both of the security guards quit their jobs!

Oh s**t! She's back!!

Our phone rang and rang as we continued to ignore it. We knew by the caller I.D that it was Karen back again to haunt us. We could practically feel her evil presence from the other side of the room. I watched as every employee stopped what they were doing and just stared at the phone as it rang like it was a kid with a temper tantrum.

"What is going on? It should have gone to voice mail by now!" Our boss asked, her fingers curling in agitation.

We collectively shook our heads in disbelief as the phone rang relentlessly. Finally, my co-worker, Jesse, got up and unplugged the cable jack from the back of the phone. 

Silence. 

We all sighed with relief, some of us laughing from the absurdity of it all. We waited about ten minutes before we plugged it back in. We almost expected it to start ringing again, but it didn't. 

Just as we thought it was over, we heard the outside door open and someone walked quickly towards our door in the pantry. The hurried steps kept pace with our quickening heart beats.

Karen suddenly appeared with her head horizontal across the doorway with a wide smile and the largest eyes I had ever seen. 

"I called and you didn't answer! I called and YOU! DIDN'T! ANSWER!!"

She screamed at the top of her lungs without blinking. It scared the shit out of me. I reflexively got out of my chair and ran for the back hall. I nearly smashed into Jesse as she too was done with this whole situation. We ran for our lives as Karen continued to scream:

"YOUUU! DIDN'T!! ANSWERRRRR!!!!!!!!"

I heard screams behind me as she leapt through the air and wrapped herself around Ray. I heard him go down and start screaming.

"Get off me!! Help!! Help Meeee!!"

I turned the corner and took off for the parking lot. I didn't even look back as I ran across the asphalt and frantically fumbled for my keys. 

I found my key and opened the door. As soon as I closed it a security car came zooming past my car and stopped in front of the building. Two security officers leapt out and ran for the building. My fellow employees took off in every direction trying to get away. 

I don't even remember how the hell I got home. But I do remember plopping down on my couch and passing out.

I just got a phone call from Jesse. She said Ray was raped and his face was clawed to shreds. He is now in intensive care at the hospital. Our boss has closed the pantry and an investigation by the police is underway. I don't when I'll be able to return to work. 

She escaped custody and is at large. Be on the look out for a pretty blonde in a black suv.

I'll try to update when I can. Be careful out there!
