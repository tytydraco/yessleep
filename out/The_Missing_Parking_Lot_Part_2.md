My anxiety only grew as I unfolded the paper map and we continued onwards. Turning on one of the car's dome lights, I studied the map carefully as if reading some ancient manuscript. 

Directions were simple, according to what the officer had drawn we were just to pass two sections where the dirt road splits into hiking trails and continue on until we reach the blind turn on our right which would be our exit.

“Okay there’s the first road split” Andy said as we drove by it on our right.

“Nice, we’re halfway there” I said as I looked forward and caught a glimpse of the small trail.

The fog was still present but the road had gotten better and we were actually making faster progress now. I randomly looked towards the backseat and saw Dario had a confused expression on his face.

“What’s up?” I asked him.

“The pictures I took of the elk are gone man” He then said.

“What?” I asked, pulling out my camera and checking.

“What the hell! The pictures I took of it are also gone!” I said loudly.

“What is going on?, this is freaking me out bro” Dario said, visibly perplexed with his hand on his forehead.

“You guys sure you didn’t accidentally delete them or move them somewhere somehow, like a hidden folder?” Andy asked.

“Nope, besides the odds of both of us accidentally doing that at the same time is impossible” I answered.

“This has never happened before,” Dario added.

“Check your storage space” I then told him.

“I’m good, I've got plenty of space and my SD card seems to be working fine” he said.

“No way both our cameras glitched man, that's unusual” I said completely confused.

Dario and I did everything we could think of to find the pictures we had just taken. We checked all folders, reinserted SD cards as well as batteries, and did both a soft and factory reset on the two cameras to no avail.

 Most recent pictures we had were the ones Dario took of the forested neighborhood before I got arrested. With no cloud backup of any kind, the next best thing to do was to use some kind of photo recovery software once we got home. 

“What a day” Dario said from the backseat, rubbing his face in frustration. He was understandably upset over everything that was going wrong. 

We continued down the road soon driving by the second hike trail, this time on our left just like the officer had drawn. Now over ¾ of the way through the road, we estimated.

“Crazy how the trees and night sky are blended together. It's so dark you can’t tell where each one starts anymore”. Andy mentioned as he drove.

“This is not a road I would take if I was riding alone. Not even during the day” I quickly added.

“Definitely not,” Andy reiterated. “There’s three of us, more safety in numbers, but I still have a gut feeling”. 

Dario and I agreed we also felt unsafe.

“We have both Pepper spray and Bear spray,” I said, half joking.

“Remind me to bring my dad’s pistol next time” Andy said, straight faced. 

The dark road was now becoming all too familiar. While moving, at the same time I felt we were staying in place, perhaps because I knew we were very close to the exit. I half expected something else to jump out of the shadows of our headlights.

We were relieved yet confused when we finally arrived at the end of the road and were presented with not the aforementioned hard right turn but a fork in the road.

It wasn’t a fork down the middle, more like a split that came up on our right side with the current road ending at a road closure. We stopped and contemplated the paths ahead.

“Okay so the officer said there was a tight right hand turn at the end of this road, I’m guessing he forgot about the other path?” Andy asked, referring to both us and himself.

“I don’t know, everything until this point matches exactly to what he wrote and told us, him forgetting a major detail seems unlikely” I said looking down at the map.

“Still got no service of any kind”, Dario said from the backseat looking down at his phone. Andy and I also checked our phones and they were just as useless as they were earlier. We had no way of knowing which way to take.

The two choices were either taking the first and tightest turn at around 45 degrees or taking the other right hand turn closer to 90 degrees. The logging road we had been taking ended on a curve therefore both choices were viable, either one could be the correct route.

“If the officer said our exit was a tight right turn I’m assuming it’s this way” Andy said pointing to the way on our furthest right.

Dario and I agreed that the tightest turn matched the officers description the most so we made the turn and took off. The crunching of dirt and slight rattle of our vehicle started getting worse again as we picked up speed.

“God, when are we finally gonna get back to the paved road, this is starting to make me sick” Dario complained.

Only a few minutes in, this new road had now started declining and he was having to hit the brakes to keep the car from picking up more speed. The fog and darkness were still as present as ever.

Looking at what the officer drew on the map, this road was supposed to start curving slightly to the left and eventually merge onto the road we would use to get out of town. Instead it continued onward seemingly straight and downhill. 

“There we go!” Andy said abruptly. The road had gone from dirt to pavement and the car immediately stopped shaking. Both him and Dario were relieved while I was still skeptical.

“I’m not sure we’re going the right way,” I told them looking ahead at the passing yellow and white stripes of the paved road that was still descending. “The way we’re headed doesn't match what the officer drew, I think we are riding parallel with the correct path and this road is leading us elsewhere”.

“Maybe it's a different route, either way the officer was wrong”. Andy said confident we were headed out of town. The descent continued but only for a few minutes until the road finally leveled and the pavement markings ceased.

“What the!” Andy said out loud as he slowed down. We moved slowly as even through the fog we could tell what was once the road opened wider and wider. Realizing it was a very wide open paved area we assumed it to be some kind of rest stop or RV park. Moving forward we soon started seeing very faded parking lines. 

Continuing on, we kept an eye out for any signs of life, so far it appeared we were the only ones here. If this was a rest stop why was there no noise whatsoever, no other cars passing by us, no headlights to be seen through the fog.

“This place is creepier than the road we came through,” Dario replied from the backseat.

“Yupp we took the wrong road” I said looking around nervously.

“What Is this place?” Andy asked when suddenly he hit the brakes and our car screeched. Something had come into view in front of us. 

“Almost didn't see it through the fog” Andy said, inching closer.

When we got closer we saw that it was a very old abandoned car. It was rusted all over and the tires were rotted out and flat. Only distinguishable feature of the car was its fading bright green paint. 

“I don’t think this place is a rest stop if that car was allowed to sit here and rot” Dario said, pulling out his camera.

We drove around the old car and were caught off guard by more abandoned vehicles. They came into view randomly parked in the deserted lot. Some of them were in decent shape and appeared functional. Weaving between them, Andy pointed out something bright in the distance that looked to be further away due to the fog. 

Heading towards it we saw it was just another abandoned car catching the triangular glow of a light pole, we neared it and saw there were two more in the distance. The light poles were spaced at about the same length from each other. Unable to tell if there were any more thanks to the fog, what we could tell was that this place seemed to be huge.

“Seriously, what is this place?” Andy asked again. “Who keeps lights on for no one except all these forgotten cars”?  “Why is this massive place paved”? He continued driving, cutting in between the abandoned vehicles and fog.

“Hold on, slow down here” Dario said from the backseat, he had been taking pictures for a while and was now holding the camera and pointing it at an odd looking car. 

“What type of car is that?” I asked. Andy got close enough to see the emblem and Dario captured a photo from the backseat. The car had a logo none of us recognized.

“Some of these cars are in perfect shape, just dirty and old. It’s as if they were forgotten here and left to rot”. Dario said, still taking pics.

“You’re right, assuming this is another junkyard. Most of these cars are nice and complete, I don't see many that are missing parts or that appear to have been wrecked in any kind of accident. Some just appear old and rusted.” I replied looking around.

“Most of the glass windows are closed and intact too, why is this place so neat? All the junkyards I’ve ever been to are a mess. There's no way to tell what this place actually is”. Andy said thinking out loud.

 “Are you kidding me!” “My camera's still not working, none of the pics I just took were saved!” Dario yelled holding his camera. 

“Here test mine” I said, handing him my camera. My hand had started hurting again.

“Nope, also not working” Dario said, slouching in defeat in the backseat.

“I left my camera in the trunk, no way I’m going out there to get attacked by another junkyard dog, let's just try our phones,” Andy said, grabbing his phone after putting the car in park. Dario and I checked again and told Andy we still had no service.

“No, I mean let's try using our phone cameras and see if those work”. Andy clarified. 

We each took a test shot with no luck, just like the cameras our phones were taking pictures and footage but it all seemed to disappear when we checked our photos and galleries.

“Ok so now we know it's not just our cameras, there's a bigger issue going on here in this specific area, including the logging road we came through.” Andy said.

“You think there's some facility nearby that has access to signal jammers or something?” Dario asked intrigued.

“That would explain our phone signal loss but that wouldn’t explain our lost camera and phone feeds, I don’t believe jammers affect SD cards, they don’t work that way”. I said thinking of other possibilities.

“The fact is, the three of us are in an area we shouldn’t be with no way of contacting anyone if something goes wrong”. I added.

“If something *else* goes wrong you mean, because we are already in rough shape as a group” Dario replied. 

 “Yeah, let's get out before we get disoriented in here” Andy said, putting the car on drive and heading back the way we came. 

Driving in between the many abandoned cars and fog, we thought we lost our way until we saw the bright green paint of the first car that came into view earlier. Using it as a guide we eventually found our way back out of that mysterious place, reentering the road we came through.

Uphill instead of downhill took us a little longer but 15 minutes later we made it back to the split in the road. After taking the other right hand turn, just a few minutes later it merged onto the paved main road we recognized, exactly how the officer said it would. Our view was nice and open, no longer as restricted by the dark forest and fog. 

Ecstatic to see other cars on the road and have phone service again, we were back on track heading home.

All of us were starving and stopped to refuel and eat at the first gas station we saw. I stretched out my legs as I ate a fully loaded gas station hot dog. Eating snacks in the car, we waited for Dario who had gone to the restroom.

Dario was struggling to get around, he was still not used to the crutches but didn’t want help. Whilst in the car I accessed Maps on my phone and checked satellite view. I was still curious about the massive place we had stumbled into and hoped a top view would clarify exactly what that place was. 

I traced the road on my phone, when I got to the hard right turn I saw that it only showed one right turn instead of two. No sign of the first road we took that lead into the massive parking lot.

“Check this out” I told Andy as I showed him how there was no such thing as two right turns according to my phone’s GPS.

“Then what the hell did we stumble into, Pedro”? He asked. “That reminds me”, he then said as he walked out of the car and opened the trunk to retrieve his camera. 

After a quick check he said everything seemed to be in order, his camera still had the photos and footage of the junkyard from this morning and it seemed to be taking pictures just fine.

“The glitches definitely had something to do with the area then” I said as Dario finally joined us inside the car. 

He and I tested out our cameras again and they were back to normal, functioning the way they should just like our phones. We were all absolutely perplexed over the road not showing up in any of our phone’s GPS. 

Exactly what was that place? Why do electronics go haywire? Why are all those cars there? These were just some of the questions we kept asking ourselves heading home. 

Nothing else of note happened that night. Andy dropped us home, I looked at the clock when I walked inside my place and saw that it was past midnight before stepping in the shower with a bag on my injured hand. I felt absolutely filthy after spending hours at both a hospital and a police station. 

That night I accidentally slept on my bandaged hand and woke up much earlier than I should have to take some pain meds and call off from work. I was exhausted but I couldn’t go back to sleep, instead I browsed the web on my laptop and looked up the case of the missing teens by the name of the town. 

It didn’t take long to find an article detailing everything to know about the case. Skimming through names and last whereabouts I looked for details of the car they were last seen in. Article mentioned A Red Chevy truck. Pretty sure we saw one in that big parking lot-but Chevy trucks aren’t exactly uncommon, I then thought, debating with myself.

Whatever the officers had found when they had the road blocked was not mentioned in any articles, it was not yet known to the public. After less than a day, it was safe to assume it was still under investigation. 

I opened Google Earth and looked up the town again. Scanning the logging road thoroughly, everything looked exactly the way we saw it in person until the end of the road. Once again the road we took and came back from was not there, it seemed to not exist. I laid down and thought of more plausible explanations.

Maybe that place is still under construction and not yet visible on maps. In that case shouldn't it be inaccessible to the public, either fenced or gated? That still doesn’t explain the cars and malfunctioning electronics I told myself before falling back to sleep.

My phone rang at around noon and woke me up. I picked it up and was greeted by a woman's voice, Frank's secretary. She was calling me to let me know that the person that carried the break-in I was almost framed for was found. She confirmed my case was pro bono, I would not be billed.

It wouldn't be until a few days later that Frank himself would call me to let me know the body the search party found was actually the culprit I was thought to be. Identified from a gash in his arm and brutally mauled by animals, with some of the stolen items still in his pockets and nearby backpack.

I called both Andy and Dario after speaking with the secretary to relay to them what I had just been told and they, just like me, were still pissed that we had lost all that time over a misunderstanding.  

Thankfully the junkyard owner never filed a report against us and a week later we asked and received the okay to upload our video. Just as we expected the video did well. There was a lot of engagement from our fans with some asking to know where this junkyard was. A few planned some sort of payback on our behalf that we persuaded them to call off.

Good thing we’ve always kept our locations and destinations vague.

We explained to our viewers that after trespassing on his property the owner had made sure we knew we weren’t welcome. Our injuries were our own fault after trying to hide and not outing our presence. It could be argued the man should have handled our intrusion better, but his dog had other ideas and we did not want to escalate things further, we weren’t exactly in the right. 

Soon our injuries will be healed, all we want is to continue creating content for our viewers with as little interruptions as possible. We’ve checked online trying to find worthwhile spots closer to home and safer, it’s hard to do when all other places seem futile. 

None of us can get that parking lot out of our head and focus on a new location. No Photo recovery software can bring back the pictures we took there. Keeping up on articles of the missing teens we believe their disappearance has something to do with that mysterious place. 

There is never any mention or any trace of that place no matter where we look. I thought about calling to report that red truck I saw but the place is massive and odds are they’ve probably already found it, flipped it on its heels and found nothing, right? 

Well, eventually the missing case went cold and nothing of note came forward. That is until a few days ago when somebody uploaded new individual pictures of each missing teen and one of them caught our eye. This reveal only added to our pile of questions.

The picture was of the teen said to be driving the night of the disappearance. The photo showed him leaning in front of his bright red Chevy truck with shiny gold rims. Dario remembers it and argues that that very same truck is in that parking lot and insists that it was in one of the pictures he lost.

We are now convinced we need to go back.

Do authorities really not know of that place? How could that be if a cop was the one that told us of that logging ground road? There is definitely something fishy going on.

It being 3 hours away doesn’t exactly make it easy for us to go there at random. More reason to plan it out and be ready I guess. We now know better and understand the importance of downloading offline maps. We've ordered polaroid cameras to try to get around the glitching issue, if we can’t get footage at least we’ll have photos.

This time we are going to make sure we get there during the day to check out that place fully with little to no disruptions.  

That place being a well taken care of paved junkyard or still under construction business lot are the most probable reasons we can think of for why it wouldn’t be visible on maps. Those are the assumptions we’ve decided on. There is no doubt in our minds this won’t make for great content. Dario and I are not yet fully healed but when we are we will set a date and ask for the days off from work. 

The thing is we don’t exactly know how to go about this, on one hand helping authorities in solving a case will be huge for our channel, at the same time we have no desire to notify the authorities just yet. There's a chance this is a case that is being pushed under the rug for one reason or another. We installed a police radar in the car to help with this.

For now the plan is to simply drive back to this secret place and try to find that truck.  

Know that I plan on uploading this right before we go back to that town to avoid any further unwanted  attention from readers claiming to know and or figure out where this place is. I will do my best to keep you all posted. If I don’t offer any updates, well, just wait for our next video.
