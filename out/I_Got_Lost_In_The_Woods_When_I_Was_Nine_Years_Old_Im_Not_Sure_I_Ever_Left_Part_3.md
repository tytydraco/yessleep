[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11n255w/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)

I should say that I am sorry if my first two accounts felt uneventful. I feel that it was necessary to let you know how long I have suffered from this problem and how deeply it affected me. 

I woke up in that forest man, many more times over the course of my childhood and teenage years. The condition that triggered these nightmares was easy to identify: If I passed out—whether from exhaustion, a blow to the head, drugs, or any other means beyond ordinary sleep—I would find myself back in that place. 

Of course, this information helped me not at all beyond an extra incentive to fix my sleep habits. 

There is no need to tell you about all of h to e dreams after those first three. Most of them resembled the first two more than the third. I was usually in the real glade, able to see the copse of trees I once desired to reach, and am chased by a single creature. Other variations did occur, however. Once, I found a burrow beneath the ground and followed it into a cave. Another time, a lake twinkled under the dim sunlight. 

I was always caught though. That never changed.

By the time I reached college, I was something of a wreck. I could still live a somewhat normal life, but the fear of this thing following me was never far from my mind. I had happy moments, but any time I got exhausted or otherwise risked passing out I would remember my fear of being back in those woods. 

Still, I consciously tried to push forward and be some kind of normal. I made friends. It wasn’t the traditional outcasts, but the potheads that proved to be the most accepting. I’ve learned that stoners have a high level of tolerance for social dysfunction. 

My best friend, I’ll just call him Brad here, was the first person I tried to explain what was happening to. 

“You ever have recurring nightmares?” 

We were hanging out the same way as usual. He smoked weed while we took turns with the controller on our preferred multiplayer FPS. 

 It was pretty normal to just leap into random topics during such times, so just broaching that topic with no lead-in was not odd. 

“Uhh. Yeah. I guess. I don’t remember that kind of stuff well.”

“I’ve had the weirdest one forever now.” I kept going. Yes, I know. I was the guy talking about my dreams. This weighed heavily on me though. I needed to just explain to someone in order to feel sane. “I wake up in the woods. But, it’s not like a dream. It’s like I’m actually waking up in the woods.” 

“Wait.” He clearly pieced something together while taking a hit. “Is this about that time you got lost? When you were six?”

“Nine.” I corrected. “I was nine. But yeah, that was the one. The thing is, I never stopped having nightmares about that forest. I just… keep waking up there.” 

“That’s weird, man.” He said as he blew a cloud of smoke. 

“Nah. What’s really weird is that the dreams, they’re like, more real than this. Pain, itching, taste, smell. Everything is super real. And I know it, and I can think about it. But I don’t do much, because I’m six.” 

“Nine.” 

“Huh?”

“I assume you’re like, nine in the dream.” He explained.

I laughed, realizing how tired and second-hand high I was. 

“You think the dream might be real?” 

I was surprised that he actually stuck with the topic. Having gotten it off my chest I was willing to accept that I’d just bored my friend as the price of confession. 

“Yeah.” I nodded. It was a simple moment, but it was important to me. That was the first time I truly confronted, even to myself, the paranoid suspicion that had been growing in me. 

“What if I just passed out in there? What if this is all just some sort of weird dream between flashes of consciousness?” I poured out my worries.

“Well, I know I’m here. So, for me, the question is answered. Doesn’t help you though, does it?” He chuckled. “Just go with it, bro. I mean, does it matter? If time isn’t really moving there, then you might at well be here, right?” 

I’m not sure the logic there was very good, but I supposed that he had already followed shockingly well while being so incredibly high. 

“It’s just… still being that little kid, stuck out there, it’s so messed up. I’m an adult. I’ve moved so far. I shouldn’t still be that child. But here I am, sooner or later I know I’m going to wake up as a lonely, frightened kid again.”

I wasn’t sure my problem made any more sense, but it was the truth. 

“I dunno man.” He shrugged. “I guess you’re gonna have to find a way to fight it then.”

I didn’t, obviously. Life kept on moving. It was not long until I had the next incident though. 

One of the perks of having even just some friends, and being in college was the relative ease of having some nominal dating life. I never had much success, but I did get a few short-lasting girlfriends. 

One night found me heading home from a date during such time. Nothing that happened earlier in the evening stands out anymore, I could not begin to venture to recount how the date went, or what we did. All I know now is that I was heading home in the dark of the evening, tired but sober and aware. 

“I had a great time.” My date smiled at me. 

It was an expected nicety, but always good to hear. 

“Me too.” I returned the smile.

The singular moment in time that followed would have been memorable under any conditions. It should have been just a ‘what could have been’ seared into my brain. A lesson in attentiveness remembered as a near disaster averted through good fortune. My “condition” has its own say in things though. 

Another car chose to go for it and squeeze in a left turn across my path the moment I looked away. Oblivious to this, I wasn’t slowing down until I looked back. By that point, it was far too late to brake, if it ever would have been possible in time. Instead, I slammed the brakes and pulled left hard. The only blessing given me was a wide grassy meridian between opposing directions on that road, broken at several intervals for turns, such as the car in front of me was using. 

My car hit the grass, instantly slowing me and simultaneously taking away any control of my direction. Then, we ramped back onto the lane between and finally back onto the grass. The car stopped when it hit the ditch running down the center of the grass at a sharply downward angle, jolting the car violently to rest. 

The crash wasn’t severe, but I was still violently jolted.

I jolted and tried to shake off the disorientating fog hanging over me. I knew I needed to do something. My body fumbled as I pushed myself up.

I was in the woods. 

I needed to do something. I knew it. The enormity of the trees shrouded my purpose though, swallowed it up like so many dry leaves. 

I shook my head. There were lights, wheels. I could imagine fragments, but I couldn’t piece together the whole. 

Even still, I had so much more cognizance than usual. I will admit to liking to think that it was my conversation with Brad that helped push me to try to keep my head and solve things. 

I knew that I had been knocked out in a car. For once, I knew I wasn’t nine years old in those woods. But what to do with that knowledge?

I had never gotten to explore that place with the sensibilities of an adult. What I had experienced, however, was enough to tell me it was a cursed place that I had no power over. 

I looked around me, mind still foggy but determined. The woods looked the same as always. I particularly looked ahead at the copse of trees that had long ago been my destination. I knew that something in those trees was behind this, or at least deeply important to it. 

I decided to try something largely at random. I closed my eyes and headed in that direction. 

It was a game of feeling my way forward. I knew logically this would not do anything to stop being caught in a loop. Being in this kind of situation, however, requires accepting that ordinary logic no longer matters. You need to experiment and find an internal logic if even that exists.

I was ready to try, at least. 

Every time I lost sight of my target, I found myself reset. Perhaps if I never lost sight of it, the woods would let this hellish game move one step forward. 

At first, my hands planted on roots and trunks. Then, I began to feel other things. Smooth and wet flesh, course, and matted hair all began to reveal themselves beneath my palm. I cannot say that I didn’t expect that. Nonetheless, I pushed forward. I knew what would happen if I opened my eyes. 

Eventually, I did feel trees again, to either side of me, small and close.

I was in the copse. 

My eyes opened to see the forest looking normal still, just the little trees around me and the view seeing things from the spot I had never reached so long ago.

The little circle in the trees was, of course, well shaded. It felt warm and moist, just as the air had then. It almost looked and felt like a little cottage grown as a shelter by some woodland soul. 

A few things were sitting on the ground in the middle of it all.

They could easily have passed as forest debris to someone not looking, but I instantly understood their meaning. It was a good straight stick, with a few scraps wrapped around the base, and a pile of pine cones. That was exactly the sword a nine-year-old me would have made to defend his fort and the projectiles he would have thrown at attackers.

First, my heart sank. Then, I felt a swelling rage. 

“Just let me go! I don’t want to be here! I don’t deserve to be here!” I screamed at the trees around me. 

“I grew up! I have a life!” I was shouting it as much to myself as to the woods. “And I was just a boy. I did nothing wrong! Why are you doing this to me?” 

The woods don’t answer questions. They felt no debt was owed to me.

And the things in the woods? They felt it was my debt to pay. 

“Just let me go!” I broke down to wailing. “Just let me go!”

-

“Just let me go!” 

I woke up in my car. The vehicle was essentially undamaged. The crash was little more than a bump. 

And I woke up incoherently screaming. 

Driving my date home was awkward. We never saw each other again. 

What really damaged me was finally accepting that any attempts at normalcy were futile. I was, and would always be, trapped in that place, and that could never be ignored.
