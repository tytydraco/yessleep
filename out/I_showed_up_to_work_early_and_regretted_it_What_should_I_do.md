It all started with a new job. Decent pay, promises of something big—I signed the contract without even skimming the fine print. It was a factory still under construction, and I was waiting for a call with a start date. Two weeks of silence went by, then the phone rang. The voice was flat, all business:  

"Factory’s delayed, but we’ve got temp work with the same employer. You in?"  

Money was tight, no options left. I said yes.  

The place was in the middle of nowhere—so far from the city that my GPS gave up, and the road turned into a muddy track lined with bare trees. The company office was a gray building next to the half-built factory, surrounded by rusty fences. The owner met me there: tall, in an expensive coat, smiling but not with his eyes.  

"Follow me," he said, hopping into a black SUV. I trailed behind in my car.  

We drove for nearly an hour before pulling onto a lonely patch of land. Fog crept over the grass. There was his house—old, paint peeling—next to a stable with restless horses, a small soccer field with a beat-up ball, a treehouse, and a workshop—a low shed with a tin roof. The morning was damp, the fall chill cut through me, and there was a smell in the air—heavy, sour, like something rotting. I figured it was the livestock, but something inside me tightened.  

He led me to the workshop. The door creaked open to a dim room, a single bulb swinging from the ceiling. That’s where I met Travis, the manager. Tall, lanky, with long arms that seemed too bendy. He wore old-school glasses with thick lenses that turned his eyes into black dots. His hair stuck out in tufts, like he’d been yanking at it. He looked like the kind of guy you’d cross the street to avoid at night.  

"Hey, I’m—" I started, but he just flicked his eyes at me, blank and sticky, like wet dirt. Then he turned to the owner and muttered, "We’ll get along, heh."  

The owner clapped his hands. "Great! Have fun!" Then he was gone, swallowed by the fog. I was alone with Travis.  

He halfheartedly showed me the machines, mumbled something about fixing parts, and shuffled to his corner. I got to work, mostly to avoid him. But he was suffocating. He moved silently, like a shadow, and sometimes I’d catch him staring—unblinking, inhuman. A day passed. Then another. Weeks dragged on, and no word about the factory. The commute was brutal, the work exhausting, and that smell—it got worse, seeping into everything. I couldn’t pin down where it came from.  

Travis was weird. He only drank warm Pepsi from crumpled cans that littered his desk. Ate cheap pastries, licking the cream off his fingers with a long tongue. Sometimes he’d sneak up behind me—I’d turn, and he’d be a step away, silent, those black eyes boring through his glasses. My pulse would spike, but I kept quiet. Didn’t want to talk to him.  

He drove the forklift like a lunatic—engine roaring, tires screeching, always looking like he’d plow right into me. "Travis, slow down!" I’d yell. He’d just grin, flashing yellow teeth, and hit the gas harder.  

Then there were the owner’s kids. They wandered the property—pale, silent, faces blank. The youngest, maybe nine, rode a shiny black quad bike. They’d drift in and out of the fog like ghosts. The owner himself? Vanished. Gone when I arrived, still at the office when I left.  

The worst was the workshop bathroom. A tiny stall with a rusty sink and a wall that rattled—steady, like someone shaking a pipe. I knocked back once, and the sound got louder, turning into a low hum that made my skin crawl. I didn’t ask Travis about it. He barely spoke anyway—his face a mask, his voice a rustle.  

One thing stood out: he always left before sunset. He’d watch the sun, and if he stayed late, he’d bolt—drop everything, jump in his rusty car, and peel out without a word. I’d finish up alone.  

I kept hoping for a transfer, but nothing. Then came the morning that broke me.  

Alarm was set for six, but I woke up at five—sharp, no reason. After shifts, I’d crash at seven p.m., dead to the world, which wasn’t normal for me. That day, sleep wouldn’t come. I figured I’d head in early—maybe snag some overtime. Got there before dawn. Sky pitch-black, fog thicker than ever, and then I saw it—Travis’s car. Parked at the workshop. Light on inside.  

Dread gripped my throat, but I brushed it off—"Just nerves." Opened the door. Froze.  

Travis was there. Working—a hammer in his hands, jerky movements like a broken machine. Normally he’d slouch in his corner with his Pepsi, but now he was frantic. Metal clanged, sweat poured down his face, glasses fogged up. I coughed, "Morning!" He stopped. Turned his head slow. Smiled.  

It wasn’t right—his eyes like black pits, teeth bared, veins popping on his neck. He didn’t say anything. Just stared. Then went back to hammering.  

My legs locked up. I wanted out, but he barked, "What’re you standing there for? Help!" His voice was rough, pissed. I grabbed a hammer, started pounding parts—anything to avoid looking at him. Reached for the nail gun. Saw the blood.  

It was sticky, red. Travis’s hands had dark streaks, his fingers slick. By his desk—a puddle, thick, metallic-smelling. Next to it—a carcass. Dog? Pig? Just a heap of fur and bones. He laughed—low, guttural, eyes locked on me.  

"What the hell?" I stammered. He stepped toward me, silent, those eyes unreadable. I bolted for the door, ran to my car, jumped in. Key turned, engine roared—I peeled out. Then I heard it—the forklift. Travis was chasing me, glasses crooked, face twisted. I floored it, mud flying, the fog swallowing him as he roared behind me.  

I got away. But that smell—rot and metal—sticks with me. 

What do I do? Tell someone? Am I losing my mind? Anyone been in a situation like this?
