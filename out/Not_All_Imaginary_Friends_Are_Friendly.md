Have you ever known true fear? No, I’m not talking about the heart palpitations you get when watching a scary film, or even the extreme discomfort that say a fear of heights or spiders may bring on. I’m talking about raw, unfiltered terror. If you haven’t then allow me to describe it to the best of my abilities. It’s like having a split personality, one side of you is paralysed, numb to everything around you, every sound muffled and distorted, even your own thoughts. On the other side of it your mind is simultaneously screaming at you, neurons firing in overdrive as it begs your nerves to release their death grip on your muscles and let you get away. I’ve experienced such a feeling once. I’d only known Katie for a few weeks but when I awoke at 3am to see her kneeling astride me on my bed, the painfully wide, manic grin that split her face bouncing as she gave those deep , earsplitting, inhuman giggles. Behind the kitchen knife raised over my chest, her gaze was locked onto mine, empty but for the cold, furious madness dancing within her almost glowing blue eyes. If my sister hadn’t shrieked from the doorway at the sight, snapping me out of it long enough to instinctively punch the distracted girl in the face before throwing her to the floor and making a run for it, I know my life would have ended that night. It was pure luck that my little sister had fought with her parents earlier that day and begged to crash at mine for the night. Pure luck that she had woken to use the bathroom when she did and heard the giggles. Pure luck that I’m alive to write this now. However, what I’ve learnt over the past few days has taught me a valuable lesson. 

I thought nothing would come close to the fear I felt that night, somehow, living through such an event made me feel stronger. Until I read those damned books. Until I started questioning my own mind, my own… sanity. I thanked my lucky stars every day since that I’d remained in the world of the living. Now though? Now I’m starting to think I’m the unlucky one…

Apologies because this is going to be long. 

I first met Katie almost exactly four years ago. From the moment I laid eyes on her I felt this strong protective urge which made sense considering the circumstances. I was walking home from work on a Friday night following a blazing row with my boss that I was pretty sure would mean more job hunting in the near future. I’ve never been good at holding down employment. The weather reflected my mood, the cloying, gray clouds seemed to smother any light coming from the street lamps while the downpour of rain drenched my clothes leaving them clinging tightly to my defeated form. I hadn’t realised one of my shoes had suffered a tear until part way into my walk but the wet squelch every time my sodden right roof met the pavement was a constant reminder. I was only about five minutes from home, the bottle of whiskey in my cupboard mentally calling to me after my shitty day when I heard it. Barely audible over the raindrops thundering against the floor, there was sobbing. I slowed and looked around before I spotted her. Sat huddled against the wall in a small alleyway was a young woman. Her hands were clasped against her ears as if trying to block out the world while she rocked back and forth, uncontrollable sobs wracking her tiny, soaked body, strands of hair clinging to her cheeks matted with both rain, and the tears freely flowing from her eyes. She was pretty, even in the state she was in it was easy to see how attractive she was. That probably helped in my following decision. I like to think I’d have done the same for anyone but I often didn’t make the best choices in life and the way I’ve treated people has left me with plenty of regrets, I’m ashamed to say. Shaking some water from my hair (not that it made the slightest difference) I sighed quietly and walked over to her. 

She didn’t notice my approach, between the palms clasped to her ears and the tightly shut eyes, I was all but invisible to her. It was only when I reached out and gently touched her arm did her soft, brown eyes spring open in surprise, looking like a startled animal debating whether or not to flee. I stepped back, hands raised in a peaceful gesture with what I’d hoped was a kind smile on my face. Her gaze remained firmly locked on me and I suddenly had doubts as I realised how out of my depth I was.

“Are… are you ok?” I’d asked, flinching as I finished upon realising what a stupid question it was. The girl regarded me for a few more seconds before shaking her head as fresh sobs began to bubble up. I wanted to run away, I wasn’t equipped to deal with this, this was so far out of my comfort zone that all I wanted was to be far, far away. But I didn’t. There was something about her, her frail, tiny build, looking even smaller in the curled up position. The kindness swimming behind the distraught veneer in her eyes. This was someone without a malicious bone in their body, to just abandon her like this would be human. “S-sorry, I don’t want to be rude but I want to help… I’m Will…” I trailed off helplessly. The ghost of a smile appeared on her lips if only for half a second.

“Katie,” she whispered back hoarsely after a few seconds, “and thank you, but I don’t think you can help.” Despite the situation, the warmth and authenticity of her tone made me glad I hadn’t run, increasing that protective instinct I felt towards her.

“Well, at least let me call you a taxi to get home, sitting out in this can’t be helpful, unless you’re a secret mermaid,” I tried to joke and cheer her up, instantly cringing at how decidedly unfunny it was. But she laughed, it was a short, weak laugh, I’m sure she was only doing it to be nice, or maybe she was laughing at the weakness of my humour but either way, it thrilled me to see that momentary cheer slipping through her devastated facade before she crumpled once more, whispering about how she couldn’t go back to that place, even the thought of it seemingly terrifying her. 
“I only live round the corner, if you want to at least get out of the rain I can fix you a coffee.” I mentally facepalmed as I said it. As if she would just accept an invite to someone’s house who up until two minutes ago she’d never laid eyes on. 

“Ok..” she sniffed, a little warily, fixing me with those glistening, trusting orbs. In that moment I wanted to keep her safe from all the evils of the world, I hated the fact that such an innocent looking, trusting person could be in so much pain. I held out a hand and she gingerly took it, letting me help her to her feet. That was how I met Katie.

Upon returning to my house, she had slumped exhausted into a chair, gratefully accepting a towel while I muttered an embarrassed apology about the mess (which she waved away, of course) before going to flick the kettle on. It was only when she took the mug that I realised how badly she was shivering, she must have been outside for hours. The grateful smile I got after fetching her a blanket made my heart melt a little. I nearly dropped my mug when she explained the source of her misery. Her older brother had been found dead in a park that very morning. I remembered hearing of his death when I got to work, the latest in a string of vicious murders that had rocked the area over the past few months. The prevailing rumour had been that he’d been walking home drunk after a night out and passed out in a park bench only for his cold, mutilated corpse to be discovered by an unfortunate jogger early the next day. Upon telling me this, she had once again dissolved into helpless tears. Me, with my limited skills interacting with women, had decided the most comforting thing I could do was lean forward and gently pat her shoulder (yes I know, pathetic really). The tight hug she pulled me into as she sobbed into my chest filled me with a calming, blissful sensation I only ever experienced with her. 

Throughout the evening I slowly got more information from her. She lived with her brother, at least she had, hence why she couldn’t face going home. After a couple of hours, I asked if she was hungry and offered to order a takeaway. Sure, I had food, but I didn’t think offering her a pot noodle was the best course of action. She’d smiled and nodded but insisted that she would cover the cost to thank me. I tried to disagree but she wouldn’t budge and that was how we ended up huddled beside each other, eating Chinese and watching Netflix within four hours of meeting each other. I offered her the spare room that night. My roommate had moved out about a week back so the room was empty, and it had a bolt on the door I reassured her. I could tell she didn’t want to be a burden but the exhaustion after her day had begun to get overwhelming so she agreed and thanked me with a peck on the cheek. Katie ended up staying with me all weekend and it was the happiest I'd been in a long time. Seeing her slowly coming out of her shell and gradually begin to smile more gave me an indescribable rush.

On the Sunday night she said she was ready to go home, but shyly asked if I could come with her. I agreed without hesitation. She had sobbed upon entering her apartment, despairing at seeing her brother's things that he’d never lay eyes on again. Once more, I comforted her and helped to calm her down. She begged me to stay the night with her and once again, my agreement came without delay. When she tiptoed into the living room at midnight, just as I was nodding off on the couch, and asked me to come and share her bed because she felt so alone in there, I didn’t need to be asked twice. I wrapped her up in a tight hug beneath the sheets, only giving the weathered looking stuffed toy on her bed a glance, before she turned to me, thanked me again and gave me a soft kiss, this time on the lips. We had sex for the first time that night. Yes I know, you might think I was taking advantage of her being so vulnerable, and the thought crossed my mind many times but she was very much the instigator. I like to think it was her way of distracting herself. Not that I was complaining, it had been a very long time and being with her was mind blowing. 

We saw each other every day for the next three weeks and I felt like I was living the high life. Every day she grew back into herself more and more, that tiny, shy smile I’d seen that day in the rain blossoming over time into a joyous beam. I’d never met such a gentle and caring soul. Katie loved nothing more than going for walks in the park and scattering food for animals. I’ve never seen someone happier than she would be when she was petting someone’s dog. The time we saw a dead bird by the side of the road she’d cried and cried, insisting we take it away and bury it. Honestly, I found that to be more than a little far but I simultaneously loved her for it. Yes I know, we’d hardly known each other for long but I already knew I loved her, I’ve never loved anyone like that and doubt I ever will again. 

I also learnt a lot about her past. It made sense how well she was getting over her brother’s death when I learnt of her childhood. She had grown up with her father, she didn’t remember her mother, the woman having left when she was still a baby. From what I can gather, all she had wanted was a son, she had no wishes for a daughter and had one day just walked out with Katie’s brother, Mark. Her father had forbidden his wife’s name from even being spoken in his house. I had felt so angry that someone could just abandon such an incredible girl but I was relieved to hear that her upbringing was so happy. As she put it, her father showered her with more love and attention than any other parent could begin to manage. Unfortunately he had passed away a couple of years prior. Mark had reached out to her a year later and they’d started seeing more and more of each other until they got a place together, making up for all those lost years.

It was just over three weeks since I’d met Katie that I awoke to see her there with the knife. Not an hour before I had drifted off with her snuggled up against me and now there she was about to snuff my life out like a match being clasped between two fingers. You know how the story goes from here. By the time the police arrived, she was rocking back and forth in the corner, bawling and screaming, constantly cursing ‘Greg’, whoever that  was. When I discovered that Katie was responsible for all the murders that had been terrorising the city, I didn’t believe it. How could such a small, frail, gentle soul be behind such atrocities. Evidence doesn’t lie though, and it was damning. I was there for the entire trial, the whole process I felt my world crumbling. The Defense listed disorder after disorder and I felt sick to my stomach. Sick with pity, this wasn’t her fault, it… it couldn’t be. I tried so many times to meet her eyes but she’d never look at me, instead rocking back and forth in the dock while she sobbed uncontrollably and muttered about Greg. I don’t think anyone was too surprised when she was sent to a mental hospital but I felt the remaining shards of my heart break.

I visited her just once. Visits were forbidden for the first month but as soon as I could I went to see her. She looked good, but she could barely meet my eyes. There was a doctor nearby but she had no restraints or anything, I guess due to her stature she wasn’t seen as any kind of risk. At first she wouldn’t even look at me until I begged her to do so. When she did, our eyes were only locked for a second, those soft hazel irises bringing a light back into my life momentarily before she burst into tears and turned, running from the room calling herself a monster. The Doctor gave me a sympathetic smile and turned to jog after her. When he returned and informed me she wouldn’t be returning and didn’t want to see me ever again, I didn’t even try to hold back my own tears. 

Every day felt horrendous without Katie, I never moved past her and when I met Lewis, I jumped at the opportunity I had been given. Lewis was a friend of a friend, he seemed like a pretty boring guy and I’d probably have never thought twice about him. I got stuck next to him in the bar, trying to make awkward small talk. When he revealed that he worked at the same hospital Katie was being held at, I damn near jumped for joy. Just like that I made it my mission to get close to Lewis, if only for the constant updates I could get about Katie’s progress. I know he found it a little strange, and he even said as much to me once, but when I explained a little of our personal history he relented, conceding that she was one of the sweetest people he’d ever met.

I learnt that her first year there she’d been erratic at best, some days kind, friendly and eager to please but others she’d just scream and shout and rage against Greg. He asked if I knew who Greg was since all the staff there were at a loss but I was just as stumped. Since then however, she’d been making excellent progress. Her meltdowns had steadily become more infrequent until they had completely stopped almost a year ago. When I learned that Katie’s case would be coming up for consideration into her entering a supervised living arrangement I let out a genuine whoop. 

Three days later Katie killed herself. It was the 29th October and it was all over the news. Apparently she had stabbed herself in the face and neck so viciously and so many times that it was impossible to identify the body by sight alone. I reacted the only way I could, by spending the next week totally drunk with one question in my distraught mind. Why? It was a week after the news broke that Lewis found me, clutching an almost empty bottle of whiskey in the corner of a bar we hit regularly. He gently prized the bottle from my fingers as I looked up at him with unfocused eyes. The pitying smile on his face made me ashamed of myself and I’ve never hated myself more than I did in that moment. Pulling out a chair across from me, he put his bottle of Corona down on the table while placing a glass of water in front of me and telling me to drink. I did. Lewis offered his condolences as was to be expected before hesitating, his voice taking on a more serious tone.

“Look man, I know how much she meant to you so I’ve got something here, don’t tell anyone though because it could cost me my job.” Lewis muttered, looking straight at me. I straightened up, the booze fuelled haze clearing somewhat as I focussed on him. “She uh, she wrote, wrote a lot in her diary, she had a big box of them going back to when she was younger. They were in the pile of stuff to be incinerated because there was no next of kin but I grabbed the box… thought maybe, you’d be interested…” he trailed off as I nodded furiously, it would be nowhere near having her with me but it was something, some small part of her. Lewis nodded knowingly and slid a small box over to me. I made my excuses to leave as soon as possible, desperate to get home and see the books. Lewis didn’t seem surprised and told me he’d see me soon. 

When I got home, I opened the first one in the box and immediately recoiled. There was a crude, childish drawing inside the cover. It was a man, absurdly dressed in an orange and blue pinstripe suit. He had long brown hair with a far too small top hat perched upon it. I recognised it vaguely and made the connection to that aged stuffed toy Katie kept on her bed. The drawing however, was unnerving, it had a manic, almost feral grin, open in soundless laughter while his crudely drawn, almost familiar, piercing blue eyes seemed to stare deep into my soul. Underneath the drawing were two words. ‘Giggling Greg’. I started reading and whatever hope I had in humanity, whatever optimism lived inside me was crushed, slowly, painfully ground into nothing as the harsh reality of this world burnt itself into my retinas. I’m going to transcribe a few of the entries for you below, the ones I think are most important to try and understand the events surrounding Katie. I must warn you, reading these made me feel sick to my stomach.

Note: I’ve fixed the spelling and grammar errors in the earlier entries.

March 18th 2006

Dear Diary, I finally turned seven! Well actually it was yesterday but I was too excited to write in you then! Do you like my drawing, that’s my imaginary friend, Giggling Greg. He always looks after me when I feel sad and makes me feel better after Daddy gets cross. He looks just like Daddy’s toy that he said he had when he was a boy. He never lets me play with it though because it’s old and I might break it. I wanted to have a party and invite people over but no one wanted to come. I’m so lucky to have Greg and Daddy as friends or I’d have none. I was so happy when I got the big cuddly dog. He fits in my bed with me and he’s called spot. I love dogs so much! Daddy didn’t get angry at all, I think it’s because he wasn’t drinking that yucky drink that makes him talk funny. He can get very mean when he drinks that and it’s scary but he’s always really nice after and makes me feel better.


September 4th 2010

Dear Diary,
I had my first day at big school today. It was very scary, I don’t know anyone and some of the older kids are so big and grown up. Luckily, Greg was there with me, making me feel safe. I have lots of new teachers, most of them are really cool but I hate my science teacher, she’s already given us homework. Daddy asked if I made any friends but I didn’t. He says it’s weird that I don’t have any but I have Greg. Last time I told him about Greg when I was nine though he got very angry and told me I was too old for imaginary friends. On the plus side at least he got me makeup for the first time to say sorry, he got me some sparkly lipgloss and concealer because he said I couldn’t hide my face from people. I don’t talk about Greg anymore but he’s still my best friend, he always looks out for me and says what I’m too scared to. It always makes me laugh when he starts giggling. Anyway I have to go now and do my science homework (YUK!)


April 3rd 2016

Dear Diary,
I accidentally mentioned Mum today and Daddy got very angry, asking me why I was banging on about that stupid fart who didn’t give a shit about us. I felt really bad for upsetting him but I didn’t like him being so mean (you know how much I hate bad language). It’s really stressful at the moment because my exams are starting soon so I’m doing lots of work. At least everyone at school is distracted by that though so they’re mostly leaving me alone. Jessica’s still a horrible bully though. Today she surrounded me with her friends and they kept on shoving me and slapping me. It didn’t really hurt, Daddy hits me much harder when I do something silly and I know that doesn’t matter because he always tells me how much he loves me so why should this matter. I couldn’t help but cry though which just made them laugh more. Luckily lunch was ending so they had to leave me alone. Greg was very angry, he kept saying he’d punch and kick those girls so much that it’d make Daddy proud. I told him not to be mean but he was giggling while he said it so I know he was joking.

 Damnit! I’ve just seen the time, I was so focussed on studying that I didn’t realise it was so late. Dad will be home any minute and I forgot to make dinner for us! This is going to hurt, why am I such an idiot?! Greg keeps telling me to stand up to him but it’s my fault.



January 2nd 2018

Dear Diary,
Sorry it’s been so long, my head’s been in pieces. Daddy died last week. They said he took loads of sleeping pills and it was suicide, that he was already weak from how much he drank. I don’t understand, he never seemed suicidal. Greg keeps saying he doesn’t think it was suicide while giggling, he can be so weird sometimes! Then again, I’m 18 and my only friend is an imaginary one so maybe we’re as bad as each other? I miss my Daddy so much. He loved me so much and was so kind. Even when he got really cross when he was drinking, he’d always be so regretful after hurting me and made me feel so special. The funerals this weekend and I’m dreading it, saying goodbye to Daddy forever. What will I do with my life now? 


November 1st 2020

Dear Diary,
It’s been a crazy week. I’m ashamed to say it but I nearly ended it all when I found about about Mark’s death. All of our childhoods apart only to reunite and then have him taken away from me again. The pain is indescribable. Greg was very nasty, he didn’t like Mark, kept saying we should get rid of him, kept accusing him of trying to steal me. It annoys me how possessive Greg can be but I worked out long ago he’s with me for the long run. I just hope he likes Will. I met him the same day I heard about Mark. He’s absolutely amazing. He showers me with attention and does everything for me. I can’t believe I met someone so perfect. It’s only been a week but I feel like I’ve known him my whole life. I told him about Daddy, how special he was. I didn’t mention the times he got angry though, I know Will won’t understand and I’d hate to make him upset. 

Greg still isn’t sure about Will but I really hope he comes round, he has to, I’ve never met such an amazing person. I hope he doesn’t realise I’m a freak like everyone at school did and run away, I don’t know how I’d cope knowing I lost him. He’s been so good helping me cope with the loss of Mark and he treats me like a normal human! I’m going to meet him now, I’ll check in again soon.


November 13th 2020

Dear Diary,
Kill Will, Kill Will, Kill Will. That’s all I’ve been hearing the last few days. I don’t understand, why doesn’t Greg like him? Why would he say such things? He’s ‘giggling’ when he says it, but it isn’t nice, not like it used to be. Maybe it never was? I put my foot down today though. Greg kept saying that Will only likes me because I’m damaged goods beaten by Daddy. I hate how nasty he is and I finally put my food down. I told him I don’t need him anymore, I have Will and he’s a better, kinder man than Greg can ever dream of being. Greg went very quiet and called me a weak willed little whore still in the grasp of her Daddy’s dead fingers and I yelled at him to ‘Piss off.’ (Sorry diary, you know how much I hate swearing but I was so cross) It worked, Greg’s finally gone. I’m free now, free to enjoy my life with Will.



January 16th 2022

Dear Diary,
They finally let me have you back. I’m sorry. I’m sorry it’s been so long but a lot has happened. I don’t want to tell you right now, I’m not ready but I will. I lost Will. It’s my fault, I’m a monster. He came to see me the other day and I couldn’t face him. I watched him leave from my window, he was in tears and so was I but he can’t be near me, I can’t hurt him like the others. But it wasn’t me, it was Greg. I mean, I did it, but Greg made me, he didn’t go for long, he came back. He nearly killed Will. I can’t put him at risk, he’s so much better without me. Being in this hospital is more than I deserve, you don’t know how bad it is, I deserve to be dead, I’m a stain on the world. The doctors here keep listing all these illnesses but I’m not crazy. I’M NOT. IT'S ALL GREGS FAULT. HE DID THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS, I WASNT THERE I UNDERSTAND NOW! THE TIMES WHEN I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING GREG IS IN CONTROL! I’m going to sleep, the light hurts, the silence hurts, my mind hurts and Greg won’t shut up. I hope I dont wake up tomorrow.


May 3rd 2023:

It’s not fair, Will’s still putting in requests to see me. Why won’t he move on, I love him so much why won’t he let himself be happy? Greg won’t shut up, calling him a pathetic freak like me. I wish I could scrub him from existence. I hear his giggles every day and every night, the stream of ranting, raging filth coming out of his mouth. There were some frogs in the garden near the pond, they’ve been there for about a week and I loved sitting and watching them for hours. I blacked out yesterday, again and when I came too in my room, Greg told me he squished them all. I went out this morning and saw their broken bodies. I cried so much, I hate hate hate Greg, why did I have to imagine him? Why? Why did Daddy have that stupid doll? I wish he’d let me play with it and break it, even if he’d put me in a coma it might have meant Greg won’t exist. I said that and Greg was very angry. When I came too he’d slammed my face against the wall so hard my nose broke. 

No one else knows this but Greg killed Daddy. He finally admitted it to me. I think I knew all along but he made me crush those pills up and put them in Daddy’s Whiskey. Why? First Daddy, all those other people, then Mark, then almost Will and now the frogs? For what? All of them were Greg. ALL OF THEM! I HOPE HE ROTS IN HELL ALONGSIDE ME THE SICK FREAK! I’ve accepted I’m going to hell. Even if God understands that Greg killed those people he’ll never forgive me for how I’ve hurt my beautiful Will. No not mine, he can’t be, no matter how much I want him, how much I love him. He deserves better than a freak like me.


28th October 2024

No no no no no. I heard them talking about it today. They think I might be able to leave this place soon. I can’t, I can't, it's not safe. I said I shouldn’t be allowed out yet but they said it’s just because it feels like home here now. I’m such an idiot! I hated the pitying looks they were giving me, like they were disappointed in me. I stopped ranting at Greg, just letting his venomous filth wash over me, convincing them I wasn’t a freak. I’m pretty sure I can make enough of a scene at the hearing to convince them to keep me here, but Greg said he’ll take over and make sure they let me out. He promised me that as soon as we’re out of here, he’s going to kill Will and make it hurt, to remind me I’m his. He can’t. He CANT DO IT. I need to stop him. I think I know how but I’m scared. I deserve it though, for bringing this monster into the world. I know it will crush Will. He has such a good heart and I know he thinks the world of me. I just pray he can eventually move on. 

The thought of Will with someone else tears me up more than anything Greg’s done, I know it’s selfish but it’s true. If anything I’m glad he’ll never know what I’m about to say because I think it would destroy him but I truly, deeply love him. In another world I could imagine a life with him, having a family, growing old together, devoting my heart and soul to him as I know he would to me. But not in this world. BECAUSE OF GREG! I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM SO MUCH! HE THINKS HES SO CLEVER AND IN CONTROL! Tomorrow he’ll get the shock of his life. I’m sorry Daddy. I’m sorry Mark. I’m sorry Diary. I’m sorry Will.



I finished reading them all a couple of days ago. I haven’t left my house. I haven’t showered. I haven’t eaten. I’ve just sat there, numb, dead to the world. We call ourselves the most sophisticated species on the planet yet how could we fail such a gentle, beautiful mind. Cause it to crack so badly. Katie truly was an angel, with everything that happened and she still managed to be such a beautiful person. She was right, her words have destroyed me. Irreparably so. 

I saw the first person I’ve seen since I was given the diaries earlier. It was a delivery man, delivering the coil of rope I ordered. I screwed up tying a noose on my first couple of attempts but you really can learn anything online. I looked at it when I was done. Knowing I’d be meeting the same fate as my Katie. Feeling hot, furious rage bubble up knowing how the system had failed someone suffering from a lifetime of abuse and mental illness. As my anger spiked, my boot lashed out, striking my coffee table, sending it, and the stack of diaries to the floor. I froze. One of them had fallen open. ‘Giggling Greg,’ stared at me with those pale, strikingly blue eyes and it hit me like a ton of bricks. That familiarity I felt when I first laid eyes on the picture. I’d seen those eyes once before. Staring at me behind the blade of a kitchen knife…
