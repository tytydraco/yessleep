Humanity has been faced with a world-ending crisis, all I can do is watch it unfold on Channel 8.

We found out humans have not been the only reasons for global warming, as Channel 8 announced that earth's scientists have determined the sun has consumed the majority of its hydrogen and has been slowly expanding while it begins its transition to red giant phase. 

This small expanse, while slow, is slowly pushing the earth to the edge of the habitable zone. Within centuries, scientists predict all life on earth will cease as unstoppable solar heat envelops the world. Many ideas were floated out in earths brightest think-tanks, and the most appropriate solution was determined by our leaders: Galactic abandonment.

Earth has practically become an oven, and over the last decade the temperature has only continued to rise. We have all been locked inside, due to the scorching heat outside. Ice has become the new gold. Wildlife is dying and homeless bodies litter the streets, killed quickly by heat stroke. Wildfires run rampant with only robotic firefighting methods available to attempt control of the blazes, you couldn't pay anyone enough to go fight a fire in this weather. We are all ready to abandon ship. 

In a worldwide broadcast, our nations united leaders; The Council of Humanic Affairs, announced the solution to our problem. An experimental technology developed over the last decade aimed to teleport Earth to a younger, more habitable sun to ensure the survival of our world. Housed at a secure research facility in the middle of the Atlantic, this technology was named "Humanity’s Life Raft". It can warp the entire planet to any intergalactic coordinates in the known universe. After tirelessly searching the Heavens, our most powerful space telescope located a potential oasis in deep space; A lone star located near the edge of the Andromeda, named Baxar-85. The sun is approximately 1.34 million kilometers in diameter and carries only 4 barren planets in its orbit. Its habitable zone is clear, and it was decided this is to be the future home of the human race. 

Lastly, they announced our judgement day. The world was due to be moved in one week, at exactly noon. We were given strict rules in advance of the great abandonment. All aeronautical and astronautical travel was to immediately cease. Coastal cities were evacuated in anticipation of extreme tidal fluctuation. Lastly, everyone must begin praying at 11:59 am. If all goes right, the shift through space should be nearly instantaneous, nanoseconds longer than the blink of an eye. The Council Chair stated that if these rules are followed, everyone's safety is guaranteed. We were told the only way we would notice that we were in a new galaxy would be the sudden cooling. Humanity, as a whole, was excited for this new solar system. Not only would the temperature ensure our comfortability for millennia to come, but this new galaxy brought new opportunities for outer space exploration and trade. Maybe in this new galaxy we would even encounter extraterrestrial life. 

I was nervous, though. It seemed too good to be true. Everyone else was just too hot to care.

As the day closed in, though, peace fell upon humanity. Despite everything going on, we were all excited for the abandonment. Hope was at an all time high, no one could resist the fact that this change was universally positive. After a week of pure anticipation, finally, the day came. 

TV's on, we all counted down until prayer. Hands were held across the world, and we celebrated like it was a thousand new years. Everywhere, the screens blared:

00.01.05
00.01.04
00.01.03
00.01.02
00.01.01
BEGIN PRAYER.

I started praying the only prayer I know, Our Father. Meanwhile, our scientists powered up the life raft. What could only be described as a low hum was heard worldwide. The time of reckoning was upon us. 

00.00.05
00.00.04
00.00.03
00.00.02
00.00.01

Blink.

The Earth Shook violently. It worked. It was far more violent than expected, but it worked. The climate cooled quickly, but not without it's consequences. The oceans exploded as the moon was ripped away from the planet. Every city and country within 100 miles of the ocean was destroyed by tsunamis higher than ever thought possible. Islands were erased from the face of the earth entirely. While luckily I was nowhere near the coast, we the central areas didn’t go unpunished. Earthquakes rocked the rest of the world. Skyscrapers toppled down, inland rivers and lakes erupted as dams failed globally. For days I sat huddled under my bed, completely helpless to the Earth's relentless shaking. 

After days passed, the earthquakes finally subsided, and the waters started to retreat. When the dust finally settled, hundreds of millions were dead or missing. Rescue crews began to mobilize across the globe to assist with international triage and recovery. Humanity began scraping all of its resources together in an attempt to bring some normalcy to this new solar system. When I finally walked outside, I was met with a cool breeze that sent chills down my spine. I couldn’t believe it. 

In the midst of it all, though, a rumble was felt across the globe. People around me screamed and cowered in fear. Are the quakes starting again? 

The world suddenly darkened. 

At first it looked like the moon was crashing into us, but then the first spikes struck through the clouds. Descending through the atmosphere was a gargantuan spacecraft. It blackened the face of the earth with its dark, dagger-shaped hull. Sleek, bladed wings jutted off the ship in all directions, resembling the biblical angels sent for our salvation that I remember learning about in bible school. It cut down through earth's stratosphere with ease, as if even the sky was afraid to displease it. The ominous roar of it's titanic engines pierced the ears of all of us below. 

As we all stared upward in amazement, hope, and fear; a message was broadcasted from the alien ship:

"Homo sapiens, we have been preparing for your planet's arrival for many megaannum. We have been waiting patiently for you all to enter into our grasp. Your species' slavery to us was foretold by our prophets long before your creation. Our ancestors placed your seed in the milky way billions of years ago with faith one day you would ripen and return to us. You all will live and die for our continued advancement, and for that you shall feel pride for fulfilling your intended purpose. Welcome home."

It was at that moment I realized:

We are no more than sentient cookies that were set to bake in a heliocentric oven. Now we are to be devoured.
