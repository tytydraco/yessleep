To begin my story I have to go back in time, and to be more specific, 15 years ago.

I was 11 years old when everything started.



I remeber it was cold, an obscure winter night in a little Romanian town in the heart of Transylvania. A tiny light bulb flickered weakly, casting shadows on the walls. My mother’s voice broke the silence, cracking as she checked the locks one more time, her hands trembling:

’’-Just try to breath silently.’’ she whispered, as though trying to convince both of us. ,, I know they’re out there. I can hear them’’.

I tried to keep my voice low, but I failed:

’’-But mom, who’s outside?’’

She didn’t answered. She only sighed and covered my mouth with a trembling hand. I couldn’t breath… ‘’If I just close my eyes, maybe it will be better’’ I thought.



But I wouldn’t close them-not with her squeezing my hand like that. I have to see, I have to be there. I couldn’t miss this; it was a routine I had to endure every night. We’d lock everything, turn down the lights, and wait .

,,Is someone watching us?’’ I tough, half-believing it. What else it could be, if she was so sure? I’m only glad my brother is too young to understand any of this.



I don’t really know how much time has passed since all this routine starded, but I think I can hear something outside the door, scratching. It sounds as if something wants to come in. It might be my imagination, but I don’t think so, it feels too real. Every time she squeeze my hand, the scratching comes back. The stronger the squeeze, more intense the scratching. I try to close my eyes; I don’t want to see this darkness anymore, I long to dream of light and colors-to let them dance across my mind- but something stops me. I don’t know what it is, I’ve never felt this before. It’s something new, something sticky wrapping around my insides, not letting me breath. Everything around me spins, my head can no longer stay upright, and bile rises to my throat. Just when I think I´m about to empty my stomach, the scratching stops. Silence returns, and the grip on my hand loosens. I think the sun is rising; I’m not sure, but it seems like some light is slipping through the shutters. I hope it’s the sun-I pray to something I don’t even have a name for yet that it’s the sun.



Another night without sleep, the cold winter wind keeps me awake, but the dread begins long before I arrive at school. I try not to let my exhaustion show when I walk trough the school gates, but I know they see it. They always see it.

Al school, there is no silence to retreat into, no room to hide. They circle me, sharp words flung like stones, cutting trhough my defenses. ,,Why are your clothes so old? Why don’t you talk? Are you stupid or just weird?’’ Every question, every stare, peels away my layers, exposing me until I’m raw and trembling, wishing to disappear. I long to fade into the back-round, but even invisibility it’s stolen from me. I shrink further and further, locking myself away inside my mind, until my body becomes a hollow shell, sitting motionless while they laugh, waiting for it to end.

The worst part isn’t even their words. It’s the knowledge that home isn’t a refuge. It’s a place where the fear keeps us in perpetual darkness.

Dread is my shadow, following me wherever I go-a whisper in my mind that the world will never be safe. Not home. Not anywhere.



The walk home from school that day felt no different from any other-a gray, uneventful stretch filled with silence and the ache of my tired feet. I turned the corner to our house, already bracing myself for what was waiting behind the door. Maybe whispers about people lurking outside, maybe the curtains drawn tight, the house steeped in the usual tension that made it hard to breathe.



But when I stepped inside, I froze. The faint smell of something sweet hung in the air, soft and warm, like nothing I smelled in a long time. My mother stood in the kitchen, a plate in her hands, and on it was a cake. A real cake. Homemade, uneven, but real.



,,Surprise!’’ she said softly, almost shyly, as if she weren’t sure I’d believe it. ,,I made this for you.’’



My legs didn’t move. I stared at the cake, at her face, at her hands that were shaking ever so sightly. I don’t remember reaching for her, but suddenly my arms were around her waist, and tears spilled down my my cheeks before I could stop them. The sweetness of the moment overwhelmed me; she never did this. Never.

But for a fleeting second, I felt normal, so this is what other kids must feel every day when they came home-a mother’s love wrapped in the scent of cake and safety.



And then she said it:,,Someone told me tonight is going to be special.’’



Her voice had a softness to it, almost dreamy, as if she were revealing a secret meant only for us. The words hit me like ice water. My body stiffened in her arms, staring at her.



Who? Who told her that?



She didn’t answer my unspoken question, but the smile on her face was too wide, her eyes too bright, like fire burning just beneath the surface. The warmth from the cake evaporated instantly, leaving only the creeping tendrils of dread curling in my stomach.



My mind raced, my pulse quickening as her words echoed in my head. ,,Special.’’ She’d said it like it was a gift, but all I felt was cold terror. What did she mean? What was going to happen tonight? I didn’t want to know.



I glanced at the windows, half expecting shadows to be there already, watching us. My mouth opened to ask, to beg her to tell me what she meant, but couldn’t. The fear had stolen my voice. Instead, I stood there, nodding numbly as she lit a single candle on the cake and told me to make a wish.



All I could wish for was for tonight to pass like any other night-but deep down, I already knew it wouldn’t.





The house had fallen into the fragile stillness of night. My brother was asleep, his tiny breaths soft and even in the next room, while I stood in the dim bathroom, brushing my teeth. The fluorescent bulb above flickering slightly, its weak light casting shadows on the walls. My body ached with exhaustion, but I forced myself trough the nightly routine, praying for an uneventful night, praying for peace.



And then her voice broke the quiet.



,,Come here.’’ my mother called. Her tone was light, almost sweet, but something in it made my hand stop mid-motion. ,,Come see me. Come admire the work of the shadows.’’

The toothbrush slipped from my hand, clattering into the sink. My chest tightened. The hallway stretched before me, dark and silent, each step toward her room heavier than the last. The floor creaked beneath me as is the house itself was warning me to turn back, but I couldn’t.



When I reached her room, I froze in the doorway.



She was lying on the bed, her body slack and lifeless, as if all the energy had been drained from her. Her eyes stared straight at the cieling, hollow and empty, yet a wide, unnatural griin was stretched across her face. My stomach twisted at the sight, and my knees wavered.



In her hand was a piece of paper, its edges crumpled as though clenched too tightly. My trembling fingers reached for it, and as I unfolded it, I felt the cold kiss of dread crawl up my spine. Four words scawled across the page, messy but clear:,,**You will be next.’’**



A wave of nausea crashed over me.

,,Mom?’’ I whispered, though I barely recognized my own voice.



Her grin didn’t falter. Her empty eyes rolled toward me as if she could see right trough me, see into me. Slowly, with deliberate, eerie precision, her lids began to close.



,,No, no, no!’’ I screamed, my voice shattering the silence, but there was no answer. My brother didn’t stir, no neighbor rushed in-only silence responded.



And then I saw it.



In the corner of the room, just past the foot of the bed, a shadow moved. Not a flicker from the outside world, not a trick of the light-this shadow was alive. It stretched unnaturally, clinging to the walls like ink spreading on paper, watching me.



The air grew heavier, pressing against my lungs, and all I could do was scream, scream into the void where no one could hear me, where no help would come. The shadow didn’t flinch; it just lingered, waiting.



I didn’t know how long I stood there, frozen in horror, but when I finally turned to run, the shadow followed.
