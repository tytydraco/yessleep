Some moments are there to change your life forever. Some moments are there to drive you headfirst into the hate-filled clutches of fate. A fate that means discovering things about yourself you weren’t ready to discover. 

That morning was one of them. 

Last week, I was woken up by intense banging on the front door on my only free day of the week. Less than an hour into my beauty sleep. 

I rolled out of bed intending to unleash the heat of a thousand suns on the person behind it. I didn’t know that many people in town, and everybody who would be here to see Roger knew that he was with his father relearning the “alpha way,” whatever that meant. 

His mother and sister were on a trip to visit his grandparents, and Martha was working.

So that only left a handful of options, none of which I felt particularly inclined to deal with.

“What?” I spat out as my eyes got skewered by burning sun rays. What I wouldn’t have given for the sun to actually burn his kind!

“Well, that’s rude,” Lucien complained, leaning against the doorframe. “Come on, Bloody. Let me in.” He whined. Ok, he didn't technically whine, but that's the way it sounded to me. I'm not idiot enough to invite a vampire into my home.

I just stared at him. 

“Not even if I promise to be on my best behavior?” He asked, putting on his most angelic smile. 

Yeah right. And I’m the queen of England. Still, I took the marvelous opportunity to toy with him. He basically handed it to me on a silver platter. 

I let my shoulders slump in defeat. 

“You,” I started through clenched teeth. “May.” His smile turned smug. Perfect. “Not enter this house.”

“Hah!” His eyes widened with shock. If I had had my phone on me at that moment, his face would’ve become my new wallpaper. His hand shot to his chest. “Wow. You wound me, Bloody. Really.”

“What do you want?” I asked again. As much as I'd enjoyed that, sleep sounded much much better.  

“I’ll tell you if you let me in,” he teased. 

“Bye,” I replied, starting to shut the door.  

“Ok! Ok,” he sighed. “I’ll tell you. But do you really want prying ears to hear?”

“Leave me a note. Goodnight.”

“It’s morning,” he replied. 

“And I’m going to sleep.”

He pursed his lips, and made a show of looking around for any witnesses. I swear this man has a future in drama.

“I know someone who can help with your…problem,” his smile turned smug. Ugh. 

I perked up, though. And he saw it too, because he took it as another chance to push. 

“So, how about you let me in? We’ll be able to discuss this in private.”

Put like that, it did seem reasonable. Luckily for me, I wasn’t an idiot, and I didn’t fall for his charms. 

He rolled his eyes when I didn’t move or say anything. It doesn’t take much to wear this man down. “How much do you know about the way Eternal Night works?” He finally asked. 

“I know you’re from there, so it must be dreadful.” I’m not ashamed to say that I giggled at my own joke. “Nothing else aside from that.” And he was, in my opinion, being exceptionally rude since he ignored my jab. 

He smiled at the little hint of annoyance that I accidentally let through. Asshole.

“Over a millennium ago, the land was ruled by both of the royal families, vampire and werewolf, and their respective elders. But then, one of the vampire kings went insane and ordered the execution of all the elders so that he could rule without their interference. No elder had been appointed since. But—”

“But he missed one,” I interrupted. 

“Yep." 

So predictable. I fought the urge to roll my eyes.

“Right.” How was I supposed to say this tactfully? “As much as I would love to meet another one of the elders,” I shuddered visibly on purpose. “I would rather eat nails.”

“You don’t get it,” he insisted. “This one is much older than the oath to kill you, and he was in hiding when it went into effect. He’s the oldest creature alive in all of the Seven Realms. If anybody knows what you are, it’s him.”

Oh, right. Hadn't I mentioned this? The oath the wizard was bound by included all of the elders from his time. All of them. Makes you wonder what the hell is going on.

“And how are you so sure that he’s going to help us?” I asked, annoyed.

Lucien flashed me one of his signature smiles. “He’s forced to follow a direct order from the royal family. All vampires are. It’s in our DNA. No vampire can refuse.”

“And let me guess. You know someone from the royal family,” I said in a monotone voice. I didn't quite fancy the idea of meeting another vampire.

Yes, I was digging my own grave right then. But alas, I was too stupid to realize it. 

He took two steps away from my door, amusement gleaming in his eyes. “Very nice to meet you, Miss Bloody,” he smiled, making sure that he was showing as much of his fangs as possible. “Allow me to introduce myself. I am Prince Lucien Hayes Devereaux of Night. Heir to the vampire throne.”

Huh.

My eyes didn’t widen out of sheer willpower. I sure wasn’t expecting that one. 

That’s what Martha must’ve meant about bloodlines, I thought.

Not only was the man I’d been insulting for a few minutes—or months, If you add it all together—a very scary vampire. But he was also royalty. 

I couldn’t help but wonder how long it would be until curiosity alone stopped being a good enough deterrent from his homicidal urges. 

For some reason, though, all I could think to say right then was “Silas doesn’t seem too obedient.” My voice came out high-pitched, even though what I was going for was nonchalance. 

At least I got him to feel ashamed. I could deal with that, I was sure. “I don’t use that particular gift on him too often,” he admitted, avoiding eye contact with me. 

On him?

My brain immediately tried to look deeper into his words, and flashes of Roger’s admission on Christmas came to mind. But my thoughts quickly turned away from that and to my last interaction with inhuman royalty.

The fae queen who had tried to eat Roger and me. 

I couldn't help it. I burst out laughing. 

The last royal I had met tried to eat me, and this one actually managed to. 

That’s hysterical. 

Not only that, but this is how I found out that a literal prince is my self-appointed vampire protector.

And to make matters worse, I’ve also been sharing his secrets online. Yet another reason I can’t allow him to find out about my Reddit account. 

Anyway. I will spare myself the humiliation of telling you how the rest of the interaction went.

Afterward, I took Lucien to the diner so that he could explain his plan to everyone involved in what I like to call *Operation What the Hell Is Susan*. For some reason, it still hasn’t caught on with the other participants. I consider it only a matter of time, though. 

Basically, the plan consisted of him taking me to the Seven Realms in Anchorage, the closest portal to the vampire. There, we would have to rent a car that would take us to Fairbanks, where we would switch cars to go talk to the elder—whose location I’m going to keep secret for obvious reasons—and finally drive the rental car back to the Anchorage diner. 

It came as a complete surprise that there were no objections. This is most definitely a first for a group formed by a vampire, a werewolf, a witch, and a Susan. I do have to clarify, though, that the lack of objections applied only to the journey. Because Roger—the wicked, wicked traitor who knew all along who Lucien was and deemed it unnecessary to inform me—insisted that he come with me. 

And, despite my momentary irritation toward his person, I profusely agreed if it meant that I wouldn’t have to spend SEVEN hours in a car with Count Dumbula (a much more fitting insult than I’d realized the first time I used it.)

Do you know that moment when the worst person you know makes a great point that there is no way you can refute? Yeah…

Lucien pointed out that the combination of really ancient vampire with millennia of accumulated strength and knowledge, plus young—these are Dumbula’s words, not mine—inefficient and reckless werewolf wasn’t bound to be favorable toward the latter. 

Damn him and his well-thought-out arguments. Who knew he was capable of them?

I know, I know. I’m being unnecessarily mean with everyone right now. Of course I’m aware Lucien’s literal job is to make good arguments and decisions. But I’m mad at everybody who decided not to tell me that Lucien was a prince.

Sorry, not sorry. 

In addition to that, he even bribed the other cook to work a double shift the following day, and Roger so that he would take my waitressing shift, allowing me to actually rest.

Fine! He’s beginning to grow on me too. Like fungus. But still.

We left immediately. No time like the present or whatever. And I made sure to pack a thermos of O-, because I know him too well.

“We’re going to be walking for a while. Anchorage is door 1045,” Lucien said as we walked into the wall behind the jukebox. 

“Doesn’t the in-between read out intentions?” I asked. 

“Knowing what door we’re going to is not knowing *where* we’re going,” Lucien rolled his eyes. “You need to have been there before to actually *know* the place." His tone was mocking, and I so wanted to punch him in the face. 

Still, a smile spread over my face.

"And I’ve never been to the Seven Realms Diner in Anchorage myself. We usually fly straight into Fairbanks, but I couldn’t possibly tell my uncle why we needed the private jet on such short notice.” Ugh. Rich kid problems, am I right?

I let him keep blabbering about private jets and Alaska for a while more before interrupting him.

My smile had turned smug, there was no way around that. “Are you sure about that?” I raised an eyebrow, looking pointedly behind him. 

Lucien's eyes widened before he even completely acknowledged my words.

Shock flickered across Lucien’s face for a brief moment as he slowly turned around to face the door opposite our diner. There, instead of 556, which usually greeted us upon entering, stood 1045. It was almost as if it were waiting for us.

“Impossible,” he murmured. 

“How can I possibly know more about the in-between than a decrepit old vampire who has known this place for centuries?” I teased.

“It’s you! This place is reacting to you,” he exclaimed. And I could be wrong, but I felt like there was a hint of pride in his tone.

“Oh, please,” I dismissed his words with a flick of my wrist. 

“No, I’m serious. It’s happened before. I couldn’t figure out why finding the doors was so easy. It usually takes a lot more focus, even when you have clear intentions,” he chuckled.

“Really?” I asked. Strangely enough, I was happy. 

“Yes,” Lucien laughed. “On Halloween, we got there and back in record time, and when we went to see the wizard, the door was right there. Just like now! The place reacts to you.”

I smiled at that. It was the first real clue as to what I am. 

I'm not too used to receiving praise, though, so I just told him that we needed to move under the guise of not wasting more time. 

Despite that, I was still grinning an hour later when Lucien decided to be an ass again. 

“Oh boy. I definitely should’ve brought some blood.” He said. “Good thing you’re here, though. A hungry vampire is never your best choice for a driver.”

See? I told you I would need that thermos.

I did manage to sneak a picture of his face when I shoved it into his chest, which I did make my wallpaper later. 

Then, after the longest seven hours of my life, we finally switched cars and got to the elder vampire’s house. 

And, in case you were wondering—no. I wasn’t wearing appropriate clothing for the weather. I didn’t even *own* appropriate clothing for the weather! Thankfully, I only had to endure almost dying on the small commute from the car to the door, because everywhere else we’d been was properly heated. 

I nearly cried in relief when my fears of a rundown cabin with a constant draft and dark rooms were replaced by a huge mansion, cloaked by magic so that nobody could bump into it by accident. It even had a heated driveway!

You know what they say. If you’re a vampire and you’ve been alive for centuries and you’re still poor, what the hell are you doing?

Now. I’m aware that you are all under the impression that if shit were to hit the fan anytime during this trip, it would definitely be during the visit to the very old, very dangerous vampire. 

But you would all be mistaken. 

The encounter with the man had indeed been terrifying, bloodcurdling, and I did consider braving the cold if it meant putting some distance between him and me. I felt like a juicy steak, and not in the way Lucien looks at me when he’s thirsty. 

Now I know that his “hungry” look is more teasing than anything. 

But nothing of much interest happened. Lucien commanded him to tell us what he knew about me, and the old vampire only told us that he knew that I was some kind of hybrid, which was no news. 

Then, when Lucien pressed for more information, the elder began vomiting blood.  

Lucien withdrew his command immediately. Finally, under a new command, we discovered that he was under oath not to divulge my identity. 

No, not as a part of the original oath that the wizard was part of. That one had many layers that still remained unknown to all of us. But by an oath the original elders had forced upon every living person at the time. This oath was meant to keep the very existence of my species a secret.

The knowledge about my people’s existence was supposed to die with them. 

Oh joy.

The only thing of value we discovered is that we were going about this in a completely wrong way. Every single inhuman that was alive when my species roamed freely through the seven realms was forbidden from even mentioning them. 

So, the idea of finding somebody old enough to remember was futile. 

It’s a good thing that after so many disappointments, I didn’t really allow myself to be hopeful when we left home. 

And, to make matters worse, things started going south once we left. 

“I’m sorry we couldn’t find anything,” Lucien said as he pulled away from the driveway.

The sincerity in his voice caught me off guard.

“It’s fine. I wasn’t really expecting much,” I shrugged, looking out the window. “At least I enjoyed getting out of town.”

“Wow. I didn’t realize you appreciated my company so much,” he joked. 

“Meh,” I replied, stifling a smile. 

Truth be told, it wasn't as horrendous as I make it out to be. Who could tell October me that just a few months later, I would be spending time with this vampire willingly?

I was once so terrified of him that I locked myself in that motel room for days. Now, I can somewhat enjoy his company. It really puts things into perspective.

We sat in silence for a while, and eventually the rhythmic roar of the engine lulled me to sleep. 

The car pulling into a gas station woke me less than twenty minutes later, though, saddling me with one of the worst cases of nap hangover in my entire life. I swear I felt more tired than I had before falling asleep.

“You don’t have to get up,” Lucien murmured. “I’ll pay for the gas, and we’ll be on our way.”

“No, no,” I mumbled. I rubbed at my eyes, but all I managed were narrow slits. “I need the bathroom.”

I felt groggy as I climbed out of the car, but the gelid air sobered me up a little—though it was so cold I briefly considered holding it until we got home.

Lucien ran to block my path and handed me his suit jacket, which I accepted without complaint. Of course, he didn’t feel the cold. The bastard. 

Once I was done using the facilities, I grabbed a chocolate bar and joined Lucien in line at the counter. For a gas station lost in the middle of Alaska, it was surprisingly busy.

I started rummaging through my pockets for some change, but he snatched the bar out of my hands with an eye roll. 

“Thanks,” I muttered. Perks of being friends with a rich kid.

Then, once the gas and my snack were acquired, we walked back out into the frozen tundra. All that was left to do was to pump the gas, and then we could’ve been on our way. 

Except for one small, tiny, insignificant detail. 

Our car was no longer where we’d left it. 

The police were called. They made us aware of a string of auto thefts at that gas station, which was still unsolved three months after it began. And, “Why did you think leaving the car unsupervised would be a good idea?”

Apparently, empathy isn’t something all that common in law enforcement. At least not here.

And, of course, it was entirely too cold for Lucien to follow the smell. He admitted after a while, rather reluctantly, that only a werewolf would’ve been able to. 

At least the police drove us to a hotel, only after chiding me for my lack of appropriate apparel. Don't they have anything better to do?

Meanwhile, Lucien struggled to find us another rental car to be able to make the rest of the journey. 

Who knew that even princes can be denied service after 11 pm?

We had no choice but to spend the night at the hotel—five stars, Lucien had insisted. But the best the officers could do was three, much to Dumbula’s dismay. (How much money does this man have anyway? Maybe I should start charging him for annoying me. That’s a thought.)

I’m not sure I should share this detail, because I can already smell the comments, but—of course—the only available room had only one bed. 

Truth be told, I wanted to be mad at Lucien. I wanted it to be his fault. But none of us could’ve foreseen this. 

Once we had our key, I stumbled into our room, and I could barely get myself to kick off my shoes before collapsing onto the bed. In the previous twenty-four hours, I’d only had a total of two hours of sleep. Still, I knew that I would have to get back up once Lucien came in, so I didn’t allow myself to feel too comfortable. 

I didn’t have the energy to argue with a crazy vampire prince, so when he finished the check-in, I grabbed a pillow from the bed and two blankets and proceeded to make myself a little cocoon in the corner. 

“What are you doing?” He asked. 

“You can have the bed, your highness,” I mocked. 

Lucien rolled his eyes. “I don’t sleep much. You take it.”

I furrowed my brows. That was odd. No fight?

I put the pillow and the blankets back on the bed. 

“Thank you,” I said. I couldn't help but side-eye him as I walked back to the bed. He was being suspicously non combative.

“You’re welcome, my lady,” he said, bowing. I waited for the taunting smile, but there was none. 

Instead, he looked concerned.  

“You know…” Lucien said after a while, looking sheepishly at me. 

I groaned. Here it comes. I know him too well by now.

“I was hoping we’d make it back tonight, but we’re stuck here and—” he hesitated. Was he nervous? “Vampires require regular feeding. Normally, I’d compel a human, but I used up most of my power commanding the elder. I can’t do anything like that until I get some more blood.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him so anxious. 

“Um…” My heart started pounding against my ribs. 

“Please, don’t feel obligated to offer,” he added quickly, stepping back from me. “I know it must be unnerving enough to have to share a room with a hungry vampire. But I assure you that I won’t make you do anything you don’t want to do. I have excellent control.”

The lack of blood was clearly affecting him because he was acting extremely odd.

I took a deep breath. I didn’t want to feed him. It wasn’t a pleasant experience. But last time hadn’t been *so* bad, and since I’m the trouble magnet, who was to say that there would be none? I needed him to be at full strength. 

“Well, what are you waiting for?” I asked, offering him my hand. I couldn’t stop it from shaking, but I didn’t hesitate, and I am congratulating myself for that. 

He sighed, relief painted across his face. “Glorious,” he grunted, grabbing my extended arm. The relief in his features converted into ravenous hunger. But, for some strange reason, I wasn't entirely afraid.

The bite went the same way as last time, and it took no longer than two minutes. I was happy that his self-proclaimed 'great control' hadn't been exaggerated. As a rule of thumb, please don't agree to feed an extremely hungry or drained vampire. It's very easy for them to lose control and end up killing you.

Then, since I fed him, I made him take me down to the restaurant to feed me. My stomach was growling, and all I’d eaten had been that chocolate bar. 

I was exhausted. I could barely put one foot in front of the other, and the blood loss certainly didn’t help. I caught a glimpse of my face in the elevator mirror, and I looked paler than Lucien. And that’s saying something, because he’s a vampire. 

The restaurant was, of course, nearly empty. It was late, and most people had already retired to their rooms. We were some of the last people there. 

“What’s their problem?” I asked, staring at two men who were, in turn, staring at me. In my defense, they started it. 

“They hate you and want you dead,”  Lucien murmured without looking up from his phone. He was still trying to find us a way out of this mess.

“That wouldn’t surprise me one bit,” I replied. 

I shivered a bit as the two men kept staring at me, and I quickly rolled down my sleeve when I realized that what they were really staring at was the bite mark on my wrist.

I ate as fast as possible. Not because of those men, but because I wanted to get in bed and finally sleep. Sleep sounded like heaven at that point. 

Finally, we walked back into the room, and I allowed myself to properly collapse into bed. Now that I knew that it was all mine. 

Lucien, on the other hand, sat at the desk. Still on his phone. 

I closed my eyes, ready for unconsciousness to take me away. But, as I tossed and turned, sleep eluded me. There was a gnawing question that I’d had for weeks, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted it answered. My brain knew that that was the perfect opportunity to bring it up. 

“Lucien?” I asked. 

“Hm? Weren’t you sleeping?”

“Did you kill my parents?”

His breathing hitched, and he tensed up. 

“Did you want me to?” He averted the question. 

I thought about it for a moment, and I just shrugged. 

Did I?

“No,” he said finally. 

I nodded. To be honest, I’m not sure which answer I would’ve preferred. 

“Based on previous experience with you, I assumed that you would want them spared,” he said. I indeed tend to spare instead of killing. I spared the ghost, and I begged him not to kill the wizard*.* I was once again taken aback by how well he knew me. 

“But I will if you want me to. First thing tomorrow, they’ll be dead.” The intensity in his gaze made me look away. 

“No,” I whispered. “I just wanted to know.”

I finally allowed my eyes to close. 

“I would’ve been fine with either answer,” I added before I fell asleep. 

—————————

*Thud*

I was startled awake by something falling. 

I glanced around the room for a second, but nothing seemed to be out of place. I thought that I must’ve imagined it. Either way, I was glad that I’d awoken because the pressure on my bladder was intense, so I got out of bed to use the restroom. 

“So much for not sleeping,” I murmured, looking at the vampire whose head was resting on the desk. He was fast asleep. 

I giggled as I returned to the bed to grab my phone. I took several pictures of the vampire. Blackmail purposes and all that.

Also, that was going to be my new new phone background. 

I will forever be grateful that I decided to take that picture. Not because it is bound to provide an eternity of humor, but because, as I was adjusting it to better fit my screen, my eyes locked on a red feather-like blob jutting out of his neck. 

Once, when I was twelve, my parents allowed me to go to my first birthday party ever. 

The birthday girl received a dartboard with real darts as a present from her uncle. Unaware of how sharp they were, her mother shooed us away to the girl’s bedroom so that the parents could have some alone time. 

In there, we all took turns shooting at the board. However, when it was the birthday girl’s turn, one of the other kids ran to grab her dart at the same moment the girl threw hers. 

It struck her right in the neck. I’ll always remember that day. There was so much blood because we were stupid kids, and someone instructed her to take it out as soon as possible. (She’s ok now, don’t worry.)

But, for the minute before she did it, and from the angle that I was at, the dart had looked exactly like what was sticking out of Lucien’s neck. 

My eyes widened, and I stopped breathing. I pressed my ear against the door, listening for any sound. For any proof that we weren’t alone in the room. 

I heard some rustling, and hoping that it was Lucien coming to, I peeked through the keyhole. 

But it wasn’t Lucien on the other side. It was one of the men from the restaurant. In his hand, he held a cup with a stake submerged in some sort of transparent liquid.

I didn’t give myself time to think. Instinct took over, and I grabbed the first thing within reach.

With a sharp tug, the towel rack tore free from the wall.

I didn’t let myself think about how I’d been able to do that either.

I threw the door open, and the attacker swung his head toward me. He clearly hadn’t expected me come barreling barreling at him, because his steps faltered. 

I swung the towel rack, and it connected with his arm. He grunted in pain as the cup fell and shattered on the floor, splashing its contents all over the room.

The hunter stumbled back, clutching his side, but he didn’t allow the hit to incapacitate him for long. He lunged at me with a snarl, and all I could do was brace for impact. 

My arm was raised, ready to strike him again with the rack, but he was able to dodge. His head made impact with my stomach, and I was pushed against the wall. The air left my lungs, and at the same time, the blow that was meant for his head connected with the wall instead. 

I gasped. The wall, made of brick and not wood, caved in, and the towel rack broke in half. 

I wanted to marvel at my own strength—I’d never been so strong before—but the hunter noticed it too. 

“You filthy thing,” his nose turned up in disgust. “You’re one of them. And to think I was going to save you.”

The hatred in his tone felt like being stabbed, but I didn’t let it bother me. 

Trying to summon some of that strength from before, I pushed the hunter off me. He moved, but of his own volition, not from my nudge. Apparently, my strength had a mind of its own. 

He dove for the stake, fallen on the ground. I managed to get to it first, and I kicked it to the other side of the room as I ran to Lucien. 

I sighed in relief when I saw that he was still breathing. 

I turned my head slightly to the side, seeing that the hunter had been able to grab the stake. 

Panic swelled in my chest. Without a second thought, I pulled the dart out of Lucien’s neck. Not waiting to see if it had had any effects, I charged straight at the hunter. 

The stake incrusted into my arm, but I couldn’t feel the pain. Adrenaline had taken hold of my body. 

The hunter grunted in frustration as he tore it free. He looked confused, his gaze drifting between my injured arm and the stake in his hand. I used that against him by pushing him to the door. 

He regained his senses then and tried to block me, but I got the weird strength back, and instead of being forced back, I pushed harder. We crashed into the door, and it instantly shattered under the force. 

We found ourselves sprawled on the floor, swimming in splintered wood and debris. 

I hit my head pretty hard on the floor, and my vision blurred. When I touched my scalp with my good hand, my fingers came away wet with blood.

I tried to get up, but the whole world tilted. It was hard to keep my eyes open. 

“I’m going to enjoy this.” The hunter’s putrid breath hit my nostrils. He had climbed on top of me, and through my blurred vision, I saw his sadistic smile. 

I thrashed against his hold, but once again, the strength had left me. 

I was in pain, concussed, and worst of all, I was about to die, knowing that Lucien would be next. 

“Let’s see…” he murmured. 

He pinned my good arm above my head and pressed the sharp tip of the stake against my skin, dragging it slowly downward. I screamed as pain ripped through me. 

Why was nobody hearing us? The hotel was full. 

“Odd,” he said, almost to himself. “You’re not a vampire after all.”

Did that mean that he was going to let me go after all?

“Oh well,” he shrugged. 

The last thing I saw was his arm lifting, the stake angled toward my heart as it plunged down for the kill.

In a last, desperate effort to save my life, I kicked the hunter in the stomach. 

Only it was’t just a kick. The strength had returned at the best possible moment. 

Suddenly, nobody was pinning me down anymore. The wooden railing of the staircase snapped, and down went the hunter. 

He fell three stories, and a sickening thud could be heard when his body made impact with the ground. 

I didn’t even get the chance to catch my breath before tiny prickles assaulted my body. Similar to the static I felt when going into the in-between, but stronger. Painful. 

I screamed in pain, thrashing. 

*Is it the concussion?* I thought. *Am I really going to die after everything?*

Lucien roared as the pricks faded away. He was by my side in an instant, looking around for the cause of all this.

I was glad he was awake. 

He frantically moved my body, looking for the source of all the blood. 

But all of my injuries had healed. My muscles were sore, but the wounds were gone. 

Even the concussion seemed to have disappeared.

Once I was up on my own two feet, and I told him what happened, Lucien disappeared in a blur down the stairs and was back less than a second later. 

“He’s dead,” he murmured through gritted teeth. “Grab your things, we’re leaving.”

That was, plain and simple, an order. I wanted to refuse on principle, but the way he clenched his fists gave me pause. I’d never seen him so angry. 

No, actually, I had. When he was dealing with Silas. 

So, although his anger was not directed at me, I complied. 

I grabbed my phone and his jacket and ran to catch up with him. 

Once we’d made it to the bottom floor, every single person there was asleep. Some on the floor, some on tables, and others even on top of one another. It looked like the aftermath of the apocalypse. 

Lucien explained that this is what hunters do. They fill the vents with some kind of gas to incapacitate all humans before they go kill the vampires. 

Afterwards, Lucien stole a car, and we left the hotel immediately, resuming our journey back to Anchorage. 

“Fuck!” He slammed the steering wheel. I flinched. “I should’ve done this the minute we were stranded!” He growled. 

I pressed myself into the seat of the car. 

“Are you ok?” He asked, more softly. 

I just nodded. I wasn’t sure. 

I’d killed a man. A human man. At first, I’d assumed that it was a vampire-human hybrid, like Roger said most hunters were. But Lucien confirmed that this one was fully human. 

More than likely, the apprentice of the other man I’d seen at the restaurant. And he was nowhere to be found. 

And I know that it was in self-defense, but this was the first time I’ve ever killed a human. 

Lucien laughed.

“Remind me to never piss you off,” he teased. 

I laughed too, despite myself. Laughing is excellent at releasing tension. 

“I will.”

I bit my lip. I was still shaking as Lucien sped through the highway. We were still quite a few hours away from the diner.  

“At least you owe me now,” I said, forcing a smile. 

“Hah!” He laughed, side-eying me. But, at least, most of his anger had melted into amusement. “Fine, you fiend. I owe you.”

I didn’t like the way he said it one bit. What I liked even less than that was the mischievous smile on his face.

He went quiet again, and I decided that it was best not push. Instead, I entertained myself by digging my nails into my skin. Every so often, I would draw some blood, but all wounds I inflicted on myself disappeared less than two seconds later. 

One thing was clear as day. I was a little bit less human than I’d woken up that morning. 

Sometime into the first hour of the drive, I became fed up with Lucien. He had been sniffing the air in the car in periodic intervals since we’d left the hotel. 

“What the hell are you doing?” I asked. 

He grimaced. “I was hoping you wouldn’t notice.”

I knew a deflection when I saw one. “I did notice.”

His expression became tortured. “Your smell isn’t fading away,” he admitted. 

“What?”

“You changed again, like you did in that clearing,” he said. Of course, I already knew that. “And this time, your smell isn’t going away. You still smell like yourself, but the inhuman edge is… constant now.”

I groaned. So much for keeping my identity a secret. 

“Great,” I said as the first tear slid down my face. 

I don’t typically cry in front of people, but I couldn’t help it. 

I cried because I was still shaken from the incident. 

I cried because I still hadn’t gotten to know myself before I changed again. 

I cried because I didn’t know what I was. 

I cried because when the only people who knew about me were my closest friends, I could pretend that I was still human. 

I cried because I realized why I was changing. 

Maybe the wizard was right when he said that I was a risk to them all. 

Lucien just drove. He took my hand and kept his eyes on the road, saying nothing. The comforting gesture was probably because of the protectiveness triggered by my blood, I reasoned.

We arrived home early in the morning. Linda was just starting her shift. 

Lucien tried to stop me from entering, most likely thinking that maybe I hadn’t realized who would be on the other side. But I had. I didn’t care anymore; I knew that everybody was bound to know soon enough. I couldn’t hide my smell from a town full of inhumans. 

The customers stared at us as we came from behind the jukebox, but one look from Lucien had them all minding their own business. Maybe I did like having a prince as my protector after all.

I was expecting to see surprise in Linda’s eyes, but I didn’t. 

She was waiting for me with a cup of hot cocoa in front of her. 

“I thought you may need this, dear,” she pushed the cup to me and then poured Lucien some blood. I didn’t miss how it was AB+ instead of O-.

“How did you know?” I asked. 

“My essence is tied to the in-between, darling.” She also put a pastry in front of me. “I’m interconnected to this portal, and the one in Barcelona,” she smiled knowingly. “No one can go through them without my knowing.”

“So you’ve known all along?” Lucien snapped. 

Linda glared at him and kept addressing me. “Yes, dear. I was just waiting for you to come to me.”

“Thank you.”

Linda grabbed my hand in a comforting gesture. 

“Now, take this one home.” This time, she was talking to Lucien. “She needs to rest.” She turned to me then. “And don’t worry about tonight, dear. I’ve found a replacement for me at the other diner, so I’ll take your shift.”

At least Roger was off the hook. 

Then, Lucien walked me home in silence. This time, it was me who didn’t want to talk. 

Once I was in my room, I slept for over twenty-four hours, leaving Lucien to explain to Roger what had happened. 

But there was something he couldn’t explain. Something only I knew deep down. 

The reason I kept changing.  

The first time, I changed after killing the faerie. 

Now, I changed after killing the hunter. 

As some people say, coincidences don’t exist. Not when they’re so on the nose. 

I changed because I’m a killer. 

How could I be anything but a monster when killing is what makes me stronger?

How long until I become power hungry, like so many other people before me? 

How long until that thirst for power turns me into a murderer?
