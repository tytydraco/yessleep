(tw:a bit of gore/child death)

If you live in the south west part of Krasnoyarsk,Russia, be warned something is on the loose.

I am spending my last moments typing this message so I could die a hero atleast.How did I get here you wonder? 

I was on an ordinary day at school. Day starts at 9AM so I wasn't very awake in the class.

At around 12 is when hellfire broke. The powerplant near my city (which is  nuclear-powered ) had a fire. Nothing much,we still continued. 

At 13 PM was history class. The teacher was talking about the cold war . I took a look at the smoke and it was alot. I received a note by my classmate Vlad 

"Do you think we will be dismissed early today?"
"Yes,I do. Dumb to let us be sitting ducks and stuck here" I wrote and gave it back to him.

The teacher saw us exchanging notes and he approached us but as soon as he got near us,the power went off.
He looked annoyed at me and Vlad and he scolded us for not paying attention. Pretty typical  teacher moment...

After that we stayed in silence looking at the fire of the powerplant. After a good 20 minutes of waiting for the power the teacher sent me and Vlad to tell the principal about the power cut off

As me and Vlad were going down the dark hallway, we noticed the classroom near us was empty and locked but, the window was open.
Just as I looked at the classroom Vlad told me 

"Dude be careful,there is vomit on the floor" I looked down and there it was, someone puked . I got scared and started running to my classroom until I saw everyone in my classroom was hiding in a corner

"Mother of Chrsit" I heard Vlad tell himself.
I turned and saw what he saw.  Door smashed open. Windows painted with the blood of the 5th graders. Vlad ran to the principal and I followed. 

The principal was hiding ,tears in his eyes. Outside there was only a fog that was formed of the smoke cloud. I was lost in the horrific view. I saw an 8th grader, named Kurt , with vomit all over himself get stabbed by something from the smog. I saw his guts spray onto the window, as his eyes looked in horror and guided me to run.

Next second I knew,what was in the dark started screeching and scratching the windows,making a horrible noise. I lost Vlad but I could hear him running. He entered the classroom opposite of mine (the chemistry lab) and all I could hear was the tables screeching the floor boards as he positioned them to block the door. I locked myself in the other classroom. Jumping over the dead bodies of my classmates. 

I hid in the trash bin,where I will die. The putrid smell should hide me of whatever is there.

I am sending this message via the laptop. I set up a macro that will upload this post as soon as the power comes back. I hope my phone battery will be enough to charge it till power comes back on.

If you are near Krasnoyarsk , leave to another country.
