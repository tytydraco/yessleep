 **Day 12**

I’m losing track of time. I don’t know if that’s a blessing or a curse anymore. It doesn’t feel real anymore. Nothing feels real.

I woke up today, but I’m not sure I actually woke up at all. I could hear the hum of the engines before I even opened my eyes, reverberating through the walls like a heartbeat. I used to think the noise was coming from outside—just the convoy, passing through again. 

There’s no escaping it.

And if I’m being honest, I think I’m starting to forget who I was. I know I had a name, at least, I think I did. But it's slipping away from me, piece by piece. Sometimes I wonder if I ever really had one. Sometimes I wonder if I’m already dead. This town is draining my soul.

This town is draining my soul, and it is quieter than ever. The streets are empty, even during the day. The houses all look the same, and their windows are always shut tight. No one talks anymore, not that they ever did, but now... now, it’s worse. They just move through their routines, eyes hollow and distant, like they’re not even alive. Like they’re robots pretending to be human…

**Day 15**

The past few days have been relatively peaceful. I still hear the hums of the SUV's always creeping up my street at exactly 2:45 AM which at this point isn't unusual to me anymore. However today was very different. I went to the local post office to drop off a package that I wanted delivered and after I was finished, I walked back outside and saw a woman standing next to this stop-sign across the street. My house was a few blocks past her, so I went on my way. 

As I walked past her, I gave her a little smile and said, "how you doing?" in a quiet tone as a friendly gesture. She didn’t reply at first, but just proceeded to stare at me, her eyes wide open and her face shadowed by her sun hat. I’d never seen her before, but something in her eyes was different—alive, almost. She clearly wasn’t like everyone else who lived in this God-forsaken town cause in general,  she didn’t even look like she belonged here. She had this...knowing look, like she was aware of the rules, but had stopped obeying them long ago.

I tried to act normal, to keep walking like I hadn’t seen her, but she proceeded to walk with me down the street anyway, her feet making no sound on the asphalt. I froze when she placed herself right in front of me.

“You need to leave,” she said, her voice low but urgent. “It’s not safe here anymore. You’re not like them. You still remember who you are.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. I don’t know why, but the words felt... wrong, like they didn’t belong in this place. Like they didn’t belong in me.

“You have to leave,” she repeated, her eyes scanning the street, almost nervously. “Before the patrol comes back. They don’t forget. And once you’re on their list... it’s too late.”

I wanted to ask her who she was, why she knew so much, but the words didn’t come. There was something about her that made me feel... dangerous. Like being near her was a risk. She stepped back, her eyes flickering toward the stop-sign again.

“Don’t wait too long,” she whispered, almost to herself.

“They’ll come for you when you least expect it.”

 She turned and walked away, disappearing into the alleyway of the street. I stood there for a long time, staring at the empty street. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t just trying to help me. She was trying to warn me.

**Day 20** 

I’ve seen it now. What happens to the ones who try to escape this town.

It was just past 3 AM, the quietest time of night when the world itself seems to hold its breath, waiting for something to break the silence. I had just settled into bed, the hum of the engines still vibrating through the walls, when I saw movement out of the corner of my eye through my window and across the street. A family—husband, wife, and two kids, all hurriedly packing their car, their movements frantic, as if they were running out of time.

I watched from my window, unable to move, unable to stop them.

They were trying to get away. I could see it in the way the father’s hands shook as he slammed the trunk closed, the way the mother kept looking nervously down the street, like she was waiting for something. Or someone. She looked familiar though, it was hard to recognize at first since she was hidden in the night's darkness but when she went under the light pole, revealing herself under its shine, I realized who it was. It was the same woman who I saw when I was leaving the post office. My blood turned ice cold.

I knew what they were trying to do. They thought they could outrun the patrol. They thought they could leave before the convoy came.

But they were wrong.

The father started the car, its engine coughing to life in the dead of night, the sound so loud that it seemed to echo through the silent streets. The kids, too young to understand the full weight of the moment, were silent in the backseat, their eyes wide as they stared out the windows. I could feel their desperation from where I stood. I could see it in every movement.

They were almost out of the driveway when the headlights flickered. 

That was when it happened...

A single black SUV rolled into view, its headlights casting a cold, sterile light across the street. At first, the family didn’t notice it. They were focused on the road ahead, thinking they could get away, thinking they had a chance. But I knew. I could feel it in the air. The SUV wasn’t just passing by.

I saw the woman’s head snap toward the vehicle, her eyes widening in fear as she recognized the convoy. But It was too late. They’d already been seen. The SUV didn’t stop. It just followed them—slow, patient, like it was waiting.

I heard the mother's voice through the window as she shouted to her husband, urging him to drive faster, to hurry up. But it was no use. The convoy wasn’t going to let them leave. The streetlights flickered. The hum of the engines grew louder, almost deafening, as the convoy increased its speed. It was coming closer now, closing in on them.

The mother began to cry, her hand clutching the dashboard in panic. The children in the backseat started to scream, terrified, not understanding why their parents were so afraid.

The car was still speeding down the street when another SUV appeared, cutting off their path. The father slammed on the brakes, the tires screeching as he tried to stop in time. But it was no use. The second vehicle blocked them completely, trapping them in the street.

The convoy surrounded them, three black SUVs now, their engines humming in perfect synchronization.

I could feel the weight of their presence before the doors even opened.

They weren’t here to talk...

The soldiers emerged from the SUVs, their dark uniforms blending in with the shadows. They moved with precision, calm and methodical, like they had done this countless times before. The father, shaking, opened his door, trying to explain—trying to beg for a chance to leave. But the soldiers didn’t listen. They didn’t need to. In a single, smooth motion, the soldiers were on them, pulling the family from their car. The children screamed as they were torn from their parents' arms, their cries echoing in the night. The mother collapsed to the ground, sobbing, as the father was shoved to his knees.

 I didn’t know what was happening next. I could feel the air grow thick with something I couldn’t explain—something I had felt before but never understood. The patrol wasn’t just here to stop them. 

They were here to make an example out of them.

A cold chill ran down my spine as I realized what I was witnessing.

One of the soldiers turned to the others, as if giving some silent order. Then, without another word, the soldier lifted the father off the ground, and the mother’s sobs grew louder, more frantic. The children were pulled away, their terrified faces now ghostly pail. It happened quickly. Too quickly.

I could hear the voice of the soldier, cold and unfeeling, speaking to the father:  
"You were warned. You broke the rules."

And then, they took them.

They didn’t leave evidence behind. They didn’t even leave footprints. The family just... vanished, like they had never existed. The SUVs drove off, leaving the street as silent as before, except for the hum of the engines, which still echoed in my ears.

**Day 21**

I couldn’t shake the images of the family—their faces etched in terror, their futile attempts to outrun the convoy. The way they were dragged back into the night, as if they were nothing more than shadows themselves.

I had to talk to someone. I had to ask questions. Questions that had been gnawing at me since I first arrived in this place.

So, I went to Tom’s house.

The porch was the same as always—quiet, perfectly kept. I knocked on the door, and it creaked open almost immediately. Tom stood in the frame, his eyes shadowed, his smile tight but polite. I noticed then that he had no real surprise in his expression, as if he had known I would come. The air felt thicker than usual, heavier. I didn’t waste time.

“Tom,” I started, trying to steady my voice.

“I saw it last night. A family. They tried to escape. I saw them, just like I saw you... with the convoy...”

His gaze flickered, but the mask was quick to return.

“I know.”

“You know?” I was starting to feel that familiar chill again, the feeling that everything around me was an illusion, even the people.

“Nothing escapes the patrol,” he said, his voice flat. “They’ve been here for longer than you realize. They don’t let anyone—no one—break the rules. They ensure... order.”

The words stung, but I pushed on.

“What happens to people who try to leave? To those who—who fight the patrol? What do they do with them?”

Tom paused, his eyes narrowing slightly.

“You already know the answer to that, don’t you? They disappear. Or worse.”

I wanted to scream, to ask him why, but I held it back.

“Is it worth it?” I finally managed. “Staying loyal to the patrol? Is it worth them getting what they want? Is it worth seeing… seeing that happen to those families? Watching innocent people get... dragged away? Is that your way of keeping us safe?”

Tom’s expression softened, but not in a way that comforted me. More like someone who had long ago accepted a grim truth. “You don’t understand,” he said, his voice lowering. “The patrol isn’t just... enforcement. They don’t just keep order. They are the price we pay to keep the town... in balance. They are the system. Without them, none of us would be safe. You can’t fight it, not without consequences. But if you fall in line—if you accept it—there are... rewards.”

The words hit me like a slap, and I stepped back instinctively. “What do you mean, rewards?” The question was on my lips before I could stop it.

Tom’s gaze flickered for a moment, just long enough for me to see something shift behind his eyes. There was no fear in his voice when he spoke, only a strange, practiced calmness.

“Loyalty to the patrol guarantees... certain privileges. Comfort. Protection. You get to keep what you have. Your house. Your life.”

It was then that the cold realization sunk in—Tom wasn’t just some old man trying to warn me about breaking rules. He was part of the system. He was loyal to it. He had been rewarded for his fucking loyalty. He was complicit.

That word hung in the air between us: complicit.

I swallowed, my mind racing. “So, you... you work for them?”

Tom didn’t flinch. Didn’t blink. He met my eyes, and, for a brief moment, the truth spilled out like a confession. “I do what’s necessary. What needs to be done to keep the balance. The patrol... they protect us. They protect the town.”

I couldn’t find the words. I wanted to shout at him, ask him why he’d chosen this life, why he had turned into this cold shell of a person. But all I could do was stand there, frozen, as he went on, his voice methodical, almost rehearsed.

“Don’t fight them,” he continued, his voice softer now. “The price of defiance... is always too high. Everyone who tries to break free... they pay the price. And when you’ve paid enough, you’ll understand why it’s better this way.”

“Paid enough?” The words tasted bitter in my mouth. “Like that family last night? They were paying the price?”

Tom’s expression didn’t change, but something in his eyes flickered for just a moment. “They made a choice,” he said, his voice almost a whisper, too quiet to be fully trusted. “A... bad choice.”

A weighty pause hung in the air, and I could feel something else behind his words, something darker.

“What do you mean?” I pressed, the unease crawling up my spine.

Tom’s lips twitched upward, but it was no longer a friendly smile—it was something more calculating. “There are... ways to prevent the patrol from acting, if you’re careful. If you know how to make the right decisions. Sometimes, it’s about knowing which plans will make it... easier for them to find what they’re looking for.”

I stared at him, realizing what he was suggesting. That family had tried to escape, but someone had to have tipped the patrol off. Someone had to have known their plan.

And Tom, in his quiet, methodical way, had just confirmed it.

I recoiled slightly, a sick feeling creeping up my throat. “You... you sold them out?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Tom didn’t deny it. Instead, his eyes met mine, and for the briefest moment, I saw something I hadn’t seen before—something cold but resigned.

“It’s what needed to be done,” he said, his voice too calm, too practiced. “They were never going to make it. But if I hadn’t made sure they were found... the patrol would’ve made it worse. They don’t take kindly to... unsanctioned movements.”

I staggered back, disgust mixing with disbelief. "And you think that's fucking justified? You think that's the right thing to do?"

Tom didn’t answer immediately. He just stared at me, his gaze unwavering. Finally, he spoke, but his words were like a warning, something meant to settle my mind. “Survival isn’t about being right. It’s about knowing what’s necessary.” He paused, adding softly, almost like a final thought: “Everyone who survives learns that lesson eventually.”

I stood there, my head spinning, my thoughts a whirlwind of anger and confusion. Tom wasn’t just a part of the system; he was the system. And the more I spoke to him, the more I realized just how deep that loyalty ran. He had sold out that family—had helped the patrol drag them away—and would do the same again if it meant keeping his own place secure.

“Don’t ever forget that,” he added as I turned to leave. “It’s never too late to make the right choice. And that... is your reward.”
