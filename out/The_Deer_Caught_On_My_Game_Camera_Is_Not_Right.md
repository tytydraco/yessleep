I’m an avid hunter and tracker. I love to get outdoors and explore, shed hunt for antlers or just hike around to view wildlife. I live in the Rocky Mountains In southwest Montana. So the forest are endless and the wildlife are abundant. 

Recently, I’ve purchased 5 new game cameras, to scope out around my property. These cameras catch anything and are superior to other brands out. I own around 20 acres of forest land with a nice little creek running through it. I put them all the way around the property to see anything and everything.

Within a week I checked them. To my surprise I had photos of a wide variety of wildlife on there from porcupines, to coyotes, to deer, and even a cougar passing through. I never would have imagined I had so much going on throughout the property. 

The next week was strange, as my cameras had taken 100’s of photos but nothing was on them. As I kept browsing through the photos something unnatural caught my eye, far off in the distance in the last few photos I could see what looked like a deer, but it was not just any normal deer. The fricken thing was standing upright on its two hind legs. And as the photos went on it appeared as if it walked like that across the whole view of the camera. 

Still blown away by what I had seen. I felt the need to investigate further so, I made a tree stand by the camera that caught that freakishly looking deer. After completion, I was all ready to go. Since the activity was between 2-3 am in the morning I went to the stand at dusk to get hunkered down and ready to find out what that was. 

The first night I stayed until dawn seeing nothing. But I heard some crazy noises like whispering and talking off in the distance. I felt it odd because my closest neighbors are two miles away. It sent chills down my spine but I remained sitting all night. 

Night two, nothing again until about 230am. Then I heard branches breaking like something was stomping through the woods off in the distance just outta range to be able to see with my night vision binoculars. I kept looking as the thumping noise was getting louder. Then I heard what sounded like a woman crying from the same direction as the branches were being broken. 

This really got me freaked out now, as the crying became louder and it sounded like she was begging for someone to help her. I couldn’t sit and just listen any longer. I then shouted out where are you? I’m here do you need assistance? 

I got down off my tree stand and started running in the direction of the woman’s crying, but it seemed as the closer I had gotten to her she remained at about the same distance ahead of me. I kept taking to her asking where are you? Are you hurt? And the same response help me please!! 

This went on for about 15 mins and I thought to myself what if this is some kind of trap. I’ve seen movies like this before. So I stopped and quickly turned around started jogging back the way I came. This is where things get disturbing as I was getting farther away from where I heard the crying and pleas for help. It was now getting closer to me as I was making my way back out of the woods. 

Now I’m scared shitless, I started sprinting towards the tree line to my property as it sounded like whatever that was, was right on my tail breaking branches and it sounded big. I could hear its feet hitting the ground thump,thump,thump,thump, I finally hit the tree line and no longer heard the cries or begging for help. 

In the opening I turned around just before reaching my house and back at the tree line I could see two glowing yellow eyes a dark silhouette of a figure of what appeared to be about 7-8 foot tall. Whatever it was just stood there staring right at me. Then I heard a low menacing growl. 

Terrified now I ran back into my house got out the AR15 locked and loaded , ready to blow that thing away, but as you would know it, it was gone. I walked back out to the tree line and I could hear low whispers and talking again like two people having a conversation. I knew better than to follow the sound of voices this time.

After owning the country property for 15 plus years I decided it was time to move closer to civilization for whatever was out there I definitely did not want to encounter it again. I don’t know what it was planning that night, but it was definitely sinister.
