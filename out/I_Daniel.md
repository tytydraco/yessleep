I was eight when I became a ghost, rising from the shallow grave where my stepfather had buried me in the woods behind our house. 

I was happy to be a ghost, because he couldn’t hurt me anymore. And I was sure I was dead. I remember the look on his face, his eyes glowing with murder as he struck out at me. I remember the flash of pain replacing all the fear and agony, and the blood rising in my mouth, and then utter blackness.  

So when I rose from my grave, and found myself alone in the woods, I knew I must be a ghost, and I wasn’t scared of going back to the house. But I stayed out of their way, letting myself in silently into the basement and hiding in a back alcove. 

Sometimes I would go up in the dead of night, poking around in the kitchen, and once I crept up to their bedroom and stood at the foot of their bed. My mother jerked out of sleep, sat up, stared at me, and then screamed and screamed. I fled back to my hidey hole in the basement. 

They left that house soon after and others came. But they didn’t stay long either. As much fun as it is to imagine haunted houses, it actually isn’t fun to live in one. And so families came and went, and I grew more forgetful about how living humans do things. 

I look back to those years as if in a dream now, my ghostly existence flitting through the house, the basement, and the woods. Time lost its meaning for me.  

Until Lily and her family came. Lily was often ill, and couldn’t get out and run around like others. I heard it whispered through the walls that she may not live much longer. I wondered if she would become a ghost like me, perhaps joining me in my basement home, creeping up to the kitchen and out into the woods every now and then. It wouldn’t be terrible to have a companion in the dark and dreary basement.  

So, despite what had happened those years ago, when my mother sat up in bed screaming and screaming, her mouth an open black hole of suffering and misery, I decided to visit Lily in the bedroom where she lay in bed. 

Late one night, I crept up to her room, and quietly laid my hand on the doorknob and swung it open. I heard Lily restlessly move, and then sit up.  

She stared at me in the dim night glow. I waited for her to scream. But she didn’t. Her face showed confusion rather than fear. She said quite clearly “I heard it was little boy who haunted this house. But you are a young man.” 

 

Nobody had spoken to me for so many years. I frowned, trying to understand her words.  

She spoke again. 

“Who are you?” she asked . 

I understood that one. “I am Daniel. A ghost”. It had been years since I had spoken, but the words were coming to me. I remembered becoming a ghost. 

Lily got out of bed, and walked towards me. “Daniel?” 

She reached out, took my wrist, and holding it tight, turned me to a large shimmering mirror against the wall. I saw myself, a lanky pale young man looking back at me. I was so confused.  

I turned back to Lily. Memories and futures started running through my mind.  

Lily said quietly “You’re not a ghost Daniel”. 

I can still remember the warmth of my tears on my cheeks as they squeezed out of my eyes. I closed my eyes briefly, remembering the time I thought I became a ghost, opening my eyes, seeing the flecks of blue-black night sky and stars through the loose earth over me. My hands, scrabbling through and pulling me out.

 I remembered the cool air on my face as I crawled out of my grave and started walking home, covered with dried blood. 

“You’re alive” said Lily, and I was, I was there in her room, looking into a mirror at myself, a young man. A car drove by outside, its bright lights shining into the room and lighting up my face.  

Lily sat me down next to her, on the edge of the bed. 

We began talking. 

And after that conversation was done, I never lived as a ghost again.
