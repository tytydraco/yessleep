I grew up in an old mining town. Once a bustling place full of opportunity and good old traditional values (at least, according to my parents), it had fallen on hard times. The place as I knew it was grey, soulless and deprived. Still, a sense of working class pride, bordering on a sort of inverse snobbery, remained about the place. Generations lived, worked and died in the town and outsiders were treated with heavy suspicion.

When Joanne arrived from her wealthy, middle class suburban town, she could not have been more out of place.

“Why don’t you jump back on your pony and go home?” the kids at school would say.

“I don’t have a pony,” she would reply.

But it didn’t matter. It didn’t matter that she didn’t have a pony. It didn’t matter that she appeared to be a perfectly nice girl. It didn’t matter that within weeks, her accent was indistinguishable from the rest of ours. She was different, and the kids at school had decided on who Joanne was the moment she arrived. Within six months of her arrival, Joanne was a complete social pariah and had become almost mute.

While I wasn’t an active participant in this bullying campaign, I did not defend her either. When people would taunt her on the bus, I would turn the other way and pretend to be temporarily deaf. I knew I was being a coward, but I was simply too selfish to take the hit for her. I wasn’t exactly popular myself - I had survived this long by flying under the radar. The brief pangs of guilt just weren’t enough for me to make a stand for her. I knew it was wrong, but Joanne was on her own. Or at least, she would have been.

The summer before returning to school, my family was caught up in a huge scandal. My father was found guilty of historic sex crimes. Overnight, my whole world collapsed around me. The crimes had been committed before my sister and I were born and before my mum had even met him. None of us could get our heads around it at all.

As if that wasn’t enough for a teenager to go through, I was expected to carry on with life and face a town full of people who had heard the news. I knew, before I even stepped foot back into school on that rainy September day, that I had been snatched from my cushy life as an invisible student and was about to be thrown to the wolves.

I would have understood if Joanne had taken immense pleasure in my suffering. If it was the other way around, I probably would have. After all she’d been through, the son of a sex offender would surely take the spotlight off her.

The few friends I had soon disappeared and I was bullied relentlessly. My mum considered changing my school but I declined. It wouldn’t have mattered. As far as I was concerned, I could have moved to Antarctica and the gossip would follow me there. No. The only way to survive was to put one foot in front of the other.

That’s not to say I handled it well. The bullying was bad but the fallout at home was worse. My mother was heartbroken. My sister was completely in denial. And I was torn about the grief I felt for the father who had not quite died but no longer really existed either. If it wasn’t for that Thursday when Joanne nodded me over to her table at lunch, I’m not sure I’d have survived at all.

I’d never had a best friend before. I mean, sure. I had once had friends at school. People I sat with at lunch and caught the bus with. But we never really talked much. Sometimes I would wonder if I stopped turning up one day, how long it would take for them to notice or whether they would even care at all.

With Joanne, it was different. I could talk to her about anything and she just seemed to understand. She had this way of really listening to every word you said.  Joanne was truthfully, the first person since my dad to seem interested in me at all.

She still barely spoke a word at school, but when we were alone she would tell me about her old school and how she missed it. Sometimes, her old accent would come out again and then she would cover her mouth with her hand as if something awful had come out of it. I never teased her - not even jokingly. I liked hearing it; it made me feel special.

“I have something to confess,” she said one day, her face turning serious suddenly. We were in the local park with some very cheap alcohol and I had been using all of my efforts until then to pretend that I was enjoying the feeling of spinning off the edge of the world.

“You can tell me anything,” I promised her.

“I did have a pony. Back home. His name was Nelson.” And suddenly we were both rolling around on the floor, roaring with laughter. I laughed until my belly hurt.

And then, in the way that often happens with alcohol, my laughs turned to sobs and I lay on the grass, suddenly feeling vulnerable. I cried because I missed my dad and I cried because I hated him. I cried because of the horrible plan I had been hatching - to move out after school and never see or speak to my mum and sister again. None of it was their fault, but it was all just too hard. Being around them was too hard. My dad was gone and I just wanted to be gone too.

She never judged, only comforted. And when I begged for forgiveness for not befriending her earlier, she told me there was nothing to forgive. She was a good person, and that day, lay on the ground, I vowed to be a better person too.

Maybe if I’d have become a better person sooner, a more intuitive person, a more selfless person, I may have noticed that she only ever occasionally spoke to me about her old home and her old friends and I knew very little about her current family life at all. Maybe if I’d have noticed and maybe if I’d helped somehow, everything would have been different.

There’s no denying the fact that Joanne was a bit… unusual. She wasn’t into make-up and boys like most of the girls at school. She was obsessed with the paranormal. Every weekend she would have me performing seances with her, or visiting haunted houses or pushing glasses around ouija boards. It wasn’t for the thrill of the scare and it wasn’t out of morbid curiosity. Joanne was convinced that the supernatural creatures that we cannot see are simply misunderstood, trapped on Earth against their will and she saw it as her duty to release them.

One day, she ‘confessed’ to me that she herself was a ghost. At first I laughed, and when it became clear from her face that it wasn’t a joke, I just shrugged and told her that it didn’t matter to me if she was a ghost or not. This non-response seemed to be enough for her and we continued as if she’d just told me she was a Saggitarius.

There was a nagging part at the back of my mind that was concerned about her mental health, but back then there only existed “crazy” and “not crazy” and I really didn’t want her to be crazy so I told myself that it was no big deal.

We never seemed to actually find anything on our ghost-hunting adventures. There were no creepy incidents that made me think that maybe she was right. The ouija board only ever spelled out nonsense and there wasn’t even a blown lightbulb or well-timed gust of wind to shake us up during the many seances. If Joanne was a ghost, she didn’t seem very adept at communicating with her own kind.

Still, it was something to keep us entertained and any time with Joanne was time I enjoyed.

My sister had been given a pair of walkie-talkies for Christmas with the caveat that she use them responsibly. My mum, who was also into the supernatural (albeit in more of a ‘let’s sprinkle some sage’ way than a ‘let’s go rescue a ghost from a tower’ way) was referring to walkie talkies apparently being a tool to converse with other planes of existence.  She had not been referring to (but maybe should have been) the possibility of my sister using them to "talk intimately" with the boy next door. They were soon confiscated and naturally,  I got up early and popped them in my bag before anyone else woke up.

Joanne described these walkie talkies as the best idea I ever had. We each took one home and decided that we would go and find somewhere the next day after school to test them out as a means of supernatural communication.

Except Joanne wasn’t in school the next day. Or the day after. Rumours flew around the school, each one more far fetched than the last. By Friday, I had been informed with complete certainty that Joanne had been hit by a truck, been kidnapped by a cult, and had gone off to live with the royal family.

Nobody would answer what was actually going on, and I was out of my mind with worry. I had never actually been to her house, as she always preferred to come to mine, but I knew roughly where it was and so went there several times after school. The curtains were always drawn and nobody ever answered the door.

Every night, I spoke into my walkie talkie in the desperate hope that she would answer back. It was useless. I knew that wherever she was, she was well out of range, but I couldn’t help but try.

It was almost a month before I got any answers. A boy at school said he saw Joanne’s home being searched by the police, who found evidence of “satanic rituals”. It all seemed a bit silly to me, and I didn’t see why it was anyone else’s business if Joanne’s parents were drawing pentagrams on the floor or worshipping goats or whatever people like that did. Why did that mean they had to leave?

It took me a long time to get the information, to understand it and to accept that it had been happening right under my nose. Joanne was being abused by her family. They had involved her in "rituals" that a judge would later go on to describe as “monstrous”, “sickening” and “unforgivable.”

I never saw Joanne again. My mum told me she had probably been taken into care or gone to live back in her hometown with her other family members. Nobody had any answers that weren’t just a polite way of telling me to drop it. In fact, my mum seemed downright angry when I brought it up, as if she thought me so delicate that simply hearing about it would upset me. None of these people seemed to care that Joanne was the one who had to actually live through it.

At night, I’d remember things she said to me in passing and my mind strained and twisted itself into knots, trying to figure out if they were relevant or not. A lost cat, a special birthday, a family trip. I was tormented with intrusive thoughts, that maybe if I’d asked more questions, pried harder, cared more, then I could have saved her from it.

The school counsellor they eventually brought in after I became “violent and unpredictable” said that maybe Joanne thought she was a ghost because she wanted to be a ghost, to be invisible and hide from her family and what they were doing to her. Maybe she was trying to rescue the other ghosts as a way of rescuing herself. I guess it made sense, but it didn’t help the guilt and it didn’t take the pain away.

I tell you all of this to explain why, all of these years later, the letter I received in the post was quite unexpected indeed.

“Promises made and promises broke,

Reunited by the crooked old oak,

Adults as children, we’ll meet once more,

Friends forever, the three of us swore.”

I’d forgotten she’d been into writing poetry.

Underneath the rhyme were the date and time that all those years ago, we had agreed to meet for a reunion. No matter where our lives ended up, no matter if we had grown apart, no matter how long we hadn’t talked. We would meet up by the tree.

It didn’t make sense. I’d tried looking her up online over the years and had never found a trace of her. She had no way of knowing my current address. Yet the handwriting in front of me was undeniably the neat, careful penmanship of Joanne.

\*

I wasn’t going to go. Of course I wasn’t. I mean, was I really going to drive all the way back to my hometown after all these years to go and stand near an oak tree in the park? It would be insane.

In fact, as I ruminated on it more, I felt kind of angry. If Joanne was indeed the one who sent it, then what was she thinking? Why wouldn’t she have contacted me once over all these years to tell me she was okay? Did she not care about how worried I’d been back then? Had she not missed me at all? My mind jumped backwards and forwards all evening.

That may have been the end of it if it hadn’t been for that damn walkie talkie. I honestly don’t know why I kept it. I had parted easily with the rest of my childhood possessions, throwing them away when I fulfilled my promise to move out of my home and away from my family as soon as I was old enough. But the walkie talkie. Maybe it was a way of remembering Joanne, or of remembering my childhood. Or maybe some crazy, desperate part of me believed that somehow I’d hear her voice through it one day.

It was just a giggle at first. I thought I was dreaming, except my dreams could never conjure her voice so clearly, as the memory had faded with time.

Then it was a soft whisper, breathing just my name. Once. Twice. Three times.

It had that static-y walkie talkie sound, but it was still very clearly her.

*Joanne?*

“Can you hear me? Over!” and a giggle.

*There’s no batteries in the walkie talkie. I must be dreaming.*

“Testing. 1, 2, 3.”

*The battery has been flat for years.*

“You’re supposed to call me Roger. Ha. Ha.”

*You’re asleep. You must be.*

“A promise is a promise.”

*Wake up.*

“Friends forever, back together.”

*Wake the fuck up.*

As my eyes shot open, my heart pounded in my chest. I don’t know how long I waited. I know that I have never been so terrified. I know that the next morning, I took a hammer to that walkie talkie. And I know that hearing that ear-piercing static scream as I smashed the walkie talkie to smithereens was what convinced me that I had no other choice but to drive back to my goddamn hometown to that goddamn [oak tree.](https://www.reddit.com/r/viciousmock/comments/i5robb/list_of_stories/)
