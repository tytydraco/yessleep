I didn't want to be in this situation, it's all Sam's fault. I told him we shouldn't have gone in there, we shouldn't have explored the basement. But he just had to provoke that thing. He just had to do it...

It was just after my 24th birthday when Sam got this Ghost Hunting itch. He had been watching videos on YouTube of some group of people exploring haunted locations, and wanted to try. Aaron and I weren't too keen on it, but Sam insisted. He wanted to share his results with that stupid group.

He decided he wanted his first experience to be at what everyone calls Hell Hall. It's this large manor on the outskirts of town, over 3 centuries old. Everyone says it's cursed and to stay away, but Sam was never the type to listen. He bought some cameras and other equipment, then dragged Aaron and I to that godforsaken property. 

We wandered around the empty, dark halls with minimal activity. Ending up in the cellar, Sam was sweeping his flashlight back and forth. I was the one to see it, the pinpoint-thick glowing eyes from the far end of the room. The moment I saw it, I froze. It didn't take long for Sam and Aaron to see it too, and we all sprinted out of there.

When we got back to the car, we took off. Aaron was unusually quiet, and I was shaking in the passenger seat. It didn't take long for us to get back to his house, and that's when Sam told us he had caught it on camera. He seemed a bit too excited by it.

Over the next few weeks, things seemed to be fine. Sam showed two girls we had graduated with, but that was the last of it. At least, until a month after.

Nicole was the first person to fall victim. She went missing without a trace after Sam showed her the video. No one had any idea what had happened, not even her fianc√©. When her body was finally found, they said her stomach had been ripped open and her organs removed.

Hailey was taken 2 weeks after. Her boss called for a wellness check when she didn't show up to work. Police arrived and found her in her living room, covered in blood and organless.

Aaron disappeared on a hunting trip 2 weeks after that. He was the only one on the trip and never came home. His body hasn't been found yet, but I'm almost certain he would look like Nicole and Hailey.

Sam died 2 weeks ago. They found his car wrapped around a tree, and his body several feet away. He was hanging on a tree branch from his empty chest cavity.

I know I'm next. It's been exactly 2 weeks since Sam died, and I'm the last of us. Night has set, so I know I don't have much time left. We should have never gone to that house. It's fucking cursed. 

Oh God, I see it.
