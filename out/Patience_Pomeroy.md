I never really understand the sentiments behind the things I unearth from my Grandpa’s archive.

Sometimes I try and take the odd tape here and there to the pigs down at the police department in South Charleston, but they never listen.

One time I even found our joke of a Governor’s address and handed the tape to him directly as he was leaving for work with my email attached. (I’ll leave it in the description in case anyone would like to send the bastard a pipe bomb on my behalf)

Of course, by that point I came off far too unhinged to get any sort of message back, I’m not even sure if he ended up watching it.

Knowing politicians, the chances were slim to none he’d do something about it regardless.

Who knows? Maybe I got lucky and I’m on some kind of watch list now, maybe one day the FBI will bust down my door and confiscate my grandfather’s collection before I have the chance to taint my mind with it any farther.

They’re far more likely to play dying_horses.mp3 outside my house and drive a tank over his grave as it all goes up in flames, but I’m holding out hope.

I’ve never invited a friend over to watch one of these with me, and certainly not my partner, as far as my personal life goes, The Archive is my best kept secret.

One held so close to my chest I’m counting down the seconds until my ribs finally collapse under the pressure it inflicts on me day after God forsaken day.

Today however, I’m sharing it with the world.

I haven’t watched this series of tapes yet, and I hardly care to now, but everything I’ve seen so far has festered in my mind so long that it can’t amount to much more than the rotten stew of trauma and vomit that coats my arteries even as I transcribe my thoughts to you now.

Just one more marathon…

One last sprint to the finish line, the reality where maybe someone finally hears my desperate cries for help and does something about it, or the one where I crack under the pressure and finally fall apart for someone to find days later when I start to rot on the outside just as much as my innards have the past 3 years I’ve wasted watching The Archives nuggets of hidden wisdom.

This is the last series in my grandpa’s collection of tapes, and my last call the pathetic suicide hotline I’ve made of reddit the last few weeks.

As I touch this tape and let its magnetic strips pierce my skin and stitch themselves all the way up my arm, across my neck, and behind my eyes, digging into my optic nerve in a way I’m so used to it doesn’t even hurt anymore, the last thoughts I’ll have for a while bubble to the surface of my consciousness.

My name is Alice Arkwright, and I only hope that by putting this out, that I don’t subject you to the years of suffering I’ve become oh so ever accustomed to.

As my body transcribes this unconscious thought with my free hand, entirely on auto-pilot, my left eye begins to glow an irradiated green as the tape feeds further into my brain and begins poking out the back of my skull.

My consciousness slips into the abyss once more, and my body stays behind, in the world I so often find myself slipping further and further away from…

————————

Valerie… That’s my name this time.

Or rather, the name of the person who’s body I’ve come to inhabit.

Her arms slink deep into a toolbox and pull out a disgustingly old camcorder.

They never tend to notice when I take the backseat of their minds, sometimes I think about what part of their brain I actually dwell within.

I decided on the amygdala, with no real rationale behind it other than when I was in these worlds depicted in the reflective brown tape as it makes impossibly tiny cuts across the inside of my skull, the feeling I experience most, is always that of abject terror…

Sometimes I feel an indent made by the tape in my brain when I come out of the trance, a hole carved by the friction it produces like a chainsaw would in a tree trunk, but short of popping my head open like a PEZ dispenser, there was no way to know for sure.

I watch as Valerie takes a chisel and begins hammering a hole into the cobblestone wall, big enough for her to wedge the camcorder inside.

I watch as she finagels her fingers into the hole, removing all the mold growing within, I’m glad she was wearing gloves…

Now that I get a good look, whatever hole she’s crawled into to do all this is caked in a thick layer of moss, mold, and cobwebs.

I can feel the sensation of the rubber shielding her fingers, the sweat pooling under her gas mask, the way her hands shake when she reaches for the camcorder again and she shoves it into the opening.

She runs a cord to the already heavily occupied power strip.

Nonetheless, she plugs the camcorder in, and plops her hammer and chisel back into the toolbox.

As she bends down to do so however, I notice that the floors are freshly waxed.

I do my best to get a good look at the room from Valerie’s perspective despite not being able to move her eyes like I would my own, and it seems we’re in a basement.

Halfway through renovation, at least by the looks of it.

Ugh, this was the most frustrating part of the process, trying to access the person’s memory.

It was entirely impossible for me, though I try every time purely out of habit.

I may not be able to see memories or recall information that isn’t my own—

Like father like daughter I guess… Valerie thinks to herself, staring down the lens of the camcorder as she removes its lens cap.

But I have the privilege of hearing their thoughts surface in real time, anything happening to her in the here and now is fair game.

Though, I can’t transfer thoughts to HER, I’m purely a passenger, these events have already transpired and I have no say in what plays out or how.

Valerie opens the door to the basement, finally allowing some light in, and that's when I see it—

Identical camcorders have been dug into the walls, crammed through every surface perceivable with the borrowed vision I’ve been permitted.

Okay… Valerie thinks, closing the door and walking up a nearby set of stairs.

Almost ready to start… This may be odd to say, but she didn’t sound PROUD of the hard days work I assume she just did.

The thought was uttered in her mind like it was an atrocity, something she should be terribly ashamed of.

I wish I had more time to mull it over in my head, but as I try, my thoughts are dragged back into nothing by Valerie’s unconscious thought, and I’m entirely snuffed from the narrative.

————————

I stare through Valerie’s eyes down at the notebook she’s doodling in.

I hate cuts in the edit, it’s always disorienting.

If you were to watch this tape from the outside, something I am unable to do, as every time I stuff the tape into a VCR the device very quickly disintegrates around the plastic hull keeping it’s contents safe, you’d likely find multiple cuts in one scene like there would be in a movie.

When grandpa was still alive, as painful as it is to think about, I’d watch him edit these tapes in real time.

They always seemed to have the amount of cuts you’d expect a normal film reel to have, but despite that, I only ever experience them as disorienting shifts from scene to scene where my stomach drops, and my mind is ground into sand only to defragment like a corrupted hard drive being resuscitated from the scrap heap.

Valerie’s eyes flick nervously to the security camera in the corner of her classroom, the one I assume my grandfather ripped the footage from to get this take.

I was never conscious in a room without a camera, that much was consistent across my jumps, as horrible as it is to say, the rules of these worlds were incredibly concise and easy for me to understand after spending so much time trapped inside them.

Sometimes I’d swear off visiting them, it never lasted more than a month.

You can release the prisoner from jail, but that doesn’t remove the conditioning the warden instilled.

It doesn’t make me want to come back and discover the hidden facets of other people’s unconscious thoughts any less.

If anything, it made me even more desperate to come crawling back.

I hate this about myself, but I won’t sit here and lie to those of you who care enough to listen and call myself a saint.

Valerie’s eyes flit back to her paper, and a drawing of someone sticks out to me.

The drawing is entirely in pencil, but remarkably detailed, it hurt me to my core as I watched Valerie tear it out of her notebook and crumple it up.

It felt like a part of her was being ripped out of her very soul and stuffed so deep between her innards that it’d never emerge again.

Valerie stands up, and begins her trek to the back of the classroom, where the woman in her drawing awaits.

Patience Pomeroy… Valerie’s voice echoes through my being like a supersonic earthquake, the atoms making up my essence begin to split as tiny explosions rain like a warzone across whatever would pass for my body at this point.

I feel Valerie’s jaw loosen as she calls out to the woman, every movement she makes causing my identity to scatter further and further across the ridges of her brain like a desert freeing itself from a tornado on death's door.

The last thing I see before my mind fails me once again, is Patience turning to look at Valerie.

————————

Before I know where I am or what Valerie has done, I hear something slink down a flimsy wooden staircase.

Valerie sends her foot careening into a metal door, I can feel the gas mask on her face again, but even more than that—

I feel the exhaustion brought on by the herculean task of dragging the exposed body of Patience Pomeroy into the basement.

I feel Valerie’s stream of consciousness seep into mine as her train of thought derails and turns mine into a heap of rending scrap metal.

How easily the needle containing the anesthetic slipped into Patience’s neck, how Valerie’s muscles screamed in agony under the weight of the woman’s limp body, the lingering anxiety Valerie felt worrying a a cop may pull her over and ruin everything.

The thoughts were fresh in her mind, therefore they were fresh in mine, it’s like someone’s shoving bits of a shattered mirror into different parts of my brain.

Each shard reflecting a different memory that I wasn’t there to experience and digging in deeper to drive the point home that I was very much an unwelcome visitor in this world.

Eventually, the visible surfaces would get so soaked in blood and sinew I’d no longer have the displeasure of seeing them, even in their horrendous fragmented state, I can feel them trying to dig deeper into my being, trying to claw their way back into the present, bring me back to my senses and take them with me.

I watch as Valerie ties Patience to the support beam in the center of the room by her waist, and feel her flop completely backwards onto the floor in exhaustion, subsequently snapping me out of my tortuous trance.

“Ughhhhh… Kidnapping is so harrrrd.” This was the first time I’d actually heard Valerie speak, even if it was muffled by the gas mask.

She sounded so young…

I could make out her voice well enough in her head, but it doesn’t have that same nuance you’d expect from the genuine article.

What would drive her to do this to someone? 

She has so much to live for, and she’s throwing it all away just to capture a classmate?

Valerie forces herself back on her feet, shuffling into a room I hadn’t previously noticed.

A side room in the basement, just a dingy little bathroom without a door.

The sink is full of packaged needles and the counter is covered in petri dishes with all sorts of subjects trapped inside.

Most importantly, she nabs a rot iron chain, dangling from a nearby mirror.

I did my best to catch a glimpse of Valerie, but with the gas mask and all, I wasn’t able to get a good look at her face.

She claps the collar at the end of her chain around Patiences neck, tugging on it a few times to test its durability.

That won’t do… Valerie thinks to herself, pulling out a drill and driving a rivet through the clasp holding the metal grip around her neck.

Satisfied this time, she ditches the drill, searching for something to mount the chain to, noticing a series of hooks toward the top of the support pillar.

Shit… She roots around in her toolbox until she finds a padlock looping it though the hook and subsequently through the chain.

8… 15… 81… I hear her think as she flits at the numbers below the lock.

If only Patience were the one hearing this instead of me…

The lock clicks in place, and Valerie unties her victim, satisfied that her prison is secure.

She stares at Patience as her body goes limp, the anesthetics haven’t worn off.

I feel Valerie’s throat close up as her stomach churns, she’s trying to prevent herself from vomiting, the stomach acid sears the walls of her esophagus as bile shoots to the surface only to be smothered by Valerie's iron will.

She stumbles out of the basement, and removes her gas mask once she’s sure the door is shut.

She spits into the woodwork below her poorly crafted patio, trying to wash the taste of guilt from her mouth without anything to filter it through.

She crumbles to a heap on the ground, burying her head in her hands.

Okay Valerie, calm down… She thinks in a poor attempt to soothe herself.

She crawls up the steps and curls up into the fetal position, watching the neighbors go about their days beyond the treeline.

It’s just like any of the other experiments so far. Her lip is trembling and I can feel the tears run down her face.

My consciousness begins to ripple, as if her tears added to my endless expanse, a drop of crude oil to pierce the surface of an already polluted ocean.

Just wait for her to wake up, and take things from there. Valerie rests her head against her knees, and lets the world slip away as much as she’s able. You have plenty of time.

I feel like I’m being drained, like my body is being pulled into a whirlpool and I’m being stretched across the universe like a strand of sugar in a cotton candy machine.

You’ll get through this. Valerie’s thoughts grow even quieter as they echo across the dwindling space in her mind I once inhabited.

In the distance, above Valerie, somewhere in the house, I hear something bang against a window.

A long drawn out groan bounces off the phlem coated walls of its throat, as it hunts down whatever's left of me to give me one last taste of what I’m unfortunately in store for.

You’ll get through this… Valerie promises herself one last time, as the being’s muffled screech fades from my senses, and is replaced with the sound of tape feeding across my still exposed eyeball.

The last slip of tape slips into my skull, dislodging itself from my eye and popping out of my head, the searing pain floods throughout my nervous system, only to subside just as quickly as it came to pass.

I took a second to get my bearings, the dissociation caused by this alone was enough to send me reeling for days on end.

I have no idea when I’ll be ready to watch the rest of these… 

Straight out of the experience it’s really tempting to keep going, the pain is horrible but experiencing the world through someone else’s eyes is such a transcendent feeling it’s easy to get caught up in the euphoria and never come back to your senses.

To not exist, even for a few fleeting moments.

I have plenty to live for, I know that…

But my god—

It feels so nice to let it all just fade away, and become the last thing I could ever have on my mind.

These tapes may be the death of me one day, but I’ve become so acclimated to them, I don’t know if I can ever stop diving into the multitudes they have to offer.

It’s times like this, where I have to seal off The Archives, and go to my partner’s house, stay there until the urge slips far enough into my subconscious that it’s not all that’s ever on my mind at any given point in the day.

I hope I don’t worry them…

————————

I don’t know what to say.

I went to bed with my partner, entering the nightly routine of cuddling up to them while either of us scroll social media until one of our brains gets so fried we have to go to sleep, when my entire body froze.

The Governor of West Virginia was found dead in his house earlier today—

The Governor I personally delivered a tape from The Archives to…

I don’t know how or why, but that man’s blood is on my hands.

Maybe they’ll confiscate The Archives like I silently pleaded for them to at the start of this journey.

Is that what I really want?

Deep in the core of who I’ve become?

I’m ashamed to admit how quickly I came to the conclusion.

How quickly I raided the nearest grocery store, ran back to The Archives, and holed myself up within its safe metal walls.

At least here I know they won’t find me.

And if they do—

That I won’t be awake for a single second of it.
