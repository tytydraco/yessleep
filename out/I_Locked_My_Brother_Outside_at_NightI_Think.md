Alright, so I (26M) live way out in the middle of nowhere, in this old farmhouse that’s been in my family forever. My younger brother Theo (21M) just moved in with me last week after breaking up with his girlfriend, Becca. They were together for years, but she dumped him because she “needed space.” Honestly, I don’t blame her — Theo’s kind of immature, always staying out late, forgetting his keys, just generally not having his life together. She’s in med school, totally burned out, so yeah, I can’t imagine his crap helped with her stress.

Anyway, when Theo moved in, I told him straight up: 

“If you’re out past midnight, I’m locking up. I go to bed early, figure it out.”

Friday night rolls around, and Theo goes drinking with some old friends. Around 12:30 a.m., I hear banging on the front door. Not knocking — like, hard banging. I check my phone: no texts, no missed calls. I figure, great, he forgot his damn keys again.

I get up, kind of annoyed, and check the peephole. It’s dark, but I can see someone standing there. I flip on the porch light — yep, it’s Theo. But something feels… off.

He’s just standing there, not saying a word, smiling this weird-ass smile. His clothes look soaked, muddy, even though it hadn’t rained. His hair’s all stuck to his face, and his eyes look… too wide, like the whites are bulging out.

I crack the door and go, “You okay, man?”

No answer. Just smiling.

Then my phone buzzes. It’s a text from Theo:  
*Hey bro, sorry, staying at Charlie’s tonight. Don’t wait up.*

I just froze.

I look back at the door — Theo is outside, still smiling, softly swaying now, like he’s waiting to be let in.

At this point, I’m pissed, thinking maybe he sent the text earlier and just came home after all. he's clearly too drunk to comprehed anything and I’m too tired to deal with his crap, so I quietly lock the deadbolt, turn off the porch light, and go back upstairs. He can sleep in his truck tonight. 

Next morning, I get up, make coffee, look outside — no sign of Theo’s truck.

Around 9 a.m., Theo comes strolling in, looking completely normal. Clean clothes, dry hair, sunglasses on, yawning. I pour him coffee and go, “Rough night?” He’s like, “Yeah, puked all over Charlie’s bathroom. He was pissed.”

I decide to take this time to fuss at him about the drinking and driving situation, "you could have texted me when you got there after you left here. so I knew you made it at least."

he looked confused, "I rode home with Charlie."

I ask, “You didn’t come home at all last night?”

He looks at me, confused. “No? I texted you, remember?”

I tell him, “Someone was banging on the door. I *saw* you — muddy, wet, smiling, just standing there.”

He swears up and down it wasn’t him. He looked legit confused and a little freaked when I described it. I think he is still screwing with me so I told him, if it happens again, I’m not letting him in.

So, that night, Theo goes out again, this time to the bar with our friend Alex. I stay up watching some TV, but by midnight I’m done. Lock up, turn off the lights, head upstairs.

Around 1 a.m., I wake up.

The pounding’s back.

I sit up in bed, Check my phone — no texts, no calls. again.

I peek through the curtain — Theo’s truck is in the driveway.

I go downstairs, staying quiet, just listening.

The pounding stops.

Then I hear it — “Let me in.”

It’s Theo’s voice.

But it’s… wrong. Too low, like he’s crouched or something. And too soft, like he’s whispering.

I glance through the peephole.

There’s someone crouched on the porch.

It *looks* like Theo — but twisted, hunched down, knees bent weird, hands flat on the porch. His head tilts up toward the door, and his neck stretches way too far. His smile’s too wide. At first, I think maybe he just drank WAY too much and is on the verge of blacking out. I’m about to open the door and then — I hear a creak on the stairs behind me.

I spin around.

It’s Theo.

Standing at the bottom of the stairs, just in his boxers, hair messy, rubbing his eyes, like he just woke up. He mumbles, “Dude, what the hell is that noise?”

I'm confused.

I glance back at the door and look through the peephole again.

The porch is empty.

No one’s there. No crouched figure. No pounding. 

Theo came over, yawning. “Was someone knocking? I thought I heard something.”

I just shake my head, “Yeah… someone was.” 

So, at this point either Theo is messing with me somehow or I’m going crazy. I don’t know how he could have got inside, stripped off his clothes and behind me so fast. 

So… Reddit, AITA for locking my brother out? Or is there something seriously messed up going on here, maybe I am going crazy? Maybe Theo's on something that's making him act weird?

Any help would be appreciated.
