This will be the first time I have ever told anyone this. Even now, speaking about it, it was one of the most terrifying situations I have ever been in. To this day, I tend not to look out my window in the dark. It was October time last year and I needed to catch a break, so I did what any normal person would do and looked up social media for a getaway break. I've been single for 2 years now, and I usually do these things by myself. I find it a good way to get away from everything.

I came across a wilderness experience. You would stay in a cabin out in the woods with one gigantic window that looks out at the wilderness. The cabin isn't much of a cabin at all. It is quite small, basically just one room, one gigantic window, a bed facing the window, and a small bathroom. So, I booked it that very weekend. The drive was uneventful; it took 2 hours to get there. When I was booking, I was told I was going to meet a man named Tom. Tom owned the cabin and, I presume, the land that it was on. I drove into a laneway. The lane went on for about 5 minutes of windy roads, gritted gravel, and shrubs on each side. The further I went in, the denser the shrubbery and trees became.

I pulled up in front of a big, square, white house. As I got out of the car, the gravel underneath sank me just a little bit by my own weight. I walked up to the door and rang the doorbell, then took two steps back. The door opened immediately. An old man greeted me at the door. He was around 5'6", bald, in his 60s or 70s, wearing blue jeans.

"Hello there." "Hi, um, I have a booking in the getaway cabin." "Yes, yes, come in. We were expecting you."

I walked up the two steps and into the house. The house was pretty regular, except for the gigantic ceilings above. There was a small desk to the right-hand side, where the old man went behind.

"Okay, so what time would you like breakfast at?" said Tom

"Um, anytime really. I'm not in any rush." 

"Okay, we'll say 9:30."

"Yeah, that's great." 

"And what experience are you looking for?" asked Tom.

"Um, how do you mean?" I replied puzzled by the question.

"Well, we have seasonal experiences around here, and because it's coming up to October, we have horror, or you can jump ahead and go straight to Christmas. The experiences are up to you. Here, here is the list."

The list was an A4 sheet of paper. It had an option for four items: number one, Christmas, and then just beside it, in brackets, it said Santa Claus; number two was horror, and beside it, in brackets, it said Halloween; number three was New Year's; number four was Thanksgiving.

"Um, which one is the best?" I asked the man, still confused by the offer. 

"Well, while you're here, you will still get the whole experience of the wilderness, but what happens tonight will be completely up to you. Personally, I do think you should avoid the Christmas one, as we are still in October. But, are you brave enough to pick horror?"

I did want to get away from everything for a while. I didn't think I was going to be getting such a confusing offer. So, I looked at the man, took a brave breath in, and said, "Sure, nothing scares me. Go on, I'll do the horror."

"Excellent choice. So here are your keys. Your cabin is just out the door here, down the path through the woods, and you will see it in the middle of the field. Go there, and there are a number of items in the room. Beside these items will be a little note on how to use them. I recommend you keep the lights off; otherwise, when it gets dark out, you won't be able to see anything out your window. But if you keep the lights off, your eyes will adjust. So please, just remember that."

I thanked the old man. I took the keys and went back to my car to collect my things. I followed the man's instructions towards the cabin. It was around 4:00 p.m. at the time. It was slowly getting to dusk as I arrived at the small cabin. The cabin was no larger than 8 ft tall. It was a brown square wooden box with one gigantic window overlooking the tree lines. I walked up to the cabin, unlocked the door, and let myself in. When I came in, there was one chair facing the window, a small fridge to my left-hand side, my bed to my right (not facing the window), and a small bathroom barely big enough for one person. There were a number of random items in the room.

The first one I noticed was a pair of binoculars. The binoculars had a note beside them that said, "Use me at nighttime. I am night vision." The next items I noticed were earplugs. The note beside the earplugs said, "Use me if the wind gets too loud." Finally, there was a notebook. The note beside it said, "Write down your experiences here."

After settling myself in, I decided to take a seat on the chair, pulled over the binoculars, and put them on to see what was in the wilderness. It was around 5:00 p.m. at this point. Off in the distance was an apple tree. Four small baby deer came out and slowly moved their way over to the apple tree, picking at it. The two main deer walked behind the baby deer. It was quite an unbelievable sight, one that, if I wasn’t in this cabin and I was standing outside, would surely never happen because the deer would have been too afraid once they saw me. But behind this window, I could see everything in the wilderness.

At 7:00 p.m., it was pitch black. At this point, I had all the lights off, staring out into the shadows. The night vision binoculars were working. You could see everything in a dark green palette. As I was there gazing out into the wild, I heard a knock on my door. I got up out of my chair and opened it, and not to my surprise, there was no one there. I figured this was one of the horror experiences. It did give me butterflies in my stomach—excited ones—so I sat back down with a small grin on my face.

Suddenly, as I looked out the window, something just ran by. I could barely make it out, but it was definitely in the figure of a human. I picked up my night vision goggles to have a look. Searching far and wide, I found nothing. It must have been just my eyes adjusting, or again, just another one of these horror experiences.

For the next 2 hours, nothing really happened. I drank two beers as I sat in the chair, opened a bag of chips, and just listened to the wind. I wrote down some of my experiences. I wrote down noticing the deer, someone knocking on the door, and something running by the window. I read back on a few of the entries. Nothing out of the ordinary except one from four weeks ago. It was from a woman named Mary. She said that she also had knocks on her door and saw something or someone running by. She said that she regretted picking the horror option.

I told myself I should get ready for bed, but not before I had another look outside using the night vision binoculars. Again, I searched wide and far. Then I noticed something way off in the tree line. Two small dots lit up. The more I stared at the two dots, the more an outline of a figure emerged. It looked like a really skinny man. The man had really long hair coming down his face. Out from the two dots, which I presumed were his eyes, he was hunched over with his shoulders out in front, but his arms were long and skinny. I stared at him for nearly a minute, wondering why there was a man out in the woods at this time. This was surely another horror experience happening.

I stood up from my chair, still in complete darkness. I lowered my binoculars, trying to see if my naked eyes could see the man, and to no surprise, I couldn’t, as it was way too dark outside. So, I put the binoculars back up to my eyes. That’s when I noticed the man was now standing outside of the tree line, closer to me. The tree line was about 100 meters away from the cabin. All in front of me was overgrown grass blowing in the wind. The hunched man never moved, his shoulders still pointing towards me, with his arms nearly down as far as his knees. His hair was still slicked down his face. My heart began to speed up. What was actually happening here? Is this part of the horror experience that the old man welcomed?

Again, lowering my binoculars, I decided to take a sip of water and then put the binoculars back up to my eyes. Now...The figure was about 50 meters away. He was a lot taller than I first expected. I don't know how he got this close so quickly. I took a sip of water for only 3 seconds. How could he move that fast? Since he was closer, I noticed he was breathing heavily. I noticed his arms and body were full of scabs. His facial features became clearer the closer he got, and yet he still didn't move. As I stared, I could see his eyes were staring directly at me.

I decided to grab my phone and call Tom. I was worried that this wasn't all part of the experience. I searched for Tom's name on my phone, found it, put the phone to my ear, and looked up. The man, or figure, was now only 10 feet away from the window. At this point, I did not need binoculars at all. The figure was taller than the cabin itself. Its eyes were fixated on me. Its hair was no longer covering its face. Its wide mouth was left hanging open. Its long arms moved up and down as its body was breathing.

I kept my eyes on the figure as Tom wasn't answering his phone. The figure's head shifted upwards, looking into the sky. Its neck was long and skinny. Its hair was falling down the back of its head, revealing its skinny, stretched abdomen. It roared in a high-pitched voice. I put my hands to my ears. The noise was unbearable. I grabbed the earplugs that were left in the cabin. I reached for the light switch to turn on the lights. The lights were blinding as they came on. I looked back out the giant window but could only see the reflection of myself. Then something banged against the window. Pushed up against the window was one of the baby deer I saw earlier. It was lifeless. Wrapped around its neck were five long, gray fingers.

The loud scream came back again. I pressed my hands against my ears yet again, keeping an eye on the window. The deer vanished as if thrown away from the glass. The screaming slowly deteriorated into silence. All there was, was silence: me and my reflection. I hesitantly went to go and turn off the light switch. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and flicked the switch. Slowly opening them, I noticed nothing. There was nothing there, only the vast field and the tree line. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.

The next morning, I went back to Tom's house to check out. I rang the doorbell to be greeted by Tom. "Why, hello. Welcome." "Um, I was just about to come down with your breakfast." "Yeah, that's quite all right. I honestly didn't get a wink of sleep last night, and I need to go home. But thank you so much. I'm going to hit the road as soon as I can." "That's no problem at all. Come on in and I'll check you out."

I stepped back into the high-ceilinged hallway. I handed over the keys to Tom as he took out the card machine for me to pay. "So you must have had a hell of an experience last night, then?" "Yeah, you weren't kidding with the horror experience anyway." "Oh, it's just a little bit of fun. It wasn't supposed to scare you that hard." "Well, I just couldn't sleep, knowing there could be someone just standing outside my cabin the whole night." Then Tom said it. "Oh, I don't be standing out in the middle of the field all night. I just do a simple knock and run by, that's all." "Yeah, and the tall, skinny man who was off in the tree line?" "Excuse me? What tall, skinny man? We only have one experience here for horror, and that's me knocking on the door and running by. What man in a field are you talking about?" Then it hit me. If it wasn't him that was out in that field staring at me, then what was it?
