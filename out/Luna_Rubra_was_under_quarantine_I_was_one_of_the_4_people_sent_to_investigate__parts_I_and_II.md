It’s been two months since Luna Rubra, and I haven’t slept more than a few hours at a time. I signed the NDA the morning they released me, hands shaking, eyes still stinging from the decon showers. I told myself I’d keep it. I told myself I’d forget. But forgetting is impossible when your dreams replay the sound of boots on cold steel and the smell of ammonia burning the back of your throat. When I close my eyes, I see the corridors—empty, identical, too clean. I see the files in Bay Three, page after page of redacted info where the answers should have been. We weren’t told what we were walking into. They gave us just enough to get us on the convoy and through the gates, not enough to understand why everyone in that place moved like they were afraid to breathe. Now I know why the air was so still, why the guards wouldn’t look us in the eye, why Command kept his visits short. I know what was in those patient logs. And I know what’s waiting.



The convoy was loud—glass clanged, metal banged, and every jolt of the road rattled through us. As we neared the site, the chatter died off. The reality of what we were walking into started to sink in.

Morales tapped his knee—he hadn’t stopped since morning. “What do you guys think is going on?” He tried to sound calm, but his voice had a nervous edge. Silence followed.

Nick sighed. “It’s impossible to say. We know what they told us. Luna Rubra went on lockdown four days ago. One-way comms. No visual or physical contact. That’s all we’ve got.”

“That base was built for emergencies like this,” Davis said. “Bio-containment, low staff numbers, underground support systems. Perfect quarantine site.”

“How do they expect us to work when we know nothing?” Miles muttered, arms crossed, jaw tight.
I tried to exhale the tension pressing against my chest.

“Specifics don’t matter. We research. We report. Don’t ask, don’t tell.” I didn’t believe it—he wasn’t wrong.

I glanced at the folder in my lap. It was mostly redacted—names blacked out, timestamps removed. But there were symptoms.

Cognitive regression observed in three of the five crew. Language repetition. Memory gaps. One went unresponsive a day after touching back down on Earth.

“Bullshit,” Miles said, talking just to fill the silence. “A few people go to the moon and come back sick; how does that make any sense? The file just says ‘astro-neurological contamination under investigation.’ Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie.”

Morales rubbed his face. “I thought space was a vacuum.”

“It is,” Nick said. “So either it isn’t… or something followed them back.”

Morales slugged him in the shoulder. “Don’t say shit like that. You’re freaking me out.” No one spoke after that. We stared at the floor, the walls, the ceiling—anywhere but each other. For the rest of the ride, the silence held. 

The convoy rolled to a stop in front of a tall steel gate, looming like the wall of a fortress. The air outside was dry and still—no wind, no insects, nothing but the low growl of the engine and the crunch of gravel under our boots as we stepped onto the uneven road. A man in a sealed hazmat suit approached, flanked by two guards in similar gear.

He took off his helmet to reveal short grey hair, sharp eyes, and the look of a man who hadn’t slept in days. He reached out his hand and met my eyes. “Dr. Rand,” he said, nodding to me, before doing the same to the rest of our team. 

“I’m Commanding Officer Norris, welcome to Luna Rubra.” He drew in a breath as if he was weighing his words only to let out a sigh. The only sounds were the creaking of the metal gate and the hum of the engine. He signaled us to follow him as he kept talking “I’ll be blunt,” he continued “I wish we could’ve met under better circumstances but times are dire. You’ll be working in Sector C-2—the research wing. We’ve prepared various biological samples of the patients, patient video logs, and highly detailed behavioral logs. Physical or verbal interaction with any of the crew are off-limits for now. Route any questions you have through internal comms. Document anything, no matter how insignificant.” 

As we walked through the gate and metal detectors at the front entrance a strong smell of ammonia caught me off guard. It was sharp—pungent and it stayed in the back of my throat. It smelt as if someone dumped a bucket of cleaning solution on the ground. Morales scrunched his nose while Nick stared at the boot marks we were making on the recently mopped floor.

The air in Luna Rubra was cold and dry, the kind of dry that made my lips stick to my teeth. I shoved my hands in my coat pockets, trying to keep them warm. Couldn’t have been warmer than sixty-five. Our footsteps echoed down plain, colorless corridors—walls the shade of faded paper, lit by fluorescent strips that buzzed softly overhead. Every turn looked like the last. The emptiness made the place feel bigger than it was. I couldn’t tell if it was the chill or the silence that was making me tense my shoulders.

Norris kept a steady pace in front of us—boots striking the floor in a hypnotic rhythm. He stopped and turned to his left to reveal large reinforced steel double doors that were marked as C-2. The letters were scuffed and partially missing. Beyond the double doors the air grew colder as the lights gave off a sickly yellow tone. There was some kind of platform with glass walls but it had been blocked off and curtains drawn over the windows

“This is where you’re working,” Norris said, stopping at a secure access panel. He pressed his card against the reader, and the lock gave a low, mechanical click. “You’ll have full lab privileges. Samples are secured in cold storage, video logs are queued in the system. You’ll find everything in bay three—just around the corner.” 

His eyes lingered on us a moment longer than felt necessary. “I’ll check in with you every hour. Don’t hesitate to use the comms if you need anything.” He started to leave before turning around to say one more thing. “Good luck men.”




When he left it felt like the tension in the room dropped dramatically. He had an aura of intensity around him that felt like it commanded all your senses. Morales let out a sigh and retrieved a clipboard from a nearby countertop, his foot bouncing in place as if the tension had to go somewhere. “Let’s get this over with as fast as possible,” he muttered, scanning the first page too fast to really read it. “Hopefully they got sick after being re-introduced to Earth.”

The clipboard had some kind of instruction manual attached to it. Inside the manual were clear instructions on how to operate the entire science wing.  

“Somebody flip that lever by the door.” Nick moved toward it without hurry, glancing at the wiring above as if he were memorizing its layout. The lever clicked into place and he tilted his head slightly at the sound of the machines. “Transformer hum’s running high… probably not dangerous,” he added, though he didn’t sound entirely convinced.

“You mind helping me grab some of the stuff we need?” Miles gave a short nod before pushing himself off the wall he was leaning on. When we began making our way to bay three he started a conversation.

“Hey Kyle, seriously, what the fuck do you think is going on?”

“I don’t know. But the fact that we rode in on a convoy and almost everything was redacted can’t be good. Add in the fact that they requested 4 people with different specialties for such a small case means they have no clue what’s going on. I don’t know what’s going on but it’s leaving a bad feeling in my stomach.”

Miles rubbed the back of his neck and looked down on as he talked. “Yeah… It’s messing with my head a little bit. Maybe I’m just psyching myself out.” I gave him a pat on the back as we rounded the corner and saw bay three.

Bay Three looked more like an archive vault than a standard lab storage room. The thick reinforced door, card reader, and biometric scanner weren’t there to keep us out — they were there to make sure whatever was inside never left in the wrong hands.

Inside, the lighting was dimmer than the main lab—soft, cold strips along the ceiling that made the polished floor shine like water. Rows of reinforced cabinets lined the walls, each with combination locks and hazard labels in red ink. Many bore handwritten tags: Patient Logs, Medical Imaging, Environmental Samples–Data Only. In the back corner, a bank of terminals sat inside a glass cubicle, their screens dark, keyboards wrapped in clear sterile sleeves. Above them, a small security camera tracked in a slow, steady arc.

Miles stepped in behind me, glancing at the camera. “They’re not taking any chances with this stuff.”

“And I assume it’s probably for a good reason.” I replied, running my hand over the biometric panel. The metal was colder than expected.

The chill deepened once we were inside—not enough to be unbearable, but enough that our breath started to mist. The air had that heavy, undisturbed quality of a room that wasn’t entered often. Miles shoved his hands in his pockets. “It feels like a morgue here.”

On the nearest counter, a stack of sealed manila envelopes lay beneath a heavy acrylic paperweight. Each envelope had a red “CONFIDENTIAL” stripe running diagonally across it. The one on top was stamped DO NOT DUPLICATE—PATIENT #3. The edges were worn, as if they’d been handled too many times in too short a span.

I lifted it and turned it over in my hands. “This one’s heavier than it looks.”

Inside was a summary page. My breath frosted faintly over the paper as I scanned the first line: Rapid cortical decay within seventy-two hours post-Earth re-entry.
The words punched the air out of me.

 “Shit…”

Miles moved to my side. “What?”

“Patient Three’s scans started showing changes mid-flight. They were already deteriorating before they landed.”

Miles exhaled, slow and tight. “So whatever this is...” he dropped his thought before he could finish it.

I kept reading — finding gaps in the timeline where entire hours were blacked out, marked only with brackets and the word REDACTED.

“We need to take this back,” I said, sliding the page back into the envelope. I grabbed the other two packets before heading toward the door.

We stepped back into the lab, the warmth hitting like a reminder of what it felt like before reading those papers. Morales glanced up from the clipboard, his knee still bouncing under the table.

“Well?”

I set the envelopes down on the counter. “Patient Three’s brain started deteriorating before landing.”

Nick didn’t look up right away. When he did, his gaze moved from the folder to me. “Seventy-two hours…” He said it slowly, as if turning the number over in his head. “That’s not long for something to burn through a brain like that.”

Morales leaned back in his chair, eyes still on the envelopes. “And whatever it was, it started before they even touched down.” His thumb drummed once against the clipboard before he set it down. “Then we start where it started.””

No one moved. The hum of the machines filled the space between us, sharp and constant. Somewhere in the vents, air hissed in slow, uneven breaths. Even that felt too loud.
