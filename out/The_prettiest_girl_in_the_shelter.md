We didn’t have snow where I grew up.
Only in the mountains, the nuns told us once.
I’ve never seen snow, I was only 9, until they showed us pictures, I remember thinking what it’d be like if I bite snow, like biting on a cloud maybe.
They promised one day we’ll go visit, after the war ends and only if we pray hard enough.
We had copper lanterns and homemade candles, the only source of light in the shelter.
The constant bombing shaked the ceiling. Everybody looked up, as if one of them bombs will come straight through, but it never did.
Starts with a whistle, whistle gets louder and ends with a boom.
It spits dust after making cracking noises, I could see flakes of dirt falling down, absorbing whatever dim light there was.
I remember this guy who used to smuggle fruits and vegetables to sell to whoever was in the shelter, his stand made of wood chunks he assembled from the burning building close by, before the siren signalled us to make way underground.
He was so funny with a thick moustache, always telling dirty jokes and making us laugh.
But I was looking somewhere else, I was staring at her, the prettiest girl in the shelter, but I dare not come close, I dare not say a word to her. I better stay close to mother and father.
Anyways, the stash guy lost his wits when I accidentally slammed against his stand knocking a watermelon to its demise, it's only a harmless bomb, the red of its inside is yummy and wholesome, God knows what was getting spilled outside these walls.
Explosions continue till dawn, only to start again. I asked my mum if the bombs will only stop after all the houses are burned down? I shouldn't have said it this loud, shush mum said, keep it quiet.
Maybe I should stop thinking about it, for now. My father wasn't happy he had to pay for the watermelon, but guy with the thick stash cooled down.

Mother was begging dad not to go out for a cigarette, curfew started 5 minutes ago and whispers say that anyone out will get shot on sight, no questions asked.
But stubborn dad wouldn't listen. He wasn't gone long, until everyone looked up again, this time to the sound of fire. A few militia men greeted him with flying bullets, aiming at his feet.
Stubborn dad crawled back down the long stairs, leaving a trail of blood, dragging his flaccid legs.
A few years later he'd let me put my fingers in the holes where bullets took refuge.
I asked if he could feel any pain, he wouldn't answer with words, he'd just smirk and tap the metal plates filling his shins.

My older brother, the culprit, pushed me onto the stand for a giggle, and got away with it, next time I'll get him, but for now, I’ll be waiting, until I can see her pretty face again.
