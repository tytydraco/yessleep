I stood, watching darkness fall onto the town outside similar to a storm front does with rain. The darkness approached quickly, blanketing everything in an inky darkness, stopping just inches from the illumination of the store. I couldn’t even see my car despite it being parked just feet away. My heart raced as I heard the town come alive with screams, laughter, cries for help, and what sounded like thousands of footsteps. Turning back to the gas station attendant, I asked “so, how much would it cost to stay here for tonight?” “hmm, how about your right arm? I think that’s a fair deal” the attendant responded, his multiple hands gripping the counter, some had painted nails, some were hairy, others were slender, and all seemed to not belong to him.

I contemplated the deal, an arm would be a good deal to not die outside, but I like having two arms, and I would just bleed out if he ripped it off of me. Peering around the gas station, I sighed with relief, noticing my Hail Mary on the window. “What about working here for the night, you are hiring” I said, gesturing at the help wanted sign in the window. The attendant looked at my silently, the buzzing sound of the gas station lights emanating through the air. They then grew louder and louder, their buzzing sound entering my ear and feeling as if it was scratching my brain. I clasped my head in pain, my fingernails digging into my head as if I was trying to open it up to free the noise.

Almost as fast as it appeared, the buzzing noise subsided, returning back to the low hum. “Fine, you’re hired, though I’ll be having you work the front today” spoke the gas attendant in an annoyed voice. He threw me a shirt with the words “Dripes, service to die for.” “Get dressed, today’s the auction and we’ll be having company in the next 20 minutes. My names Drill by the way” said the attendant, moving around the counter and entering a door to the side with “Employees Only” emblazoned at the top.

I took my place behind the cash register, unsure that I made the right decision. I may be a sitting duck outside, but who knows what’s going to walk through those doors. My thoughts were interrupted by the gas station bell ringing as the door opened, sending chills down my spine. Looking over, four lanky figures entered the store, arms and legs far too long, and massive grins going up to their massive eyes. Their lips were parted just slightly, showing their jagged teeth as if someone took a hammer to each tooth. They shuffled through the store, bones creaking as they whispered to each other excitedly. One of them peered towards me licking it’s lips, it went back to talking it’s friends, gesturing repeatedly at me. They then became far more excited, their whispering replaced with their mouths opening and closing, their teeth making loud clicking noises. For a moment, that’s all I heard, “clickclickclickclick” of their teeth slamming into each other, coming to a realization.

II know these monsters from the book, teeth chatterers, known for ripping the teeth out of any creature they come across, as long as they know they can get away with it. I watched in horror as one of them started tugging at their jaw. A sickening cracking noise made it’s way through the gas station, as the teeth chatter began to pull tooth after tooth out of it’s jaw, each tooth making a loud popping noise as it separated from the teeth chatterer’s jaw. What felt like hours, the teeth chatterer removed tooth after tooth out of it’s jaw, letting each drop against the floor each with a tiny chilling clink. As it finished, it looked at me, giving me a wide toothless smile, and began pulling out a rusty set of needle nose pliers.

I panicked as it began stepping towards me, first a slow walk, then picking up the pace running towards me with an audible scream. I screamed in return, holding up the cash register to defend myself, only to hear it suddenly gasping for air. Looking up, I saw Drill holding the teeth chatterer back with it’s multiple arms, keeping it from entering the counter space. “You may not enter the counter unless you’re an employee” Drill said angrily, throwing the teeth chatterer back. It made a loud crunching noise hitting the floor, followed by a loud clank as the pliers hit the floor next to it. Quickly it rose back up and ran out of the store, crying as it held it’s jaw wide open. The other three followed behind it, laughing hysterically at their friend’s misfortune.

I placed the cash register back in it’s place, turning to say thank you to him, I was instead met with my hands being held on the counter, my fingernails being the only part of my hand visible. Drill’s numerous hand help me in place as another extended to pick up the rusty pliers on the ground. “As this was a simple mistake, I’ll be only taking half of your fingernails. Think of it as a minor punishment” Drill said angrily. My struggles were only met with Drill holding me down harder, his hands cutting off any circulation I had to my arms. I screamed as the pliers came down underneath my fingernails, feeling the rust of the pliers scrape against the open wound underneath my nails. Almost with surgical precision, I felt my finger nail crack as half of it was removed, parts of skin and fleshing fighting to keep it attached only snapped away with it, the blood being stained orange from the rust.

“one down, nine more to go” Drill said happily

Half an hour later, tears still dripping down my face, I wrapped each hand in paper towels from the bathroom.

I don’t know if I can make it the next 8 hours here, especially if this what was considered to be a “light punishment” for something I didn’t cause. I didn’t have a choice, whatever was out there in the inky blackness of the night would probably be far worse. Lost in the pain emanating from my fingers, I didn’t notice Drill throw a bucket towards me, it slamming into my face. “Nice catch” laughed Drill “but I’m going to need you to head outside and clean the windows. I want the customers to see what a great new face we have.” I froze in fear, “but what if something happens to me while I’m out there” I stammered out, terrified. “And what do you think I’m going to do to you if you can’t do your job” Drill responded back, opening is mouth in a grin. “I think I’ll start with your retinas this time, you don’t need to see right?”

I scurried to the sink to fill my bucket, my mind racing for a way to get out of this. What could I say to get him to let me stay in the gas station?
