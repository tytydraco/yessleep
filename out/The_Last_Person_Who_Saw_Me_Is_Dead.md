# Before we begin.

The following events happened to me in **Brazil**.

Surely, the supernatural **knows no borders**.

If you have any doubts about the cultural context, feel free to ask, and I’ll do my best to explain.

But I’ll warn you now—

I won’t go into the **more supernatural details.**

I just want to **leave this experience behind.**

---

My name is Fernando. I’m just another IT executive who got tired of the stress of big corporations and decided to retire. Not because my body asked for it, but because my mind demanded it. I just needed to rest, let time pass quietly, and avoid crashing head-on into the burnout train.

I’m not married, I don’t have kids, which, I confess, made it easier to take a sharp turn like this: I bought a rural property in the countryside and moved there. My plan was simple—study, enjoy the video games my exhausting work routine never allowed, read, and reflect a bit.

I found the perfect property, about **30 km from the city center**. A dirt road, isolated, exactly what I was looking for. I invested a good amount of money to bring in **renewable energy and water**. I also spent a chunk of my savings to give a **serious facelift** to the house that was already there: **a huge old colonial mansion, extremely spacious but falling apart.**

During my trips to check on the renovation, I met my neighbor, **Tião**. A rugged man who lived with his wife and two young children in **a wattle and daub house**, about **5 km from my property**. Other than Tião’s house, there was **nothing else on that side of the Tietê River**. I was told it was **a protected area**, so nobody bought land there because **it couldn’t be legally developed**.

But **Tião lived there, strong and steady.**

One late afternoon, I stopped my truck in front of his house.

He seemed **friendly**, came out to greet me, but his wife and kids stayed at the window, **watching me, hesitant**.

Our conversation, as I remember it, went something like this:

— **Good afternoon. I bought the mansion at the end of Estrada da Jurema. How’s it going?**

— **Good afternoon. You’re gonna like the area.** My name’s **Tião**, and inside are my wife and kids. **We don’t get many visitors, so they’re a bit wary of stepping outside.**

— **My name’s Fernando. I brought a box of fruit for the neighbors.** — I handed him the box.

— **That wasn’t necessary, sir. But I appreciate it.** Phone signal’s weak here, but if you ever need anything and I can help, just let me know.

He hesitated, then added:

— **Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s better we don’t stand here talking too long.** It’s getting dark, and **there are jaguars in this region.**

**Jaguars?**

— **Why don’t you come by earlier one day? We can have some coffee.**

— **Sounds good. I’ll be stopping by the house next week and can drop by later, if that’s okay.**

Tião’s face changed.

— **You’re not gonna tear down the mansion, are you?**

His tone was **completely different now.**

— **No, no, just a renovation to make it more livable.** But why? **Is something wrong?**

Tião’s shoulders **relaxed slightly**.

— **Nothing, sir. I just like that house. Lots of memories there, that’s all.**

He seemed **relieved.**

**I had no idea that conversation was the beginning of my problems.**

---

# The renovation went smoothly.

The contractor mentioned that there was a high turnover of workers. Nobody wanted to spend the night there. Too isolated. No phone signal. No internet. Nothing. I made a mental note to install satellite internet. I wanted peace and quiet, but internet was as essential as coffee.

I kept the original layout of the house, with a few modifications. I merged two bedrooms into a large office. The largest bedroom became my master suite. The living room and kitchen were now open-concept. Inside, the house was modern and well-equipped.

From the outside, it was still the same old colonial mansion—only now, extremely well-maintained.

There were other areas of the property that I didn’t touch. (I wasn’t made of money.) And maybe I could fix them up myself—a new hobby, perhaps.

On the highest point of the property, there was a small ancient chapel, completely falling apart.

A barn, just as old, in dire need of either a complete renovation or outright demolition.

I even considered getting rid of my truck and replacing it with horses. I kept that thought in the back of my mind.

There was also a small animal enclosure.

It looked like an old, abandoned chicken coop, where goats and other small animals had probably been kept in the past. The enclosure was connected to a small room that must have been used as a slaughterhouse.

But it had been a long, long time since any farm animals had been there—except for the rats and possums that probably scurried through the place now.

At the far end of the property, deep in the woods, there was a stream branch and an old ruined shack.

From its condition, I guessed it had once been a storage shed for fishing gear.

But now, it was just a rotting husk.

# With the renovation complete and the internet installed, it was the perfect retreat.

**The zombie apocalypse could happen, and nothing would change in my routine. Hell, I could even start planting something. My grocery trips would become even less frequent.**

**On the day I moved in, I was excited. I had so many ideas for how to build an amazing life on that land. If only I had paid attention to the details.**

---

**At the end of the day, after carrying dozens of boxes into the house, I was exhausted.**

**I decided to drive into town, find a place to eat, relax a little.**

**As I passed by Tião’s house, the sun was already setting.**

**A lamp was lit out front.**

**Wait. No electricity?**

**Maybe I could set up a power line so he could tap into my energy grid.**

**But… 3 kilometers of wiring?**

**Not happening.**

**I stopped at a gas station by the roadside to fill up before reaching town.**

**Gas was ridiculously expensive there.**

**I had never stopped before. Not worth it.**

**Better to drive a little further and fill up in the city.**

**But… what if I ran out of gas out here, at night?**

**I’d be waiting forever for assistance.**

**And worst case scenario?**

**I’d make some new friends.**

**An old, grumpy-looking gas attendant approached.**

**I struck up a conversation:**

**— Good evening. Fill it up for me? Just moved in. I’m staying on Estrada da Jurema.**

**— Good evening. Regular or premium?**

**— Regular’s fine. It’s pretty isolated out there, huh? Just me and Tião.**

**The old man gave me a disgusted look.**

**Then, without warning:**

**— Fill up your own damn car.**

**— Or better yet, don’t. Get the hell out of here and go bother someone else.**

**He turned his back on me and walked away.**

**What the fuck?**

**Does this guy hate engineers?**

**Did he think I was arrogant?**

**Or was I just another city idiot thinking I could escape stress in the countryside?**

**I started the car, still confused.**

**When I got to the center of town, I filled up at another station and mentioned the incident to the attendant.**

**He just shrugged.**

**— Don’t mind him, Doc. That old man is Zé from the gas station. He used to be rich, but now he’s just stuck there, bitter.**

**He chuckled.**

**— Nobody stops there anymore. He waters down the gas.**

**I almost corrected him. Gas and water don’t mix.**

**But... fuck it.**

**Better to just get home.**

**I wasn’t in the mood for a drink anymore.**

**Or for anything else in this town.**

---


# I arrive at the mansion.

I open the gate with a remote control—**a small automation more than deserved.**

I park right at the entrance.

As I turn the key to unlock the door, I notice **something hanging from the wooden beam of the porch.**

A **necklace.**

It’s brown, made of **stones.**

Or... does it lean more toward **red**?

The stones aren’t perfectly round—**their edges are slightly jagged, but smooth enough to look polished over time.**

They’re strung together with **twine**, something **rustic, natural.**

**Handmade, for sure.**

Probably **one of the workers left it behind** while finishing up the renovation.

I walk into the kitchen, toss the necklace in the trash, grab something to eat, spend some time online, and go to bed.

# The next morning.

I wake up early, ready to enjoy my **first full day in the house.**

Between one thing and another, a thought crosses my mind—

**Maybe one of the workers will come back for that damn necklace.**

I go check the trash can.

**The necklace isn’t there.**

**Shit.**

I must’ve left it somewhere else.

I rummage through my things, checking every obvious spot.

**Nothing.**

**Fuck it.**

If someone asks about it, I’ll just pay for another one, give them a few bucks, and be done with it.

# I decide to explore my empire.

My head is spinning with **ideas.**

So much potential.

So many things to build.

So many things to create.

When I reach the **chicken coop**, something feels... off.

In the **old slaughterhouse**, there’s a **dead animal.**

A **rabbit.**

Lying on the ground, **its belly split open.**

It must be a **tapiti**, a native rabbit from this region.

Hard to find.

Probably got **cornered by a possum** inside the slaughterhouse.

The floor **is stained with blood.**

I clean up the area, **get rid of the carcass.**

(**Do I need to bury it?**)

And then, I **shiver.**

Just outside the slaughterhouse, on **the stone path**, I notice **a bloody footprint.**

Roughly **the same size as mine.**

I shake my head.

**Stop it.**

**You’re overthinking.**

I must have stepped in the blood while cleaning and tracked it outside.

Now I’m **standing here alone, making shit up in my head.**

I decide to **bury the rabbit.**

I dig a small hole **near the slaughterhouse**, drop the carcass in, and cover it with dirt.

But the **footprint bothers me.**

I make a mental note to **wipe it away later.**

# Later that day.

I go back to clean the **stone path**, wiping away the dried blood.

It’s not much, but **I don’t need unnecessary scares every time I walk by.**

Then, I notice **something I missed before.**

**The trail doesn’t stop here.**

The faint **blood stains continue.**

Leading toward **the stream.**

**Three more footprints.**

Then the trail fades.

But the **direction is clear.**

**The stream.**

# I follow it.

I enter a **narrow trail through the forest**, leading to **the abandoned cabin.**

As I walk, **my mind has already solved the mystery.**

**Some idiot must be hunting illegally around here.**

The bastard **crossed the stream to get his prey**, which had wandered onto my property.

He was **probably in the middle of gutting it** when **something spooked him.**

**He ran.**

Didn’t even notice **he left a blood trail behind.**

I’m going to install **an outdoor camera.**

Maybe even **some sirens** to scare off anyone who thinks they can sneak in here.

# I reach the stream and scan the area.

**The cabin, the trail, the surroundings…**

**Nothing.**

**Out of the corner of my eye, I notice something on the other side of the river.**

**But from where I stand, I can’t see it clearly.**

**Fuck it.**

**Let’s get my boots wet and check it out.**

**I cross the stream and walk toward it.**

**It’s just an old piece of cloth.**

**But when I unfold it—**

**the necklace is there.**

**Drenched in dried blood.**

# I’m a goddamn engineer.

**The necklace did not teleport here.**

**This must be another one.**

**The same hunter who left this here was probably the one who forgot the first one at my front door.**

**That will all make perfect sense…**

**As soon as I find the first necklace.**

**I pick up the old cloth with the necklace, head back to the mansion, and try to make sense of all this.**

# As I approach the house, I notice someone standing at the gate.

**It’s Tião.**

**From a distance, I motion for him to come in.**

**But he doesn’t.**

**He just shakes his head.**

**— Doc, come here for a second.**

**I walk up to the gate.**

**Tião greets me with a smile, always friendly.**

**— How are you, Doc? Thanks again for the fruit, by the way.**

**He hesitates for a second.**

**Then, almost casually:**

**— Listen… Would you mind if I come onto your property now and then? Just to fish in the stream?**

**— The part that runs through your land has some big lambaris. Sometimes even a nice fat traíra.**

I shrug.

— **Tião, the house is yours.** Come whenever you want, no need for formalities.

But **something feels off.**

I take the opportunity.

— **Let me ask you something… I think someone was here last night.**

— **I found a dead rabbit in the slaughterhouse.**

— **And some footprints.**

Tião **shrugs like it’s nothing.**

— **Oh, Doc, people from town come hunting around here all the time.**

— **It’s really common, you know?**

— **Get a dog. That’ll keep the fools from sneaking in.**

He then notices **the necklace in my hand.**

His expression **changes slightly.**

I lift the necklace.

— **Look what I found, Tião. Must belong to the hunter who came through here.**

Tião **frowns.**

— **Oh, Doc… that’s macumba.** 

***Note***\*: "Macumba" is a term sometimes used in Brazil to refer to Afro-Brazilian spiritual practices, often involving rituals, offerings, and protection against supernatural forces.\*

— **It’s not good to keep things like that around.**

— **Throw it away. It only attracts bad things.**

He pauses, eyes fixed on the necklace, like **it deeply unsettles him.**

— **Look, I won’t touch that, but I can grab it by the cloth and get rid of it for you.**

He **reaches out for the amulet.**

**But my hand pulls back.**

**Instinctively.**

**Why?**

I play it off.

— **Come on, Tião. I’m not going to let you throw away my trash.**

I force a smile.

— **I’ll handle it.**

— **I need to set something up to scare off that hunter who came through here anyway.**

Tião **nods with his usual smile.**

— **No problem, Doc. Just call if you need anything.**

— **And thanks for letting me onto the property.**

I give him a casual wave.

— **The house is yours!**

---

I step inside, grab my truck keys, and head into town.

**I need to figure this out.**

I want to buy **a camera, some security devices, and a few tools.**

**I’m going to catch this hunter red-handed.**

But the **town has nothing.**

The **only** electronics store is tiny, filled with **outdated, useless equipment.**

I chat briefly with the clerk, but it’s clear—

**I won’t find what I need here.**

But he does give me a suggestion:

— **If you're worried about security, get a dog.**

— **My cousin has a kennel here in town. He breeds and sells to São Paulo. He might have a trained one for you.**

# The idea of being at the mercy of some stranger who could walk into my property didn’t sit well with me.

**But having a dog?**

**That...**

**That seemed like a much better option than being defenseless.**

**I head to the kennel the clerk mentioned and introduce myself to the owner, a guy named Gabriel.**

**I explain my situation—everything that happened.**

**He listens, shakes his head, and comments:**

**— Damn. Never thought anyone would actually buy the mansion on Estrada da Jurema.**

**— When we were kids, we used to play around there all the time.**

**— The old folks say it’s haunted. And honestly? No one goes there at night.**

**He chuckles.**

**But then, his tone shifts slightly.**

**— To be real with you, though… that place was caught up in some endless inheritance dispute.**

**— Legally, it couldn’t be sold for decades.**

**— So people just made up ghost stories to explain why it stayed abandoned for so long.**

**— Really? I had no idea. — I say absentmindedly, barely registering his words.**

**— I bought it for the isolation. For the peace and quiet.**

**Gabriel smirks.**

**— Oh, you’ll definitely get peace and quiet out there.**

**— The heir to the place is Dona Firmina. You must’ve bought it from her.**

**I freeze for a second.**

**Dona Firmina?**

**I had never heard that name before.**

**I bought the mansion through a judicial auction but...**

**Gabriel keeps talking:**

**— Dona Firmina’s old now. Lost her mind in that place and ended up in an asylum…**

**— WHAT?!**

**My voice comes out louder than I intended.**

**Gabriel bursts out laughing.**

**— Nah, just messing with you, man.**

**— She still lives in town. She’s doing fine, despite her age.**

**— Totally sane, no asylum.**

**— In fact, when word got out that the mansion had sold, people started hitting her up for loans.**

**— But with all the debts she had, she barely saw any of the money.**

**He says this like it’s just another trivial detail.**

**After chatting some more, I realize a puppy wouldn’t be much help.**

**So Gabriel sells me Brutus—**

**A massive, fully trained German Shepherd.**

**If I hadn’t been told otherwise, I’d swear this thing was part wolf.**

**I spend about two hours getting familiar with Brutus.**

**Despite his sheer size, he’s incredibly gentle.**

**But before I leave, Gabriel gives me a warning:**

**— Don’t get too comfortable, Doc.**

**— He’s playful now. But if you give the command…**

**— He could rip someone’s arm clean off.**

---


# The whole ordeal of getting a dog took up my entire day.

**It was already getting dark when I drove back to the mansion, Brutus in the truck bed.**

**As we passed Tião’s house, I noticed something.**

**The old oil lamp was lit.**

**No electricity.**

**Poor guy.**

**Can’t be easy living like that.**

**Maybe I should insist on helping.**

**No one was at the door.**

**But Brutus noticed something.**

**Without warning, he started barking like mad toward Tião’s house.**

**My heart jumped.**

**What the hell?**

**I stepped on the gas.**

**I didn’t want to bother Tião with Brutus's barking.**

# Back home.

**Brutus did what any dog would do—he tried to walk into the mansion with me.**

**I ignored him.**

**I stored the dog food I bought from Gabriel, set up water and kibble outside, and walked inside.**

**Brutus let out a small whimper, grumbled a bit, but I didn’t care.**

**The whole point of him being here was to protect the property.**

**He needed to stay outside.**

**I made myself dinner, wasted some time on the internet, and went to bed.**

# I should have paid attention to his behavior.

**But I didn’t.**

---


# 7:00 AM.

**I woke up feeling well-rested.**

**I got dressed.**

**And that’s when I felt it.**

**The necklace I had found by the stream was still in my shirt pocket.**

**Weird.**

**I had completely forgotten about it.**

**I went looking for the first necklace.**

**But it was nowhere to be found.**

**I ended up washing the one I had and, without thinking much about it, put it back in my pocket.**

**I wanted to go online and research more about it.**

**But something unsettled me.**

**I needed to check on Brutus.**

**I opened the front door.**

**And my breakfast nearly came back up.**

---


# The entrance of the house was drenched in blood.

**Right in front of the mansion—**

**A dog’s severed paw.**

**Probably Brutus’s.**

**Blood trails stretched across the ground.**

**My head spun.**

**I followed the trails.**

**And then—**

**I found pieces of Brutus scattered everywhere.**

# His head was behind the small chapel, on the highest part of the property.

**Behind the chapel, I noticed holes in the ground.**

**Had Brutus been digging?**

**Or had something else started digging?**

**I took a step closer.**

**And then I saw them.**

**Small. Old. Gravestones.**

# This wasn’t a normal cemetery.

**It was a secluded part of the property.**

**A place reserved for the dead.**

# But that can wait.

**Let the dead stay where they are.**

**The real problem is my goddamn dog.**

**It must have been a jaguar.**

**I should have listened to Tião.**

**I should have been more careful with the wildlife.**

**Running around the property, under the scorching sun, searching for Brutus’s remains, left me dizzy.**

**I sat down for a moment.**

**Maybe it was the stress.**

**Maybe it was the fear.**

**Fear of a jaguar?**

**They’re nocturnal.**

**There’s no way one would attack me now.**

**Then what the fuck am I afraid of?**

**Ghosts? They don’t exist.**

**Corpses? They’re already dead.**

**What harm can they do? What, give me an infection?**

**My vision darkens.**

# I black out.

---


# I wake up in the middle of the afternoon.

**I’m dirty.**

**Lying on top of one of the graves.**

**My nails are caked with dirt.**

**And bleeding.**

**Looks like I was digging.**

**Desperately.**

**Futilely.**

**Probably the shock of seeing Brutus like that triggered something in my psyche.**

# I get up.

**I go back to the mansion.**

**I take a shower.**

**I get dressed.**

**I pack a bag.**

**I need to find someone to kill that jaguar.**

**Until that happens, I can’t sleep here.**

**I need to find a hotel.**

**I’ll come back tomorrow morning with someone to—**

**I don’t know.**

**Set traps?**

**Fence the property?**

**Do something.**

**Fucking nature.**

**I wasn’t expecting a jaguar.**

# I drive back to town, speeding.

**My head keeps spinning.**

**I’m seething over Brutus’s death.**

**But…**

**Was that really the only thing bothering me?**

# It’s late afternoon.

**I can’t find a hotel.**

**Just a small inn, a little far from the town center.**

**Looks like a simple place.**

**Which makes sense.**

**Who the hell would come visit this nowhere town?**

**An old Black woman runs the place.**

**I explain that I had a domestic accident and need to stay somewhere else for the night until I sort things out.**

**I’d rather not go into details. Trying to explain everything to this woman…**

**But she just looks at me.**

**Her voice is calm. Steady.**

**— Son, go rest. Get some sleep. You seem agitated.**

**— Here, you are protected.**

---

**Protected from what, exactly?**

**I think about asking.**

**But I drop it.**

**The adrenaline was fading.**

**I needed to sleep.**

# And sleep, I did.

---


# I wake up in my room at the inn.

I glance at the clock.

**It’s 11:30 PM.**

**Silence.**

Then, I hear **voices.**

Coming from **the back of the property.**

**The smell of burning wood.**

A **bonfire?**

The voices **aren’t clear.**

**Something feels off.**

I get up and move **through the darkness**, still inside the inn.

I stop near **a window facing the back.**

I slowly pull the curtain aside.

**And I start to watch.**

# At the far end of the property, hidden among the shadows, a few people were gathered.

A… **terreiro \*?** 

***Note***\*: A "terreiro" is a sacred space where such rituals take place, often linked to religions like Candomblé or Umbanda. In Brazilian folklore, these places are sometimes seen as connected to spirits, both good and bad—especially in horror stories.\*

Honestly, **I don’t even know what to call this shit.**

All I know is that **people who are out of touch with reality think they can talk to the dead in places like this.**

**All I need right now is a hunter.**

Someone to go there and **take down a wild animal.**

Preferably **without involving the authorities.**

**And instead, the universe sticks me in a rundown inn with some kind of spirit-calling bullshit in the backyard?**

**Fuck this.**

I decide to grab my things and leave.

I’ll come back **in the morning to pay for the night.**

I quietly close the curtain.

I turn around **slowly.**

And a **shiver** runs from the base of my spine to my neck.

---


# She’s there.

The old woman.

**Watching me.**

— **Son, you’re not well.**

Her tone is **calm.**

**Almost maternal.**

— **You’re the young man who bought Dona Firmina’s house, aren’t you?**

Her eyes **seem to see past me.**

— **Don’t you want to tell me what’s going on?**

I **swallow dry.**

— **Look, ma’am, I don’t mean to be rude, but honestly, no.**

Or rather…

To be **totally honest**, I really just need **a hunter.**

— **There’s a jaguar on my property.**

— **It killed my dog.**

— **And if I want to have my peace back, I need to get rid of that thing.**

I force an awkward chuckle.

— **So, if you don’t mind… Unless you happen to know a hunter that works 24 hours.**

She **stares at me** for a moment that lasts **too long.**

Then, she **speaks, calmly.**

— **Of course, son. If that’s what you want, go ahead.**

She pauses.

Then, with **absolute certainty** in her voice, she adds:

— **But I’d bet anything that the one who killed your dog…**

She tilts her head slightly.

— **Was you.**

---


# My body turns cold.

That statement, **completely disconnected from reality,** sends a wave of terror through me.

— **Look… We don’t know each other, but I’ve never even killed a damn ant.**

My voice comes out **sharper than I intended.**

— **Let alone a dog I paid good money for.**

I pause.

Then I add:

— **You’re probably saying this to extort me.**

— **To blackmail me with some kind of animal cruelty accusation or something…**

She lets out a slow sigh.

Then, in **a hushed voice**:

— **Son…**

Her tone is more **sad than accusatory.**

— **You don’t see it.**

**But I do.**

— **He’s right behind you.**

— **Laughing.**

— **Waiting for just one more night.**

She **pauses.**

Then, she **smiles softly.**

— **When you decide to believe me… call me.**

Her voice is **steady, confident.**

— **I’ll be here waiting.**

# My heart starts racing.

— **Alright, alright, alright.**

I reach into my pocket and pull out a bill.

I throw it onto the floor.

— **Here. That covers my stay.**

My voice comes out **more unsteady than I’d like.**

— **Now, if you don’t mind… I’d like to leave.**

I **walk out fast.**

# I’m not going back to the mansion.

I don’t want to deal with **a jaguar.**

But I’m **sure as hell not sleeping in this place.**

**No fucking way.**

---


# Maybe I should drive to a bigger town.

**Find a real hotel.**

**But no.**

**I feel too exhausted.**

**I drive to a gas station.**

**Lock the car.**

**Recline the driver’s seat.**

**And sleep.**

---


# 10:00 AM.

**I wake up with the sun burning my face.**

**Unshaven.**

**Mouth dry, breath awful.**

**I reach for a mint in the car’s console.**

**Nothing.**

**I must look like absolute shit.**

# I drive back to the mansion.

**I pass by Brutus’s remains.**

**The stench is unbearable now.**

**Dried blood everywhere.**

**I step inside and lock the door.**

**I need to pull myself together.**

**But I can’t think straight.**

**I’m not even hungry.**

# I collapse onto the couch.

**And sleep again.**

---


# I wake up in the stream.

**No boots.**

**Feet wet.**

# The sun looks low.

**It must be around 5:00 PM.**

**Something is happening to me.**

**This must be stress-induced.**

**Some kind of physiological response.**

**A form of sleepwalking.**

# I grab my phone.

**I need to call someone.**

**I need medical attention.**

# No signal.

**Goddamn forest.**

**I climb up to the chapel, on the highest part of the property.**

**The signal should work there.**

**I walk barefoot, my feet scraping against the rocks.**

**I reach the top.**

**Still no signal.**

# But there is something inside the chapel.

**I move closer, carefully.**

**I peek inside.**

---


# Candles.

**Lit.**

# In the center of the chapel, a clay bowl.

**Inside it, rotting entrails.**

**Brutus’s, maybe?**

**I walk toward the back of the chapel.**

**The broken tombstones are still there.**

**But they’ve been rearranged.**

**The stones now spell out names.**

**Dona Isolda Salgado, 1822 - 1854**

**Julieta Salgado, 1844 - 1854**

**Astolfo Salgado, 1843 - 1854**

**Sebastião Salgado, 1801 - 1854**

# I lose my breath.

**They all died the same year.**

**I find myself whispering out loud:**

**— Who the hell arranged this?**

# A shiver runs down my spine.

---

**A voice behind me.**

**Soft.**

**But cutting.**

**— You, son.**

**— It’s all you.**

# I spin around instinctively.

**The old woman from the inn.**

**She’s not alone.**

**Beside her, another woman.**

**Just as old.**

**Maybe older.**

**And a young man.**

**Black. Strong. Built.**

# Adrenaline surges through my body.

**I shout:**

**— What the fuck are you doing here?!**

**She remains calm.**

**— Calm down. Listen to me for five minutes.**

**— If after that you want us gone, we’ll leave.**

**— And we’ll never come back.**

# I grit my teeth.

**My hands tremble.**

**My breathing is heavy.**

**— Fine.**

**I take a deep breath.**

**— Five minutes.**

**I say, impatient.**

**She proceeds, serious:**

**— Before I tell you anything, you need to say these exact words: "I revoke my permission."**

**I recoil.**

**— Permission for what?**

**My voice comes out sharper than I intended.**

**She hardens her gaze.**

**— SAY IT NOW!**

**She shouts.**

**— Fine, fine!**

**— I revoke my permission. Happy?**

**I say it impatiently.**

# Relief is immediate on their faces.

**But before I can even begin to process what just happened—**

**The old woman turns to the young man and orders:**

**— João, now. Make him throw it up.**

# What?!

**Before I can react, João grabs me.**

**His grip is unbelievably strong.**

**He presses my stomach with a force that shouldn’t be possible.**

**My “excellent” engineer physique doesn’t stand a chance.**

**I vomit.**

# And chunks of raw, rotting entrails spill from my mouth.

**(Brutus?)**

**My body shakes.**

**The stench is unbearable.**

**My mind refuses to accept what my eyes are seeing.**

# The old woman looks at me again.

**Her voice is cold. Precise. Irrefutable.**

**— This woman next to me is Dona Firmina.**

**— She’s the great-niece of Dona Isolda.**

**— The grave you were lying on? That was hers.**

**— And I…**

**She pauses.**

**As if debating whether she should go on.**

**Then, she does.**

**— I am the great-granddaughter of the slave that family owned.**

**I feel my heartbeat accelerate.**

**She doesn’t blink.**

**She continues:**

**— Dr. Salgado was obsessed with Dona Isolda.**

**— He was a jealous man. Possessive.**

**— But more than that… he was fascinated by the rituals of my ancestors.**

**— In his madness, he sought a way to live forever—**

**— By Isolda’s side.**

# The chapel feels smaller.

**The air thicker.**

**The old woman doesn’t stop.**

**— After years of searching, he found a slave who promised him a ritual.**

**— A ritual for eternal life.**

**She shakes her head.**

**— I don’t know what that man was planning. Don’t ask me.**

**— But that ritual…**

**She pauses.**

**— Dr. Salgado murdered his entire family.**

**— Then he killed himself.**

**— Right here. In this very chapel.**

# Silence hangs in the air.

**But the old woman still isn’t finished.**

**— The promise that man made to him?**

**— It worked.**

**— Salgado achieved eternal life.**

**— But not as a man.**

**— He became something worse.**

**— He still exists.**

**— But he survives as a demon, by taking the bodies of the living.**

# My breath quickens.

---

**But she doesn’t stop.**

**— My great-grandmother wouldn’t let that happen to Isolda.**

**— She banished Dr. Salgado’s soul from this land.**

**— And without access to his remains…**

**— The ritual became useless.**

# The old woman takes a deep breath.

Then, she **drops the final piece of the puzzle**:

— **In some way, you’ve already met Dr. Salgado.**

— **Maybe by another name.**

— **Sebastião Salgado.**

# My blood turns to ice.

---

**Tião. Short for Sebastião.**

---

The old woman **continues, unwavering**:

— **He and his family haunt this region, beyond the limits of this land.**

— **He as the tormentor.**

— **His wife and children as his victims.**

— **And you…**

— **You let him in.**

— **You gave him access to his remains.**

— **And he nearly took over your body.**

— **He almost cast your soul into the abyss.**

# The weight of her words crushes me.

And then, she tilts her head.

She **studies me.**

Like she’s trying to **figure something out.**

Something **even she doesn’t understand.**

— **But what intrigues me the most…**

She squints slightly.

— **… is how you’re still here.**

— **Something has been protecting you.**

— **And neither you nor I know what it is.**

— **If you ever find out… be grateful.**

— **Because by now…**

She takes a slow breath.

— **You should have already been lost.**

---

# My head pounds.

---

I **force my mind** to process everything.

But it’s **impossible.**

So I say **the only thing I can manage**:

— **Wait.**

My voice **trembles slightly.**

— **I admit… this is all absurdly confusing.**

I pause.

— **But I met Tião.**

— **He’s my neighbor.**

— **I saw his family.**

— **I shook his hand.**

— **How can they be the "ghosts" you claim… if they’re alive just a few kilometers away?**

— **It doesn’t make sense!**

The old woman **smiles.**

But it’s **not just any smile.**

It’s a **smile full of compassion. And pity.**

— **Then why don’t you go visit them?**

She turns to João and Dona Firmina.

— **Take him there.**

— **I’ll stay behind to undo the ritual.**

---


# I don’t hesitate.

I get into my truck.

João and Dona Firmina follow in **an old, battered car.**

**I’m going to prove them wrong.**

# We drive fast to Tião’s house.

The **wattle and daub shack** he called home.

We step out.

I **walk straight to the house.**

**Door closed.**

**Windows shut.**

They follow close behind.

I knock.

**Once.**

**Twice.**

**Three times.**

# Nothing.

The door is **unlocked.**

I push it open.

I turn on my **phone’s flashlight** and shine it inside.

# Cobwebs.

**Dust.**

**Filth.**

# This place hasn’t been lived in for years.

Then, in the middle of what should have been the living room, **something makes my breath hitch.**

A **basket of fruit.**

**Rotten.**

---

# My basket of fruit.

---

I step outside. **Pale.**

My **whole body trembles.**

João and Dona Firmina **look at me with sympathy.**

**They know.**

# Now, I understand.

There is **no denying it anymore.**

Maybe I will **never be the same again.**

# Then, my eyes drift to my truck.

And **my heart stops.**

# Tião is there.

Leaning against it.

**Staring at me.**

# The same smile.

**The smile that never changed.**

Like he **knows.**

Like he **knows exactly what just happened.**

Like he **knows…**

# That this was just the beginning.

**My breath catches.**

I scream.

— **HE! RIGHT THERE! YOU SEE HIM?!**

Dona Firmina **doesn’t even look.**

She just sighs.

And **calmly** says:

— **Son…**

She looks straight into my eyes.

— **There’s no one there.**

# Prologue

I’m in my old apartment in São Paulo, writing this down.

I left that place **yesterday.**

A truck took all my belongings.

I was the last to leave, carrying only my personal items.

I left **the necklace** exactly where I found it—

Tied to the roof beam, where it was.

As I drove away, through the rearview mirror,

I saw him.

# Tião.

Leaning against the gate.

With that **same sinister smile.**

I hope he stays there.

And I pray he **doesn’t follow me here.**
