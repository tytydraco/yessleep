This sure has been an insane past 48 hours or so. Again, I just want to thank everyone who replied to my original post. Y'all mean so much to me, you don't even know. If you missed my original post or the update edit I made to it, [I would encourage you to go back and read it first](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/9PByFFvOkK), as this is sort of a part 2, and I wouldn't want you to be lost.

Basically, the short version is that my boyfriend Steve and his friend Greg have been missing for a month, and all I had was a mysterious voicemail from Steve. Then, Greg showed up at my apartment just a couple of nights ago, missing an arm, an eye an ear, and completely delusional. Please go read my other post, though!!

Alright, so to start, it is of some small importance that I've worked as an assistant nurse at the local ER for the past year. I guess maybe I should have clarified that in my previous post? I'm not sure, but regardless, keep that in mind for later.

Anyway, I got back from my shift to my apartment at around eleven last night. I was tired, yes, but I had resolved to investigate the address that had been left scribbled on a scrap of paper by Greg. I'm not sure whether or not he wrote that here in the apartment, or if he had written it a while ago and it had just fallen out of one of his pockets or something, but either way, it doesn't matter much. I didn't really know what to bring with me, so I didn't end up bringing much. Just a flashlight, a 30-foot yellow rope, my cell, and a sharpened kitchen knife (yes, I scare easily, I know). I put all that in my purse and navigated my way to the Markham building.

I am actually quite familiar with the Markham building, at least the exterior of it, as I pass it on my way to work every afternoon. I was unaware of the name attached to it, though. As I looked at it last night, walking quietly towards its dark entryway, I shivered. It looked much more ominous and imposing than I had ever seen it, but that could have just been my stupid mind messing with me. Initially, I had worried about being spotted by security cameras, but the decrepit looks of the building assured me that modern technology would be hard to come across here.

I looked down at the scrap of paper again. "Markham Building, 13th floor," it said. It was a very hot and humid summer night, despite the fact that it was now half an hour past midnight. The air was very still, and there was virtually no traffic around. The Markham building is very old. I probably should have done more research on its history, but perhaps another day. Anyway, I knew enough to know that it was all but abandoned, or at least everything, but the first floor is seldom used. I wasn't sure how I was going to get in. The door wouldn't budge when I pushed on it. I figured it was locked. I turned on my flashlight to try to find another way in, but to my surprise, it was then that I saw through the glass entrance why the door wasn't moving. A desk had been pushed up against the door from the inside, as if it was some kind of barricade. I'm not sure who did that or why. That just seems super odd to me. Did somebody know I was coming and try to keep me out? Why not just lock the door. Maybe they didn't have a key? I'm still confused on that whole detail.

I decided that in order to get in, my only real hope was in moving that desk somehow. I pushed with all my might against the glass door but only managed to move it forward, maybe an inch at most before the desk became completely immovable. I decided then to walk around the perimeter of the building to see if there were any other ways in. There were two more doors, but both of them were locked for real. I realized that there was only one way I was gonna be able to get into that building. I'm not sure if this was legal (probably not, so this is my confession I guess :P), but I backed my mom's pickup as close to the entrance as I could, which was about 20 feet away or so. Then I pulled the rope I had brought out of my purse and slid the end of it through the one-inch gap in the door. I worked the rope for several minutes until I had managed to loop it around one of the legs of the desk. Then I tied a knot and pulled it as tight as I could. I took the other end of the rope and tied that around the trailer hook on the back of the pickup. Then, I climbed back into the front seat and prayed for my plan to work. I turned the key in the ignition, and after taking a deep breath, I floored the accelerator, shooting forward. The engine was loud, but I could still hear the sound of smashing glass behind me as I pulled the desk through both of the glass front doors.

A minute later I had parked the truck back in the lot next door and was making my way over broken glass through the front entrance to the Markham building. I didn't pay much attention to what was on the first floor, as the note Greg had left had clearly mentioned floor 13. From what I can remember, the first floor was dark, but had some signs of being used recently, but again, I'm really not sure by whom or for what. I hurried along over to the stairwell, and was about to make my way up it, when I saw something that surprised me. A brand new, shiny, sleek elevator. It looked incredibly out of place in this dingy place, and I'm not kidding when I say it was the newest, most modern elevator I've ever seen in my life. I suddenly started worrying that there might be a lot of security cameras here after all, so I avoided the elevator entirely and began climbing the stairs.

The stairs were long and steep. I'm not short by any means, but the stairs seemed very tall and uneven in spots. They must've been very old. The climb was otherwise uninteresting and uneventful, except I did at one point begin to feel like something was deeply, deeply wrong. Like someone or something was watching me from behind. I swerved around in a panic, shining my flashlight in every direction, but there was nothing there, obviously. I don't believe in ghosts at all, but if there was a place I would ever run into one, I felt like this would be the place. I didn't do much exploring of the various floors, thinking back on it now I wish I had, but what I did see of them was what one would expect of an office building abandoned in the 90's. Cubicles are filled with old, fat desktop computers that were covered in dust. There was a bit more lab equipment than what I would have expected though, now that I think about it. Signs everywhere read "HexSoft" this and "HexSoft" that. I had never heard the name before, but I figured it must be a tech company of some sort.

Anyway, I finally arrived on the 12th floor. I don't know what I had expected to find when I crossed over to floor 13, but I was admittedly pretty scared to find out. There was something oppressive in the air. Not only that, the air smelled foul. Like something rotting. Like a body. It wasn't an overpowering smell, but it was most certainly present, and I happen to have an especially sensitive nose. I didn't linger long on floor 12.

I climbed the final stair case, and reached the heavy metal door that held so much mystery behind it. My heart was beating so fast I could feel it in my throat. The stench had grown stronger and more putrid than before. Was there something dead behind the door? Was it... Steve? No. I refused to entertain that thought. Steve is alive. Greg said Steve was alive and so he is and that's all there is to it. I pushed on the door... and it didn't move. It was locked. How could that be? None of the other doors were locked! Was the same person responsible for baracading the front entrance responsible for making it impossible to get through this one too? I don't know, but I do know that I was frustrated. All that built up anticipation and I didn't get to see the other side of that door? I might just so happened to let out a "Damn it!" and kick the door really hard with my boot, but who's to say?

Tearfully, I turned to leave, but just as I did so, I realized that I had almost forgotten something. The elevator! I could ride the elevator up to the next floor! I slapped my forehead. "Kristen, you silly goose!" I forced myself to chuckle. I was about to retreat down the steps again, when I recalled something else. All the doors all had little square glass windows. Maybe I could shine my flashlight through and at least see the 13th floor from a distance? The glass was covered with grime, but I removed my hair tie and applied a little spit (yes, gross, I get it), and wiped the dirt off as best I could. Then I picked up my flashlight and shined my light through the glass. I recoiled almost immediately. I was not prepared for what I saw.

On the floor, in front of the elevator door, was a decomposing left arm. Next to what appeared to be a small pile consisting of printed out photos, coins, a finger, an ear, a watch and an eyeball.

That's what the smell had been! I gagged at the thought and stumbled back down the steps. Were those Greg's body parts? It seems obvious to me now, but, my gosh... why?? Why the f*ck did he do that?? My experience as an assistant nurse was enough for me to be able to tell that that arm was severed off. Painfully, with some kind of rough hacking tool.

I was absolutely not going to the 13th floor now. Not today. I felt like I was gonna vomit. I don't do well with things like that (I work at a hospital not a morgue!)

I stood, panting for breath on the 12th floor. Suddenly, that feeling of being watched returned. And I could have sworn I heard whispering in the distance. I shined my flashlight all around and didn't see anyone. What I did see, though, were boxes upon boxes of files, floppy disks, and VHS tapes. The boxes appeared to have sustained heavy water damage. I quietly picked up one of the tapes on top of the box ([pic of the tape](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17uCkPerdTTW3HMAe_4fnQfmeKD_LjySM/view?usp=drivesdk)), where damage was least likely to affect the quality of whatever was on here. It said "HexSoft, Intro Tape, '97." I had already broken and entered, so what's a little petty theft gonna do at this point? I hid the tape in my blouse and decided that I could come back for more next time. I just wanted out in that moment. Then, I heard something for sure. It sounded like somebody's shoe bumping into an empty can and sending it rolling across the floor. That was the last straw. I bolted. I was terrified to look back. It felt like something or somebody evil was chasing me, right on my heals.

I must've made it to floor 1 in record time for that building. Believe me, I flew!

I burst out the front door and didn't breathe easy again until I was safely back home.

The tape was so flipping weird, man. I'm not sure if it's connected to why Steve and Geg went missing, though. Luckily, I happen to have a VHS to digital recording device, [so I can link a recording of it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WY0BTWL-K2rRzhwEqfVl7UwQXLGe0AL7/view?usp=drivesdk) so that and you can see it for yourself! :)

Ugh... I'm just missing Steve a lot rn. Steve. If you're out there. I'm hugging you hard!

-Love Kristen
