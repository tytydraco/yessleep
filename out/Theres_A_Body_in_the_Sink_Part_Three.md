Anika’s pastor arrived on our porch five minutes after ten. He greeted us with a warm, friendly smile, and shook our hands with a solid grip.

“I’m Pastor Bachalan,” he introduced himself. “But most people just shorten it to Pastor Bach.”

“You look too old for nicknames.” Charles eyed him head to foot. “Trying to be hip with the kids and all that?”

“Ah, it's a childhood thing that never went away.” The pastor laughed. “Most of the congregation were neighborhood friends of mine.”

Despite the man’s amiable air, Charles’ already-wary expression turned even warier. Thankfully, Sam cut in before the atmosphere could get awkward, and welcomed our visitor inside. I ushered Charles out of the way as everyone headed for the kitchen.

“You okay?” I asked.

Charles nodded stiffly. “Fine, I’ve just…never gotten along well with church folk.”

There was a story there, but Charles had started picking his cuticles, so I didn’t press. There were a million reasons for people to be ambivalent toward the religious; whichever one Charles had wasn’t any of my business. I nodded, and we both joined the others in the kitchen.

When we got there, Sam and Anika were animatedly explaining the situation to Pastor Bachalan. Dominic sat by the table and watched them; Leo stood posted by the doorway, his gaze flitting around and notably avoiding the sink. His brother, I remembered, he said the head in the basin looked like his brother.

I hung back with him while Charles took a seat across from Dominic. I had no interest in being in the kitchen if I didn’t have to anyway. The way the corpse head—my sister’s—discolored eyes slid toward me one at a time further cemented my apprehension.

In the room, Pastor Bachalan nodded as Anika and Sam finished their wild gesturing.

“I see.” He pulled his right sleeve back. “And you said it appeared…here?” He shuffled closer to the sink and motioned just above the pool. His pinky brushed against the corpse head’s hair.

I tensed, holding my breath as the nudged strands fell over the corpse’s face. The others looked ready to bolt.

“I…yeah.” Sam glanced between the corpse and the pastor. “Yeah, it’s…right there.”

Pastor Bachalan hummed.

Then, with all the calm in the world, he stuck his hand into the flooded sink.

Chaos broke out: voices overlapped in screams of *“What the fuck?!”, “What the hell are you doing?!” “JESUS CHRIST!”*—chairs scraped as Dominic and Charles jumped to their feet and backed up—Leo and I scrambled back into the hallway.

“What?” Pastor Bachalan glanced from person to person. The disfigured head an inch away from his wrist bobbed in the newly-disturbed water. “What is it?”

“Don’t—don’t stick your hand in there, you madman!” Charles yelled. “That thing might…I don’t know, but it could do something!”

The pastor frowned. “What will?”

“The head!” Charles frantically motioned to the sink. “It could spawn the rest of its body or something. Get the hell away from it!”

Pastor Bachalan…just stared at him. My stomach dropped.

“…tell me, son,” he said. “What’s in the sink, exactly?”

“What are you *talking about?”* Charles’ voice cracked at the end of his question. “Are you blind? It’s flooded with sewage and there’s a head in it!”

The pastor’s stare melted into something more pitying. I looked away just so I didn’t have to see it; I already knew what he was going to say.

“There’s nothing there, son.” Pastor Bachalan pulled his hand back—the pool rippled with the movement, but his arm rose out of the water bone dry. “The sink is empty.”

Later, he sat us down in the living room and told us about spiritual attacks and war on the mind. I turned most of it out—not on purpose, but every time I attempted to focus, my eyes wandered to the kitchen doorway. I couldn’t see the head from where I was sitting on the couch, but my thoughts meandered to it anyway. That strange, ever-changing thing, different to each of Bonifacio Grove’s inhabitants and non-existent to everyone else. It occurred to me that I didn’t know what Anika saw it as, or if any of my housemates had asked her in the time I was asleep.

What ghost peered up from the water for her? A sibling, a cousin, a parent? Or was it something even more unexplainable and confusing, like Charles seeing a deceased version of himself? If we knew, would we find the throughline to what this haunting of ours was? Did it matter? Would knowing help us fix all this?

I snapped out of my scatterbrained fugue when Pastor Bachalan offered to pray for us. I bowed my head, just to be polite.

He left us with invitations to his church Sunday’s service. The building were just a few minutes’ ride away from us, and no more than half an hour on foot. Nobody returned the offer with affirmatives. Not even Anika, who just stared at the floor with the devastation of someone bereaved.

“So we’re fucked,” Dominic concluded, once we were all alone. He paced a grove into the living room carpet. “We’re just fucking crazy. Making all this shit up.”

Nobody answered. I hunched forward and buried my face in my palms.

It was starting to sound like that, what with the contents of the sink invisible to everyone but us. Maybe this was a seven-person hysteria. Maybe our ‘loops’ back to this house had never happened. Maybe we’d never left the house at all and were vegetative in a corner somewhere joint-hallucinating all of this.

“…maybe we’re being punished,” Anika murmured. I parted my fingers to look at her. “Maybe we need to repent. These kinds of curses are brought onto people because of their sins.”

Charles scoffed and crossed his arms; the action finally ripped Anika’s attention away from the floor. She snarled: “And that’s exactly the kind of behavior that makes the Lord angry in the first place.”

“I didn’t do anything.” Charles lifted his hands in surrender.

“The mocking and the scoffing, Charles!” Anika pointed an accusing finger at him as her voice climbed to a shout. “You don’t mock God’s people!”

“Oh, *Christ.”* Dominic cut in with a roll of his eyes. “I forgot we actually had someone crazy in this house. Whatever, I’m leaving.”

“What?” Sam’s head snapped up, at the same time Anika’s finger swung at Dominic and she shrieked:

“And *you’re* too short-tempered! The Word warns about anger being sin—”

“Everything’s a fucking sin to you people,” Dominic bit back.

“Wait, hang on, calm down.” Sam rose and put his arms out in his usual placating stance. His now-familiar peacekeeper smile plastered itself on his face, though it faltered at the edges. To Anika, he said: “I don’t think a fight is going to help us right now, okay?” Then, to Dominic: “And we’ve already tried leaving—Elise is *still* trying to leave—but we just keep ending up back here.”

“I *know* that, asshole.” Dominic glowered. “But this place is gonna have to let me leave, or I’m burning it the fuck down.”

Something thudded in the kitchen. I turned with a start, braced as I waited for whatever made the noise to do it again, or come crawling out, or do whatever other horrible thing this place had in store for us. A second passed, two, three—nothing happened.

“Guys?” Charles called out.

I turned back toward him. He was pointing to the smooth, unbroken mahogany walls. Wait—

“The windows are gone.”

Dread lanced up my spine. I stared at the walls—the spots where there should have been windows were now uninterrupted panels of wood.

Charles abruptly stood. “Everybody get out.” He pushed Sam, then Dominic toward the doorway. “Now. *Now, now, now! GO!”*

The six of us bolted down the hall. Dominic shoved and elbowed his way to the lead; Leo almost tripped when he was pushed, but I grabbed his arm and pulled him back upright before he could hit hardwood. We raced to the front door—or where the front door used to be, as nothing greeted us there but a wall.

*“Shit!”* Sam hissed.

The doors were gone too. Whatever this was—this *house* was caging us in.

Dominic made an irritated noise. “Ah, *fuck it.”*

He backed up, brought up his foot, and *smashed* it into the wall. Plaster cracked. Wood splintered. A trickle of dark water oozed through the damage like blood beading out a wound.

The sight made my heartbeat roar in my ears. “Wait, Dominic—”

Dominic kicked the wall again, hitting right at the injury he’d already inflicted. The wood cratered. Water splashed all over the floor. Dominic didn’t seem to notice, or if he did, he wasn’t alarmed by it, as he brought his foot down again—

“Dominic!” I pushed past Leo.

—and again—

“Dominic, *stop!”*

—and again—

The wall ruptured and the ocean flooded through.

The night my sister died—when I spent hours on my house’s roof watching the storm just take and take and take—I’d learned a new fear, learned to be afraid of something more unpredictable and more destructive than my father’s anger. That fear returned as dark water burst through the wounded wall and swept everything in its path.

The world spun, turned upside down, tumbled sideways. I flailed and kicked and thrashed in an attempt to get my bearings. I should have hit a wall by now—the hallway wasn’t *that* big—but nothing stopped my momentum as I hurtled through the deep. There was only water and water and so much more water.

My chest ached. My head hurt. Somehow, Eyeless Mary’s voice rang in my ears as a whisper: *“Do not drown.”*

Bonifacio Grove had two floors. If the first one got flooded, there should still be time before the water rose to the second level. I had to get up there, get to higher ground so I could *breathe.*

I looked around wildly, trying to find shapes and outlines in the water to orient myself. With how dark everything was, the task was impossible, but there were beams of brightness cutting through the flood from above me. I looked up—and there. A rectangle of light.

I kicked my feet and started swimming up. Slowly, painfully, the box of light drew closer and closer. My lungs burned from the lack of oxygen, but I was already doing better than I thought I would be. I was a good swimmer and could hold my breath for a while, courtesy of growing up in rural Cebu, but I still should have run out of air by now. For some reason, I wasn’t even lightheaded.

After an eternity, the light was finally right overhead. I speared my hand through it and—my palm breached the surface and felt air. I slapped it down, hitting water first, then my fingertips brushed the edge of something solid. I crept my hand forward until I was fully bracing it on hard surface, then brought my other one up and heaved myself out of the water.

A ragged gasp escaped me as I bent over whatever I’d beached myself on. I clung there for a few seconds, shoulders trembling with the effort of holding my upper body up. Then, I grit my teeth and started the painful crawl onto dry ground. My nails dug into…tiles.

I tiredly squinted through my wet hair. Wherever I’d ended up in was dark—not the oppressive, tangible shadows of my drams, thankfully—and it took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust. Vague silhouettes carved themselves out of the flat darkness; there was a fridge, a round wooden table, a set of eight chairs…

I was in the kitchen. Bonifacio Grove’s kitchen. I looked down; I was hauling myself out of the fucking *sink.*

That last bit of realization ignited fresh panic into my limbs. I grabbed the edge of the counter and pulled myself forward with an animalistic noise that was half a groan and half a scream. My upper body tipped, and I banged my forehead on the floor when one of my hands slipped. Hot pain wiped all thought from me for a moment. Something warm trickled down my brow. I sucked a breath through my teeth and sluggishly crawled until my legs were finally out of the sink and all of me sprawled out on the floor.

I rolled on my back, my chest rising and falling in an erratic, feverish rhythm. The water-stained ceiling above me blurred into Rorschach patterns. I thought I could see Mary’s face up there, with two empty eye sockets and a massive black hole of an open-mouthed smile.

The exhaustion had felt like this during the flood too, when I was a terrified child waiting to either die or for the storm to end. I shook the déjà vu off with a wipe of my face, staggered to my feet, and limped toward the sink.

The water was impossible to see through but since that’s where I’d surfaced, the others must still be somewhere down there. Somehow. I had no idea how the house worked anymore.

*“Guys!”* I screamed. *“Up here! Swim up here!”*

No answering ripples from the water. Maybe they’d gotten swept away deeper than I had.

I called for them until my throat hurt and my voice went frail and hoarse. Eventually, my arms tired of holding my weight up, and I had to lay on the wet counter just so I didn’t slide back to the floor. I needed to stay by the sink. If the others didn’t hear me, they might never come up.

The human brain could only last up to a minute without oxygen before brain cells began dying. I considered, for a moment, that there might not be anyone left to come up. Maybe I’d lucked my way into crawling out the godforsaken sink and everyone else had drowned like my sister did.

A hand splashed through the water, flailing madly.

I flinched upright. I grabbed the thrashing hand with both of mine—nearly dropped it with my weak grip—and it dug its nails into my wrist. I hissed in pain, but held on, then leveraged a foot on the bottom of the sink and *heaved.*

Leo breached the dark water.

He wildly slapped his free hand all over the counter in search of purchase while I hauled the rest of his body out. Once free, he rolled onto the floor with a grunt; the weight displacement took me with him.

Sam rose from the sink next. I stumbled back up to help him out. He got his bearings faster than Leo—we lifted Charles out next together, then Anika, then Dominic. Our last man hit the floor like dead weight, but despite his near-immobility from fatigue, he was still shouting curses at everybody in the room. Leo had swam too slow for his liking. Charles had accidentally elbowed him in the face while in the water. Sam and I had taken too long in hoisting him up.

I slumped to the floor with a hysterical laugh. My voice broke into sobs by the end of my mad laughter.
