I went to the club like I normally do. It was a friday night and I was feeling in the mood to dance. I am a single guy that normally goes out alone. Not because I dont have friends, it's just that my friends would rather play tabletop games instead of dance at the club. There are a few clubs I enjoy and I chose from them randomly. I wish I had chosen another one.



The first couple hourswent by well. I sang and I danced. The music and the smells were all encompassing. I danced with some, some danced with me. It was honestly turning into a good night. Then I steped outside to cool off.



There were a bunch of people doing the same as me. We talked for a bit and passed around a few. Then the man with bangles on his wrists butted into our conversation. "I can tell your blind because I have been doing gang signs in front of you and you havent reacted." I was stunned. 


'First off gang signs? Secondly he was testing my blindness? Screw this guy.' I thought to myself. "Look mate I gotta get back to it." I tried to break away from the conversation. 

"Can I hold your white stick?" the second thing the man said unnerved me more than the first. "No. Mate no one but me holds my cane." "Come on I will only hold it for a bit." This dude was throwing up crimson flags and I needed to gtfo. 


He had pissed me off though. "You dont go asking a man in a wheelchair if you can sit in there chair. Like what the fuck mate?" with that I moved back inside. Away from him and near the people.



I had been marked by him though, little did I know. Not ten minutes later I am dancing with some girl. She moves on as the songs move on and I start dancing with another. This person though had a sound about them I recognized. That clatter clack of the bangles on his writs. "Let me hold that big white cane of yours." he said while I could feel his hand trying to reach into my cane pocket. "No dude. Go away." I told him before I broke through some dancers and tried to get distance. 


I went to the bar and grabed a water. It was nice and cold on my parched throat. Something didn't feel quite right though. My timing was off and my mind had become a bit fuzzy on the edges. I decided that I needed to go. 


As much as I wanted to stay and dance some more. I didnt feel like getting sick on the dance floor. I hit up the restroom before I left and noticed that I was walking like I was drunk. I dont drink on dance nights, except for water. So I started getting worried. 


My house was only half a mile walk away. I thought I would walk it and hopefully walk off whatever was in my system. 


I heard the bangles while I was taking a piss. It sounded like they were in the stall next to me. It was just one clitter clatter but I knew that noise. He was there just on the other side of the devide. 


I tried to leave stealthly but being blind I can only stelth so long before I run into a trashcan. 'fuck!' I screamed in my head before I slipped out of the mens room. 


This guy had me on edge. I wanted to get home as quickly as possible. Only later did I relize that I could have just told the barkeep what was happening but that was only in hindsight. I pulled out my cane once I left the bathroom and tapped my merry way out. 


Outside I set up my GPS on my phone and the instructions came through a boneconductive headset. Once set up I started walking. 


Tap tap step. Tap tap step. I walked. Cars drove by and sometimes I passed a person or two. Then about two blocks away I heard something new. Tap tap step, clitter-clatter.



'no.' a small voice in me whispered. I continued going and hearing that clitter-clack. I needed an escape, so I kept my ears out. I listened hard to everything around me. Up ahead about a block or two I heard some music and talking. I sped up my walking just a bit. 


When I got close I asked one of the people out front if they could help me. I told them about bangles and asked if they could help me inside for a few minutes. "Ya bro we gotcha." one of them said to me. "Thanks mates that bangles guy was freaking me out." 


We went inside and it was a place unknown to me. All the sounds were off and it was difficult for me to get an idea on the size of the room. By the smells and sounds though, I had found another club. 


I moved through it headed towards the back. I asked a few patrons and was given general instructions. I figured that if I slipped out the back and walked on a nearby street for a bit, I would lose bangles. 


I wasn;t halfway through the back parking lot before I heard the clitter-clatter. It had come from the clubs backdoor. I tried to keep my cool, even though I had started shaking. The vocal instructions home were a saving anchor in that moment. I was only a twenty minute walk away now. I could do this. 


Two blocks later and the clitter-clatters had gotten more agressive behind me. Like the guy was dancing or doing more gang signs. I didnt know but I knew what he was doing. He had slipped me a drug somehow and now he was just waiting for me to tire out. 


I think he thought I would run or something. Blind people don't run, it leads to scars. So he just tormented me with those clitter-clatters dancing all around. I was really starting to panic when I got a few blocks away from my home. I came to the conclusion that if I walk home all the way, he will know where I live. I had to walk home though because busses dont run after 11pm. 


About two blocks away from my house I heard the sound of an engine I recognized. It was my housemate's pos truck. He hadn't picked up the phone earlier so I had thought he went to bed. I waved and he stopped. "Hey Mark did you have a nice time at the club?" He asked as soon as he had his window rolled down. I had already started walking towards the passenger side of the truck. "It was alright but I dont want to walk anymore." I said as I slipped into the passenger side. 


"Hey theres a weird guy wearing alot of pink glaring at me. It's kinda freaking me out." my housemate John said. When he saw I buckled up he drove away quickly. "fuck!" I heard from outside the truck. 


Moments later we pulled up to the house. We both got out and hung out for a bit. After eating and brushing my teeth I headed for bed. I fell asleep quite quickly, my head still fuzzy. Then something woke me.



Now I am typing this here because I dont know what to do. I heard the clitter-clatter from inside my house. It came from down the hall and I heard it again just now but closer. I really hope this is just a messed up drea.
