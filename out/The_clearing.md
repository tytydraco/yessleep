Finally, it was done. After a few weeks of hard work, I was finally able to finish fixing my old mountain bike. There were a lot of problems with it, but after days of hard labor, and a few issues that came in between fixing the different parts of my bike, it was finally ready. I longed for a bike ride down to the nice countryside, between the fields, the beaten paths, and the small woods that were outside the town. After a quick trial run, where I just made sure everything was fine, I decided to go home so I could get some rest, and I would leave tomorrow.

The next day, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I was so excited to go. I wasn’t as rested as I hoped to be. To be honest, I barely slept during the last few days because I just wanted to finish fixing the bike. I tend to be like that: I get so eager to work on a project that I focus solely on it. While I thought I would get some nice rest last night, the excitement got the better of me and I couldn’t sleep properly. Ultimately, my exhaustion did not matter because my excitement was still strong and that gave me the boost of energy I needed to conquer the day.

I left around 11 am, having a general idea of what paths I would take, but I figured that I could try different paths if I saw an opportunity.

The sun on my skin and the light breeze felt amazing. It was the middle of October, but the temperature was warmer than usual, making the day feel marvelous. Maybe it was not so much the weather but simply the feeling of victory of finally being able to go on a long-awaited bike ride, on a bike that I fixed all by myself. After a few miles, I entered one of the woods. At this point, I was completely alone, with only the sounds of birds in the distance. Nature can sometimes feel astonishing, and today was no exception. The quietness, the breeze, the view; all of that simply made me feel more alive than ever. As I was going down the woods, I noticed a path on my left. It felt like I had never seen it before, even though I had ridden in this area several times already. The curiosity got the better of me and I started taking it. I saw a few signs along the path, indicating that it was a trail for hikers that would lead to a small town a few miles away from here. A few minutes later, I saw another path, once again on the left side. I decided to be curious, and I took it as well. I quickly realized that this was not a trail. After a few yards, I entered a small clearing, where I could see that some human activities happened. I stopped and put my bike down: maybe I could find something interesting in here. A lot of trees were cut, and several logs, but mainly branches, were on the floor. I noticed some old bags and canisters at different places, probably abandoned by the workers who came here. Maybe I could find something interesting here; my trip started to feel like a treasure hunt. I didn’t want to steal anything, but based on the looks of everything, it seems that no one came here in a few years. Vegetation had overgrown some of the objects left behind by workers, and some canisters looked rusty.

As I was going further down the clearing, I realized that it was more abandoned than I anticipated. It felt like the place was abandoned overnight. Some equipment looked expensive, such as an old generator, or saws. Why would people leave this here? This seemed a bit too expensive to simply be forgotten here. As I walked, I heard a snap under my feet. At first, I thought it was an old branch, but something about the sound just wasn’t right. I looked down and saw that I stepped on the carcass of a small animal. It looked like a chicken. This made me uncomfortable: why would there be a chicken carcass here? Did people eat some chicken whole and leave it here? This would be the most logical explanation I could think of, but it was likely to be a different animal. This didn’t stop me from going further, after all, I wasn’t a baby, and it’s just old bones. I mean it’s normal and should probably be expected right?

As I ventured deeper into the clearing, I started to notice stranger things. There were some strange markings on some trees. At first, it looked like a mark to distinguish which trees should be cut, but then I realized that some words were written. *Him*. *Apology*. *Never again*. This started to freak me out, but I brushed it off as a prank by some high schoolers who probably came here to drink and smoke joints. I liked my explanation, after all, it was very rational. The only thing is, I didn’t see any cigarette butts or empty bottles, which made me feel a bit nervous. *Ok maybe just a prank with no alcohol involved*, I thought. But why bring paint spray to do it here, when it is likely no one goes around these parts?

Something shiny caught my attention and pulled me away from my thoughts. I turned my head in its direction and started walking there. Here it was, sitting on an old tree stump, a knife that looked brand new. Not only that, but it looked like the expensive kind. It was long, clearly sharpened, and had some golden inscription on it. *Free*. I laughed to myself thinking it was a sign for me to take it. After all, it was *free*, right? At this moment I heard a loud noise coming from the entry of the clearing. It was followed by the noise of something running through the branches. I turned around quickly, and I tried to see if I could see something. As I did that, the noise abruptly stopped. I dropped the knife on the ground and took a few steps back. For some reason, I started to feel uncomfortable. This place was weird and started to creep me out. I decided to walk back to where my bike was and leave. I picked up my pace, feeling more and more uncomfortable. As I did so, it felt like I kept hearing rustling noises around me. Every time I turned my head towards the direction of the sound, it stopped. At this point, I was almost running. As I arrived at the entrance of the clearing my heart started racing: I couldn’t see my bike anywhere. I looked around frantically but couldn’t see it. I knew I left it there, right at the entrance, but it simply wasn’t around anymore. As I started to panic, I heard more rustling noises coming from my right. I looked there, expecting to see something or someone, but once again the noise stopped right as I looked in its direction. I decided to gather all my courage and walk towards it. There were a few trees, but after that was simply an empty field. I turned back, walked back to the entrance of the clearing, and yelled: “Hey that’s not funny, give me my bike back assholes!”

No answer.

As I kept looking around frantically, I noticed a small white mass on the left side of the entrance. I walked toward it, wondering why I hadn’t seen it earlier, in the hopes that it was my bike. I knew deep down inside me that it was unlikely, especially since my bike was mainly black, but I couldn’t stop hopping. As I got close to it, I realized the horror that was in front of me: it was a small pile of bones, some of which looked bigger than the chicken carcass I found. The bones were big enough to belong to something bigger, like a deer, a cow, or a man. As I got even closer to it, trying to identify what animal they belonged to, I realized that they were piled up in a precise manner, as if someone put them there intentionally. This was too much for me. My heart was beating so fast, and I started to feel really scared. What the hell was this place? Part of me started contemplating leaving the area and never coming back, but I simply couldn’t stop looking for my bike. At this point, my levels of fear and nervousness were out of proportion. I never felt that way before. And that’s when it happened: I heard laughter, very close, from behind me. Not just any laughter, but the clear sound of a child giggling. It was not an adult, it was not the potential high schoolers that I feared, it was a child. I didn’t want to turn around. I didn’t want to find out. As soon as I realized what happened, I bolted out of the clearing and ran back to the path I initially took. I didn’t care about my bike; I was too freaked out. If it was a prank, it was an elaborate one, because I never saw anyone in there. *Have fun with the bike assholes*, I thought as I ran away.

After a few hours, I arrived in front of my house after a mix of running and walking. I was exhausted, and after a bit of thinking, I figured that I should call some friends to go back there with me. I didn’t care about the bike anymore, but I hoped to see the prankster behind this elaborate scheme. With other people with me, I would have a chance of understanding all of that better and be ready if something were to happen.

As I looked up toward my house, I realized that someone was in the front yard. After the events of the day, it felt unsettling, and I was tense. However, the tension immediately released as I realized it was Mark, one of my high school friends.

“Hey dude!” he started, “I came to see you five minutes ago but you weren’t here. I was about to leave when I saw you walk up the streets. Dude, I really wanted to say congrats! You did a terrific job here,” he added.

“What?” I asked. “What are you talking about now? Man, you’re not gonna belie-” I tried to say, before getting interrupted by Mark.

“The bike! It’s amazing, you really did fix it! I’ll be honest with you, I had little hopes, but you did it!” he exclaimed.

“I’m sorry Mark, but what the fuck are you talking ab—” I stopped.

Behind Mark was the bike. The same bike I had been working on for the last weeks. The exact bike I had just lost. It was right in front of me, on the side of the wall where Mark was standing.

“Anyway, you shouldn’t just leave it like that in the open if you go on a walk, someone could steal it from you. That’d be a shame after the efforts you put into it” Mark continued.

I was speechless. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What was going on? Was I exhausted to the point where reality didn’t make any sense anymore? Did I just dream all of that?

“Oh, by the way, what is up with the flyer? I found it on your doorstep” Mark added. “I don’t get it, there’s not much on it. Did someone just leave that here or what?” he asked me while handing me a small poster. It was completely white, with just one word written on it. As I looked at it, my heart stopped for a second as I read the single word: *free*.
