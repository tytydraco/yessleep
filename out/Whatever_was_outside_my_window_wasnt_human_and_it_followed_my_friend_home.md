We were around 17 and dabbling in stuff we shouldn’t have been. It started with simple things—candle sigils, dream journals, reading about astral projection online. Jess and I used to stay up all night researching spirit boards and protection spells like it was a game.

My mom hated it. She was furious when she found the small altar we’d made in the basement. She said we were “inviting darkness into the house.” At the time, we thought she was just being dramatic. Another adult who didn’t get it.

But then… weird things started happening.

It was little stuff at first. Footsteps upstairs when no one was home. Whispers through the walls that we couldn’t quite make out. Even my mom heard them once. She didn’t say a word—just looked at me like she already knew I was the reason.

I started sleeping with the light on. Jess thought it was all really cool.

“It’s just energy,” she said. “We’re probably getting closer.”

One night, Jess stayed over. She was on the floor in a sleeping bag, passed out with her phone in one hand. I couldn’t sleep. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted.

That’s when I heard it.

A soft rattling at the window.

I thought it might be the wind, or a branch. But when I looked—just a glance—I saw something. A shape. A face.

It was pressed against the glass.

A horned, goat-like creature. Its horns curled back like a ram’s, and its face was pale white and stretched. It was tall, hunched, with hooves, not hands, braced against the pane. But it didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just stared.

Something deep inside me knew: Don’t look.
That’s the rule.
If you don’t look, you’re safe.

So I turned over, shut my eyes tight, and forced myself to sleep. I didn’t even tell Jess.

The next morning, the window was fogged up from the cold. But there were two dark smears pressed against the outside.

Not handprints.

Hoofprints.

I finally told Jess over lunch. She didn’t laugh. She didn’t even doubt me. She just leaned forward and said:

 “Like… a goatman?”

"Yeah,” I told her. “Exactly.”

Jess was obsessed with cryptids. Bigfoot, Mothman, you name it. Her Myspace was a shrine to the weirdest corners of the internet. So of course, she believed me. She actually wanted to see it.

"I’m staying up tonight,” she said. “I want to see it with my own eyes.”

“No,” I said. “You don’t get it. I think it wants us to look. That’s how it starts.”

She just smiled.

“Then I’ll test it. If I die, you can say I told you so.”

That night, I got ready like I was suiting up for war—earplugs, sleep mask, hood up, turned away from the window. Jess had her thermos and phone on the floor beside her, ready to ghost-hunt.

But I woke up anyway.

The earplugs hurt. I pulled them out, took off my mask to grab my water bottle, and glanced at the window. The curtain was mostly shut, but there was a gap. I thought I saw something move behind it.

I put the mask back on. Told myself I imagined it.

It felt like five minutes passed. Maybe ten.

Then I woke up again.

No sound. No movement. Just wrongness.

I sat up and took off the mask.

The curtain was wide open.

And it was right there.

The goatman was pressed against the window, face smashed to the glass like a starving thing trying to force its way through. Its mouth was wide open in a silent scream, jaw unnaturally long, throat black and endless. The horns scraped against the frame.

It was staring right at me.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I just reached down and nudged Jess. She sat up slowly. Still groggy.

Then she saw it.

Her breath caught in her throat. She didn’t scream. She just froze. Her eyes locked on it, just like mine.

I whispered, “Close the curtain. Now.”

She didn’t move.

“Jess. Please. Don’t look at it. Just close it.”

Her hand reached up and slowly dragged the curtain shut.

The window disappeared behind the fabric.

But we could still feel it.

Tap.

One soft knock.

It was still there. Waiting.

Jess left the next morning. She didn’t say much. Just packed her stuff and left.

A week passed before I heard from her again.

She called one night, whispering like she was hiding under a blanket.

“It’s not the goatman anymore,” she said. “It followed me home. But it changed.”

She told me about the voices. The shadows that moved through her hallway when she wasn’t looking. And the attic—

She had one of those drop-down attic doors in the ceiling, with a wooden ladder that folds out. It started opening on its own.

Always at 3:00 a.m.

Sometimes she’d find the ladder extended, reaching into the dark hallway.

But when she climbed up to check? Nothing.

Just cold air. And something waiting.

She saw a shape once—tall, thin, like a person burned into the dark.

“I don’t want to see anything else,” she said. “Ever again.”

She moved to another city that summer.

She deleted all her old ghost blogs. Threw out her crystals and boards. Stopped astral projecting. She told me she became a born-again Christian.

"I just want peace,” she said. “And I finally have it.”

As for me?

I never saw the goatman again.

But I had other… moments. Cold air in my room when it was warm outside. Flickers of something in the mirror, just outside the corner of my vision. Whispers under the floorboards and in the corners of my room.

But after I moved out, and stopped practicing the dark arts completely, it stopped.

Just ended.

Sometimes I wonder what it was we called in.
If it needed us to summon it.
Or if it was just waiting for someone—anyone—to look.

I don’t dabble anymore.

No spells. No rituals. No sigils in notebooks.

Some things aren’t meant to be explored.

Some things are hungry.

And some things…

Just want you to look
