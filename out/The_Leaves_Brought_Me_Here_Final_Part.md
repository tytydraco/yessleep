Strange things have been going on in this town. Disappearances left and right, with sometimes not even a single thing ever being found of that person ever again. Some folks say it’s the Pukwudgies. Magical little men in the woods that lure people to their demise. I’ve never believed in such things until somewhat recently, when I had an encounter with a spire of floating leaves. They called out to me for help but at the time I was too scared. My mother suggested it was a spirit or spirits. She’s always believed in paranormal stuff like that so she’s had my back through these strange times. That is until they took her.

I had come home from school one day and the police were at my house questioning my dad. In my room I found a note. On it my mother sounded borderline crazy, but she maintained her sweetness that she shared with everyone. She had gone on to say that, like the leaves I had seen, she witnessed a spire of sand that somehow was calling out to her. I don’t know why it’s sand this time, but I can assure you that I don’t think it’s the same kind spirit that was calling for help. My mother had gotten too curious and intrigued by my events that she wanted one for herself so badly that now she’s in danger.

I have to find my mom before they do.

It’s been a few days since the disappearance of my mom. I’ve gone into the woods alone after school on several occasions, just hoping that the leaves would show up again and bring me to her. They never did. At least, not yet they have. When I had told my mom about the strange occurrences I had been going through, I felt a little less alone. She always made me feel that way and hopefully she can again once I save her from whatever, or whoever, is out there.

I’m writing this from my last block of the school day. I don’t have game club tonight so I plan on going straight for the woods once I get off the bus. My dad has been so caught up in managing everything on his own now that he hardly notices that I’m out looking for mom sometimes. Every day though, I’ve noticed him get more and more irritable. Hopefully nothing comes of that.

Something came of that. In my room now, and just had a screaming match with my dad. He saw me grab a few things and put it in a backpack before trying to head out the door.

“Where do you think you’re going?” He snapped angrily. But I could tell that behind that anger, he was just concerned. Concerned I’d end up like mom.

“Um… I’m going out to look for mom.”

“That’s up to the police now son. There’s nothing we can do but pray she comes home safe.”

“But dad, they think she’s crazy.”

There was a moment of silence before my dad sighed and said something that made my blood boil.

“Maybe she is crazy…”

I snapped immediately. “HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT MOM!?”

“Did you even read what she said?! Sand beckoning for her? You seeing talking leaves?! Something’s wrong with her! She’s sick and the police are doing everything they can to bring her home!”

“But if I just get the leave’s attention maybe they’ll bring me to-” my defense and plan of action was quickly cut short.

“LISTEN TO YOURSELF! YOU’RE TURNING CRAZY JUST LIKE SHE DID!”

At this point my eyes were pouring. I just couldn’t believe he’d say such things about the woman who took such good care of both of us. I stormed off and slammed my door, just cutting off my dad’s final words.

“I CAN’T LOSE YOU TOO!”

You’re not going to dad. You’re not gonna lose anyone. I’m bringing mom home. Tonight. And I’ll update this as soon as I get back.

Please. Pray for my mom. Pray for her safety and salvation. Pray that I don’t run into the evils that lurk in those woods. Pray.

Six months later I write this now. I sit in my new room, in a new house, in a new town, in a new state, and in a new life. This is the story of how I came face to face with the Pukwudgies, and how I found my mom.

I snuck out my window once I knew my dad was fast asleep. If one thing ever remains constant in my life, it’s that my dad's snores could topple a building. I don’t know how my mother managed to ever sleep. But tonight, as of every night since mom was pronounced missing, before the thunder came the rain. I lay in bed in silence just listening to my father cry until he exhausted himself. I knew that if anything happened to me now, that he would be completely destroyed. I had time to think while I waited for him to sleep. Dad, I vow to come home safe above anything else. I closed the window behind me and started for the tree line.

I had the backpack I had packed earlier with rope, a flashlight, some batteries, a snack, a lighter, and an extra jacket. I also had a portable phone charger in case my phone died. I had no idea how to even use a rope the way Boy Scouts do. They make rope seem like the pinnacle of human creation but I can really just tie a simple knot. I’m not a survival expert, but because of social studies projects I know that rope is something important so I packed it anyway.

I held the flashlight I brought in front of me as I stumbled through the forest. The whole time I was just talking to myself hoping that the leaves would hear me and come to aid me. I got tired at one point so I sat against a tree and started looking through my camera roll. I scrolled through pictures of my little family. We all looked so happy. It’s crazy how one night can change everything. I stopped scrolling when I saw a picture of my parents' wedding. It was my dad and mom’s slow dance and they just looked so in love.

My dad gave my mom the most beautiful wedding ring. It was gold with different shades of blue diamonds and right in the middle, an emerald. Emeralds were my mom’s favorite. My dad’s was emeralds with a diamond between them since diamonds were my dad’s favorite. They both looked so happy, triggering me to speak aloud to myself again.

“I promise I’ll find her dad. I promise. And I’ll come home to you no matter what.” Shortly, I would fulfill that promise.

When I had decided to get up to keep going, I was hit with a familiar warmth. I couldn’t see them yet but I knew they were here. I glanced around the darkness and shrubbery with my flashlight before the beam landed on the movement of a couple leaves. This spiral was smaller than the others I had usually encountered.

“It’s you right? I’m not just looking at some random ass leaves?” I remember saying. 

The response I got still rattles me to this day with a mixed bag of emotions. Terrified, saddened, disturbed yet grateful.

“Shaun,” spoke the leaves in a soothing, calm voice. 

This voice, I will never forget. The same voice that made me feel better when I was distraught. The same voice that was filled with joy on Christmas mornings as I opened my gifts. The same voice my father heard say “I do”… my mother’s.

Her voice spoke louder than the rest amongst her. They were almost like a faint echo of men and women, some old, some young, but my mom’s lead them.

I was still in slight shock at hearing my mom. I thought I had found her for a moment, or that she had found me. Maybe I was hearing things. Maybe it wasn’t my mom. If it is though, why is she amongst the leaves?

“Go… home… Shaun.” My mother’s voice sounded slow as if it was difficult to talk. 

I responded after shaking off my original shock. 

“What? No, I need to find my mom.”

The leaves repeated themselves.

“Go… home… Shaun.”

I started getting slightly frustrated. My dad, the police, now even the leaves that brought me to here in the first place wanted me to drop what I was doing but I couldn’t. I needed to find mom.

“No! Either help me or get out of my way… please.” My mother always taught me to have manners.

I started walking past the leaves to pick back up my search. A cold breeze brushed the back of my hair and neck. It made me stiff up and shiver, but quickly became a warm and comforting feeling as if someone was running their hands soothingly through my hair.

“Please… I… love… you…”

My eyes started to water as I realized this was in fact my mother’s voice telling me to go home and leave her. I quickly turned around.

“M-Mom?” I said, my voice stumbling with a mix of sadness and joy. I was worried I would never hear her voice again.

The leaves were gone and the natural, cold air slowly started to return. I took a moment to gather myself and continued onward, ignoring the voice of the very person I was looking for, begging for me to turn around. But I couldn’t… I needed my mom back.

Eventually there was a recognizable clearing, but this time it reeked. I just stood at the edge of the clearing, pinching my nostrils shut. I scanned the clearing with my flashlight and that’s when I could see something moving inside one of the hallow, half cut trees. It was a clump of grey hair or fur, slightly moving while curled into a ball. I then noticed that it wasn’t just that stump, but all of them had a creature in them. I processed it too slowly, but I eventually came to and quickly turned off my flashlight and put it away. This time the little homes I had found there had occupants. I gasped and darted behind a tree thick enough to conceal me, crunching a few twigs in the process.

Herugh?

An animalistic, somewhat high pitched noise of confusion came from a few of the hollowed stumps and huts. It was a noise similar to the ones I heard here before, but this time they were home and I was the one coming into town.

Waiting in silence and fear, I listened closely for what action would take place as a response to the noise. It just stayed silent. In the silence I then realized that I could hear faint snoring of whatever things were tossing and turning in those homes. I thought the one I woke must’ve fallen back asleep so I peered out from behind the tree. Before me laid the same pit of bones from before.

The stench was coming from there, in the pit. It was more shallow than before, like they had filled it up. I had thought before that it could have been a pit for meal scraps that a hunter left on his sight. Knowing what I do now, it was in fact a scrap pit. It just wasn’t from some hunter. It was from them.

I glanced over the pit looking at the new bones that sat half buried in dirt before looking away. But something shiny had caught my eye. It was a ring.

This ring I could tell had some gold on it, but it wasn’t the gold that was shining so bright. The gems were refracting the moonlight which is what drew my attention. I almost didn’t even realize before looking back, that the ring was still on a finger.

I looked back up at the camp and darted my eyes around to make sure I wasn’t being watched. I drew my attention back to the pit and got down on my stomach. I reached into the pit with my right arm while my left still pinched my nose. I used my pointer, middle and thumb to pick up the finger by the ring. As I lifted it out of the loose dirt, I saw more fingers emerging from the ground. Dirt and gravel rolled off it like a small landslide that eventually revealed this was not just a ring, and not just a finger. It was a whole hand. Judging by the nails I could tell it was likely a woman’s disembodied hand.

Still pinching my nose and the ring, I started to stand up. I held the hand closer to my face to get a better look. I froze. It was my mother’s ring. I was holding my mothers hand.

I looked back down into the pit, shaking and in shock. The dirt had parted slightly when I picked up the hand, revealing half a skull with an eyeball still in it, “looking” towards me. It matched my eyes. It matched my mother’s eyes.

Sobbing echoed through the forest as I fell to my knees, cradling my mom’s amputated hand. I was having an extremely hard time catching my breath. Even now recalling the events, I start to fall back into that moment of pure and utter despair at the realization of my mother’s death.

There was only one thing that could take me out of how I was feeling, and it was waking up. Small, hairy little men about 4 feet tall started crawling out of their dens. Their eyes lit up in the light of the night sky. Their hair was long and hung all over them like the branches of a willow tree. Their shins and forearms were peeking through the court and made by the hair. Feet and hands, proportionally bigger than they should be, started crawling and walking towards me. Dozens of small, white pairs of dots watched me from the darkness with the only thing between us being the pit.

“WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER!?” I screamed with tears pouring down my face.

They began to rant and get excited as they ran for their racks and grabbed spears along smaller pointed sticks that I recognized. They started dipping their sticks in pots before approaching me. I took the time to take off and run.

Still cradling my finding, I ran through the trees in almost absolute darkness with only a few beacons of light shining through the thickly settled trees. I could hear the stampede of monsters sprinting after me. My fleeing was interrupted when I tripped and fell on what I thought was a root. It wasn’t.

I still clung onto my mom’s hand as I started to quickly get up. Looking down briefly at what I had tripped on. There in the grass, dimly lit by the moon, was my dad’s rifle. I looked up from it and saw shadows bouncing off the trees, sprinting through grass, and swinging from branches towards me. I felt like a wild animal being hunted down by neanderthals. 

I held my mom’s hand with my left and picked up the gun with my right before starting my sprint again. The gurgling laughter and screams of joy got louder and louder as I ran whilst trying to load a rifle single handedly. Me and my dad used to go on hunting trips where he’d teach me how to use a gun. Though, I was too much like my mom to shoot the animals we would find. In me, she’ll live on. But that could only happen if I could get out of there.

I didn’t even know where I was going. For all I know I could have been running even deeper into the woods. That’s when I heard rustling besides my own to my right. The dark silhouette I saw looked to me like the leaves so I instinctively followed.

I kept following the leaves but unlike every other time, they didn’t wait for me to catch up. I thought it was just due to urgency, but I thought wrong. I realized this when I had seen a break in the trees where moonlight was more prominent on the other side. Thinking it was my way out I used every bit of energy I had left to run for it.

I stumbled out of the trees and fell to my knees in the grass. I was back where I started. In the same clearing where my mother was buried. This time the pit was on the opposite side. And in the middle of the clearing all huddled together, was the Pukwudgies. They were waiting for me.

One of them emerged from a small cave in the ground right near me. He was slightly bigger and had longer hair than the others. A gust of sand in the shape of leaves emerged from the forest beside me and swirled around him. I soullessly stared off in realization at what had happened.

I had started to accept my fate as I clutched my mom’s hand in fear.

“I’m sorry mom. I- I should’ve gone home. I broke my promise to dad. He’s going to be all alone…”

I just sobbed. As the monsters that took my mom from me approached, I heard them stop and start murmuring about something. Then I felt a familiar warmth and my mind filled with hope and resilience. I raised my head. Above the pit on the other end of the clearing, were the leaves. They were in a spiral bigger than ever. They didn’t just catch my attention. All of the little men had turned to face them as well, including what I can only assume was their leader with the sand.

I took the little moment I had to cock the gun and aimed it right at the leader. Midway through turning back towards me, I shot him in the head. A boom echoed through the whole forest turning all the Pukwudgies' attention to me, and then to their leader. They all started screaming and crying as they threw their spears and sticks at me, a few sticking into my legs and shoulder.

Ignoring the shooting pain that started coursing through my body, I once again began to run with only some of them giving pursuit. I dropped my dad’s gun and my backpack to lose weight. It was now just me and my mom’s hand.

This time on my left, the same side I carried my mother’s hand, I saw the leaves at my side. They were close enough this time that I could tell it was them. Together we ran until the Pukwudgies followed no more. Finally we were out of the forest but I had no idea where I was. There was just a long road starching in both directions. Having no clue I started to lose hope again and so did my body.

Last thing I remembered I curled up on the side of the road while the leaves covered me to keep me warm. I shivered from the cold but also something else. Something was happening to my body. I only, now writing this, know that the Pukwudgies had dipped their sticks into a concoction they had made to debilitate their prey.

That was it. I wish there was more to my perspective back then but I got nothing. Whatever the Pukwudgies had hit me with took away two months of my life. I woke up in a hospital in a different town, in a different state, with a different house, and was expected to live a different life. The rest, I only know from my dad’s point of view.

My dad woke up in the morning and layed in bed staring at the ceiling. He sat there for almost two hours just thinking about his wife and wondering if she was ok. That amongst millions of things raced through his head such as how this would all impact me. Eventually he got up, made his coffee, and headed towards my room to wake me up. But when he opened my door, I wasn’t there.

A whole day later, police in my town got a call about a kid found unconscious on the side of a long desolate road holding a disembodied hand. The kid wouldn’t wake up but he had a low pulse. This child stirred up quite the commotion in the town because it could have been any of the missing children that had been lost since varying amounts of time. Eventually the hospital was able to identify me and called my dad.

I can’t begin to imagine what that one day felt like to my dad. No wife, no son. All in the blink of an eye he lost everything. If it weren’t for mom herself, he probably would’ve lived that day over and over for the rest of his life. A day, that by itself, probably felt like a lifetime.

The police were also able to identify the hand I had been holding as my mom’s due to the ring and fingerprints. My dad refuses still to tell me what else they had found out so I hit up Patrick. He was ecstatic to hear from me but was sad I had moved away without saying goodbye.

Patrick told me that forensics were able to tell that my mom’s hand had been gnarled off by human-like teeth while she was still alive, yet most likely paralyzed. The last of the blood in her hand had the same poison that had given me a coma. The hospital told my dad that if I had been given even a gram more of it, then I’d be paralyzed for life.

The police had finally found the stuff I had posted and thought that my brain was making up stuff in relation to actual trauma I had gone through. They think that a cannibalistic woodsman had been stalking me and tried to poison me the same way that he must have poisoned everyone he had kidnapped. A bounty was set up, but for whom? There was no man… only the Pukwudgies. They even found the clearing and choked it up as his camp.

Slowly I’ve noticed more people reading what I had posted and the legends of the Pukwudgies grew in and out of our town. People began hunting for them, trying to find them and prove they’re real. Best piece of evidence they have is my word, and the unknown animal hair and blood left at the abandoned camp. People have even found human-like footprints at the camp that many believe to be the Pukwudgies.

Sitting down writing this now, I wear my mom’s wedding ring on a chain around my neck. Even when she was dead, she still looked out for me till I was safe. Well, safe enough lol. She did leave me on the side of the road after all. All jokes aside, I really miss her. Yet part of me is at ease. Knowing she’s out there as one of the things she believed in so strongly brings back that warm feeling similar to the one the leaves brought me. Best way I can put it is extreme serenity.

Weeks go by and from the sound of it, missing persons have dropped in our town. Although there is one that I can’t feel too bad about.

Me and Patrick have been still talking consistently after both of us get out of our schools. Last night he told me about how Franklin read my logs and decided to go out with his jackass friends to jokingly hunt the Pukwudgies. Apparently they ran into them and Franklin has been missing since.

(Update from Patrick) Franklin was found hidden inside a hollow fallen tree and had soiled himself. Now he won’t stop talking about what he saw but no one believes him and honestly just makes fun of him. Karma has done its work beautifully.

With our town, now a legend, I end my logs here. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe a new life isn’t so bad. I start high school soon and I can’t wait! I still go back to that town to meet with Patrick but I’m in Massachusetts now so it’s not too often. I’m happy, even though my mom isn’t here to be happy with me, but that’s what she would have wanted. Everytime leaves blow around in the street or cross my window on stormy nights, I know she’s there watching over me just like she did that night.
