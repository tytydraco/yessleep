30/12/23    
  
I checked in to the hotel and decided to head straight out. Night had fallen already, the cold air felt heavy, and dark clouds rolled overhead. A few splatters of rain had started falling, rippling in the puddles on the sidewalk that were still there fresh the last downpour earlier today.     
  
The area had a dangerous aura. Shop fronts boarded up, decorated in local graffiti designs, trash and used needles littering the sidewalk, dim streetlamps buzzing, barely illuminating the street. But I grew up in a similar area so knew how to present myself, to avoid eye contact.    
  
One block down and I was in the red-light district, the prostitutes haggling for my money were the first people I saw for the night. A pimp yelled something at me as I passed by his girls, but I just ignored him and continued walking.    
  
I did notice that some of the girls look young, too young if you know what I mean.    
  
Further down a side street, I heard yelling and smashing bottles. I decided to avoid that area and kept moving.    
  
The rain was getting heavier by the time I came across a dirty-looking pub wedged in between two boarded-up shops a block or so later, so I decided to head to get out of the rain and grab some food and a drink. The inside of the pub was dark and smokey, and my feet stuck to the carpet as I walked over to the bar.    
  
The bartender was a rough-looking guy, shaven head with neck tattoos that disappeared underneath his stained white shirt. Judging by the smell I don’t think he had showered or changed that shirt for some time.    
  
But he looked like the kind of guy that knows things. So I buy a drink me a drink and a shot for him, and start up a conversation. Diving right in, I ask him if he’s heard anything about the murders in the area lately, and the first thing he asks is am I a cop.    
  
But he opens up pretty quickly, telling me he’s heard a lot. Heard it is some new gang, heard it is a secret police unit sent in to clean up the streets, and also heard it is some wannabe vigilante out for revenge or something. That last one is what he thinks it is.    
  
His cousin saw him, the vigilante. Dressed in all black with face covered and a big jacket or something.     
  
When I ask if it could be a cape, he shrugs and says yeah, could be.    
  
His cousin didn’t get a good look at him though, said he slid into the shadows and completely disappeared, like he merged with the darkness.    
  
But we heard the next day that some local mafia family had been gutted and torn up, and it was in the area he had seen the vigilante. Apparently, one rookie cop had been overheard saying it looked like wolves had torn the throats out of the victims. They had been shooting at something, shooting a lot by all accounts, but they must have been shooting at ghosts because there was no blood or bodies of anyone aside from the mafia family.    
  
I asked if he remembered where that was, and he did. It was only a few blocks away. An empty office block, boarded up and blocked off, though rough sleepers were known to camp out there.    
  
I thanked him, finished my drink, and headed off for the office block.    
  
I found the building, silhouetted against the city backdrop, located on a dark and lifeless street. It was an older building, maybe 50s or late 40s, the facade chipped and paint peeled or covered in colorful yet lazy tags. The rain slammed into the side of the building, water cascading down the front like a glassy waterfall. A rusty temporary fence had been erected, years ago by the looks of it, encircling the building, but it didn’t take me long to find an opening I could easily fit through. I jimmied a door open and ducked inside.    
  
I made my way to the fire escape stairwell and headed up to the 5th floor, where he said it happened.    
  
When I got there, I saw what he meant. Bullet holes riddled the walls and casings littered the floor, like a massive shootout had taken place.    
  
Blood stained the carpet, furniture and ceiling tiles were scattered everywhere.    
  
The rain was coming into the building through some windows that had been smashed, glass littering the floor.    
  
I took a few [photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneMoreNightmare/comments/192wzkg/the_office/), made lots of notes and go to leave when something hits me.    
  
I walked back to the area near the broken windows, trying to work out what it is that is out of place, when it hit me.    
  
Out of the 4 smashed windows, only one had glass littering the ground in front of it.    
  
Three of the windows had been shot outward, where the glass must have rained down on the pavement below.    
  
The fourth window had been smashed inwards, like something had come into the building, through the window on the 5th floor. Something big.    
  
31/12/23    
  
I spent the day going through the cases and making notes. Later I celebrated with a drink at my new favorite bar.    
  
3/01/24    
  
The last few nights have been quiet. I’ve tried talking to other local vendors, but most ignore me or tell me they know nothing.    
  
I did see one enthusiastic street preacher, a large sign around his neck, yelling something about a new savior cleaning up the streets.    
  
The sign said “The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming”    
  
So, after another unsuccessful night, I decided to head back to my hotel, ready to turn in. But just as I was coming up to the red-light district, I heard an ear-piercing scream come from one of the buildings.    
  
The door crashed open and half a dozen or so girls came running out.    
  
I heard gunfire in the building and more screams, before a window on the third floor shattered and someone came flying out, falling to the ground with a thud.    
  
They were badly injured but alive, a loud moan coming from them. But before anyone could assist them, they were suddenly pulled back up in the air and back inside the shattered window, as if their ankle was attached to a wire.    
  
Moments later they came flying out again, hitting the ground head-first with a huge crunching sound. This time, they were most certainly dead.    
  
I looked up and saw a looming silhouette in the window frame, broad, with two pointed horns on its head.     
  
It disappeared back inside as I tried to snap some photos. Moments later, a side window smashed open and what looked like a caped crusader flew out the side of the building    
  
I started running after them, following them as they jumped from roof top to rooftop, towards the industrial park.    
  
Eventually I watched as they glided into a fenced-off lot, and disappeared into an abandoned, red brick factory.    
  
I tried to snap more [photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneMoreNightmare/comments/192wly6/the_chase/) during the chase, but it was too dark and stormy, the images nothing but black, blurry silhouettes against a dark, cloudy backdrop.    
  
I have decided I am going to come back tomorrow night with bolt cutters. Maybe, just maybe, I have found the vigilantes' hideout.

The last file on Jonahs SD card was an audio file.  

  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  
Big mistake. I'm fucked, I’m so fucked. That is no vigilante, no hero. It’s not even human.    
  
Earlier tonight, around midnight, I cut the bolts on the gate and snuck into the factory.    
  
The first thing that hit me was the smell. It smelt like a combination of a horse stable, sewerage plant and slaughterhouse, the stench burning my nostrils. I couldn’t block it out, even with my hand and sleeve covering my face, it was rancid.    
  
My phone flashlight barely illuminated the factory's vast interior, the walls and ceiling hidden beyond the lights reach, but the smell intensified as I moved forward, toward what I assumed to be the middle of the factory floor.    
  
As I continued scanning the large space, I started noticing hay scattered on the floor, my feet beginning to crunch with each step I took. The layer of hay got thicker and thicker, becoming like a layer of bedding that covered the floor of the factory. Numerous crates encircled the area I was now in, stacked clumsily atop each other, creating a walled, semi-enclosure. Scattered in the middle of the large enclosure, I saw bones. Human bones.    
  
It was a nest. A giant, fucking nest.    
  
I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, so quickly turned on my phones camera to grab some pictures before making a hasty exit, when something screeched in the darkness high above me. I switched off my phone's screen, casting me in darkness, before a loud thump sounded, like something heavy landing on the ground from a height.    
  
I immediately hid behind some crates, my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness as moonlight started to filter through the high factory windows.    
  
I peeped between two large crates as a giant figure appeared from the darkness, walking in silence despite its large stature, and dragging something along the ground behind it.    
  
The clouds outside cleared even more now, allowing bright moonlight to filter in, as the vigilante moved past the crates I was hiding behind. The thing it dragged behind it was now in full view. I almost threw up on the spot as I saw terrified eyes staring back at me. Being dragged by the leg was a man's body that was missing one leg and both arms, blood trailing behind it, a look of pure terror and agony locked on his face. He blinked and coughed up blood, short sharp breaths all he could muster.    
  
As the vigilante moved through the moonlight, I could now see it more clearly. What I had started to believe was an armoured suit of some description, was actually its own leathery, cracked skin. The skin pulled tightly over its frame, its ribs clearly visible, and spiny, thorn-like protrusions ran up its arms to its shoulders. Dry wounds covered its body, with crude stitching scars across its chest and legs. The cape that flapped loosely behind it as it moved had dark veins running through it, and now appeared to be more like its own wings than a cape.    
  
Its face was like a deformed bat, its nose morphing into a protruding snout, elongated and jagged, housing rows of razor-sharp teeth that jutted out in a horrifying display. It had beady sunken eyes that glowed a dark yellow, and the skin on its head was stretched taut across a distorted skull, with two large ears on top.    
  
The vigilantes' powerful clawed hands released the man's leg and then dropped to its hands and knees. Its mouth stretched, its jaw dislocated like a snake, and it took a huge bite from the torso. The man's eyes widened in pain, a final moan escaping his lips, before his eyes glazed over and he was still.    
  
The vigilante consumed the chunk of torso it just bit off, then went down to take another bite before it stopped suddenly, before it jerked its head up and sniffed the air. Its eyes started darting around the room and its body tensed, and I knew it could now sense me.     
  
In a panic, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a lighter. Knowing it was only a matter of time until it found me, I crouched down and set fire to a pile of dry hay to try and distract it. The dry hay immediately lit up, the fire spreading much quicker than I anticipated, and two crates soon caught fire.    
  
The area was quickly cloaked in smoke, so I took my opportunity and ran out the way I came in. Behind me, I heard a booming screech, one that rattled the windows, but I didn’t dare look back.    
  
I came straight home and started packing, but in the middle of packing my bag, the power cut out. Surrounded by darkness, I glanced out the window and froze. There, staring in the window at me, thirteen floors up, was the vigilante, its’ two yellow eyes filled with rage.    
  
I’ve locked myself in my room to record this, but I can hear it crashing around out there. It won’t be long till it finds me, and I end up like all the others that have come across it.    
  
I should have listened to H.D and never poked the bear.  

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  
  
The recording came to an abrupt halt. Leaning back in my chair, I mulled over Jordan's compilation, my tired eyes receiving a rub for some relief.     
  
"This has to be a prank," I mused inwardly. It couldn't possibly be true. Yet, the meticulous nature of Jordan and the eerie scene in his apartment—the blood on the bedroom ceiling, his unexplained disappearance for over a week—spoke volumes.    
  
Late into the night, my thoughts were scattered. The rain intensified outside, its booming rhythm adding to my distracted state.    
  
Shutting down my computer, I exited my office, shutting the door behind me, and navigated toward the kitchen. Passing through the living room, I closed an open window, silencing the uproar of rain and thunder thanks to the insulating double-glazed glass. In the kitchen, I raided the fridge, taking a gulp directly from a juice bottle before pouring a glass.    
  
Seated at the kitchen counter, I immersed myself in Facebook, diving into videos and grumbling at the intrusive mid-roll ads, all while the relentless rain battered the surroundings. The passing time blurred; perhaps only ten minutes slipped away before I snapped back to reality, realizing the heightened volume of the rain. Slipping my phone back into my pocket, I cautiously made my way back to the living room. As I rounded the corner, my eyes widened and my jaw locked. The window I had closed was now wide open again. I stepped back into the kitchen, eyes darting around before I reached for the knife block, pulled a butcher's knife from it, and then made my way to the window.    
  
Lightening crashed outside, illuminating the room temporarily, as I made my way to the open window. My eyes scanned the room as I cautiously approached. As soon as I arrived, I slammed the window shut, this time flicking the lock and testing the window with a couple of tugs.    
  
Releasing the breath I was holding, I dropped my shoulders and relaxed a little, my heart rate slowing back to normal, when I noticed a wet footprint on the floor. Tensing up again, I realised more footsteps were making their way to my office, where the door now stood open.    
  
I ran to my office, pushing the door wide open with the knife raised in front of me.    
  
The room was empty. My laptop was gone.    
  
Suddenly the rain intensified again, and I swung my head back towards the window.    
  
There, standing in my apartment, one clawed foot on the window ledge, was the vigilante, its yellow orb eyes locked on mine. I dropped the knife, a whimper escaping my mouth, as it raised a blackened, clawed finger to its lips in a shoosh motion, then turned and jumped from my apartment window into the darkness of the night.    
  
I share this with you, here, thanks to the fact my laptop had backed up to the cloud as soon as I had plugged the SD card into my computer. I know I am putting myself at great risk doing this, hence why I am posting this from the airport lounge. I will be on a plane and far away from here by the time this is out there.    
  
The vigilante has been increasing its killings, and slowly reports are being picked up by the mainstream media.    
  
It still only kills those involved in crime, so you should be safe if you are innocent. But I worry about what it will do once it is done with all the criminals, killed them all or forced them out of the city. Will it move on to another city, or will it start to target innocent civilians? Will you be the [next target](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneMoreNightmare/) of the vigilante?
