I covered my eyes and continued crying. "Please, don't hurt me. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"

A long minute passed in silence. I relaxed for a moment and then felt the covers being torn off of me. I blinked as tears and snot continued flowing and I looked up at the man before me.

He smiled at me and held out his hand, "Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Moskowitz."

I did not reciprocate and continued staring.

"I apologize if my letter frightened you. You see, that's part of the process. The letter weeds weak people out. But you stayed.”

"Weak?" I croaked out, incredulous.

He smiled ear to ear and patted my shoulder gently. "Yes dear, you are not weak. Not at all."

"W-what do you want?" I stared at him in terror, "With me?"

He returned the stare and I almost forgot how to breathe as his dark brown eyes bore into me. "You will see, in due time. But for now, let's not have this atmosphere between us. Have dinner with me."

I was petrified. I wanted to keep crying and ask questions, but what if that made me weak? What would happen?

I buried my face in my hands and exhaled. "Okay."

"Take this," he handed me a tissue and chuckled.

"Oh... thanks."

I didn't like the way he was so nonchalant. Didn't he burn me, didn't he somehow trap me in his room, didn't he strangle me? 

I was terrified but I didn't know what to do. Was it better to simply comply with everything he asked me to do or go rogue?

I hadn't noticed he had moved but now he was behind me, face a whisper away from my ear. 

"Clean yourself up, dear. Dinner will be ready in about a half hour. Dress appropriately."

I froze and felt myself blush. Were those orders? They didn't sound like polite requests. That's when it hit me that perhaps non-compliance wasn't an option.

He lingered a moment and then walked away. 

I scrambled to find a nice dress shirt and dress pants. Whatever outfit felt most presentable, whatever outfit felt fitting to plead for my life in.

That's when it hit me. Did he want me to wear something... enticing? I flushed further at the thought.

But was seduction his intention? Maybe it wasn't and he had something more sinister planned. I screamed silently to myself, what would that entail? I didn't know but felt a bile rise in my throat. What was his game?

I ruminated on this and started documenting all of this on the sticky notes pad. “No one is ever going to believe me...” I felt desolate. 

I said I wasn't his prisoner until I met him. I wasn't weak? I felt weak. I felt pathetic. 

Why hadn't I run out the door? I paused for a moment to truly consider this. Was I really too panicked, was it a mental block? Or was there some force influencing me to not go?

I shook my head and frowned. No, I was trying to explain away my own mistakes. 

Did I stay because I truly cared about what may have happened to him more than my safety or was he making me stay with some supernatural force? Or did I stay because of morbid curiosity, a desire to see this mystery through?

The fact that I truly couldn't tell scared me because if he was keeping me here, could he control my thoughts and feelings so masterfully that I couldn't tell? And if it was curiosity over care, what did that say about me?

"Dinner's ready!" Dr. Moskowitz called from the other room. I pulled myself out of my thoughts and quickly finished getting ready. 

Before I entered the kitchen, I grabbed a small recording device from my bedside drawer, carefully placed it in my front pocket, and pressed record.

As I entered the kitchen he smiled widely at me again. "Well, don't you look like a vision. Sit."

I returned the smile but noticed once more that he spoke in commands.

I looked at the dinner table. There was a spread of eggplant parmesan, garlic bread, and a salad. "Wow." I didn't know what else to say.

"Yes, I thought I'd prepare something nice for you since I've been gone for so long."

I paused. Was he implying that making me dinner would be a normal thing for him to do? That was odd. But the air was so thick with terror and intimacy that I thought better than to think too deeply about this. I still didn't know his intentions.

Lost in thought, I hadn't realized he was looking at me, waiting that long moment for me to respond. 

I coughed into my napkin and smiled politely. “Sorry, I drifted off for a minute there.”

He nodded, “It’s quite alright. I'm sure you have a lot on your mind.”

My eyes widened as I looked down at my plate, which I then realized already had food on it, careful not to make eye contact. “Yes.”

I could tell he was staring at me again before I could collect myself enough to think of something to say.

“Have you been finding the accommodations to your liking?”

The question took me by surprise. “Yes, very much so. I was worried though, living alone.”

“Oh, were you?” His eyes darkened and he cleared his throat. “You were worried about me?”

I felt a flash of anger. I didn't want to keep playing this word game with him, I wanted the truth.

“Yes, of course, I was! You were gone and left me no messages to indicate that you were safe or, or-”

“Or where I was,” he finished my sentence, his voice dripping with smug self-satisfaction.

I stewed in my frustration and said nothing. 

He glanced at me then returned to his plate and we fell into silence as we ate.

Questions raced through my mind. Why was he toying with me, what was his end-game, did he want me to be afraid of him? And not least of all, I wanted to ask where he had been all this time, but ultimately thought better of it.

I coughed awkwardly again to break the silence. "So um, will you be staying here now?”

He nodded, "Mm hm, I can assure you," he paused to look me directly in the eyes, "I will not leave ever again."

My heart flipped in my chest and I thought I was going to pass out. This was too much, I needed to call the police, call my dad, call someone, anyone, NOW! But before I could excuse myself, he cleared his throat.

"I ask that you also not leave." He stared intensely again and I felt rigid in my seat.
