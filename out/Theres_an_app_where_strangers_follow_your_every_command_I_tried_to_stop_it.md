One day, I stumbled upon the app.
I was just messing around on my phone, bored out of my mind one afternoon. Scrolling through every bit of nonsense that popped up. That’s when I saw it, this weird little app buried among the others. Its oddly eye-catching icon instantly grabbed my attention. But when I opened it… things got even stranger.
The app looked like TikTok. People appeared in the videos, but every single one was labeled as live. At least, that’s what it claimed. Most of the people in the videos were just… waiting. Like they were preparing for something, or expecting something to happen. It all seemed pretty boring at first, until the comments started rolling in.

I was watching a guy, his whole room was covered in cameras. But he was just sitting there on his couch, doing nothing. Just staring into space, like he was waiting. Then someone dropped a comment:


“Stand up and grab a glass of water.”


And the guy, on live video, followed the command. Instantly. Like it wasn’t even a choice, just something he had to do. It was weird, especially because he didn’t look at his phone or a screen or anything. He just… knew what to do. I stared at my phone screen, squinting in disbelief.
Then another viewer joined the stream. Now there were three of us watching this young guy walk into the kitchen and pour himself a glass of water. But once he did, he just stood there. He didn’t drink it. Didn’t spill it. Just stood in the kitchen, holding the glass.

Then another comment popped up:


“A dog runs in, and you spill the water.”


Suddenly, in the live feed, a small mutt dashed past the guy’s legs and bumped into him. He flinched, and the water splashed out of the glass.

I couldn’t make sense of it. What was this app? What were these people doing? Why was everyone acting so… strange?

Still, I kept watching. Curiosity got the better of me. Eventually, I decided to join in, just with something harmless:


“Make a sandwich.”


And the guy? He opened the fridge and started making one. Like he had no choice.
I was stunned. What kind of twisted thing was this? These people on the app were doing everything they were told. Who in their right mind would ever agree to something like this?


I watched as the guy made himself a pretty decent sandwich. A strange mix of feelings swirled inside me. It was unsettling, someone taking comments as commands. And at the same time, it felt like I was playing The Sims.
When he finished the sandwich, I was just about to type “Eat it” when another viewer beat me to it:


“Shove the sandwich up your ass.”


I winced at the comment. When I looked back at the stream, the guy was already taking off his pants.

I have never scrolled away from a video faster in my life.

What the actual fuck is this? And why are people such absolute pieces of shit?

I clicked into another stream. This time, it was a woman painting her room. It all seemed calm, until I looked closer at what she was painting with.
It was her own feces. The last comment confirmed it, followed by a flood of laughing emojis.

That’s when I just… gave up.
I scrolled through a few more, hoping not to lose all faith in humanity, but it only got worse.
It was early evening, prime time for these so-called “live robots,” and the app was swarming with lunatics.
People were giving the most deranged, vile commands to these poor souls.
In just a few minutes, I saw everything, From sadomasochistic porn to self-harm to full-on violent abuse, All carried out by strangers, to strangers.

It was a plague. A festering, digital hell. And I thought: That’s enough internet for today.


The next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about the horrors I’d seen.
Even if some of these people chose to be in this situation, or were forced into it, why did the viewers always have to ask for the worst possible things?
It was like some sick joke from the dark web.

The best I could think to do was to report the app, anonymously, to the police. I sent everything I had, hoping they’d be able to do something with it. But in the meantime, I figured I’d keep watch. Maybe I could help the people still trapped inside.

So I started leaving harmless comments, anything to prevent bloodshed. I hoped I could make a difference. Maybe offer some kind of peace to these poor souls. That afternoon, after I got home from work and finished my usual chores, I sat down and opened the app again.

Luckily, not many people were online yet. A few random viewers were lurking, and most of the streamers were just waiting, Sitting or lying in their rooms, motionless, staring into nothing, waiting for the next command.
But that gave me the perfect chance to launch my sabotage plan.
My idea was simple:
I’d give as many of them as possible long, complicated tasks, Ones that would keep them busy during the “danger hours,” when viewer numbers tend to spike and things usually go to hell.

So I started typing.

- I told them to clean the entire room with a toothbrush until everything sparkled.
- To master the guitar, perfectly.
- To cook a four-course meal for a crew of twenty, each dish different.

Anything I could think of to keep them occupied. To protect them from what was coming.
It was working…Until the viewer count started to rise.


What I didn’t count on was that the other viewers would twist all my commands.
The guy I told to bake something? He was now hacking other people to pieces with an axe.
Another was slicing open his own abdomen. The rest, I didn’t even want to look anymore.

I tried fighting back against some of the commenters. Every time someone posted some sick, twisted suggestion, I would instantly reply with something safe, something that wouldn’t let the person on stream hurt themselves or anyone else.
But I couldn’t keep up for long. It was like every stream was flooded with commands, orders to mutilate themselves or torture others.

The whole app was a fucking cesspool again.

I just collapsed into bed, exhausted. My soul felt crushed by everything I’d seen, and by the fact that most of the commenters were absolute monsters. They were making these people do things no sane person would ever think of. Just thinking about it made me sick.
This was happening every day, on this app.

I barely slept that night. And the next day?
I don’t even want to talk about it.

Those faces burned themselves into my mind. The torture. The perversions. The constant stream of twisted orders pouring in from strangers.

Even at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. How could I stop this? How could I at least help somehow, until the police finally did something?

Back home, whenever I had a free moment, I opened the app again.
My new plan was simple: If I couldn’t protect everyone, I’d focus on just one person.
Let me save one person. Just for a night.
I hoped I’d be able to.


What I didn’t expect… was who the app showed me when I opened it.

It was a young girl.
She was sitting in a simple living room, wearing a college hoodie. Cameras were filming her from almost every angle.
As I glanced at the comment section, a message immediately popped up. It was from a user named cherrydelry.
But the message wasn’t addressed to the girl,it was for me.


“Please don’t hurt her. I’m begging you. She didn’t do anything wrong. Just move on, find someone else. She’s my daughter.”


I was completely shocked.
That was the moment the whole thing hit me, really hit me. These people I’d been watching suffer for two days straight… they were real. They were once just normal people.
Then another message popped up, again from Cherry, directed at me:


“Please. I’m begging you. Don’t give her any commands. Please.”


I quickly replied, hoping to ease her panic:


“I won’t write anything. Don’t worry. I think this whole thing is horrible too.”


I never thought I’d find a kindred soul here of all places. But it turned out that cherrydelry was actually the mother of the girl I was now watching live.

Her daughter had gone missing months ago. No one had found her, not the police, not the locals, no trace, nothing. Then, one day, Cherry found her daughter’s phone. And on it… this app.
That’s when she discovered her daughter had a profile and was already part of the livestream.
It was all just… horrifying.

Cherry and I talked a lot in the chat. We agreed not to reveal anything personal about ourselves, just in case someone was watching.
Whenever someone joined her daughter’s livestream, we attacked the chat immediately, flooding it with harmless commands, so nothing awful could happen to her.

For the first time in days, I felt like I’d done something good. Together, we managed to protect a young girl.

Cherry told me she watched her daughter almost all day. She’d already shown the footage to the police, but they didn’t really believe her. All they said was “We’ve opened an investigation.” Bastards.
Cherry and I made a pact, I would help protect her daughter too. Together, we’d try to keep her alive until someone in law enforcement finally took action.
I’d never done anything like this before, but I followed Cherry’s daughter’s profile in the app.

I had to keep an eye on her.


The next day, Cherry and I were successful again.
We took turns watching over her.
A few lunatics jumped into the stream and immediately started flooding the chat with commands, telling the girl to do all sorts of things to herself, but luckily, we shut them down in time.

But how long are we supposed to keep doing this? The people who should really be shutting this whole thing down, why aren’t they doing anything? Maybe… maybe it’s time to go to the media?
I talked a lot with Cherry, too. She told me a few things about her daughter. She got into college on a gymnastics scholarship. Super smart girl, just spent a little too much time on her phone instead of studying.

Cherry also talked a little bit about herself, though only in broad strokes, just enough to avoid giving away anything that could cause trouble later.
Honestly, I didn’t always trust her either… but she was protecting the girl, same as I was.
So maybe I could trust a mother who was willing to do anything to protect her daughter.

Cherry offered to stay up late and keep watch. She said she didn’t have anything better to do anyway. I, on the other hand, was completely exhausted, especially at 4 a.m., knowing I had to work in the morning.

So I went to bed for a few hours. All my energy had been drained trying to keep the girl safe.
I slept like a rock, after two nights of staying up that long, I was totally worn out.

But in the morning…I woke up to a surprise.


Before heading out to work, I quickly opened the app to check on Cherry’s daughter.
But Cherry wasn’t there among the viewers. No one was watching her daughter.

Where did Cherry go? Maybe she just got tired… maybe she went to sleep?
I didn’t have time to dwell on it, I had to leave or I’d be late for work. So I rushed out the door.

But I would check the app again later during the day.
Just to be safe.


Cherry was offline the entire morning. She didn’t check on her daughter at all.
At work, I couldn’t really keep an eye on things, my boss wasn’t exactly a fan of people being on their phones during office hours.
But I faked stomach issues a few times just to slip off to the bathroom and check what was going on.
Thankfully, the girl mostly just stood or sat there, waiting.
But I had no idea what to do if Cherry didn’t come back. I didn’t think I could protect her daughter on my own.

What happened to Cherry? Where did she go? Was she just sleeping?

I practically ran home from work.
Cherry had been unreachable all day. And since it was Friday, more and more people were becoming active on the app.

I typed as fast as I could whenever someone entered the girl’s stream. I tried my best to protect her.
I’m sorry… but I couldn’t do it anymore.

By 9 p.m., there were so many people flooding Cherry’s daughter’s stream that it became impossible to keep things peaceful. They were sending her horrific messages.
I can’t say I was surprised. People like that, when they can control a twenty-year-old girl like a puppet, they always show their worst selves.

It was a nightmare. And my heart broke, but I left the stream.
I couldn’t keep watching this innocent young girl, with a blank face like a machine, carry out the most disgusting commands thrown at her.


That night, I just cried. Are people really this cruel when they get a little power over someone else?
As I was getting ready for bed, I checked the app one last time. Maybe something had changed. Maybe Cherry had come back. Maybe she was watching her daughter again.

But the girl’s stream was no longer available. She wasn’t even listed among my followed channels anymore.

There was only one thing that could mean: The girl was dead.
I couldn’t even cry anymore. These past few days had been a complete nightmare
since the moment I found that cursed app.
I sat on the edge of my bed, completely shattered. The app was still running on my phone, and the streams just kept rolling in, one horrifying scene after another.

Then, suddenly, my phone auto-launched a new live feed. It had a brand new label.

It showed an overweight man standing in the middle of his room in nothing but underwear.
The walls were covered with posters, disgusting ones, mostly of children.
But what truly shocked me…was the username.
The stream was being broadcast from an account named:

Cherrydelry.


It was him.
Cherry was visible on my profile again. But not like before, this time, I couldn’t message them anymore. Now they were the one in the livestream.

But… who the hell was that man?

Cherry was supposed to be a mother, at least that’s what they claimed. Someone trying to protect her daughter from a twisted online app.
My mind was in total chaos. What the actual fuck was going on here? Who lied to me?
What happened to Cherry? Or… was she ever real in the first place?

That’s when my phone buzzed. It was the app.

A cold sweat ran down my back, this had never happened before. I’d never gotten a notification from it.
When I checked it, I saw I had a message.
From the admin.


“Here’s your friend. Watch him, and do whatever you want. This is a private privilege, just for you. 24 hours.”


I was completely stunned.
Not just because the app admin had contacted me directly, but because Cherry had lied to me.

She wasn’t a mother. He was just some perverted freak who tried to claim a girl for himself, a girl who looked barely of age, through some grotesque, horrific app.

There are no words for what I felt sitting there on my bed. My entire world had flipped upside down.
And now, for a full day, this disgusting worm of a human was placed in my hands, entrusted to my good intentions.

Does someone like that deserve a terrible death?
Or should I just let someone else take care of the dirty work?


I just suffered until dawn.
I wandered the apartment, pacing. Then I tried to sleep, but the thoughts racing through my mind wouldn't let me rest.
Sometimes I glanced back at the fat man, the one who had pretended to be a desperate mother online.
Just the sight of him made my stomach turn. How many people had he deceived already?

And yet, he just stood there in his disgusting room.
Motionless. Like always. I felt betrayed. Lied to. Stupid.
How could I have been so fucking naive?
Disgusting worm.

And the worst part?
I helped him. I helped him trap a victim. I beat myself up over it for hours, but in the end, I felt like I deserved to be the one, to take revenge.

Cherry, or whatever the hell this thing was, was going to suffer anyway.
If not by my hand, then someone else’s. But someone would make him pay.
So I typed in the chat.
I kept it simple. Clear. Even for someone like him, surrounded by child porn posters on his walls, I gave him a dignified death.

Cherry reached down... and slit his own throat with a knife. He bled out right there on the floor of his filthy room.
The whole thing devastated me.
I think he deserved it. But was I really his killer?
I couldn’t decide. I just kept spiraling...until I finally fell asleep.


I woke up with a jolt.
The events from the night before were still gnawing at me. The moment I sat up in bed, my hand reached for my phone. I wanted to check the app.
But I couldn’t open it.
It was still on my phone, but when I tapped it, a message popped up:


“Access denied. Your account has been banned.”


Somehow... it was a relief. At last, I didn’t have access to that horror anymore. But it also pissed me off.
Why was I banned? Did they still want something from me?

The morning dragged on. I couldn’t focus on anything. It felt like my mind was somewhere else, not even in this world anymore.
I could barely eat. Sipped on coffee. Forced down a banana.
I told myself that after this nightmare of a week, this Saturday should just be a quiet day.
Stay home. Try to ease back into normal life.
That’s when my phone buzzed.
The app. The message was simple:


“The stream is starting.”


What stream? What the hell is this?

I opened the notification, and my phone slipped right out of my hand.
It was a livestream. Just like always.
But this time...it was my living room on the screen.

I stood there, in my pajamas. Staring at myself.
I was live now, too.
