It all started this morning. We were just minding our own business, watching the cameras, making sure the T-Rexes stayed in their enclosure. The rain was steady, but nothing too serious. By afternoon, the storm got worse. Thunder shook the compound, rattling the walls. When we were heading back to the staff quarters, my radio crackled to life. Lightning had struck somewhere in the system, deactivating the fences.

Two T-Rexes running loose? That was unthinkable. They sent us — me and Carter — to reboot the system. We grabbed our flashlights and stun batons, knowing full well what we were walking into. The lightning lit up the muddy path to the tower, illuminating trees bending under the wind, puddles reflecting the flashes like mirrors. Every flash made me jump.

As we approached the fence, I could hear the faint rumble of something massive moving in the distance. My stomach knotted. The T-Rexes weren’t panicked yet; they were just… aware. Waiting. Watching. Carter muttered something about the storm, trying to calm himself, but I could feel his fear. It mirrored my own.

We reached the tower. The panels were sparking from the rain, water dripping down wires. I reached out to touch the main switch — wet gloves making it slippery, every spark a little jolt through my hand. Behind me, a low, rumbling growl echoed through the enclosure. I froze. Lightning lit up the field, and for one terrible second, I saw it — the shadow of one of the beasts moving, massive and silent, eyes reflecting the light like fire.

Carter hissed, gripping his baton tighter. “Did you see that?” I nodded. We both knew there was no turning back. The system needed to come online before they got close enough to test the fences themselves. Every muscle in my body screamed to run, but I couldn’t. I had to finish this.

I flipped the main breaker. Sparks flew. The screen flickered. The fence hummed back to life — but for how long? That growl behind us didn’t stop. Lightning flashed again, and the shadow moved closer. The rain masked the sound of its footsteps, but I could hear the heavy thud of its claws striking the mud somewhere just beyond the tower.

The system wasn’t rebooting fast enough. Every second felt like an eternity. Then we heard it — a loud, bone-shaking roar, followed by a massive crash. Cables snapped, whipping into the rain, striking the mud. The tower shook beneath our feet with each step of the Beast.

I froze as lightning illuminated the window. Its head peeked inside the tower, massive jaws clamping down on steel supports. The whole structure shuddered. Then, with a deafening roar, it ripped the tower off its base, dropping it onto our vehicle with a sickening crunch. Carter and I were thrown across the floor like ragdolls, scraping our arms and backs.

We scrambled to our feet, grabbing the stun batons. Each step outside was cautious, our boots sliding in the mud. Then the radio crackled. Someone was shouting over the storm, telling us to stay calm and not move. I didn’t even answer. The roar had already alerted the Beast to our location. Its footsteps pounded toward us, each one a hammer against the earth.

Panic took over. We ran. I could barely see through the rain and darkness, but we made it to the staff quarters. Relief didn’t last long. A second roar split the air, and the other T-Rex smashed through unelectrified cables, charging toward us like a living avalanche. Its eyes locked on us, herding us toward the small outpost nearby, its jaws snapping, teeth glinting in the lightning.

In the distance, we saw a single security guard locking up for the night. Relief surged through us. We started yelling, waving our flashlights, hoping he’d notice. Luckily, he did — and he saw the T-Rexes too. He fumbled with his keys, finally unlocking the door, and ran inside. The door was swinging shut, but we made it just in time.

We were safe… for now.

But the floor trembled beneath our feet. BANG… BANG… BANG. The thick metal door shuddered as the T-Rexes smashed against it, their massive heads rattling the frame. Mud and water from the storm splashed inside with every impact. We started running deeper into the outpost, hearts hammering.

I grabbed the radio and tried to reach the nearest ranger station, my voice cracking as I begged them to send a team, to rescue us. But my pleas fell on deaf ears. The man on the other end asked, flatly, if we’d read the staff manual. Of course we hadn’t — nobody read that 100+ page monstrosity. I begged again, voice trembling.

“Stay calm,” he said. “Turn off the radio, lock yourself in a room, and pray.”

I slammed the radio to the floor. A huge mistake.

A deafening roar shook the outpost. Concrete dust rained down. The ceiling above us caved under the weight of the T-Rex crashing through. I barely had time to register the sound before it slammed down on Carter. He screamed. Then silence. The beast had eaten him in a single, horrifying motion.

I didn’t stop. The security guard and I ran blindly through the corridors, smoke and debris in our faces. The roar behind us never stopped, vibrating the walls with each step of the massive predators. Every corner, every doorway seemed like a potential death trap, and I realized, with a sick twist in my stomach, that nobody was coming for us. Nobody ever would.

We locked ourselves in the maintenance room. The smell of oil and damp concrete clung to the air, the only reminder that there was still a building left above us. The security guard was eaten yesterday.

We thought the T-Rexes had been contained. We really believed it. So we checked it out.

We were wrong.

A T-Rex got him right in front of me. One second he was there, the next he was gone in a spray of water and mud. I was almost eaten too, but I managed to jab it with my stun baton, a quick surge of electricity that made it reel back long enough for me to dive into the maintenance room. I lost the baton in the process. My only weapon.

Now it’s just me. I’m hungry and thirsty. My lips are dry and cracked from whispering to no one.

It’s all quiet now. No roars. No footsteps. No crashes. Just rain dripping somewhere beyond the door. Maybe the dinosaurs were contained again. Maybe someone finally came.

But wouldn’t I hear voices? Wouldn’t I hear someone calling my name?

I don’t know anymore. The silence feels heavier than the roars ever did.

I’m going to check.
