When my son, Melvin, moved back in, I thought it would be temporary. At 32, he should’ve had his life together, but he’d been struggling since he left college. It wasn’t the first time he’d landed back on my doorstep, and I know many parents will say that I shouldn't have let him back in. But I can't help but feel I'm the one to blame for where he's at in life. Being a single mom since he was 2, it was very hard and I did whatever I could to get us here in the States so that he could have a good life far away from the drama I was surrounded by in the Philippines. Before his dad died I told him, "I hope you die," because he had been beating me day and night. A week after I said that he got in a fatal car accident. Maybe if I hadn't, Melvin wouldn't be where he is at today. 

So, yes, I took him back in with open arms. I let him settle back into his room and gave him a list of chores that I do around the house. I'm getting old, so I thought I could benefit as well with his young bones back home.

At first, it was fine. He kept to himself, helped with groceries, and even mowed the lawn once. But things changed quickly. He started bringing people over—friends, he called them. But each friend was someone new, or someone I simply didn't want in my home. Loud, chain-smoking, drinking until all hours of the night. I tried to talk to him about it once, but he brushed me off.

“Mom, I’m a grown ass man. You don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have over,” he snapped. “You never let me have privacy when I was a kid. You always barged in, and look how I turned out. Now you're going to do this to me again?"

His words stung. Was it true? Had I been that overbearing? I was strict but that's only because I was scared. Moving to a new country and trying to keep up with the different culture... trying to raise a son in a world I didn't fully understand... maybe I was too much on him? Melvin always blamed me for his struggles. I thought it was just an excuse, but what if I really had failed him?

I didn’t argue after that, but I started locking my bedroom door at night and told him that none of his friends are allowed on my side of the house.

But the first time I heard the scream I froze. I thought I imagined it, so I stood there in the kitchen with soap suds slowly popping on my dishwashing gloves. But the second time, it was unmistakable—a high-pitched, horrified cry coming from Melvin's room.

I knocked on his door, heart pounding.

“Melvin? Is everything okay?”

The screaming stopped immediately. His voice came through the door, calm and irritated. “I’m fine, Mom. Go back to bed.”

“But I heard—”

“You always think you hear something. It’s nothing. You need to relax-- and I told you that you need to mind your business.”

"But if one of your friends are hurt we need to call the ambulance," I persisted, attempting to open the door but it was locked, "Melvin, open this door NOW!"

After too long of a moment waiting there, he finally opened the door with his brows furrowed deeply, "Leave me alone."

I pushed past him, but I was shocked to realize nobody was there. 

"Was it you?" I asked him.

"Does it matter? I asked for privacy and you always push my boundaries. And you wonder why I hated you for so long." 

His words dug deep, and I apologized for bothering him.

But it wouldn't be the last time... because when I left the room I might've seen a red stain on the carpet near his closet door. Maybe it was from a small cut... or maybe he was hiding something from me.

The screaming continued, almost every night. Sometimes it was muffled, other times it was sharp enough to make me jump. Each time, Melvin had the same excuse. “You’re hearing things,” he’d say. “You need help.”

Eventually, he took me to the doctor.

“She’s been confused,” Melvin told the doctor, his voice full of concern. “Hearing things that aren’t there. She forgets stuff too.”

I tried to argue, but the doctor gave me a pitying look. “It could be the early stages of dementia or even schizophrenia,” he said. “Let’s start with a mild antipsychotic and see how you feel.”

The pills made me groggy, dulled my senses, but they didn’t stop the screaming. But as the screaming continued Melvin would just give me more medicine. Sometimes I wondered if I'd overdose just to get rid of the screaming. 

One night, I’d had enough. The screaming was louder than ever, and I couldn’t bear it anymore. I grabbed my keychain and went outside. My hands trembled as I crept around the house. When I reached Melvin's window, I peered inside.

My knees nearly buckled.

A young girl, maybe 18 years old or younger, was tied to a chair, her face streaked with tears and open wounds. Melvin and his friends surrounded her... laughing and jeering. One of them held a knife. Another held a camera. Melvin was holding her detached foot.

I don’t remember running back into the house. I don’t remember unlocking Melvin's door. All I remember is the girl’s glazed over eyes and the way her body was exposed not without clothes, but with skin dangling off her face and revealing her insides.

I woke up in a hospital bed, my wrists strapped down. My body ached—bruises lined my arms, and there was a bandage on my forehead.

Melvin sat beside me, his face pale and tear-streaked. “Mom,” he said, his voice trembling. “You… you attacked me. You were screaming about a girl. You tried to hurt yourself. I didn’t know what else to do.”

I stared at him, my throat dry. “The girl,” I whispered. “Where is she?”

His eyes filled with fresh tears. “There is no girl, Mom. You’re sick. You need help.”

The doctor came in then, kind but firm. “It’s important for you to rest,” he said. “Your son told us about the trauma you suffered in the past. Sometimes, our minds can play tricks on us, especially when we’ve been through so much."

Melvin squeezed my hand before he left. “I love you, Mom,” he said, "I hope you come to your senses soon... I'll look after the house while you're getting better."

Now I just lay in bed, unbothered by any screams but heavily medicated. I feel like I'm in a different world. I feel like I am no longer human. I think about my house, and I wonder if the screaming is continuing there. But then I think about Melvin and how similar he looks to his father. The doctors tell me I probably hold a grudge against my own son for what his father did to me, seeing myself as a young girl being abused... that it was my own screams that I've beeb remembering. 

But deep down I think there is something sinister going on back home... but I am too scared of being wrong anymore.
