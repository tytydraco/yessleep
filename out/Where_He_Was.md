I never knew where my dad was, nor do I recall having any memories of him. For as long as I’ve known, it’s always been my mum and I.

My 18th birthday was coming up. I didn't necessarily want or need anything, but to find out about my dad. My mum never really talked about him.

she would constantly avoid anything that she knew would lead to me asking about my dad.
 
“your birthday is tomorrow”

mum mumbled, breaking the silence that had sat in the kitchen, along with the two of us. I wasn’t as excited as I should’ve been.

 “It's just like any other day” I shrugged.

she knew I wasn’t looking forward to it. I was lost in my thoughts while finishing up the rest of my cereal when suddenly, she dropped an envelope in front of my bowl. 

“from your dad”

I was taken aback, hearing those words as I glanced at the strange envelope. 

“My darling, Grace” 

written in black pen, in the centre of the envelope. 

I looked over at Mum who looked like she hadn’t slept properly for a few days now, she’d left the room as soon as she saw me pick the envelope up. 
 
I cautiously opened the envelope and pulled out a piece of paper. an address met my gaze.

 I took the piece of paper to my bedroom and placed it on my bedside table. 

I decided I'd get some rest, then go to the address tomorrow. my birthday. 

I knew it wasn’t a very wise choice to go to the strange address but I had waited for as long as I could remember to find out about my dad, this was my chance. 

The morning came and the sun filled my room. I hadn't slept last night as my mind had been racing all night long. 

I briskly washed up and got ready before making my way downstairs. a mysterious, purple box was left on the countertop. 

I peeked out the kitchen window which had a view of the front yard, mum's car was gone.
 
I put my shoes on before quickly heading out the door. Was I seriously going to be meeting my dad? this mysterious man whom I’d not been aware of for most of my life. 

I pulled the paper out of my pocket.

361 Crescent Rd. 

I searched for the address on the maps app. I sighed in relief seeing as it was a 30min walk. 

After walking for what felt like forever, while a million thoughts crossed my mind, I finally saw the street sign. 

361 Crescent Rd. 

My eyes were met with a stone gate, at first I was confused. I looked at the paper once more.

361 Crescent Rd.

Before my mind could register what I was looking at, my phone went off.

“You’ve arrived at your destination”

I glanced around only to see the sign to the left of the moss-covered gate. 

“Brooks Memorial Garden”

I finally found where he was.
