I stood there, petrified, looking at Captain's eyes. I didn't say anything because, to be honest, I was afraid of the dog actually answering me. I didn't want to hear that terrifying voice ever again, and hopefully convince myself it was all my imagination, but deep down I knew... I knew it was something more than a mere hallucination.

Something clicked then and there, and a spark of hope gave me shivers; what if I was just having a bad dream? But then I was way past that, with the never-ending flashes of pain coming from the gunshot and the bite wounds. Like a statue, my body was frozen solid before the officer's body, next to the dog.

"Home", he said once more, crushing any hope I had left of it not being real.

I mumbled something about the car being broken, home being too far from here, and the city's exits being all guarded and closed. Halfway through my excuses, Captain just started walking towards the police car, now orphaned behind the barricade. Not al exits were guarded, I guess. He waited patiently for me to open the door, and he jumped right in. I sat on the driver's seat and noticed the key was missing. I looked back to the corpse and caught a glimpse of a keychain on its belt, so I went back to it and grabbed the keys. I also grabbed the gun in the most inconspicuous way possible, shoving it inside my pants. 3 bullets left on the magazine.

I drove back home through deserted roads. No cars whatsoever, no people. Only a 45 minutes drive to get back to that lonely house I moved into after Emerett's death. Too much time to think, though all my thoughts moved around the dog. My mind felt like it was engulfed in some sort of thick fog. I could not stop having the same thoughts over and over again, like my brain was trapped in a wicked loop of terror, pain and sadness. "What's going on?" followed by "did Captain really spoke to me?" and "what can I even do?", eventually stained by a "I wish I had some painkillers right now".

"Park" said the dog when we were about to get home.

I looked at him through the rear-view mirror; his eyes locked on mine, as if he was expecting me to look at him. I just took a left on the following street and got to the park once again. It was different this time, actually full of people and their dogs. It was early afternoon, and I could see the terror, the dread, in people's faces. Some of them turned their heads to me, to the car I was driving, most likely, and I swear you could see the hope on their blurry faces at the thought of the police coming to help. Hope turned to disappointment when I parked the car and got out. I saw my reflection on the window right before opening Captain's door; a trail of dry blood that had flowed down from my shoulder, a sad patch of gauze covering the bite, my eyes all sunken on my eye sockets, the way my hand was shaking at the thought of opening the door. Yet I did. Opened it.

Captain got out calmly, slowly, like a king marching before it's servants. I followed him, and all the other dogs turned their heads towards him. Again, all of them having identical rocks to the one he was carrying, but smaller. That same feeling I had at the veterinary hospital, such tension I felt like I could barely breathe. Big dogs, small dogs, senior dogs, puppies, some clean, some covered in blood, others in mud or filth, with or without collar, harness or something in between. There was A LOT of dogs there.

"H-help" whispered one man, locked in place beside his dog.

I honestly could not help him even if I knew how. I was way too afraid to do anything else than following the dog. I didn't even replied, I just walked to the skate-park, back to that concrete pit. The whole border of the pit was full of dogs, some of them with their owners, some without. But the real punch to the gut, the terror-inducing sight, the nightmare-made-real, was what was inside the pit.

A collection of corpses laid down there, at first I thought it was dozens of bodies, but a second glance told me the count was on the hundreds; not all bodies were complete, some of them were dismembered, or a single head, a finger... No apparent order behind it, just... meat. Dead meat. I couldn't hold the vomit any longer, and threw up right next to an aggressive-looking chihuahua that didn't react at all. I looked at the ground and saw other vomits laying there, which was sort of comforting, I guess. And then I looked back at the pit.

Captain was inside it, gracefully moving from body to body, avoiding the pool of coagulated blood underneath that looked more like a giant, red snot than actual blood. When he reached the center of it, or a spot close enough to what would be the center, he turned around and looked back at me. I returned the look, hoping for some sort of understanding between us, maybe even empathy, but all I could see behind his eyes now was something different to what Captain once was. There was no dog, no puppy, no friend, just some sort of new creature that had taken his body.

He turned, slowly looking at all the other dogs, dropped his rock to the pool of blood beneath, and howled. The other dogs went mad, turning on their owners - those who had them - and torn them apart. Some dogs needed some help, like the chihuahua, from their neighbours to take care of the job, but most of them didn't. Unable to take my eyes off the bodies, a familiar voice forced me to.

"Why did you leave me there to die, dad?"

Emerett's voice came from Captain. He was not even moving his mouth, the words just coming out of his throat as if the dog had swallowed a speaker. His eyes, all white populated by engorged blood vessels, showed no trace of pupils, saliva dripping from the gaping hole serving as a mouth; that... thing, that creature was mimicking my dead son's voice... or was it Emerett himself? It could not be. It could not be that sweet 10 year old kid that died alone in the hospital while his dad was working, how could it?

What could I do? What could have anyone done in the middle of that maddening carnage? I quickly grabbed the gun, hand violently shaking, and pulled it out. Four bullets would certainly not be enough to stop the carnage, but what if...

What if I just killed Captain?
