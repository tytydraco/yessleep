Right now Iâ€™m hiding in my closet typing this out in case something happens to me. 

I was hungry so I went downstairs, why didn't I just go to sleep? I stood in front of the fridge, the only light being the blue emitting from the fridge along with the blast of cold air. When I realized there was absolutely nothing good, I turned from the fridge...then I froze in place. There was something in the street. 

At first, I thought it was a shadow, but when I walked closer my heart stopped. It was a person. A person lying flat on their back, arms out, staring up at the sky. I inched closer to the window. The person appeared to be a man by the build, but something was off about the body. I couldn't quite place it, but it made my skin crawl.

Slowly, I picked up my phone I had left on the counter and opened the camera. With a shaking hand, I snapped a picture of the person. By doing that simple action, my fate was sealed. The flash shone through the window as the image was captured. The person's head jerked in the direction of me. Our eyes locked. Its face was completely black, except for the red eyes and mouth full of sharp teeth. Now that it was looking at me, I could see that its entire body was black, as if it was devoid of any light, as if it was made of darkness.

I watched in fear as it got onto its feet, revealing its true form. It was over eight feet tall with arms that brushed against the concrete, it had sharp nails at the end of each grotesquely long finger, and it was looking directly at me. Its eyes were hungry as we stared at each other. 

Then it started running.

My body unfroze and I broke out into a sprint. I ran upstairs right as I heard something slam into my house. Glass shattered downstairs and I heard a guttural scream. It was inside. I ran into my closet and pushed the clothes out of the way, burying myself to get away from whatever that thing in my house was. 

Loud footsteps echoed throughout my house. My heart slammed against my chest as its voice traveled through the walls. It was animalistic, not of this world.

"I can smell your flesh."

I held my breath, as if that would do anything.

I could hear scratching against the walls as the footsteps progressed through the house. With every step I could feel the house tremor. 

"Your blood smells sweet."

It was getting closer.

"Can I taste it?"

Tears slipped down my face as it drug its nails across a wall not far from where I was hiding.

I waited for it to get closer, to get me, but the house was silent after the last scratch. 

It's been five minutes of silence, I think it may have left. I think I'm safe. But I'll wait, I'll wait until I know it's truly safe, when-

It just started tapping on the door.
