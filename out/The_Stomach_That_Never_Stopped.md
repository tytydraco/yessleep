I had to leave.

The air, thick with stench from something ancient and decayed, clung to my skin. It seemed heavy, almost alive, like it wanted to scuttle under my skin. I looked helplessly at the throbbing, hideous creature in front of me while my knees shook beneath me like jello. It was alive. It moved. It was not something that should be. It was wrong in every sense of the word.

My eyes burned from the reek, but I couldn’t look away. I didn’t want to. I needed to understand—needed to make sense of the nightmare unfolding before me.

The walls around me were covered—dripping—with a substance. A horrible, oily blackness, leaking like something from inside. Inside me, maybe. It was as though the very air was seeping into the walls, staining them, consuming them. Every inch of space seemed tainted by it, like it had always been there, waiting.

The creature—it didn’t have a face. Not one I recognized. Instead, a mass of writhing tubes emerged from where its head should have been, each one spitting out filth, churning bile. It was its mouth, I knew that now. It was more than a mouth. It was a hunger. It wasn’t just eating—it was devouring the very essence of the room, the space around it, tearing apart whatever was near.

The bile spilled across the floor, thick and sticky like molten tar, leaving trails as it slithered in all directions, staining the walls with its acidic residue. It was alive—I could feel it, that pull, that sucking, that overwhelming need for more. It wasn’t satisfied. Not yet. The walls trembled with the creature’s need, and I could feel my stomach churn in sync with its unholy hunger. I could taste it. The stench filled my throat. The sourness, the burning heat. My stomach twisted, wanting to eject everything I’d ever eaten, every ounce of food in my body. I clenched my teeth, trying not to give in.

The sound was unbearable. The sickening gurgling, the slopping as the liquid slithered across the floor like it was hunting, searching for its next victim. I could almost hear the walls groaning with the weight of it all. They were groaning for it.

But worse than that—worse—was what I saw next.

From its bloated, oozing belly, a pair of hands emerged. Their fingers long and twisted, dripping with the same vile black substance that pulsed through its veins. They scratched, desperate to tear through the mass of filth. They tore through the sludge and dragged themselves along the ground, dragging something toward me. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see what it was. But I couldn’t turn away.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away. My eyes were locked to it, my body frozen in place by a force I couldn’t explain.

Then, something moved beneath me. I had to scream, but the sound wouldn’t come. The floor beneath me was no longer solid—its surface now undulated, soft and warm, like the skin of a living thing, breathing beneath my feet. It shifted and churned beneath me, a nauseating feeling crawling up my spine. It was as though the very ground was alive, hunting. I couldn’t breathe. I felt like it was reaching up to take me, to drag me down into the same place the creature was from. My feet sank deeper, and I tried to pull them free, but the floor—the flesh—held me in place, a vice grip tightening around my legs.

I looked down and saw what I feared most.

The floor—it wasn’t floor. It was something alive, a pulsating mass of muscle and flesh, throbbing with a grotesque rhythm. It wasn't wood or stone. I could feel it breaking me down; it was living, like a huge stomach. It wanted more because it was hungry. Below me, the flesh—no, the skin—was no longer solid. It was supple. Warm. Inhaling. It invited me into its depths and communicated to me in a language of gurgles.

As though to notice me, to tell me that I would never get away, the beast shouted. It had an insatiable appetite. My body was already inside of it, already contributing to the never-ending cycle of decay and consumption. It had begun with the floor beneath me, and now it was inside me. I felt the pull deep in my gut, and I knew—I knew—there was no escaping it. The cycle would never stop.

It wasn't the end. It was only the beginning—the start of something far worse, something that would absorb everything I had ever known and torment me for the rest of my life. There was no escape. There would never be an escape.

It had never been the end.
