I think I’m in a strangers car, wearing the face, mask and voice of my friend. It sounds like them, it breathes like them. It is for all intents and purposes my friend. He scratches his arms when he’s nervous, hums along to a tune stuck in his head, scans the forest as he drives but he is not him. I think this is where people post strange experiences so while he keeps his eyes on the road I’m typing this out on his phone in hope one of you can help me, I mean surely this has happened to someone else. So I suppose I’ll start from the beginning? To give you as much information as possible? I don’t know how much of this is useful but well I asked my wonderful roommate to drive me to the library on campus, it was late in the evening around 7:30? I don’t remember what was said or getting to the car but not out of any supernatural reason just because it was so mundane. I do remember thanking him because he hates leaving once he gets back from dinner but it was so cold out and I didn’t feel great being a woman alone walking for thirty minutes to the library. 

Once we were leaving the apartment complex we were stopped at the light to get towards the campus, he had complained “GOD! That light always is red when I get to it. No matter what time. I don’t think it’s ever been green when I get to it.” The moment the words left his mouth it turned green and he drove through turning left into the forest. See our campus is laid out in a straight line with forest on both sides making it a large oval, you can’t go through it so you had to drive around the campus through the forest to get anywhere. I don’t know if I’m explaining this well but it’s a surprisingly long drive through the forest to anywhere on campus, always slightly longer than you expect. A guy had crossed in front of the car carrying a keyboard without a case or anything, and before you judge my friend please do remember it’s late at night and we are college students, he said “wow that guy is really raw dogging that piano”

I had responded “why would you say that?” He smiled wide grinning and shrugged, I asked again “why on earth would you possibly say that?” I think I laughed but I don’t remember. It was just so random

He shook his head “I mean he’s carrying that through the snow without any protection! Actually why is he carrying that this late at night? Why would you need to transport something so fragile now?” I hadn’t known, maybe I suggested an explanation or maybe I had just zoned out. Eventually he said “the snow and fog are a bit scary, I suppose it’s just the low visibility. But be careful the Babadook doesn’t get you!”

I was really confused because somehow my life experiences lined up perfectly that I had no clue what he was talking about but I had heard about “Marmaduke?” He burst into a fit of laughter and I knew I had said something stupid.

He explained “it’s a spooky guy from a movie. A bad boring movie, in my opinion. I think it’s about a woman grieving the loss of her love, then her son, I think, starts seeing a spooky imaginary friend. She starts seeing it all around, this imaginary creature starts invading her life trying to kill her and just nothing happens the whole time, it is so boring. Wow this road feels long, is it always this long? I feel like I talking a lot am I talking a lot? I’m just really tired and a bit on ed-“ he slammed down hard on the break, which made the car make a terrible noise as it skidded across the frozen ice. Before I could ask him what the hell he thought he was doing, a boy appeared from seemingly no where biking like his life depended on it out of the woods perused by three deer, “what the hell?” He whispered as the kid disappeared back into the woods on the other side. I think I mentioned being surprised, sorry if I’m gliding past the things I said but it simply does not matter as much as all the things he said. you’ll see. Actually you don’t need to know all this context probably I’m just going to write all the things he said, I am on a bit of a time crunch maybe, I don’t know actually. It just feels a bit urgent, here’s everything he said.

“I just felt something was off so I hit the brakes”

“That was kind of insane actually”

“I did actually see that right?”

“If you think these roads are bad don’t go out to the rural areas upstate. Those go on for eternity. It’s purgatory. You just keep driving with only the noise of your gps telling to continue straight, the same sights repeating over and over stretching on for forever”

“Don’t worry the library is open. I’m pretty sure it closes at nine. No way the library is closed.”

“Oh my god we are finally out of the woods. We’re not out of the woods yet except we uh are. I need to sleep. Wake me I’m asleep at the wheel, my brain is fully off.”

Finally we got to the library parking lot, as he turned in I gripped my bag tightly, “ shit I forgot my… don’t worry actually” he always got so mad at me every time I forgot my phone. He doesn’t understand how I forget something so important. I had not put any thought into getting home, just figured I could borrow a librarians phone and call him, even if he absolutely never answers the phone for any unknown numbers, at least the voicemail might clue him in. 

There was a guy sitting in front of the library within earshot so when I exited in an attempt to embarrass me he said “Have a great first day of school sweet heart! I love you! Don’t forget your IBS meds!” I may have flipped him off, or maybe I told him I loved him back, part of me hopes I told him I love him back. If that is the last interaction we will ever have I wish I played into his bit. I waved as he drove away walking up to the library. I noticed the lights were off but I really didn’t want to believe it. I pulled the door and it thunked, the I pushed it and it still refused to budge.

I whispered “damn it.” Before turning to the guy outside “can I borrow your phone?” He just stared forwards, so I asked “are you alright?” He just kept on staring, I waved my hand in front of his face but he didn’t react at all. “Bud are you high, or having a medical emergency? Or…..”

Suddenly he moved beginning to tie his shoe saying “ah don’t worry about me my ride will be here in a moment.” He seemed to be fine and I heard Sam, my friend I don’t think I mentioned that, I heard the horn on Sam’s car. He rolled down the window and waved at me. I wish I could say there was a way of knowing that wasn’t him. That the driver was a fucking imposter,  but it was cold and the guy was freaking me out so I ran towards his car to get in.

He smiled at me with that damn crooked smile he always has on his stupid face, “the library is closed.”

I nodded frustrated, “no shit Sherlock.”

He got a wistful look in his eyes “I’m pretty sure it closes at nine”

I grumbled “well it didn’t. Did it” I just stared out the window as we drove, kind of tired too. It had been a long semester filled with terrible professors and assignments. I think I dozed off for a bit at that point to the smooth tune of the wheels in the well groomed icy road. Sam’s car had the wrong time on it, it always had the wrong time in it and it seemed to be off by a different amount of time every time I got in it. When I dozed off when it read “29:b4” when I woke up it read “29:b2” so I had no clue how much time had passed but it felt like it was more than ten minutes, I clicked on his phone which was sitting on the console plugged into the charger, the clock was missing from the Lock Screen, in my half asleep state I don’t think I questioned it. Instead I asked him “how long was I out?”

Sam took a long breath before saying “Those go on for eternity”

I thought that was a really strange thing to say, even for him even tired, “what?” I poked his arm 

He smiled keeping his eyes on the road “GOD! That light always is red when I get to it. No matter what time. I don’t think it’s ever been green when I get to it.”

“Sam?” I waved my hand in front of his eyes, the same way I did the guy in front of the loiterer. When he didn’t react I held my hands directly in front of his eyes for a long period of time. He drove as if he had perfect visibility. His eyes scanning my hand in a facsimile of a charming attribute, which meant nothing when done without reason. This mimic stole hollow personality traits. 

He said “Those go on for eternity. It’s purgatory…over and over stretching on for forever…Wake me I’m asleep at the wheel, my brain is fully off.” He continued repeating nonsense constantly. I don’t know how long it’s been, it could’ve been five minutes it could have been eight hours. The road just continues never ending nor changing at all. The bumping of the wheels is making all the thoughts leave my brain, I feel like I can’t hold onto any thought for more than a couple of seconds. I think I’m going to die. The snow stopped at some point, not that it stopped falling but it’s now suspended in air. I grabbed his phone what felt like an eon ago, I considered calling the police but what would I say that I think I’ve been on a road too long, that my friend is talking nonsense. I don’t know anyone else to call, I don’t have phone numbers memorized and Sam and I don’t have any mutual friends. I considered fighting him but he is a rugby player and I am 5’2” and disabled. Even if I somehow managed to overpower him we would definitely drive of the road in the ensuing conflict. Even blinking feels like it takes up an insurmountable amount of energy, I am typing this with one finger as I’m slumped over. I can’t think much anymore. Thoughts r getting harder. My brain hurts. Is this normal? I don’t think it is. I think I’m going to die, no I know I’m going to die. He’s still talking, so loud it hurts “the library is closed…so fragile now…grieving the loss of her love…EVERYTHING HURTS. SOMEONE HELP ME…I love you!” I think he went through this too sometimes he sys new things like th@ and it scaress me. & he went threw it alone. I ca n t mo vv e iii am go eng 2 dye I m soory
