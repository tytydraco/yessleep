Recently, I moved house.

I left a terrible house, neglectful landlord and extortionate rent. It was the epitome of the London experience. I was treated to silverfish, disgusting bugs that I saw more often than my housemates, and a broken heating system that nearly led to me succumbing to an electrical fire after my landlords gave me a faulty heater. I hated it.

Why did I spend two years of my precious existence in a place that pushed me to connect with the spiders in my room? They were the only effective form of pest control, after all.

I was kept there by what existed around my house – the green, leafy suburbia of West London. The emerald in its crown, moulded and shaped by the serpentine River Thames that placed me in the English countryside of my youth more so than of the city I had hoped to love. Along its banks, charming settlements like Richmond, Barnes, Ham and Twickenham held me close in an embrace of middle-class superiority.

I remember so vividly being surrounded by my friends at the Dove in Hammersmith, a Pimms in my hand, looking across the most gorgeous view of the Thames, basking in the silhouettes of distant bridges.

This was my home, even if where I slept was not.

I lived right on the border between Hounslow and Ealing, just on the cusp of Gunnersbury Park, and from this staging post I was able to connect into charming restaurants, the Royal Botanical Gardens, quaint bookshops and my favourite pub quiz at the Shaftesbury – giving my team the deviously named “We Put the Shaft in Shaftesbury”.

People would, as polite society is one to do, ask me, “Adam – where do you live?”. I would lie, knowing that South Ealing wasn’t really a place, but a series of houses built around a tube station, and respond with any of the much sexier options of Kew Bridge, Chiswick or the especially egregious Greater Richmond.

Now connectivity between the southwest of London and west of London is a difficult one for those who love the luxury of a stuffy tube service – the trains go towards the centre and then back on themselves. This journey of Ealing to Richmond and Kingston is a path only trodden by cars and the iconic symbol of London – the double decker red bus.

The 65 bus is a route that connects Ealing Broadway and Kingston – and I only just realise how much this service, one that celebrated its centenary of existence last year, has seen my life grow. It also happens to be the favourite bus route of the incumbent Rail Minister, Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill.

I first met the 65 travelling to Cheam, the home of my ex-girlfriend.

I did not think much of this service when I first boarded at Challis Road. Beyond the near constant stop-starting across its route, the only memory I had taken away was the existence of a large elephant bush-sculpture somewhere near Ham.

On this inaugural journey, I saw the full length of what it had to offer, going deeper into the heart of suburbia before changing at Kingston bus station to get the much more recognisable Super Loop service. I probably, in that moment, thought more about the Five Guys that I bought a milkshake from than I did the means of arriving.

Fast forward nearly two years and it would be the very same service I had to take, simply in reverse, when I broke up with her.

The N65, its edgier nighttime twin, was an oasis from drunken, stumbling nights in central London. My desire for alcohol and the company of long-lost friends held me fixed to a pub or club as the last Tube came rolling through nearby stations. Despite the more colourful characters that would populate these late services, it watched me evolve from someone who gagged at the smell of wine, to the slightly late blooming adult I am still to this day.

After the first holiday with my now-girlfriend to Edinburgh, one in which I think we truly fell in love with one another, the 65 carried us back home. I remember this journey because we had missed our last tube, and Ubers were being expectedly unreliable. I was stressed, a level of anxiety took over me as I worried if we’d ever make it home at a reasonable time, and she calmed me down on that bus while we listened to my favourite audio drama, her getting to observe a side of myself that I would rather have kept hidden.

To say that the 65 has been an unintentional passenger in my life would be an understatement. Beyond the house I despised, it was the only other constant across those two years. It was an artery that I clung to as a catalyst for solace. A vital vein that connected me to one of my coping mechanisms,  the not-so-hidden gems of southwest London, the Kew to Richmond towpath – my truest home.

This riverside walk was the go-to-cure for my woes and ills. Whenever I felt bored, exhausted, anxious, sad, happy or lonely, I would put on my shoes, embark upon the 65 to carry me to Kew, load up on snacks at the Tesco Express and loop from Kew to Richmond and back again by foot. This journey would take me about 3 hours, and I would do it nearly every single day.

Running parallel to Kew Gardens, I was able to look upon vast 19^(th) century feats of architecture, intertwining forests and rowers cutting through the water.

The beauty of its sights is genuinely unparalleled to any other London Walk that I’ve experienced. I miss it.

In August 2023, I had grown used to the bright evenings of Summer – those where the Sun would set a couple hours before midnight. This was my favourite time to walk. I would embrace the dull evening warmth, so much cooler than the blaring sun of hours prior and engage with my daily ritual. A podcast blaring in my ears, and eyes setting upon sights of constant repetition, but those that still filled me with the same wonder of the very first time.

Yet with familiarity emerges complacency, and I had become a fool. For some reason lost to memories burnt from my mind, I had decided to leave my house far later than usual and start my walk in reverse – striding upon Kew Road into Richmond rather than starting from the towpath.

I had never tried to walk the towpath in the dark. I had no memories of streetlights that could’ve aided my journey. I didn’t reflect once on the memories of walking along Kew Bridge in the late hours of prior evenings, moments where I went “huh yeah that’s dark” as I looked out at what would’ve been the route I was about to take.  Yet with my brain switched off, listening to some amateurly written horror stories, doing something that I had done close to 100 times before, I simply did not think that it would be a problem.

The walk started as familiar as ever, and some streetlights dotted upon the banks of Thames began to illuminate as I started my journey towards Kew, serving as a false hope to my idling brain that the rest of it would be similarly bright.

While the sun was still visible, it had sunken low and cast an orange glow across the horizon. Slowly, as my footsteps echoed along a road of dwindling people, it transformed into a muted dark blue. It became apparent to me far too late that I was the only person for as far as I could see.

For a journey I had taken so many times before, an ill familiarity took a hold of me as the natural glow of the fading sun tried hard to pierce through the trees, but failed, making everything just slightly different. Bushes felt larger, their shadows consuming the path. The branches from the trees jutted out to create a canopy that once felt like a hug from nature, but now felt intentional, holding me tight. The towns and villages on the other side of the Thames were now silhouettes, faint lights from tired occupants slowly extinguishing as I pressed on.

I took too many steps before I realised that I could no longer see far ahead, relying upon the occasional break in the treeline for a faint outline of where I would need to travel to next.

Leaves that were once individually perceptible formed a mass of darkness, and the stones beneath my feet curved in ways that felt like they’d pierce the sole of my shoes. There came a moment where began to lower the volume of my podcast. The horror stories that would once fill my mind with creativity suddenly felt far too real and I had chosen to switch to an upbeat soundtrack to force my brain out of a state of fear. It was as I paused the podcast that I had noticed it was the only sound. I took one step forward and the crunch of matter below my feet echoed through my surroundings.

The call of birds and faint laughter from pub side chats were gone. It did not matter how recently I had remembered them being present, they were nowhere. And so was I. The wind did now blow. I was the sole source of disturbance. Noise did not return.

I began to panic as I frantically turned my phone’s torch on to scan the route ahead of me, tracing myself along Google Maps to see if I should just pivot and turn back rather than face the uncertainty of what lay ahead. Unfortunately, I had ventured too deep. It would take me the same amount of time to get closer to home than it would to get back to Richmond, the choice had been made for me.

Using the torch, I aimed it ahead to check every inch of woodland and greenery for something that lay dormant, ready to find me and my isolation. It was then that I had noticed a cast iron bench.

Where before the darkness created new shapes out of the land that I knew had always been there, this was something completely new. While benches were not uncommon, this looked rusted with age, and far too uncomfortable for any normal person to use it. The back of the bench curved high, if I had sat down it would’ve surged passed my head by a few inches. It was wide and gently bent towards me.

I looked below.

The moss-covered bolts that presumably kept it pinned to the ground were unscrewed and discarded along the floor. As I began to bend down and pick one up, the darkness expanded and enveloped the floor. In a blink of horrified reaction, the darkness was gone, but so were the bolts, now tightened hard into the bench. My head throbbed.

I stepped back and saw the benches shadow grow. My mind was drawn to an ornate sheet of metal, but this plaque was empty. No dedications or “in loving memory” were printed out, just a faint outline of what I thought was my name. I did not look back as I left the bench behind.

The sun was gone.

In the feint outline of moonlight, a tree lay ahead. Its bark ran high, the tree merging into a mass of forestry that meant I saw no end, nor did I see where it began. Four orifices from the bark looked upon what I had hoped was the Thames.

I took a photo to send to my girlfriend, my terrified messages laying unread. My signal had disappeared.

The tree began to shift towards me and sang.

I looked at Google Maps, desperate for the solace of knowing I was nearly there. It could not find me.

I sprinted beyond the tree, its cacophony filling the air in a warped, slowed rhythm that felt like a melted record. I did not stop, catching my balance as the path began to decline and ascend, twisting and curving across itself. The further I ran the more the horizon disappeared, the stars above fading into the black of night.

I screamed but nothing came out of my empty lungs. I searched across the river for a reminder of where I was, but crooked shapes amassed around unfamiliar structures.

When I finally reached what I thought was Kew Bridge, my phone clinging to 1%, it wasn’t. It was a bridge, yes but not the one I knew. Older. Built of black brick. No traffic. Just a single red bus, parked in the middle of the span.

The 65. Its lights were on. The doors were open. I boarded.

The driver didn’t look up. I didn’t ask where we were going.

The doors hissed shut behind me. The air changed, heavy, viscous, like I’d stepped underwater. My ears popped. My chest tightened. The glass refused to show me the world as I tried to gaze out onto the streets.

We moved.

My eyes warped out onto the darkness surrounding me, and I tried to recognise the street. People walked backwards on the pavement, heads twitching every few seconds as though catching whispers from nowhere. A child pointed at me from the corner. Their hand had too many fingers. A dog barked, and the sound came out hours later, long after the dog had gone.

I closed my eyes for a second. When I opened them, I was home.

The 65 vanished into the darkness behind me. Not down the road but into it. Like the tarmac folded open and swallowed it whole.

That was nearly two years ago.

I tell people I’m fine. I go to work. I see friends. But something’s off. The sky is too low some days, like it’s pressing down on my head. My girlfriend doesn’t sleep anymore. She just lies there, eyes open, whispering in a language I don’t know. She says we never went to Edinburgh. She says we’ve never left London. We never lived together before that night.

Photos in my house keep changing. Not dramatically. Just a shadow moved here. A hand where there wasn’t one before.

The Shaftesbury’s gone. Boarded up. No one remembers it. The sign now says: “CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE SINCE 1965.”

At night, it calls. Not loudly. But low, and rhythmic. The river. It sounds like breath. Sometimes I see figures walking just beneath the surface, heads tilted, mouths open wide.

I avoid the towpath. But the 65? It doesn’t care.

I’ve moved house, moved to the other side of London, but I don’t dream. Because when I do, I’m back on that bus. I wake with bruises on my shoulders, handprints on my arms. My phone has pictures I didn’t take.

The journeys we take draw it closer to me. Tonight, as I write this down, I dreamt that it had pulled up outside my new home. I heard the engine purring, low and hungry, like it was just behind my window. The walls are thinner than they should be.

The 65 never left me, and I will never leave it.
