[The night of Gene Bowler’s death](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17vgk2k/i_got_a_coin_for_the_deathwish_well_i_should/) would have been a shitshow regardless, but my dad showing up in a drunken rage certainly didn’t help matters.

By the time dad stumbled home from the bar a little after two in the morning, the cops had already arrived, asking a ton of questions, throwing yellow tape around the entire five-acre field where Mr. Bowler had died.

“What’d those boys do this time?” my father shouted as we sat talking to a cop on the front porch. By then of course, the noise of the sirens had woken Callum who sat next to me wide-eyed in his Vanilla Ice pajamas.

My father screamed toward us and shouted obscenities. At some point, luckily, he must have realized we were only *witnesses* to something horrible, and he turned his rage on the cops.

They held my father back, and he stumbled as he tried to fight past them. You could tell he wasn’t quite there–something in his eyes told you–but he was still straining to get to us. Soon, he was berating them for questioning minors without an adult present, shouting about Miranda rights and attorneys not being present. 

My father certainly had never been to law school, only made it through a year of junior college. But something he said must have clicked, because before too long they stopped asking questions.

Dad rushed past us, hugging us close, and for once I wasn’t afraid of him, even though his breath and his gray beard stunk of Coors Lite. 

“We’ll be okay,” he said as the cops exited our porch. “You’ll be okay. Did he say anything to you? Mr. Bowler, I mean?”

Jordan gave me a hard look as I fingered the coin in my pocket.

“Nothing,” I said. “By the time we got to him, he was past the point of talking.”

I looked past my father at the police, who had gathered on the street. It wasn’t just our local cops, I realized. There were Sheriff’s deputies too, a whole lot of them. One pointed past the back field and over to the forest beyond, where I could see half a dozen flashlights sweeping the darkness. Someone far away was shouting. All the cops were on their walkie-talkies, talking in hushed voices. 

“They found another one,” my brother whispered. “Another body.”

He was right. 

By the end of the night, including Mr. Bowler, they’d find a total of four. 

Of course, there were all kinds of rumors about the people that died that night. The murdered men were all good friends. Well, apparently not that good of friends. They’d all come armed when they arrived at the forest that night, meeting close to the Mitchell Well, which stood at the end of an abandoned road a half mile into the woods. 

Of course, that was only the official name of it. Every kid in town knew its real name: the Deathwish Well. 

The dead men had lived in town all their lives. Gene Bowler ran the car dealership. Travis Willing was a successful realtor. Bill Knobbs managed a construction company that built the new mall over in Medford. Doug Reddy had grown a regional empire of fifty-eight sandwich shops.

These weren’t educated men, but each of them had clawed his way to the top of his little sphere. All of them had grown up poor and died millionaires. And all of them had once lived in our neighborhood.

“It’s no coincidence,” said Jordan as we were walking home from school a couple of days later. It had grown colder, and he was playing with his coin in his black-gloved hand. “All those guys from right here, making it big like that. A place like this, maybe one guy makes some money, moves to one of those big houses above the boulevard. But all four of those guys?”

“Maybe they helped each other out,” I said.

“Maybe something helped them out.” He held up his coin. “They all met by the well. We know at least Mr. Bowler had these two coins.”

“So–?”

“I don’t know,” he said. “Just… haven’t you felt this urge? Ever since that night?”

I wish I could say that I didn’t know what he was talking about. But I did. Ever since I’d taken Mr. Bowler’s coin, I’d felt a strange compulsion to walk into those woods. Until now, I’d dismissed it as stupid curiosity. There had been bodies there. Blood. Bullet shells. What boy in his right mind wouldn’t want to poke around in there? But I had to admit it wasn’t just that. There was something deeper pulling me into that forest.

“No idea what you’re talking about,” I told him.

He haucked up something yellow and spit onto the road. 

“Whatever,” he said. “I was mostly telling you as a favor. I’m heading in with or without you.”

I looked to my right, out at the treeline. Half a mile in, the Well waited. I’d never been to it myself, but a lot of the older boys had, my brother included. Visiting it at night was kind of a rite of passage, the culmination of a hundred different games of Truth or Dare. 

“Last chance,” he said, but I shook my head. We had reached the old dirt road that veered off into the forest toward the well. Time and rain had carved the road with scars deep enough that even an F250 with four-wheel drive couldn’t get far into the woods, but it was easy on foot, or so people said.

“I should go check on Callum,” I said. “Make sure dad didn’t forget him at the grocery store again, you know?”

Jordan shrugged and turned up his coat collar as he veered right, onto the dirt road. I kept on the main street, headed for home, trying not to let him see me look as our paths diverged. Before too long, he’d disappeared into the dark trees beyond the brown, sunlit fields.

At home, I found my dad in the backyard. He sat on a decaying Adirondack chair throwing an old tennis ball as hard as he could into the distance. After each throw, Callum would dutifully run off into the tall, dead grass to retrieve it. The brush was thick enough to make the ball hard to find, and Callum would disappear for minutes at a time while my dad sat in the chair, sipping on something out of a large plastic cup.

“Hey,” I said as Callum came running up, ball in hand.

“We’re playing hide and seek,” he said.

The stench from my dad’s cup was enough to knock you over. I had hoped it was beer, but I could tell now that it was his version of Jungle Juice, the last inch or two of every liquor bottle in the house, probably some fished in desperation out of the recycling bin.

“You give it a toss, Mikey,” said my dad.

“Nah.”

“What?” he asked. “You can’t throw now? You worried I’m better sitting down than you are standing?”

For a moment, I worried he’d stand. Back then, my father towered over me. He’d only hit me three or four times, but each time had been harder than the last, and his last punch had left me with a headache that lasted for almost a week.

“Here, Callum,” I said. “Give it to me.”

Callum dropped the ball into my outstretched hand, and I tossed it as hard as I could into the distance. It ended up halfway across the field in a spot where the grass grew especially tall. Callum was off in an instant, running fearlessly after it.

“Where’s Jordan?” asked dad, swirling his cup, sniffing at the stink coming off it.

“Went somewhere with friends,” I said. “Arcade, I think.”

My dad laughed.

“Probably just watching his buddies play. Hasn’t even got a quarter to his name.”

“Yeah,” I said.

We waited in silence for a few seconds after that. Callum still hadn’t reappeared, and it had gotten long enough that I was starting to worry. Black bears walked through that field from time to time, not to mention mountain lions. 

“Should I go check on him?” I asked, but my father shook me off.

“You’re going to make him weak,” he said. “The way you baby him.”

I didn’t say another word. My father’s drink was almost empty. When it was gone, he’d be angry in a way he wouldn’t understand, and he’d be looking for someone to blame. I was already planning  my next moves. I’d make some ramen for everyone and get the bath running for Callum. I’d make sure the TV was on. I was pretty sure the Blazers had a game starting at 5:30, hopefully against a team they’d spank. Close games were dangerous at our house, even if we were winning.

My father finished his last sip. 

Too much time had passed. I imagined a mountain lion pouncing, the sharp turn of Callum’s neck as the animal’s jaws bit through his pale skin. Blood everywhere, just like there’s been the other night when Mr. Bowler bled to death in front of me.

And then his little hand popped up, the green ball clutched triumphantly in his small fingers. 

Jordan got home a couple of hours later. By then, Callum was asleep and dad was sitting on the couch, ranting about bad refs and the Fucking Lakers. 

“Where you been?” my dad asked as Jordan took off his coat.

“Took a walk,” said Jordan.

“Mikey said you were at the arcade.”

“Yeah,” Jordan said, meeting my eyes. “For a little. And then I took a walk after.”

He looked back at my dad, his eyes curious, as if he were looking for something.

“Anything happen while I was away?” he asked me, and I shook my head.

Dad got up and started poking around the pantry. Soon, he was moving boxes and bottles around, looking for something to drink. Jordan looked at me and smiled. Then he mouthed some words I couldn’t quite understand.

“What?” I asked quietly, and he walked closer to me.

Under his breath, so that dad couldn’t hear, Jordan whispered, *“One for a trick.”*

My father leaned deeper into the cabinet, and as he did, a cold draft filled the room. Then, all of a sudden it was almost as if my father’s feet were lifted into the air by some unseen hand. He topped forward into the panty, bottles and bags clanging all around, jars shattering to pieces at his feet.

In his drunkenness, my father tried to get up to his feet, and as he did one of his bare feet landed directly in the thick, broken shards of a jar of olives, the glass burying itself an inch or more into the flesh. My father screamed and screamed, crawling toward us, trailing blood behind him as he came. 

For a moment, I just stood there paralyzed, not knowing quite what to do. And when I looked over at Jordan, I saw that he hadn’t quite succeeded in suppressing a smile.

Later, in the dark of our bedroom, I asked Jordan what he’d done.

“I made my wish,” he said. 

“You wished for dad to cut up his feet?”

“Not exactly,” he said.

I was still trying to have it all make sense in my mind. Had something really lifted dad’s feet off the ground, or had he just slipped? It had seemed physically impossible at the time, but now, as I tried to replay it in my memory, it seemed more and more like a simple accident.

“There’s no wishes. No such thing,” I said. “And if there were, you would have asked for something better than for dad to get hurt.”

“It’s not that kind of wish,” he said. “I think you’re probably right. No such thing as the good kind. That’s why they call it the Deathwish Well.”

“So you can only wish for bad stuff?”

He shrugged. 

“I don’t know. I just got there, to the well I mean. And I had this like… this urge to throw my coin in. So I did. Then I sat there like an idiot for a minute or two. I was about to turn around and head home but then I swear I heard something. Like breath. From way deep down in the well. And it said it needed a name.”

“Like it literally said, *I need a name.”*

“No… it was just like… a sound. I don’t think it was English. But I kind of thought it was asking for a name. And then I just said dad’s name.”

“And that’s it?”

“And then I ran all the way until I hit the main road.”

I reached into my pocket and felt the coin. Even for metal it was surprisingly cold. I laughed a little, and Jordan asked what was so funny.

“Just, you know, you get maybe one wish your whole life, and you spent it cutting up dad’s foot.”

Jordan smiled. “Worth it,” he said.

Late that night, the first big storm of winter hit. Rain pelted the house sideways, and the wind knocked the bare branches of the maples against our windows. At some point, half asleep, I looked out as lightning flashed across the sky and saw the head of a massive elk staring in at me, inches from the window glass. 

I knew what I’d seen couldn’t exist. After all, we were on the second story, and elk didn’t climb trees. Still, I took a step toward the window, waiting for another flash to illuminate the dark. Then, all at once, the wind gusted harder than ever and the windows blew open.

I took a step back now. Though everything was dark, I was keenly aware of something in the room with me. A rank, animal smell filled the room, and I heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps on the hardwood floor. I took another step back and fell into my bed. 

The footsteps continued across the room, over toward Jordan’s bed. Somehow, he was still dead asleep. It had grown deathly cold. I wanted to shout out to my sleeping brother, to wake him, but I feared any sound I made would startle whatever thing was in the room with us.

Instead, I only looked out into the dark and listened as it reached the side of Jordan’s bed. I still couldn’t quite see what it was, but I could tell that it was leaning over, reaching down where his head met the pillow.

And then, all at once, it was gone. The smell disappeared as if it had never been there. I ran to the windows and slammed them shut, then double and tripled checked the latches.

When I turned around, I saw Jordan sitting up in bed looking at something in the moonlight. It took me a few seconds to realize what it was: his coin.

“It was under my pillow,” he said, half asleep, perhaps wondering if he was dreaming. “It’s wet.”

We didn’t talk about what had happened until we left for school the next day. I could tell Jordan was thoughtful. He kept reaching into his pocket, touching his coin as if to reassure himself it was really still there.

“The coins get returned,” he said after a few seconds. “You can use them again and again.” And then he repeated the chant we’d heard a hundred times before in the schoolyard.

*“One for a trick*

*Two for a spill*

*Three for a scar*

*Four for a kill.”*

“That was just a trick,” he said. “But if we both use our coins together… or find a couple more of them…” 

“No,” I started. “What would we even do with two? I mean, dad already got really hurt.”

“Right,” Jordan said. “You’re right. Forget about it. We’ll both forget about it.”

[But of course, we both knew he was lying.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
