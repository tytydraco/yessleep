"What is going on?” he thinks to himself as he pushes himself up with both arms.

The place is dead quiet. The only sound Joshua hears is the frequent buzzing of broken electrical lines and flickering lamp posts in broad daylight. The streets are deserted and even the houses and establishments look bleak. He roams around until the air smells of rotten corpses and he almost throws up.

The sun burns his skin, so he takes shelter in the nearest grocery store. Its glass windows are broken, like most windows in the area. Shattered pieces of glass and a couple of big rocks are spread all over the floor. The store looks as if it was robbed.

“Uhm… Hello? Is anybody here? I, uh, I’d just like to take a few items. Sorry,” he says as he glances at the CCTV even though he isn’t sure if it’s still working.

He rummages through piles of food packs on disordered racks and shoves into his mouth whatever is still edible. He throws a few into his cart, but doesn’t collect much since most of the items were left open and rotting. He goes to the beverages next. He finds specks of blood sprinkled on the floor and the terrifying idea of a zombie apocalypse pops into his mind. He does his best to shrug it off. Nonetheless, he still grabs a few water bottles through a refrigerator’s shattered glass door. He turns to the men’s wear section to get a pair of decent clothes. As he is about to untie the ribbon of his hospital gown, he notices his reflection in the convex mirror attached to the ceiling. The guy in the reflection looks anxious with his face seemingly disoriented and sweat trickling down his brow. No, he isn’t terrified someone might catch him, but more frightened that he is alone—God knows what happened to all of the people who used to walk these empty spaces.

He tries comprehending his thoughts. No matter how much he manages to focus, he simply can’t remember what happened to him before he found himself in the alley.

He continues to put on his new shirt and pants. He then takes a backpack, stuffs inside all the food he can get, and ventures back to the desolate streets.

As he turns around the corner, he sees a white van. By the door is a person in a white hazmat suit complete with headgear and gloves—the one scientists and medical personnel wear when handling radioactive substances and biohazards. He approaches the van to take a closer look.

“Hey! Excuse me,” he says, but as he walks nearer, the person in the hazmat suit reveals a gun and aims it toward him.

“What the fuck?” he instinctively turns and runs, yet more people in hazmat suits come out of the van to chase after him. Joshua feels getting shot in the right leg, but it isn’t a bullet. It stings though, as if a giant ant bit him. He runs as fast as he can, taking turns he doesn’t even know where they will lead to. His gut clenches with unbearable pain with each step he takes.

When he is sure he’s lost them, he wanders back to the streets, cautiously leaning on every wall he walks past to check if anyone is still following.  And then, something kicks in his stomach. What follows is a familiar pain similar to being kicked in the nuts.

A gush of strong wind swirls and whips away all that scatters on the ground as a chopper hovers above him. He looks up and sees a man in military armor rappelling down the chopper. By the open door of the helicopter is another man, probably in his mid-40s, wearing a business suit and holding a megaphone.

“Patient 0307-D, come with us. We won’t hurt you. We are here to help,” the man speaks over the megaphone.
“Who are you? What do you want from me?” Joshua raises his voice, trying to beat the loud noise of the chopper.
“We just need you to go back to the lab. We’ll tell you everything when we get there,” the man answers.
“No! I don’t even know you. Some people just tried to shoot me!” He runs away, his palms gripping his belly like it’s about to explode.

He catches his breath as he hides in an abandoned building.  He sits and crawls across the hallway to an empty room. Blood gushes out between his legs. He flinches from the excruciating pain radiating in his stomach and places a gag in his mouth to prevent screaming. He clenches his fists and swears he can feel something moving in his belly. Something is alive right now in his stomach, and it is turning his insides upside down.

He takes his pants off and lays down with his back on the cold floor. He takes a series of deep breaths and though he doesn’t understand why, for some reason his brain tells him he can push the thing out of his stomach. He begins pushing, letting out breathless screams while he bites the ball of cloth in his mouth, his chin almost touching his chest. He keeps pushing harder until he can feel something coming out between his legs. He manages to sit up just to find a real baby’s head. He holds its head carefully, and with a one last forceful push, he is able to bring the baby completely out of him. Once the baby gives out a loud cry, he passes out and everything goes blank.
