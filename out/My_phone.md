I’ve never really believed in anything paranormal. I’m not superstitious, and I’ve always chalked up “creepy” stories to stress, fatigue, or just a hyperactive imagination. But tonight, I don’t have any of those excuses. I’m well-rested. I haven’t been drinking. I didn’t watch a scary movie or read a ghost story. I just went to get a glass of water.

And now, I don’t know if I’ll ever sleep again.

It was around 2:30 AM when I woke up. Nothing strange—just that classic middle-of-the-night dry mouth. My phone was still in my hand, screen dimly lit with the Reddit app open. Typical insomnia browsing. I slid off the covers, stood up, and went to the kitchen, phone still in hand. I didn’t bother turning on the lights—I’ve lived here for years and could navigate the apartment with my eyes closed.

I filled a glass from the fridge’s water dispenser, took a few sips, and leaned against the counter for a second, scrolling Reddit absentmindedly. I think I even replied to a thread. Then, after a few minutes, I padded back to the bedroom.

But when I opened the door, my heart nearly stopped.

Lying on my bed, tucked neatly under the blanket where I had been just minutes ago, was my phone.

Not a similar phone. Not my old phone.

My phone.

Same wallpaper. Same crack on the top right corner. Same neon green case I bought on impulse last month.

I froze in the doorway, my breath caught in my throat. I looked down at my hand—at the phone I was holding—and then back at the one on the bed.

Two. Identical. Phones.

And then it got worse.

The phone in my hand buzzed.

A notification. A text message.

From… Me.

“Don’t touch it.”

The air around me turned electric. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but my legs were locked in place. I glanced at the screen again, thinking maybe this was some kind of prank or glitch.

Another message.

“It’s not yours anymore.”

I looked up. The phone on the bed lit up at the same time—like it had received the same message.

And then… it moved.

Just a little. A subtle shift under the blanket. But enough to prove it wasn’t just lying there.

I stepped back. My pulse was pounding in my ears. I didn’t dare look away. Slowly, I reached toward the light switch, never taking my eyes off the thing on the bed. I flipped it on.

The bed was empty.

But the phone was gone.

I don’t know where it went. I searched the entire apartment with every light on. Checked the doors, the windows, every closet. Nothing. Just me and the phone in my hand.

I’m typing this now, sitting in my living room, all the lights still on. I haven’t gone back to the bedroom.

The last notification I got was about ten minutes ago.

“You left the door open.”

But I didn’t.

I swear to God, I didn’t.
