At first, everything seems the same. The story is just as good as I remember. The music is still haunting, still atmospheric. The art is minimalist and moody, exactly how it’s supposed to be. But something feels off

At first, I don’t even notice it. It’s subtle, like a vague itch in the back of your head. The dialogue is where it starts. Little things. Lines don’t sound quite right. A word here, a phrase there 

just different enough to make me pause and wonder if I’m remembering wrong. It’s been years since I last played, so I convince myself it’s just nostalgia warping my memory.

But then, I see it.

In Shiki’s room, on his desk, there’s a framed picture. A photo of a horse.

It’s not subtle or creepy—it’s just *there.* Bright, colorful, completely out of place. It looks like a stock photo. A horse running through a vibrant green field, blue sky overhead. It clashes so hard with Tsukihime’s muted, subdued tone that I laugh a little. “Weird Easter egg,” I think. Maybe it’s a joke or something added in a fan patch. I brush it off and keep playing.

But the horse doesn’t go away.

In Akiha’s route, I notice it again. The paintings in the Tohno mansion, which should be eerie, abstract works that fit the mansion’s oppressive vibe? They’re gone. Replaced with that same stupid horse. Same green field, same bright colors.

By the time I get to Arcueid’s route, it’s worse. I’m in the middle of the fight with Nrvnqsr Chaos—this tense, iconic moment—and the horse is there. It’s galloping in the background of the CG. Not like it belongs there. Not subtle. Just... *there.*

Nobody reacts to it. Not Shiki, not Chaos. It’s like it doesn’t exist to anyone but me.

The music starts getting weird, too. It’s slower than I remember, like someone dragged the tempo down a notch. There’s this one piano track, supposed to be melancholic, but now it has this faint rhythmic sound underneath. Like hoofbeats.

At first, I think it’s ambient noise or maybe something in my house. I pause the game. Dead silence. Start it again. The hoofbeats are there, faint but constant, buried in the music.

At this point, I’m spiraling a little. I start checking forums, Reddit, anything I can think of. Nobody’s talking about a horse. No mentions of weird patches or updates. No mod that explains it. It’s like I’m the only one seeing this.

I push on, because I have to know if it ends. I get to the finale of Arcueid’s route, the emotional payoff. You know the scene. The screen should fade into the bittersweet night sky, that iconic closing image. Instead, it’s the horse. It’s not running anymore. It’s standing still now, in this endless black void. No field, no colors—just darkness behind it. It’s staring straight at the camera. The eyes aren’t right. They’re too detailed, too real. It doesn’t look like a photo anymore. It feels like it’s watching me. I closed the game right there. alt f4d so fast I didn’t even see the credits.

I haven’t reopened it since. It’s been sitting on my hard drive, and I can’t bring myself to delete it. I’ve genuinely lost sleep over this. The hoofbeats, the way that horse kept showing up

it’s burned into my head.
