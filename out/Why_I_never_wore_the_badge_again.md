This is an incident I remember from the days when I was a cop in the local district. I've told and recalled this many times to my friends and family, and they find it amusing that something like this even happened. They were disappointed that I left my cause behind for this fable of a story. My own family refused to believe me, but it has become the occasional spooky story at family reunions or camping trips.

But that's what they say because they don't really know the shock of what happened to me that night. They don't know the reason why that incident will remain engraved in my brain for the rest of my life. There's one detail I never told them, and I shouldn't. If I wanted to remain sane and lead a decent life, I needed to forget about that detail. So, I started recalling the story to my family while leaving that detail out, hoping that by doing so, my brain would overwrite the memories. But it didn't.

This happened in the summer of 2009. I had been an officer for two years, and things were going great in my life. My girlfriend had proposed to me on the same day that I was planning to propose to her—it was phenomenal, to say the least. But what happened that night would haunt me forever.

It was May 2009 when my new partner, whom I'll refer to as Bob, and I were patrolling RedWood Street when we got a dispatch call about a domestic violence incident in the area. It seemed like a good opportunity to show the rookie how the pros did it, so I decided we should check it out.

As we drove to the house, I noticed that the street was...quiet, almost abandoned. It looked like nobody lived in this area, but I didn't pay much attention to it. I parked the car in front of the house where the call had come from. The house was simple, with two floors. I opened the door and stepped out of the car, Bob following behind me. We walked up the steps to the porch and immediately noticed that the door was slightly open. I took out my gun and signaled to Bob to arm himself.

I decided it would be a bad idea to enter through the front, so I moved to the back. The back door was open, too. Bob and I entered quietly. Suddenly, Bob yelled to check if anyone was inside. Rookie mistake, I know. I smacked him in the head for that, but it seemed we were alone in the house.

The hall was simple—just a carpet in the center and a few sofas around it. There wasn't much detail to the place, other than it was completely generic. I decided to head upstairs, and Bob followed, armed. At the top of the stairs, I saw three rooms down a small hallway. One was open. We went inside. The room was fairly well-lit, and there were notes scribbled all over the walls, ideas for stories, and a manuscript on the table. I assumed the house, or at least the room, belonged to a budding writer.

While I was reading the manuscript, Bob wandered off to the second room, the one adjacent to mine. He opened the door and called me over. I put the manuscript down and walked to him. When I saw the room, I was...weirded out. It looked like it belonged in the Victorian era. Maybe the writer was creating a roleplay for his story? I didn't know, but I went inside anyway. The furniture, if it was indeed furniture, looked well-preserved, almost like it was real from that time.

I went back out to check the last room, which was closed. I opened it up, and Bob drew his gun, preparing for the worst. We couldn't take any risks, after all. The door opened, and we were met with...darkness. The room was broken, engulfed in shadows. There were no lights in the sockets, and the room seemed to have no power. It looked like it was being renovated. We checked the room and found nothing odd—just a couple of paint buckets and brushes. Nothing out of the ordinary.

We closed the door and went back out into the hallway. As I returned to the first room, I noticed something had changed. There was a...Polaroid camera on the bed.

"Was this camera here before, Bob?" I asked, looking back at him. I might have missed something earlier, but he shook his head as if he didn't know either. I picked up the camera, and as I did, it started printing a picture. The sound of the picture developing filled the air, and the photo soon dropped onto the bed. I didn't grab it in time, but Bob picked it up. His face was full of terror. I asked him why he seemed so scared, and he handed me the photo. As I looked at it, I froze in fear.

It was a picture of us, getting out of the cruiser, taken from the window of the room. How was this possible? There was no one in the house to have taken the picture of us arriving. Before I could think, the camera printed another picture. This one was of Bob and me in the Victorian-styled room. The picture was taken from an angle, showing the spiral staircase and the hallway. But that wasn't what made me freeze. In the corner of the picture, I saw a shadow crouched in the corner of the small hallway behind the door, peeking at us.

It was getting harder to breathe as I showed Bob the picture. His expression was beyond terrified. The camera printed another photo. This one showed us in the dark room, and in the corner of the image stood a woman dressed in Victorian-era clothes. Her grin was...inhuman. It was animalistic, almost grotesque. How didn't we notice it? The camera printed another photo. This time it was of the third room's door opening, and the woman, the "hag," was walking out of it. Just as the camera finished printing this one, we heard the door creak open. That was when we ran. We didn’t look back; we just ran as fast as we could. I opened the car door, slammed it shut, and started the engine. Bob closed his door, and we sped away from the block.

We reached the station around 11:00 PM. Bob was still shaken, and I was too. What we had seen in that house... it wasn't of this world. The woman and her inhumane grin gave me chills just thinking about it. But we had left the pictures behind. The only evidence we had was the camera, which I kept on my desk.

Bob left the station, heading back to his place, still terrified. I, too, was afraid, but as I got ready to leave, the camera made a strange noise. It printed one last picture, and this is the detail I’ve never told anyone. The last picture showed me and Bob in the car, speeding away from the house. But in the backseat, staring ahead, was the same woman, grinning inhumanely.
