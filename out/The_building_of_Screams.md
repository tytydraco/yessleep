The building at 44th and Wallace was a limestone lung, breathing in the soot of the city and exhaling the rot of the forgotten. It was a twenty-four-unit U-shaped beast, divided down the middle with a surgical precision that mirrored a human brain. Twelve units on the West, twelve on the East. To a seventeen-year-old like me—Brandon—the geography wasn’t just architecture; it was a moral divide. The hallway was a dead-zone where secrets went to stagnate, a physical barrier designed to keep the miseries of one side from infecting the other.

Gabriel was fourteen then, a collection of sharp elbows and wide, flickering eyes. He trailed me like a shadow as we hauled the remains of our lives—collapsed cardboard boxes and taped-up memories—up to the third floor of the West side. Our mother moved with the jerky, exhausted grace of a clock winding down. Her face was a map of "new beginnings," but the topography was scarred by every "fresh start" that had ended in a midnight move.

"This is it, boys," she’d whispered, her voice like dry parchment. "Keep your heads down. Keep the door locked. We’ll be fine."
But the building had no intention of letting us be fine. It spoke in the language of infrastructure. It breathed through the rusted vents with a wet, rattling sigh. It groaned in the lead pipes like a captive beast. And on our third night, the building found its voice. 

It began at 2:14 AM. A jagged, high-pitched wail that tore through the floorboards like a rusted saw blade. I sat up in the bunk, my pulse hammering against my ribs. Below me, I heard the rhythmic creak of Gabriel’s mattress.
"Brandon?" he breathed into the dark. "Is that a cat?"
I held my breath, listening to the marrow of the house. The sound came again, but it wasn't an animal. 

It was a human instrument played past its breaking point. It was the old woman in 1-West, directly beneath our stack of units. It wasn't a scream of pain, though; it was a roll call.
"Rebecca!" the voice shrieked, the name ending in a wet choke. "Rebecca, get away from the window! Cynthia! Don’t open it, Cynthia!"

I slid from the bed and pressed my forehead against the glass of the window, looking down into the courtyard. It was an empty well of shadows and discarded wrappers. There was no Rebecca. There was no Cynthia. Only the names, summoned from the throat of a woman who sounded like she was being dragged, inch by inch, into a sub-basement of hell.

Chapter 2: The Man Behind the Wall
If the woman downstairs was the building’s manic pulse, the man in Unit 3-East was its necrotic silence. He was less a person and more a glitch in the peripheral vision. In our first six months, I only saw him four times. He was built like a block of granite, topped with a faded trucker cap that cast a permanent eclipse over his eyes. He never carried groceries. 
He only carried the bags.

They were heavy-duty, industrial-grade contractor bags—the kind meant for jagged glass and construction debris. He would haul them out at 3:00 AM, his muscles straining against the plastic till it looked like skin stretched over bone. Gabriel and I would watch from the sliver of space between our curtains.
"What's in them, Brandon?" Gabriel’s voice was small, tucked away in his throat.
"Tools," I’d lie, trying to project a strength I didn't feel. "He’s a contractor. Just tools."
But the building knew the truth. 

Every Monday, his alarm clock would trigger at 6:00 AM. A sharp, electronic chirp-chirp-chirp that pierced the plaster wall like a needle through an eye. Because he wasn't there to shut it off, it became the heartbeat of our apartment. We ate to the beep. We studied to the beep.

By the second month, the old woman’s litany had shifted. The names were gone, replaced by the terrifyingly specific. "The one with the red scarf!" she’d howl at the ceiling. "She’s crying! Why is she crying? Tell her to stop crying, the plastic is too tight!"
That was the night I saw him again. He was double-parked, heaving a bag into his trunk. It wasn't lumpy like scrap metal. It was long. It was yielding. And as he shoved it into the dark maw of the car, the streetlamp caught a flash of snagged fabric. It was red. The color of a scream.

Chapter 3: The Crossing
The alarm had been screaming for forty-eight hours—a mechanical cicada burrowing into the soft tissue of my brain. I stood up, my bare feet hitting the linoleum. The floor was unnaturally cold, as if the apartment were leeching heat from my soles.

I slipped out into the hallway. The West side corridor was bathed in the jaundiced light of flickering fluorescent tubes. I reached the stairwell—the spine of the beast—and began the descent. At the first-floor landing, the door to Unit 1-West leaked a frantic, rhythmic whimpering.
"He’s bringing another one home, girls," she hissed. "He’s got her in the plastic. Why is she so heavy?"

I pushed through to the basement. The air was thick with gray water and damp concrete. I walked the full length of the laundry room, where washers stood like a row of drowned men. I reached the East side stairs and climbed. Floor one. Floor two. Floor three.

The alarm was a physical assault now. I stood in front of Unit 3-East. The wood was a map of violence, covered in deep, jagged gouges. I reached out and gripped the brass handle. As I twisted, the mechanism gave way with a smooth, oiled click. The door swung inward, pulling me into the dark.

Chapter 4: The Archives of the Lost
The smell hit me like a physical blow—ammonia, rotting paper, and the sweet, cloying scent of organic decay. The kitchen was a graveyard of yellowed newspapers. A cloud of gnats swirled in the stagnant air. I pushed into the bedroom. The alarm clock sat on a milk crate next to a stained, yellowed mattress. I yanked the cord from the wall.
Silence. 

It wasn't the absence of noise; it was a presence.
In that silence, I saw the pile. Next to the pillow was a stack of plastic IDs. I knelt and reached for the first one. Sarah Marie Jenkins. The name the old woman had been screaming. Cynthia Ann Miller. Linda Sue Higgins. Twenty faces. All young. All "gone."

Then, a sound from the street. Vrrr-clunk.
The man’s rusted sedan was double-parked. He got out and pulled a woman from the passenger side. She didn't struggle. Her head lolled back. He was heading for the East side entrance. I couldn't go back through the hall. I lunged for the mattress and shoved it through the window frame. It hit the ground with a muffled whump.

I swung my legs over the ledge and let go. The fall felt like an eternity suspended in oil. I hit the mattress, but my right foot missed the padding and slammed into the concrete. CRACK. White-hot pain exploded up my leg. I had to move. I rolled off and began to crawl, dragging my shattered ankle toward the West side door.

I reached the corner and looked back. High above, the man’s silhouette blocked the light of the open window. He saw the mattress. He growled into the night, "Who’s out there?"

Chapter 5: The Oracle in the Dark
The storm broke an hour later, and the power went dead. I lay on our living room floor, my ankle swollen to the size of a grapefruit. Gabriel was trying to wrap my leg in a damp towel when the door—which I had forgotten to lock—swung open.
The woman from 1-West stood there in a tattered nightgown. 

Her eyes were fixed on the dark. "They’re coming up the stairs," she whispered. "A long line of girls with plastic skin."
She stopped in front of me. "The one in the red sweater," she said. "Sarah. She says thank you for stopping the noise, Brandon. But he’s listening through the wall."

A heavy thud came from the shared bedroom wall. Boom. The woman started to chant the names. "Sarah. Cynthia. Linda. Michelle." And then, a new name. "Elena. He hasn't put Elena in the bag yet. She’s still breathing. For now."
"Gabriel," I whispered. "Call the police. Tell them to look for the bags."

Chapter 6: The Visitor from the Labyrinth
Later that night, the sleep paralysis took me. I was pinned to my bed. A shadow bled out of the corner of the room. He was massive, his head brushing the ceiling, and atop that mass sat the obsidian horns of a Minotaur.

The beast leaned over me, his breath smelling of sulfur and ancient dust. His clawed hand hovered at my throat, and his human, furnace-red eyes searched mine. Then, the beast shook his head. No. Not this one.
He turned toward the East wall and walked right through the plaster, moving into the silence of the next apartment. A moment later, I heard a sharp, final gasp from the other side. Not a scream. Just the sound of a heart being switched off like a lamp.

Chapter 7: The Body Bag
Three days later, the sirens arrived. Gabriel and I watched from the porch as they wheeled out a gurney carrying a single, heavy black body bag. I hobbled toward a police officer on my crutches. "What happened?"
"Natural causes, kid. Heart attack. Guy in 3-East. Looks like his heart just... stopped."

I looked at Gabriel, then up at the dark window of the East side. I knew better. The man hadn't died of a heart attack. He had died because the door to his basement finally opened, and something came out that didn't need a key.
My name is Brandon. And I'm just glad the heart still beating in this building is mine.
