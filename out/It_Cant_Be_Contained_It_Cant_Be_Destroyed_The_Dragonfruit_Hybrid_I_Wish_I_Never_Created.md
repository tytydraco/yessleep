Dragonfruit. A fruit that people either love or are indifferent towards. For most, their experience of this tropical fruit comes from those purchased in stores. They would walk past, see a crate of this unusual looking fruit and decide “Stuff it, ill give this a try”. They’d brave the hefty price tag, and take it home to be eaten as a cool refreshing desert after dinner.

 “It’s not cheap, so it must be good,” they’d think as they move aside the familiar bar of chocolate and grab the chilled dragonfruit.

Anticipation drips from their tongue as they slice it up. Wonder fills their eyes as they gaze at the alien looking flesh, either red or white with freckles of tiny black seeds. They’d take a bite, expecting an explosion of flavor to fill their mouth.

Instead, disappointment. While not exactly having an unpleasant taste, the little flavor that their taste buds can grapple is swiftly drowned out by the flavorless juice that is abundant. Regret takes hold. Never again would they blow their money on such an expensive, bland and unsatisfying fruit.

That is the experience of the unfortunate majority who are oblivious to the extensive catalogue of delicious tasting dragonfruit that exist outside of the supermarkets. Supermarket bought fruits are picked weeks before they could reach their full flavor potential. But when you grow your own, like myself, they can be harvested at the optimal ripeness, chilled and eaten in the same day.

After trying one of my close friends home grown fruit, I was blown away with the rich flavor and thus entered the delicious world of dragonfruit. In hindsight I wish I had spat it out and vowed never to eat another dragonfruit again; the world would have been thankful if I had.

At first I grew out my own white flesh plant, this being the most common variety available. I was swiftly hooked after trying my first fruit and in the matter of two seasons, I went from obsessed to addicted. My collection grew from that first white fleshed to over eighty different varieties, each with their own unique exquisite flavor.

 Most of my plants were grown from cuttings purchased from other enthusiastic growers, but some were hybrids of my own.

You see, the deeper I delved into the world of dragonfruit, I learned just how easy it was to create your own variety. All you had to do was cross pollinate two different varieties, let the resulting fruit ripen, harvest and set aside some of the seeds, plant them and watch them grow. It fascinated me how each individual seedling took on different traits of their parent plants. Sometimes it was almost impossible to believe that two mature plants that had been grown from this method were even siblings.

My addiction to hybridization saw new gene pools develop and after the fifth generation of some of these initial pairings, I had plants and fruit that had never before been seen in the dragonfruit community.

It was the closest I could possibly have felt to being like God, creating whole new strains that otherwise would never have existed if I had not forced natures hand. It had been a euphoric experience.

That was, until I bred BD-6-1.

It was the first plant that had grown out of a batch of sixth generation seedlings that originated from the infamous “Black Dragon” variety. The goal of this line of hybrids was not to make a new exotic tasting fruit, but rather to create the first “purely red branched” dragonfruit plant, and possibly one of the first predominately red cacti. The idea had fascinated me ever since I began my hybridizing obsession. I chose to use the “black dragon” variety due to it already containing a faint red hue in what should otherwise have been glossy green branches.

“Black dragon” is naturally quite a spiky plant, far more than other dragonfruit varieties. But with each subsequent generation of my hybridization, the spikes only grew longer and fiercer. The first sign that told me BD-6-1 was going to be quite a difficult plant was when the first syringe-like spikes began to form when it was little more than a seedling. In place of what should have been fine white hairs that was the norm of dragonfruit seedlings, these syringes jutted out at almost three times the length of the tiny red seedling itself! If I had not been observing its growth every day and had walked in at this present stage of growth, I would have thought someone stuck these spikes in as a mock pin cushion.

It was unlike anything I could have possibly imagined. The larger this seedling got, the more I could imagine such a plant appearing in the Garden of Satan itself. It was a devilish looking thing. Within a week of its emergence, I could already tell that this hybrid was to be a rapid grower, for it was three times larger than its sibling counterparts which were only barely protruding from the soil.

Despite the dangerously sharp spikes in which I handled with the upmost delicacy not only for the plant’s wellbeing but my own, you could imagine just how much it stole my attention. Its sibling seedlings showed nothing unusual, so I swiftly discarded them in favor of this one. As it grew taller and drew closer to the stage where it could be planted outside, looking more like its final form, the red colour of its branches was the most predominant I had ever seen, adding much more giddiness to my excitement that I was one step closer to finally breeding the first fully red branched dragonfruit plant. Only the faintest hue of green was evident.

Two weeks after the seedling emerged, its roots were completely pot bound and already starting to worm their way out of the small drainage holes. At this point, the plant had fattened out considerably and was about 30cm tall. Its appearance replicated that of a 6-month-old plant. The speed in which this thing was growing was out of this world!

Excited that I might actually get a taste of its fruit within the current season, I built a 6 foot trellis just outside of my existing dragonfruit orchard and prepared the ground with a well-draining soil. For those who are unaware, dragonfruit plants are actually a vine like plant, naturally growing up established trees in the south American rainforests. The point of a trellis is to replicate this natural habitat as much as possible.

I was very aware of the syringes and what damage they might be able to cause, so I made sure I wore thick gardening gloves. In hindsight, I should have just snipped a section of those spikes off, just enough so that I could wrap a gloved hand around the trunk unhindered. But I was too keen a hybridizer, and refused to compromise the full potential of the plant for any means.

And so it was, how I managed to prick my finger with one of those spikes. It happened just as I placed it in its final position. At the time I thought nothing of it - getting pricked by less pointy dragonfruit spikes was nothing new to me- so I finished the job with half a mind to the throbbing in my right index finger.

I treated the tiny pinhole wound as I did with any other splinter: a wash with disinfectant liquid, a dab of antiseptic cream, and a band aid wrapped around for good measure. By the second day the pain was gone and by the fourth I had seized dressing it.

For the next three days, I monitored in awe as the devilish looking BD-6-1 continued its unnaturally rapid growth towards the top of the trellis. Obviously, I had other duties which called for my attention, so I was not constantly sitting there watching it. But every time I came back to it, I could tell that the plant had grown some more.

 On a few occasions I had even gone so far as to placing a small mark a few centimeters above the tip of the plant, and sat for an extended period of time as I watched the tip slowly reach the mark. It moved almost at the same pace as the hour hand on an analog clock. My confidence in tasting its first fruits only intensified.

By the seventh day after planting outside, it had reached the top of the 6 foot trellis. At this point, as is common practice in dragon fruit growing, the tip would be trained to grow over the trellis where it would begin to hang over and continue growing back towards the earth. Branches would subsequently be produced at the bend in the vine and thus the scaffolds of the final form of the plant would begin to establish themselves. 

The eighth day was when things started to go south.

It began when I awoke in the morning and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. Being a habit built in since childhood, I performed it with robotic precision as most of us do. But as I began to brush from side to side, something seemed off. I continued the motion, trying to get my head around what was so different. It was at the edge of my peripheral vision. I looked into the mirror and nearly spat all my toothpaste out.

Wrapped around my blue toothbrush, was a faintly green index finger.

I immediately cleared my mouth and turned on the bright overhead heat lights in order to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me. Sure enough, my right index finger had a green hue to it. It stood out like a pink panther next to the rest of the sun-tanned fingers on the same hand. I spun it around, my jaw slack. It was the same finger that I had pricked when I planted BD-6-1 outside a week ago.

Being a greenish colour was one thing, the other being the distinct line where the green skin merged with the natural colored skin just above the main joint of the finger. It looked as though I had just dipped the finger up to that point in a light green highlighter liquid. I knew I had to go to the doctor and called them as soon as they opened. But being a rather busy surgery and the nature of the affiliation not seeming to be life threatening at this point, the next available appointment wouldn’t be till two days hence. I supposed I could wait, there was no pain, and I knew there’d be people needing to see the doctor more urgently than me.

So I went to work with the green finger, and to be honest I forgot all about it until I was back home that evening and washing the dishes. The tip of my green index finger glistened in the soapy water, and I could have sworn that it was more prominent than it had been that morning.

My wife told me that if I awoke in the morning and it was even more prominent, she would drag me by the ear to the surgery and kick the doctor’s door down for him to see me. She was ropable that they had not taken me in that day, and incredulous at me for not arguing my case.

My wife was still sleeping when I awoke the following morning, which was probably for the best. She would have freaked out if she saw what I did. The green hue of the upper portion of my index finger had significantly intensified. But that was nothing. Nausea threatened to take a hold of me when I saw the 5cm syringe-like-spike jutting out from my skin, just below the fingernail. Several smaller spikes were also scattered about what I was swiftly concluding to be an “infected” green fingertip. Studying the largest one with sweat trickling down my brow, I knew I had seen similar spikes before: On BD-6-1.

Without telling my wife – later she would abuse me for not alerting her (abuse well deserved) – I bypassed the local doctor, and drove myself straight to the emergency ward of our city’s largest hospital.

The nurse who took me in for an initial examination immediately came to the conclusion that they were just large splinters. I insisted that such was not the case, even as she reached into her drawer of medical instruments and pulled out a fierce looking pair of forceps. She refused to believe me and I was forced to endure her rough fruitless pulling and tugging on the spikes until she gave up. I was quite angry at this point and waved my green finger aggressively in her face demanding to know if such a thing was considered normal! The damned spikes were literally growing out of the infected tissue.

One thing led to another, and by the end of the day my finger was operated on whilst I went under anesthesia.

The nurses must have already notified the surgeon who performed the job when I began to wake up, for as my eyes began to take in my surroundings, a handsome man was sitting beside me, watching me with a vacant expression. His name was Dr Dale and he just so happened to be a hand doctor. Fortunately for me, he had been booked in that day for multiple hand operations and decided to do mine, thinking it would be a “quickie”. How wrong he was.

In a calm tone, he explained that initially he had begun the operation with the intention to remove the spikes and to clear the tissue of what he was certain had been debris left from the spike that jabbed me a week ago, which was the likely culprit. He found the broken shards of the spike. But the extent of the infection caused by them was unlike anything Dr Dale had seen in his fifteen years of practice.

This is pretty much a summary of both his brief findings and my conclusions.

To describe the green hue of my finger. At the place where the spike entered my finger, and the shard separated inside, a very tiny “root-like” substance seemed to grow out from the broken plant matter. These “roots” seemingly spread out to the closest blood flowing veins and supposedly form what the doc could only describe as a “callus-like” substance within the vein, blocking the flow of blood to the further extremities that the vein reached out to. But strangely enough, blood, or shall I say “blood with an additive” continued to flow beyond the blockage. Doc said that when he sliced into me, it bled a dark green and he was certain that this was the cause of the green pigmentation of the fingertip. Yet remarkably, below the callus, the blood flowed crimson as normal.

The doctor came to the conclusion that the callus within the vein, acted as some sort of “filter”, where it somehow used the basic substance of the blood pumping from my heart, and added something into it which caused the green color. What it was, he was unsure, but took a sample anyway during the surgery to be sent off for further analysis.

As for the protruding spikes that seemingly “grew” out of my finger, this was where his expertise reached its limit and he had jokingly said that perhaps this is where his explanations enter the realm of fantasy, until the spike samples he had sent off can be properly analyzed.  His brief theory was this. Perhaps, the filtered green blood served as something akin to “fertilizer”, where it slowly filled and spread to the flesh that surrounded the extremities of these veins, creating a fertile ground for these spikes to grow out from in search of sunlight. If left untreated, perhaps it would continue growing into a plant.

I scoffed at this notion. Dragonfruit spikes - 15cm anomalies or not – could not take root and develop into a plant. That was common knowledge. The only way a dragonfruit could reproduce was via seeds from a fruit or cloning via branch cuttings. There was simply not enough genetic material, not the correct physiology within the spike for them to be eligible too. 

But had BD-6-1 proved itself to be a great big anomaly in general? What if there was some truth to the doctor’s claim? I decided I’d test this out when I eventually returned home.

And then came the crux of Dr Dales report. The only way the finger could be treated, was via amputation.

As that final word echoed in my head, only then did my eyes fall to my heavily bandaged index finger. Sure enough, three quarters of it had been removed leaving me with little more than a petty stump. You can imagine the horror I felt. I would be seeing Dr Dale the Hand specialist a lot more frequently over the coming months of recovery.

I stayed in hospital for two days.

When my wife arrived to pick me up, she vowed that if I didn’t remove that horrid looking dragonfruit when I was recovered, she would rip it out with the skid steer herself. With all that it had done to me, she developed a fierce hatred for it and I knew there would come a point where I’d have to oblige to her demand.

 Despite losing the tip of my finger to it, and learning of the bizarre nature in which it had infected me, I felt an empty pit form in my stomach. As nasty as BD-6-1 was, she was a rarity. Something that would likely never be seen again. I could not bear to destroy it. Considering its rapid growth, I was so close to potentially getting at least one taste of its fruit. It would surely begin popping them very soon. And then there was the nagging theory of the doctor.

When I got home, and I was able to slip away from my Wife’s ever watchful eye, I made my way to where I planted out BD-6-1. I turned a corner in the garden and jumped when I thought I saw a snake on the ground. But as I rounded the corner, it turned out to be a branch of BD-6-1. I couldn’t believe it. When I had gone into hospital, the plant was just topping the 6-foot trellis. Now, three days later, the vine and five other branches hung over the trellis and trailed all the way back to the ground where they began to disperse like writhing snakes along the dirt, taking root as they went. Surely it wasn’t growing “faster” the bigger it got? I wanted to draw another mark and watch the branch slowly grow to it, but I didn’t have to. The tip of the branch that I was now standing over moved at the pace of a sick snail.

My amazement was about as equal to my revulsion.

Watching that writhing branch slowly make its way through my garden, I knew I was going to have to remove it. And soon. I’d try my best to hold off for at least one more month, just to chance a fruit, but that would be the cut off. Also, there was the doctor’s theory that I wanted to test out.

A few days later I deemed a perfect opportunity to take a few spike samples from BD-6-1 without being told off by the wife who had gone out for a few hours. Wearing thick welding gloves this time, and wrapping my arms in a thick shield of old magazines, I carefully snipped off ten of the most prominent and oldest looking of the spikes, followed by ten average looking ones and finally ten smaller juvenile spikes. Daring not to trust the thickness of my gloves, I carefully used a pair of long nosed pliers as I handled them. Then, I gently stuck them into a tiny pot that was prefilled with soil and watered them in well. The care and caution made this a tedious job that took several hours until all spikes had been planted out. I finished just before the wife returned home, certain that it was all going to be a waste of time.

How wrong I was.

The next morning, I went into my plant nursery and sure enough, those damned spikes had taken root. All of them!

So, I decided to take the experiment a step further. Using a pair of snips, I cut the rooted spikes into tiny fragments. Collecting them carefully with a dust pan and brush, I scattered them in a foam box filled with soil and sprinkled a light layer of soil on top.

Sure enough, the following day there were roots in that foam box. A day later, shoots began popping from the dirt.

A dawning horror gripped me then. If this “rapid” growing plant could reproduce from mere fragments of its numerous spikes, who knew what monstrosity of a weed it could become if left unchecked! And then there was the way it had infected my finger and attempted to turn it into a growing medium. Luckily for me, I had only been jabbed in my finger tip. But what if someone was to get one of these spikes in their arm? Their leg? Hell, their torso? An image of my 6-year-old son reaching for a ball that had strayed into the spiky branches of this plant filled my mind. Such was a common occurrence around the garden. 

That was the final straw.

Fruit or no fruit, I knew then, it was time to part with BD-6-1.

Not wanting to cut down live plant tissue, I decided it was best to poison it first. At first, I sprayed it with a strong mixture of a general glyphosate herbicide that was available at most hardware stores. But after three days, the plant showed no sign of setback. So I moved up to a commercial grade herbicide and even that bore no results. Finally, I purchased the most expensive and intense herbicide available on the market, usually used by large production farms. Instead of killing BD-6-1, all the plants in the garden that surrounded it died instead.

I knew cacti were naturally tougher than most plants to kill via herbicide but I wasn’t expecting this! The only other thing I could think of which was usually the final destructor of everything, was fire. A nice hot fire would see not a trace of the damned thing left. I had a large diesel-powered incinerator on my property which I knew would turn BD-6-1 into dust.

Only problem with this method was that I had to cut it down first.

I trudged past the kitchen window, my torso adorned in a heavily padded motorcycle jacket, magazines taped to all my limbs and a motorcycle helmet over my head- goggles included for good measure. In my four digited hand, I held a chainsaw. My wife’s eyes nearly popped out of the sockets as she watched me pass. She nagged me to put the damned thing down before I further harm my wound; I should be resting she cried out. She was about to rip the saw out of my hand when she saw the direction I was heading in. Her nagging swiftly ended.

With even more care than when I had taken the “spike cuttings”, I chopped BD-6-1 up. Let’s just say it was well that I wore the armor. I lost count of the amount of spike shards that flew out from the chainsaw and ricocheted off me. Using my skid steer loader, I used the blade of the bucket to rip out the few branches that had managed to take root and gathered all the spiky red plant material into a large pile. Using the 4 in 1 function of the bucket, I picked the pile up and dumped it in the large incinerator barrel.

When I was finished, there was not a single trace of BD-6-1 left where it had been growing.

I added a generous douse of petrol over the plant’s remains for good measure, then fired up the incinerator. I allowed it to burn longer than I usually would. Upon completion, all that remained of BD-6-1 was a fine ash.

As I stared at the powdery remains, melancholy and regret took a hold of me. Perhaps there was a possibility that upon further hybridization I could create a replica. But why would I want that? Was not the image of my son getting pricked in his side as he grabbed his ball enough motivation to forget about BD-6-1? I swallowed the bitter pill of acceptance and forced myself to move on. We were scheduled to leave in a weeks’ time for our one month trip to Europe, and I had a lot of chores that needed to be done around the garden prior to leaving.

One of these jobs was to add a layer of compost to the veggie patch and ornamental garden which had been starved of nutrients over the warm summer months. Alongside this fresh dose of compost, I mixed in the ashes from the incinerator. Ash, for those that don’t know, is a rich source of calcium and provides a great balancing effect for the soil.

We left for our Holiday, and we had an amazing time. I strongly believe that it might have been the last holiday we’ll ever take.

When we returned home, the wife had entered the house first while I lingered out the front with my son unloading our luggage from the car. An ear piecing shriek sounded from in the house, and I almost had a heart attack there and then. My son stared at me bug eyed, and I told him to stay right there. Without delay, I hurried inside, certain by the way my wife was constantly shrieking that someone was attacking her.  She was standing in the kitchen, trembling as she stared at the window. I clasped her shoulders, and forced her to look into my eyes. But she merely pointed towards the window, urging me to look.

I couldn’t believe what I saw.

Poking through a large crack was an all too familiar spiky red vine. It had somehow managed to force its way through the window where it continued to grow into our kitchen. Its tip was growing out so fast that it actually looked like a snake moving at a casual pace. I could hear the linoleum floor tear as the rapidly growing plant drove its spikes in as it moved about.

I ran to the kitchen cupboard and grabbed a large meat cleaver and proceeded to chopping the vine up. I cut it all the way back to the window until I could reach no further. But even as I sliced the last piece off, I could already see the wound callous over and prepare to bring forth new shoots.

I urged my wife to grab my son and stay in the car until I was able to get a full understanding of the situation we were in. My mind was still reeling at how it could have been possible for BD-6-1 to have survived. I had literally scraped a whole layer of soil out of the garden in my effort to remove absolutely every trace of root.

My heart hammered in my chest as I went to the rear of the house where BD-6-1 had been growing prior to being removed. To my astonishment, there was absolutely no trace of it here. So where was it coming from?

I rounded the corner and nearly ran straight into one of the vines that was rapidly heading this way. My jaw dropped at what I saw.

My entire backyard was absolutely inundated with BD-6-1 plants! The veggie patch, my dragonfruit orchard and my ornamental garden. The ground ran red with the spiky vines of this monstrosity of a plant. I raked my mind for how the hell BD-6-1 could possibly have shown up on this side of the property which I had never even brought a trace of it to.

Then it occurred to me.

The ashes. Scanning the infested area, it was clearly evident that the central location where all these vines were growing out from was the veggie patch and ornamental garden. Both places where I had added the ashes from the incinerator which I had burned BD-6-1 in.

But it couldn’t have been possible! I had ensured that the fire burned hot in order to break the material down into nothing. I had even ran my hands through the fine powder which had been a product of the intense burn! No plant, absolutely none, could reproduce from matter which had been broken down through fire.

It was the only explanation I had.

The repercussions of such a possibility swiftly occurred to me. Fire is usually the final destructor of everything. Yet, if this infestation managed to come forth out of the microscopic remains within the ashes, with a dawning horror I realized that nothing could destroy it.

And then, what if it was to somehow get out of my property and grow someplace unchecked? The combination of easy propagation, extremely rapid growth, high toxicity and extreme difficulty to handle would make BD-6-1 an environmental weed on the scale of nuclear destruction! It could not be contained if it left this property.

I knew then that I had an obligation. Ash or no ash, I had to ensure all remains of this monstrosity remained on my property.

We hadn’t even been home for half an hour when I hurried back to my wife and told her to drive to her parents and stay there until I told her it was safe to come back. She was an absolute wreck and begged me to be careful. I told her that I had to start working on removing it now, otherwise it would keep growing and heighten the chances of spreading afar. She completely understood and did as I said.

Without further delay, I armored myself up and began massacring the ever-growing vines. The chainsaw went through three tanks of fuel before I reached the thick center of the infestation which was simply too dense for me to be able to work safely around. So, I got the skid steer out and began ripping into it.

Unlike my first removal of BD-6-1 when it had been growing on the trellis, this job took me three days to complete. All the while, I was constantly fighting against reshoots and the pile I was forming was growing far larger than anticipated. Through my ordeal, I managed to get jabbed twice on the back of my right hand, and one that managed to penetrate through my boots straight into my left big toe. Based off my last experience, I should have gone straight to the hospital but I deemed the job of removing the monstrosity much more important.

When I was finished, I had pretty much relandscaped my entire yard and it was an absolute mess. Not only had I ripped the vines out root and all with the skid steer, I had also used my excavator to take out 500mm worth of soil, just to be safe.

I immediately started digging an enormous hole next to the large pile of the dugout plant material. It was 10 foot deep. I used the skid-steer to push all the plant remains inside the hole, followed by all the excavated soil from the growing location on top. Eventually the entire hole was backfilled and I reckon I had driven the heavy machinery over it about a hundred times to ensure adequate compaction.

For good measure. I even went so far as to pouring a thick slab of concrete over the hole, serving as both a permanent marker of the burial site, as well as a final barrier for the vine to penetrate through if its eagerness to survive surpassed my expectations.

BD-6-1 might have been able to regrow from shards of its spikes and ashen remains, but under compaction deep in the ground, I was confident it’s chances were very slim.

I went to the hospital and somehow my toe was saved. Yet despite being operated on almost a week earlier than when my finger had been that first time, the infection in my hand had gone too far. Half of it was amputated as a result.

Throughout the following year I became a regular patient of Dr Dale the Hand Specialist, who assisted me in my recovery and learning to live with only one hand. During one of our sessions I  asked him if he had any idea about what ended up happening to the samples he had sent to be analyzed back when he operated on my finger. He assured me that nothing ever came of it. The samples likely had their DNA and genetic material analyzed before being destroyed in some medical waste facility. Despite being disappointed that nothing more came from those samples, I’ll admit that I was relieved. The last thing I needed was some researcher knocking on my door wanting to learn more about the plant that the strange spikes and green finger had originated from. I wanted closure on my ordeal, and closure is what I got.

5 years have since passed, and I never saw any sign of BD-6-1 near that concrete slab, or anywhere on my property. Living with only one hand whole hand now – constantly being reminded of what caused it - I swiftly seized hybridizing further generations of the Black Dragon line and eventually stopped hybridizing dragonfruit altogether, unwilling to accidently create another monstrosity.

I never really had any intention to tell the story of my experiences with BD-6-1. Being such an unusual and almost fantastical thing, I knew no one would have believed me. Only myself, my wife, and my son know about it.

But something has just come to my attention which has compelled me to write this up.

Last week, while watching the 6pm news, a bizarre story grabbed my attention. A waste processing facility was under investigation for allegedly concealing a “highly toxic” and “extremely invasive” plant. Apparently, two boys had been playing in a park that was located next to a five acre block of bushland that backed onto the waste facility. They had been searching for large sticks on the edge of the bushland where they accidently got jabbed by what was only disclosed as a “highly toxic” plant. Both boys lost their left legs below the knee as a result. With the incident having occurred on government land, the council was under scrutiny and were threatened with a potential law suit should it prove that negligence on the maintenance front was the largest contributing factor to the boys misfortune.  

The council had fought against these claims of responsibility and thus, to bolster their defense, led their own investigations with the help of local ecologists. Quite quickly they had been able to track the source of this “dangerous plant” to the waste facility.

Under intense scrutiny, it turned out that the waste facility had known about this plant for almost four years. At first it had popped out around the place as any weed does, but quickly grew to become a nuisance for the facility. They claimed they had never seen anything similar to it before, and instead of reporting it to environmental authorities, they had taken it upon themselves to control it with the heavy machinery they had access to. Controlling it became a very regular task alongside the actual waste processing.

My attention was peaked when a brief description was made of this “vine-like” weed. Its most notable feature was the red color of its branches and the “syringe-like” thorns embedded all over it.

I lost all sense of presence when footage of some heavy machines ploughing into an enormous thicket of this weed filled my screen. Footage of BD-6-1!

The story went on to say that the Waste facility had irresponsibly disposed of the plant material by mulching it up and mixing it with other processed green waste material. This material would be then sent off to other facilities, garden centers, parks, nurseries and landscape facilities.

When the story was finished I immediately opened my computer and began looking further into this story. To my horror, this had been going on far longer than I could have anticipated. The facility that was the center of this investigation had been a major supplier of mulch to a large national park in the north of my state. For the last four years, the national park had been battling against an outbreak of an “unknown species of pitahaya”. They had struggled to work out its origins, but since the investigations into the waste facility that supplied their mulch had begun, they were swiftly able to put two and two together.

In an unrelated article written up by the local media in the region near this national park, it calls the weed an environmental disaster. There is an interview with the head Ranger who admits that they’ve lost the battle. The weed is out of control and cannot be contained. They had taken desperate measures and had burned a large section of the bushland that was the most densely overrun in a controlled fire. It only made the problem worse, and since then the weed has been seen further outside of the park all across the local region.

There was no mention of any knowledge about the ashes being responsible for this vast dispersal of the weed.

I slammed my keyboard down hard when I read that. If people were controlling this by burning, they were only making the problem worse!

Delving even deeper, I joined the regions local Facebook group to see what more I could learn. My mouth was dry with what I saw. Every post was about this new weed, which locals were calling “the needle snake”. Gardens were completely overrun, and houses were being suffocated by it, much like mine had almost been. Insurance companies refused to pay out, leaving hundreds of residents desperate. There had been several incidents where people had been pierced by the thorns, a large number of them resulting in death. I shuddered to imagine what part of the body those unfortunate ones who died had been struck.

Even now, I rake my brain as to how BD-6-1 managed to get out of my property. For so long I was certain that I did all I could with great success. At first, I thought that perhaps some stray ashes might have blown in the wind after I had spread them around my yard. But I quickly dismissed this, as I hadn’t seen any trace of “the needle snake” growing in my local area.

There is only one explanation I can make.

Those damned samples that Dr Dale had sent off. The tiny samples had likely been incinerated as all medical waste is, Dr Dale had told me. And where then did all the ashes of such disposed medical waste end up? In waste management facilities.

I am yet to reach out to the authorities to tell them of my part in “the needle snakes” origin, and to offer my knowledge of it for their assistance. I assure you that I have every intention of doing so.

But I need to let the general public know first. If you see this post, please share it at once. The more people who can be aware of this environmental weed, the more efficient a response might be against it. There is no knowing how far this weed has already spread.

Please, if you see one writhing along the ground like a snake, get as far away from it as you can. And if you end up becoming one of the unfortunates forced to control it at close range then please, armor yourself up.

Do whatever you must, but DO NOT get struck by one of those spikes.

And for the love of all that is good, DO NOT BURN THEM! You’ll only make the problem worse!

May God have mercy on my soul for playing his hand with nature and causing the disaster that I know is coming.
