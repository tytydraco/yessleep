“I’m going to go to the park for a little bit to get some fresh air and to reorganise my thoughts.” I tell my wife Mary. We had just gotten into a fight so I thought the park would be the best place to go to calm down and get some alone sunshine. Well, I was…I was wrong. 

The park is not too far of a detour away from my house, about a 10 minute drive which if walking is about 30 minutes.

This park is where I always would go as a little kid and the memories that I have at the park as well as the nostalgia surrounding it, is a feeling that I can’t even put into words. My favourite memory being there was when it was my 6th birthday and something about running around with all my playmates, feeling the warm sun in my face (since my birthday is in July), and drinking juice boxes; it’s all just pure happiness and times were so much simpler back then, so much simpler. 

Arriving into the parking lot of the park, I close the door to my 2010 Honda, and head down the sidewalk to the park. “I don’t have any plans of what to do here, probably just walk around and get a break from all the drama with Mary.” I say to myself in my head. 

Mary and I have always had problems. Something about this fight though, really hit me from a mile away and I just needed to go and collect my thoughts. 

Walking down the main trail to the park, I notice something was off about the park that I hadn’t noticed before. The park was empty and eerily quiet. When I mean quiet, I mean it. This place was so quiet that it seemed like I could hear my own heart beat. Just a quiet sunny day in August, no wind, nothing. Not even any birds were chirping which was very odd to me since I am at a park and you usually hear a deafeningly loud noise from all the birds around.

I look back to see if I missed something in the parking lot that I hadn’t noticed before. And by turning around, I noticed that nobody, not one single car, except for my own, was in the parking lot. “The fuck is going on? Am I just lucky or something? Is this park closed down?” I say to myself out loud. It has been a couple of years since quarantine from the virus, so that couldn’t have been it. “Hmm, I guess I am just lucky.” I think to myself. “Well then I hit the jackpot if that’s the case!”
 
*Only I wasn’t alone.*

Walking down the trail more and more I notice a shiny thing in the distance hiding behind a tree. It was a vehicle. An oddly familiar vehicle. A van! 

It was bright blue and had black streaks coming down its side like a race car. Seeing this van hit me with a mad case of Deja Vu. It was something about it, like I had seen it before, but it was very hazy and was on the tip of my tongue. The memory was very vague but also vivid at the same time, like a ghost. You can’t see it, but you can sense when it is near you. 

*Seeing this van caused a feeling that I will never be able to explain. *

“Ok, this is freaky.” I exclaim out loud. “But I am not gonna let that affect me wanting to clear my mind.” Even though this van was making my mind run even more like a river. My thoughts were going crazy at this point and I also felt like I was going insane. 

With my mind rushing with thought after thought of what the van could be and why it’s here, as well as the past fight with my wife, did not mix well at all together.

But that’s when I heard a noise in the distance by the playground. A very faint noise.

“Creak, creak.” 

It was a creaking noise but was one that was high pitched. Not like the creaking of the door or the creaking sound made when stepping on a wooden floor. It was a whiny creak, a very high pitched creak. One that caused my mind to wanna explode and my ears to bleed.

“Creak, creak.”

There it was again! That same fucking noise!

Infuriating in annoyance I rush over to the playground to investigate what the noise was and I see …

a girl. A little girl. She didn’t look older than 5 and she was on the swing set at the playground. Walking up to her now in shock and also worry I call out. “Hey girl, are you ok? Where are your parents? Do you need help?” 

*No answer.* 

It was almost like she hadn’t even heard me as the same creaking from the swing would interrupt my thoughts some more. 

“Answer me please. If you are lost, I can help you find your parents. Are you hurt?” 

*Again, no response* 

The only given response was the same maddening noise over and over again. “Creak, creak. Creak, creak.” 

I thought I was losing my mind. I thought I was hallucinating. I thought that … I didn’t even know what I to think. 

Suddenly the girl stops swinging and looks up at me. She raises her finger and just points at me, staring at the same time. No speaking, no saying anything, just silence while she stared at me. But this time I could hear the birds chirping. It was like someone had paused reality and time and then unpaused it.

“It’s ok. I won’t hurt you. I am a sweet person, it’s ok, don’t worry. My name is Jaron, what’s yours?” I say to her. 

*No response.* 

But now no more swinging and creaking noises. Just pointing and staring from her with the birds chirping in the background. 

Then I heard a rustling noise in the bushes behind me. A loud rustling. I quickly turn my back to look.

A deer. “Come on Mother Nature. Don’t do me like that.” I think to myself as I watch it run away into the horizon. Yes the horizon. The sun was already setting. 

“Shit how long have I been out here.” I whisper out loud. “I wouldn’t cuss, if I were you, there’s kids near by.” A male voice says out loud.

“Who are you and what do you want?” I respond back. That’s when I notice, the girl on the swing is gone and had disappeared. “
What the fuck she had just been there! That makes no damn sense, nothings making no damn sense!

“Don’t you remember me Jaron?” The man responded. “How … how do you know my name?” I respond. my voice shaking and trembling. 

“U really don’t remember me? Huh. Let’s just say that my name is Mark and I know a lot about you.” The voice says out loud. “What do you mean, who the hell are you? Why are you doing this!?”

Suddenly the little girl runs out with a knife and cuts me in my leg. Crying in agony and pain I fail to the floor. 

“Why did you do that to me? You little brat!” I scream out loud as my leg is bleeding and stinging with excruciating pain.

“because, you are one of them. you are an evil and wicked man.” The girl responds. Her voice all innocent but the tone she spoke was terrifying and very creepy. 

“What! What are you talking about? What is this? What the hell is going on?” 

A man pops out in view behind the slide at the playground. The man who has been speaking to me. 

“Oh my god.” I repeat out loud. “Now you remember me huh.” The man responds. “No, this isn’t fucking happening!” I yell out. “Release that little girl! Stop doing this!” 

The man pulls something out of his pocket as I am screaming. A toy. A bright blue car that had black streaks coming down its side. The same one as the van in the park. 

*Then it hit me.* 

When I was 10 years old I remember waking up in a room that I don’t remember being mine. The room had cracks on the ceiling and the bed was rock hard. A man, who reminded me of my uncle, walked in the room and told me that he was a friend of my dad’s and told me that my dad just told him to pick me up for the night since he would be working late. The man then went into my ear and asked me, “What’s your favourite vehicle.” I responded in fear but also comfort thinking this is one of my dad’s friends and he won’t hurt me, “A van.” 

Again going up to my ear the man whispered, “Now what’s your favourite colour?” In a hazy way I responded, “Bright blue, like the sky, like the beautiful vast sky.” 

Then finally, the man went up to my ear and asked, “What is your favourite shape.” “Lightning bolts, the shape of them is so cool to me, like STREAKS flashing through the sky.” 

After this, the last thing I can recall is the cops arriving to the man’s house and arresting him on site while my mother was waiting outside, crying. I still remember the hug from her as she wept in my arms, her tears soaking up on my shoulder. This all hit me like a truck.

I then went out of this hypnotic state of memory and yelled out, “You sick man, you kidnapped me when I was young didn’t you?”

*Silence*

“Respond you son of a bitch or I will call the cops on you!” 

“Whoa, whoa, whoa. I kidnapped you? Is that what you are saying to me right now?” The man replied. “You got it all wrong, why don’t I show who you really are sir!” 

Suddenly multiple cops rush out of a bush. Weapons all drawn on me. Then a big screen in the centre of the playground turned on. A news report played from 3 years ago.

“Coming to you from channel 66 news. A 23 year old man, has been arrested after running over a little girl from having an illegal street race by a school. The girl ran into the road and the man ran her over. His punishment for this act isn’t gonna be the death penalty or life in prison, the community in which this happened decided that it’s best that this man gets punished from regret forever.”

A crowd boos at me in the distance. 

“You see Jaron, you will forever live in regret by being haunted by this act of evil you have committed.”

“But the kidnapping. I remember you kidnapped me when I was young.”

“No no. That is what we call a false memory. When you take your pills every night before you go to bed, they are actually pills to make you have false memories. You never got kidnapped.” 

“How about the van, the colours on it, the lightning bolt streak running down on its side. How can I have a false memory of that.”

“That wasn’t a false memory. That was a real memory. That was the vehicle you were racing when you ended that little girls life. So we remind you of it every day to torment you for what you have done. That little girl that cut you is an actor, I am an actor, everyone is actors. You will relive this day tomorrow and the next, all the way till eternity. We give you shots like the one right now that makes you lose all memory and…”

*Than blackness.*




“Wow, what a terrible nightmare” I mutter to myself as I woke up to the sound of the alarm clock. I get ready for work and leave the house. 

Getting home from work, me and my wife, Mary began to fight. 

Wanting to clear my mind for a little bit I say… “Im going to go the park for a little bit honey.”
