I’m not looking for sympathy. I just need someone else to admit they’ve heard it too.

The knocking.

Not from the door. From under the house. From beneath the floorboards.

I was alone when it started. At least… I thought I was.

It was supposed to be a quiet weekend. My cousin Leah had booked a last-minute trip and offered me her cabin in northern Maine. No WiFi, no service, no neighbors for miles. I figured it’d be good for me. Time to think. Get my head right.

And it was — at first.

The drive up was uneventful. The woods were dense, but beautiful in that lonely, postcard kind of way. The road narrowed into a gravel path after the last town. Twenty minutes later, the trees opened just enough to reveal the cabin. Two stories, pitched roof, red-trimmed windows.

Charming, in an “I hope this place has a deadbolt” kind of way.

The first thing I noticed was how quiet it was. No birdsong. No wind. Just that oppressive hush you get in deep woods, like the world’s holding its breath.

Inside, it was cleaner than I expected. Rustic but lived-in. Firewood stacked by the stove. Worn furniture. A rug that looked older than me. I dropped my bag, grabbed a beer from the fridge, and settled into the creaky armchair with a book.

The first knock came that night.

I’d been dozing — not quite asleep, but drifting — when I heard it. A slow, deliberate thump directly beneath me. Not the kind old houses make when they settle. This had intent.

I froze.

It came again. Louder.

Knock… knock… knock.

Three, like a pattern. Then silence.

I stood, heart thudding, and stepped off the rug. The boards creaked beneath my feet. I knelt, pressed my ear to the floor.

Nothing.

Just as I leaned back, it happened again — right beneath where I’d been sitting.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Same spot. Same rhythm.

I wish I could say I grabbed my keys and left. But curiosity is a dumb thing. Especially in the dark.

I checked the crawlspace. The hatch was in the kitchen, beneath a trapdoor that screamed every time it moved. I shined my flashlight down, but all I saw was dirt and lattice. No movement. No signs of animals. Just the cold breath of earth.

I convinced myself it was just the house. Maybe the pipes. Maybe some animal beneath the foundation.

I went back to bed.

But I didn’t sleep.

Around 2 AM, I heard it again. Only this time… it wasn’t beneath the chair.

It was beneath me.

I was lying on the mattress in the loft when the knocking started — directly under the bedframe. Slower this time. Knock… knock… knock…

I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

My skin prickled. I stared at the ceiling like it held the answer.

The knock came again. And this time… something scraped.

Long. Drawn-out. Wood on wood.

Like fingers.

I finally moved — rolled off the mattress, grabbed my flashlight, and hauled ass down the stairs.

Nothing chased me.

No sound at all.

Until I stepped into the kitchen.

There, on the trapdoor to the crawlspace, were three fresh scratches. Not animal scratches — these were straight. Deliberate. Spaced like fingers.

I didn’t sleep that night. Just sat on the porch with the flashlight clutched in both hands and my back to the cabin. Whatever it was, it stayed quiet until dawn.

And then… it got worse.

The next morning, I tried to leave.

Car wouldn’t start.

Battery was fine. Tank full. No visible issues. But when I turned the key… nothing. Not even a click.

I tried my phone — still no signal.

That’s when I heard it.

Not the knocking.

Breathing.

From inside the cabin.

I turned slowly.

Through the front window, I could see the loft. The bed. The shadows above it.

And something standing at the foot of the mattress.

It was tall. Too tall. Thin arms. Crooked legs. A hunched frame that barely fit beneath the sloped ceiling. Its head was bent low, face hidden in shadow. But it was breathing — slow, shuddering inhales, like each breath hurt.

I blinked.

It was gone.

Just… not there anymore.

I ran inside, heart thundering. But there was nothing. No footprints. No blood. No sign anything had been there at all.

Except—

Three new scratches.

On the underside of the loft railing.

I left the house again. This time, I walked.

I don’t know how far I made it — maybe two miles. But the woods felt wrong. Not just silent — dead. The trees looked darker. Older. And at some point… the trail behind me was gone. Like it had never been there.

I circled back by instinct more than anything. By the time I saw the cabin again, the sky had gone gray. And there was something on the roof.

Not moving. Just hunched at the peak like a gargoyle. Watching.

I didn’t sleep that night either.

The knocking didn’t stop. It came in waves. Sometimes beneath me. Sometimes in the walls. Once, from inside the damn wood stove.

I watched the trapdoor until morning. It never opened.

But something else did.

A drawer in the hallway. One I hadn’t touched. Inside was a bundle of cloth — old, yellowed, wrapped with string.

I opened it.

Hair.

Human, from the looks of it. And inside the braid, something was woven — a small carved shape. Bone, I think. Too detailed for coincidence.

It looked like a figure.

Bent backward.

Over a ring of thorns.

I left the bundle where I found it. But I think that was the final straw.

Because that night… it came up from the floor.

I was in the chair again, facing the fire, when I heard the trapdoor creak open behind me.

Not fast. Just… patient.

Like whatever was beneath the house had finally decided I was ready.

I didn’t turn around.

I couldn’t.

But I heard the footsteps.

Bare feet on wood. Slow. Deliberate.

They stopped right behind my chair.

I could hear it breathing.

Not angry. Not violent.

Just close.

I don’t remember falling asleep. I must’ve blacked out, because when I opened my eyes again, it was morning — and the trapdoor was closed.

But the scratches were gone.

Every one of them.

The rug was back in place. The cloth bundle? Vanished.

Even the car started.

I drove. Didn’t stop. Didn’t breathe.

When I got home, there was a package waiting on my doorstep.

No return address.

Inside was a strip of leather. Burned with a symbol.

A figure bent backward over thorns.

And underneath, five words:

“YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LOOKED.”

Now every night, I hear it.

The knocking.

In my walls.

And sometimes… beneath my bed.
