I don't even know how to start. What I'm about to describe is the most horrifying thing Ive ever seen. And I've seen most of the videos people describe as being the worst, most traumatising things on the internet. Some of those still haunt me. Or, they used to. Brief flashbacks that temporarily removed my faith in humanity. But this is a whole different kind of trauma. 

I can't sleep anymore. I don't dream now, it's just nightmare after nightmare. The paranoia alone has destroyed my life, I'm terrified of the consequences of my knowledge. There is only one saving grace, but I don't know if that's the last of my optimism deceiving me. I think my mind has simply had enough now, and I'm almost now ready to accept my final defeat. But before I go, I need to tell someone what I saw.

I got into using the Tor browser to explore the deep web. If you don't know, Tor is what lets you visit "onion" URLs, long strings of characters that are impossible to guess, or even remember. When you start your deep web journey you'll probably be using one of the index portals, but I became obsessed with exploring every kind of thing it has to offer. Eventually I found my way on to the oldest form of dark links: URLs posted by anonymous accounts on dated forums.

You'd never know what you'd get: guns and drugs would be obvious guesses, but dark web storefronts can't thrive if nobody knows about them. The real secretive stuff is precursor chemicals for batch making of other chemicals, the kind of the thing that only a few buyers would be interested in. Weird drugs I'd never heard of, poisons, corrosives, all that heavy shit. Some of them even had shopping lists, so you could, quite literally, pick your poison, and have all the ingredients added to your cart at once.

There was murder for hire stuff, of course, but I never ventured too far into that. Mostly it was just an info sheet: Send an email via Proton Mail to so-and-so address, and await further instructions. There was plenty of hacking stuff too, but I know well enough to steer clear of that. I was a coder myself and I know more than enough to understand how severely just visiting the wrong site can fuck you.

But that's enough preamble. I'm probably just putting it off because I don't know how to say it. So here goes.

I found a link on one of those forums. And this was deep stuff, a link from a link from a link. The only description offered was "Броненосцы", which apparently means "Battleships". It was anonymously posted, and the forum was Russian, which is to be expected if you go deep enough.

All the page showed was "1 BTC", a Bitcoin wallet address, and a password input box. This was only last year, so that's about $90k. A fair bit more than what I can afford, but like I said, I was a coder, and I had to know what could possibly cost that much. 

I looked at the source code for the site and found the script that verifies the password. For the record, most form handling on the internet takes place on the server, with backend code, but for whatever reason, the important bit here was done using JavaScript, which runs in the browser, and can be viewed by anyone. I found the bit of code that handled the password confirmation, which checked for a certain response from a server. My best guess is that it was using a pre-built service for verifying a transaction, and sending back confirmation. But the result was always the same: One of two onion URLs. One was called "red" in the code, the other called "blue". I chose red and visited the URL.

Most of the page showed a camera feed. I wasn't sure what I was seeing at first. It looked like a top-down view of a large cellar, or a dingy warehouse or something. In the middle was what looked like a large wooden surface, made up of lots of wooden planks. That's what clued me into the scale of this thing, it was massive. It had a grid drawn onto it with white paint, and letters down the side, ABC etc, and numbers across the top, 123 etc. And across the surface were what looked like rusted metal circles. Some of them had what I think were blue plastic discs, maybe frisbees or buckets or something. Each grid space had either a metal circle or a plastic disc in its center. Some of the blue discs were in a line, with others dotted around the grid.

The rest of the page had what I understand now to be a chat feed. There were a bunch of grid values, alternating in red and blue. B6, E8, back and forth. Very occasionally there was white text saying "SUNK", following one of those values. So it was red vs. blue, I gathered, in what looked like a very large, live game of Battleships. I still wasn't sure why the cost of entry was so high though.

I watched the chat until someone sent new coordinates. It was a middle value, E5 or something. Then I understood the scale of the platform, as a man in heavy boots and a balaclava walked up to the coordinate and stomped heavily on the metal circle several times. I thought that it must have been the top of a pipe, and the man was pushing it through the wood. Then he dropped a blue disc onto the now-flatted metal thing.

There were two more things on the page: An audio button, which I guess toggled the volume, and numbered buttons along the bottom. 1 to 7, I think. I clicked button #2, and my curiosity was instantly replaced with terror.

The video feed changed to show below the platform. Some kind of metal caging. The metal things were huge spikes, driving into wire and rust wrapped around flesh. There were bodies fastened to the bottom of the platform, but I couldn't recognise anything as a person. Just masses of broken body parts, bones, skin, blood, organs, hanging down, dripping, on the floor, mashed up into the wire. I searched for a meaning to it all, something recognisable, and saw a face. Just about, half off, pierced. 

I was horrified, but still couldn't understand what I was looking at. Then I made the biggest mistake of my life, and enabled the audio. Another metal pipe came smashing through. Cracking. Stomping. Screaming. It pushed into a set of thighs, snapping off their bottom halves completely. And my god, the sounds. The sounds were the worst of it. I'd never heard terror before, now it's all I hear. Then I saw a smaller body, two grid cells worth of a person, that's when it all hit me. That's when it all hit me. I shouted, "jesus fucking christ" and puked all over my desk, I wanted to pour bleach into my brain and burn it all away. 

That's when the reality of this whole setup started to sink in, and the fear started. I closed everything as fast as I could. Still covered in vomit, trying to hold back more but spewing over everything, I unplugged my computer, yanking out every cable from the back of it, breaking some in the process. I ran to my kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife I could find, hid in my bathroom, locked the door, curled up and started bawling.

I stayed there for days, shaking, crying, unable to sleep. I stopped eating. I stopped going to work. I stopped talking to people. I couldn't trust anyone. I lost my job, my home, all of it. I spent a year cowering in the shadows, waiting to be found.

But that's enough now. I'm done. I can't do this anymore, and if I'm going out, I'm doing it on my own terms. Not strapped to a fucking game of battleships.
