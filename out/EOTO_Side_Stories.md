(Been having a little difficulty with Count Jim's Fortean Freakshow Part 5. I got the story in my head. Just my stupid fingers are having a little trouble committing it to the written word. I wrote a few unrelated side stories in the same universe as a means to get into the mindset of writing it.)

**The Monster Girl**

July 14th, 2016 – Sweetwater

OMG, Diary, this is NOT a drill. Like, seriously, *not*. I got invited to join a *secret society*. A real-life, *actual* secret society. And it’s all because of my, shall we say, *unique* tastes.

It started, predictably, in Barnes & Noble. I was, as usual, hitting up “that section”—you know, the one tucked away in the back, practically whispering promises of tentacled delights and furry, fanged romance (Not a furry, BTW). I was browsing a particularly juicy werewolf-shifter-vampire ménage à trois novel (don't judge, it was *steamy*) when this woman approached me. At first, I thought she was just another curious customer, maybe judging my questionable literary choices. But nah, she had this vibe, like a really cool, older goth mom. She was all sharp angles and dark eyes, and she smelled faintly of sandalwood and ozone. Total goth mommy energy. And *yes*, I think she’s hot AF. For a Gen X-er.

She introduced herself as Soror XI of the Esoteric Order of the Other. I almost choked on my own saliva. EOTO? I'd heard whispers about them online—some obscure forum posts, cryptic Reddit threads—but I always figured it was just some LARP group or something. Turns out, it’s… not.

Soror XI explained that they’d been monitoring my online activity (!!!) specifically, my fanfics. Apparently my teratophilic tendencies and extensive knowledge of obscure mythology (thanks, Tumblr!) made me a prime candidate for… acolyte-hood. She didn't use that word exactly, but that's what it boiled down to. Apparently, my bizarre sexual attraction to monsters… gives me an advantage. Who knew?

She said my lack of fear—my *understanding*—of things most people would scream and run from, was valuable. My ability to see the "humanity" in the "monster," to connect with its fundamental otherness without revulsion, somehow made me… *useful*. The whole thing was low-key mind-blowing.

July 15th, 2016

Yesterday was the… initiation, I guess? It wasn't as dramatic as in those cheesy initiation rituals you see in movies. No blood oaths or anything. More like… a really intense interview, followed by a *very* long lecture. They operate out of this unmarked office building in Abilene, total 90s vibes. My heart was racing the whole drive, but also, I was low-key hyped.

Inside, it looked like a cross between a library and a high-tech lab. Seriously, the tech was next level. I also saw a bunch of… stuff. Weird artifacts, mostly, stuff that looked like it was pulled straight from a Lovecraftian nightmare. And a bunch of really thick books written in languages I didn’t recognize.

Soror XI explained the EOTO’s goals – monitoring paranormal happenings, protecting humans *and* "otherlings" (that’s their term for non-human entities), maintaining the balance between the two worlds, and basically preventing a full-blown apocalypse. Turns out, there's a whole universe of creatures, beings, and entities out there that most people aren't even aware of.

The EOTO's history is pretty wild, too. Founded in the late 40s by a group of scientists and mystics who found a long lost text that lead them to an ancient sleeping being called Shaitan. Shaitan, apparently, clued them into the whole Otherling thing. It's a totally different world view compared to the mainstream, but honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, it kind of makes sense that the world is more than just what we experience daily.

They showed me some of their files – accounts of encounters with everything from mischievous sprites to genuinely terrifying things best left unnamed. It was intense, to say the least. But despite the horror elements, there was also a strangely comforting element to it all. Like finally having validation for all the weird stuff I’ve been into my whole life. And maybe I'll for real have that hot monster BF... or GF of my dreams.

July 16th, 2016

Training started today. It’s… a lot. A *lot* more than I expected. It's not just about identifying different Otherlings. It’s about understanding their cultures, their motivations, and, get this, *communicating* with them. We're learning ancient languages, obscure rituals, and various forms of… well, I'm not sure what to call it. Advanced empathy? Psychic awareness? It's all pretty intense.

The weirdest part? Turns out, what we humans consider "monsters" are often just… misunderstood. They have reasons for their actions, their own societies, their own problems. I know, total mind-warp, right? But the more I learn about it, the more it makes sense. The line between monster and misunderstood is so blurred it's almost non-existent sometimes.

Soror XI keeps giving me these knowing looks. She’s totally cool with my kinks, which, I have to admit, feels pretty awesome. No judgment, just acceptance. I even got a slight nod of approval when I mentioned writing a fanfic about a shapeshifting librarian with a penchant for late-night study sessions. She just said, "Ah, yes. The hidden life of the Other."

Things are definitely going to get… interesting. My life is officially a level 10 WTF moment. I'm still processing. But honestly? I'm not scared. Maybe a little nervous, but mostly… excited. This is going to be epic. BRB, gotta go write a really intense chapter in my latest fanfic. This time, the monster’s got a PhD. And a really complicated relationship with an archivist.

**Baker**

\[Spring 2003 Investigation Log - Acolyte Milton Thorne, Esoteric Order of the Other\]

April 12th, 2003

The drive to Mineral Wells was... unpleasant. Texas in spring is supposed to be picturesque, or so the brochures claim. But all I saw was mile after mile of dry scrub, ugly flat terrain, and the occasional skeletal oil rig. In the distance, the Baker Hotel looms like a grand, decaying sentinel. Local news reports speak of the disappearance of bat sanctuary workers, but the Order’s intelligence offers a more... nuanced perspective. They aren't simply missing; they’ve been consumed by the echo. This echo, they say, resonates from within the Baker itself.

My assignment is to observe, identify, and, if possible, contain— neutralize as a last resort. However, given how long this place has attracted the... unusual, that last objective feels like a long shot.

The town is eerily quiet. Too quiet. Most buildings are boarded up, a ghostly reminder of better times. The Baker dominates everything around it, a behemoth of pale stone and broken windows. I can feel its presence— a low thrum in my very bones. The psychic imprinting here is thick and heavy, like a shroud. It's not merely sadness; it’s something… more. A restless sentience struggling to break free.

Tonight, I will attempt entry. May the Other guide my hand.

April 13th, 2003

Entry was easier than I anticipated. Someone had pried a board loose on the back dock. Inside, the air is stale— thick with dust and the scent of decay. Time feels distorted here. While the grandeur is still visible in the faded murals and cracked marble, it’s all deteriorating, as if it is a forgotten memory.

I spent several hours exploring the lower floors. The stories are true— the place is alive, but not in any conventional sense. Shadows shift and whisper; the sounds of phantom parties echo down empty corridors. I swear I saw a woman in a flapper dress dancing near the ballroom, only to vanish when I approached.

It isn’t random. It's layered, like a tapestry woven from past joys and sorrows. And there's something else— something reaching out. The building is trying to communicate; I can feel it, but its voice is a cacophony of fragmented emotions and impressions.

Tomorrow, I will ascend. The Order's readings indicate a concentration of energy in the penthouse suite. I suspect whatever "device" they mentioned is located there. I must proceed with caution. The building is not merely haunted; it's... hungry.

April 14th, 2003

The penthouse. The air here hums with palpable energy— a low vibration that makes my teeth ache. The luxury has faded, replaced by peeling wallpaper and warped wood. In a corner, hidden behind a section of loose paneling, I found it.

It’s not a machine in any traditional sense. Instead, it resembles a strange, amorphous crystal, pulsing with a faint inner light. It rests on a crude stand made of rusted metal and copper wiring. The metal seems to be… resonant, as if the crystal is tuning it, using it to amplify its power. The psychic echo is strongest here; it’s a roaring static that threatens to overwhelm my senses. I can feel the building's awareness most intensely in this space— a fragmented, desperate consciousness striving to take form.

The crystal isn’t causing the haunting— at least, not entirely. It serves as a focal point, amplifying the psychic energy imprinted in the building’s structure over decades. It’s drawing those residual imprints together, attempting to coalesce them into something tangible. Something… alive.

I tried to photograph the device, but my camera's battery has been completely drained. I suspect the crystal's energies interfere with modern technology. I attempted to dismantle the device or remove it from the building, but it feels anchored. Its base has practically fused into the wooden floor. Any effort to pry it loose causes the entire room to vibrate, and the psychic pressure is nearly unbearable.

I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched— not just by the building, but by something within it. Something that doesn’t want me to touch the device.

I must meditate. I need to understand the nature of this sentience before I resort to destructive measures—or at least, before I try.

April 15th, 2003

I meditated and sought to connect with the building’s consciousness to comprehend its desperate plea. It isn’t evil— not in the traditional sense. It is simply… lost, alone, trapped in this decaying shell. It longs to be heard and understood. It reaches for something— anything— to break free from this cycle.

The crystal is like a heart, beating at the center of this living structure, pumping out the energy that fuels its awareness. But it isn’t enough. The building remains trapped, its consciousness looping through its past glories and tragedies.

I cannot destroy the crystal. It is an integral part of the building's essence. To destroy it would extinguish the awareness and condemn it to nothingness. Yet I can’t leave it as it is. The building's fragmented consciousness is too volatile, too unstable. Its attempts to reach out could lead to disastrous consequences if it breaks through the boundaries of this place.

I need to find a way to soothe it, to help it find peace, to help it… understand. I'm uncertain whether Order would want me to care about this; they would simply want the device destroyed due to the danger it presents, but I can’t do that. That would be an act of malice. I must… speak with the building.

This process is going to take time. And I suspect it will be far more dangerous than I initially anticipated.

April 16th, 2003 (Final Entry)

Yesterday was… intense. The building spoke to me— not with words, but through emotions and images. It revealed its memories: the laughter and tears, the grandeur and sorrow. It showed me its fears and loneliness, and its core desire— to be, to exist fully.

I tried to explain, as best as I could, that it could not truly escape. That its existence would continue as it is, trapped within these walls, but it could find peace in that. I attempted to ground it to the present, and it seemed to understand— to accept its situation.

Today, I will remain here and explore further. I will stay in the building and try to help its consciousness find a way beyond the decay that surrounds it, so it isn’t so volatile. This may become my life's work, even if it may not align with the Order's goals.

I can’t leave. This is where I am meant to be.

\*\*Footnote by Soror Xi: We must exercise greater caution when assigning our acolytes. This is Milton's final entry before he vanished without a trace. He provided us with crucial insight into the nature of the anomaly, but this came at the tragic cost of an aspiring acolyte who was on the path to achieving full Frater status. From now on, no acolyte will be allowed to conduct investigations alone, regardless of their confidence in their abilities. It was reckless to think he could face this task solo. Although he declined any backup, the burden of this loss is mine to bear.

He is mistaken on one point, however. If this building is truly a thinking, feeling entity, we have sworn an oath to defend it. Dangerous, perhaps, but neutralization should always be a last resort. This may be another failure on my part— I did not sufficiently impart to him the Order's policy of compassion and understanding.

I am submitting a formal request to Pater Magnus to assign a team of more experienced specialized operatives to investigate the site. If we can establish a rapport with this anomaly, we may be able to incorporate it into our network of operational bases while keeping it pacified. Otherwise, leaving it unchecked poses a significant threat.\*\*

\*\*Subject:\*\* A Letter of Gratitude and Update

My Dearest Silas,

As I sit down to write to you, the shadows cast by the flickering moonlight dancing across my walls remind me of the countless nights we've spent in similar circumstances. It has been a long time since we last saw each other, and although the years have passed, the memories of that fateful night still linger. Time, I’ve learned, is a peculiar thing, especially for beings like my brother Liam and me. While the world outside measures its passage by the turning of calendars, we mark our years by the shifting patterns of the moon. And it seems to pass faster and faster these days.

Every fall, as the veil thins and the nights grow longer, I’m reminded of the sanctuary you offered us, of the kindness and guidance that forever changed the course of our lives. It’s strange, isn’t it? How a single encounter can alter the trajectory of an entire existence. Before the Esoteric Order of the Other found us— before you— we were adrift, spectral figures haunting the highways and backroads of West Texas. Our faces, pale as moonlight, our eyes, two pools of endless black obsidian—we must have looked like specters, the kind that chilled the blood and quickened the heartbeat.

I remember the sting of the wind, the endless hum of the Texas night, the cloying fear that clung to us like a second skin. We’d knock on doors in the dead of night, our little hands rapping on the wood, our voices hoarse with desperation. “Please,” we’d beg, our words little more than whispers. “Please, can you help us?” But the doors always slammed in our faces. We were met with screams, with screeching car tires, with guns. They saw the darkness in our eyes and perceived something inhuman.

Our parents were like us— Otherlings hiding in the shadows, trying to keep us safe. They were kind and gentle souls, but the world wasn’t built for them or for us. You, Silas, know the story well; it’s in the files, right? The mob that night, the religious zealots who thought they were purging a demon, when all they did was shatter our fragile world. After that, we just kept walking, kept knocking, hoping for a kindness we didn’t seem fated to find.

Then there was poor Mr. Bethel, the reporter. I still remember the night we met him on the outskirts of Abilene. We were desperate, having walked for days. Liam was weak, and I felt frantic. I was the one who approached his car, and I recall the look on his face— a mixture of fear and dread. He fumbled for his keys, trying to start the engine, but couldn’t. I remember the sound of his frantic heartbeat, pulsing inside that old car. He bolted when he finally managed to get it running. It’s almost tragic to think that we, two small children, became the subject of his nightmares: his “Black Eyed Kids” encounter. We didn’t know what we were, what made us so different and feared, what made our eyes so unnerving. The documents he wrote and the stories he shared eventually reached the ears of the EOTO, and then… you found us.

You were a revelation, Silas. You didn’t flinch at the sight of our unnerving eyes or ghostly pallor; you saw us, not just the Other within us. The EOTO, as you explained, was a haven— a place where beings like us could learn to control our gifts and understand our place in the world. You taught us about our heritage: the Otherlings, the lost and forgotten children of the night. You gave us more than just food in or bellies or a warm place to sleep. You gave us a name, a story, and a purpose. You showed us how to harness our abilities, how to use our powers to guide others, not to frighten them.

We learned to control our affinity with shadows, to move unseen, to blend into the darkness like whispers on the wind. We learned to harness our subtle influence— to guide, not manipulate. And most importantly, you helped us understand that our nature wasn’t a curse but an extraordinary gift. With your guidance, we transformed from victims into protectors, from lost souls into guiding lights.

That’s why I’m writing to you now, Silas. Liam and I travel extensively, going to places where we hear otherlings are at risk. We locate orphaned children like ourselves and guide them to havens, just as you guided us. We are acutely aware of the struggles they face, but with the EOTO’s support, we’ve survived, and we will stop at nothing to help others do the same.

We hear the whispers, Silas— the stories that are never told, the voices that cry out in the darkness. They are the forgotten souls, the children who are pushed to the margins, feared, and misunderstood by society. But we, the whisperers, have found each other, and with the your guidance, we’ve discovered a purpose. We channel our experiences, our fears, and our sorrow, turning them into guiding lights for those who are lost, just as we were.

We’ve changed these past decades, Silas. We’re still nine years old in body, and at heart, still fragile to the sun, and our eyes remain pools of black obsidian. But the fear is gone— at least for us. There’s a sense of purpose now, a sense of belonging to something greater than ourselves. We’ve found our place in the shadows, and with it, a chance to make a difference.

We haven’t forgotten the kindness you extended to us, Silas. You saw beyond the surface, beyond the things that made us different. You welcomed the shadows, and in doing so, you saved two lost souls. This letter is not only a gesture of gratitude but also a promise to continue honoring your teachings. We will keep walking in the shadows, guiding others, protecting our own, and living out the purpose you instilled in us. If our paths cross again, it won’t be as the terrified kids who startled that reporter; it will be as the protectors of our kind.

Thank you, Silas, for everything.

With unending gratitude and respect,

Emma, the Black Eyed Kid
