If you are receiving this message, it is imperative that you convince the government to turn off all long range broadcasting. Stop sending any kind of signals out into space. I will try to explain but I don't know how long this broadcast can last, but write everything down and the second the broadcast ends, contact General Barkley of the US military and tell him everything. This is imperative to the survival of our species.  
  
I know you probably think this is some sort of prank call, but you have to believe me. It all started a few months ago, I was approached by the US Government. They said they needed an astronaut with a science background for a confidential mission, and I agreed to go. The training they had us doing was unusual, but I didn't think much of it.  At least not until the day before the launch. They gathered the 30 astronauts into a single briefing room, and a large figure in a military uniform walked in. He must have been 300 pounds, around 6’3. “I am General Barkley, and I am in charge of this mission”. He spoke with a stern voice, radiating authority. “After what I am about to show you, you will think you’re going crazy, but you’re not” He continued, “This is no prank, this is not some experiment, this is real.” He led us through a Steel door which led into a huge tunnel. The tunnel must have been at least a kilometer long. There were checkpoints every 100 meters or so where each of us had to scan our badges and biometrics, 4 armed guards watching over us at each checkpoint. I thought this was excessive, until I found out what they were guarding. After the final checkpoint we made our way into an elevator. After the elevator went up what must have been hundreds of feet, we stepped through a futuristic looking titanium door  into a gigantic hanger. At the center was an object that looked like .. I don’t even know. It didn’t look like anything I had ever seen before. It was completely alien.  
  
The structure was composed of various sizes of spherical balls, made out of a material the likes of which I had never seen before. The color of the spheres were obsidian black, but they shone like diamonds, swimming gracefully in the harsh ceiling lights of the hanger. It was hypnotizing. Apparently, it was alien technology that crashed on earth 10 years ago. After telling us about some of the basics they showed us inside. The outside of the ship was around the size of a f-18, but the inside of the ship was like a massive mansion. Apparently the interiors of the ship can be programmed, with no size restrictions. They also taught us to operate the ship.  
  
The next day, we launched. It was not some grand spectacle like your usual rocket ship launch. All of us were sitting in the cockpit (Although it was less like a cockpit and more like the bridge on a star trek ship). The General counted down from 10 to 1, and then the lead astronaut pressed a button that set us off on our course. There was no climatic lift off as the thrusters of the rocket wrestled against the shackles of gravity. Just a press of a button, and we were off. The ship was capable of traveling at 2500 c. That is 2500 times the speed of light. We were told that scientists had secretly observed signs of life on a planet 500 light years away. And so we began our 2 and half month expedition.   
  
It was more like a luxury cruise ship than a space mission. It had a swimming pool, a bar, an observation deck and even a full automated spa. I couldn't believe the technology involved. For the first month it went great. Everyone thought it would be a simple research mission and then they’d be back home. We were even still in communication with home base using advanced communication equipment which traversed many light years in mere seconds. It was all going well, until yesterday.  
  
I woke up to an announcement on the speakers. “WARNING, Astronaut 23 is not in a stable state of mind, if seen immediately detain”. This was a pretty shocking announcement. Astronaut 23 was Charles. While he and I were not particularly close he always seemed pretty level headed most of the time. He had some anger issues but becoming angry easily is a far ways away from becoming insane . I strolled out into the hallway only to witness Charles charging at me at full speed. I am considerably bigger than Charles so I managed to tackle him to the ground. “What the hell is wrong with you???” I shouted at him. Instead of responding to me he started vibrating. I don’t mean that he started shaking, I mean he started vibrating, like one of those factory machines about to break down. I then heard a pop sound, and saw that his eyes had started bleeding. He was suddenly somehow possessed with superhuman strength, throwing me off him as if I weighed nothing. He then started sprinting at blistering speeds. I saw 2 more astronauts much larger than him try to block his way, but he ran right into them without even slowing down. Everyone involved was knocked onto the floor, but Charles immediately got up and started sprinting again, until he suddenly stopped, clutching his chest.   
  
After the incident the medic examined him. The cause of his death was a heart attack, caused by an unbelievable amount of adrenaline. The medic could not, however, explain the bleeding eyes. It was not just a few blood vessels that burst, the entire eyeball had burst like a bubble, with seemingly no explanation. Not to mention, there was no evidence as to what caused the psychotic episode, or the sudden release of adrenaline.   
  
Needless to say, the incident had the entire crew on edge. We could not afford to stop now, so we kept going. A few hours later, however, something even stranger happened. Me and another astronaut were drinking at the bar. Astronaut 14 walked in and poured himself a shot of vodka. That was already strange. In the entire month on that ship, I had never seen him drink. There were rumors that he used to be an alcoholic. Even more strange, he didn’t stop. He took shot after shot after shot. Even as he could barely pour the drink he kept going. At some point we intervened. As we got him off the bar stool and started to take him back to his room, he suddenly socked both of us in our faces. The same man who a minute ago was struggling to pour his drink, suddenly started fighting off both of us like a ninja. He knocked out the other astronaut, so I made a run for it. He just went back to drinking. When the medic and a few of the other astronauts got to the bar Astronaut 14 was already dead from alcohol poisoning.  
  
About an hour later the Captain, Me, the medic, and a few other experienced astronauts gathered to hear the medic’s findings. “Both the victims had only one thing in common. Both of them had a high concentration of a certain chemical, which I have never seen before. This chemical seemed to cause them to exhibit certain pre-existing characteristics to a heightened degree. The chemical is composed of elements we haven’t even discovered yet, so there is a very small chance it happened naturally. Something out there is triggering this. Unless we find out what that something is, I think it's best to turn back”. The captain agreed with the medic’s assessment, so we decided to turn back. “Guys let’s change course back to earth”, the Captain announced over the intercom. “Guys do you copy”. Still no response.   
  
We made our way to the cockpit, but when we got there we realized everyone there was dead. Their mutilated corpses were horrifying. Over one of them stood Astronaut 7. He was eating the corpse. My God.  
  
We all charged at him but he jumped on us. I punched him as the captain came at him from behind with a kick. He shook off both and lunged at me. I elbowed his face and jumped on him. He wrestled me to the ground. I tried to punch his face but I felt a sharp pain. THE MOTHERFUCKER BIT MY FIST OFF. The medic came in with a chair to the bastard’s head. He was bleeding but unaffected. He was trying to eat me alive. Eventually repeated strikes got him off me. He was Dead.  
  
It was just the 5 of us left. We tried contacting the home base to no avail. We set course back to earth, but before we began, we saw another ship.   
  
The other ship was enormous. The size of a small planet, but it looked like a black hole. It was invisible to all instruments except the naked eye. Suddenly a voice appeared. “Surrender”  
  
The voice was not a physical voice. It was not something we heard, but rather something we felt. It was like a memory of the present moment. “Are you responsible for my friend’s deaths” I said out loud. The response of the voice once again appeared as a memory of the present moment. “Not our fault. They heard you. You will die”. “Who’s They”. A brief pause preceded the mind shattering truth unloaded on our minds. I cannot tell, for it cannot be told. It cannot be thought, only known. Tell the general That it will find us, unless we go dark. You cannot let it find us.   
  
You must tell him. For some reason the only place I could send this message was here. You are my last hope. Nobody else is seeing this post. Any other comments are fake. This is a message to you. Your device was the only one able to pick up this signal. Contact the general or you will be the cause of what will happen. The world won’t end, that would be better than what happens if you don’t contact the general.
