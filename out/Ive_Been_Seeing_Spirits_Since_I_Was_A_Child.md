Hello everyone.
I wanted to share some experiences I've had since I was a child up until now. This is going to be a long post, so please bare with me!

When I was two years old my mother and I moved back into my grandparents' home as my parents had just gotten a divorce. Now my grandfather swears that no one else has lived on the property where they built their home back in the 70s, but I've always seen someone in their home. It first started as a toddler, I used to tell my mother about things I was seeing in the house but she dismissed it as a child's imagination. I'd always see things in the ceiling or hallways and I'd tell her only to have her go "Oh, okay, we're using our "powers" again, huh?" Then as I got older things got worse. I'd be woken up out of a dead sleep by someone shaking my bed, even into my teenager years in that home someone would always shake my bed. Then it progressed to things being thrown off my walls. Pictures I would hang up as a teen would be ripped off the walls and thrown onto the floor while I was sitting in my room playing video games. The final experience in that house was when I was roughly 12/13 years old. My friend and I were playing with a camera in my grandparents' living room, and I had aimed it at the front windows. The friend and I gasped as we saw a girl with black hair in a white dress just sitting on the ledge to one of the windows. I snapped a photo of it and saved it onto a computer (which I no longer have as it's been 16 years since then). After that, things stopped in that house.

When I turned 21 my mother and I moved into our first apartment. It was a cute 2 bedroom apartment we had extremely quiet neighbors and never had problems from us or the other people living there. One night, I was laying in my bedroom about to fall asleep and I had someone yell in my ear "Get the f*ck up!", I bolted out of bed and into the living room of the apartment and I waited until my mother got up for work before going back to bed. A few weeks later, I had just gotten out of my shower and was about to exit the bathroom when a bottle of shampoo was thrown right at my legs, at that same time someone yelled for me to "Get the f*ck out" of the restroom, and I did. After being smacked with that bottle I looked into our apartment and the surrounding location and I found out that the park, right across the street, was home to rituals and sacrifices. I decided then that I needed to cleanse the apartment and got the supplies needed (even went to the catholic church up the road to get holy water). After the cleanse it stopped.

Now to the present time; I'm nearly 30 living in a home built in the 60s with my husband, mother, and our roomate (cheaper to have a living situation like this, let me tell you!). Our landlord's father just recently passed away and we needed our master bathroom shower redone (tub was leaking into the walls and causing structural damage), and I suppose his father decided it was a great time to make himself known. I would hear him moving around in our bathroom when no one was in it and I could smell his cigarettes in the living room. I of course didn't tell my landlord this, because I'm not about to freak him out and tell him his dad's spirit is just hanging out in the house. Then I started seeing other figures in the house. Kids to ceiling tall figures, found out they've been coming from the restroom (yay, portal!), and I basically blocked off all the mirrors that were causing the problem. Now we just have the landlord's father, a spirit I adopted named Danny (died in the 30s saving his wife and kid from a house fire), and an accidentally adoption of Rachel (she came with some depression glass I bought).
