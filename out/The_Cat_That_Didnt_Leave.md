When Momo died, the emptiness in my life was overwhelming. She wasn’t just a cat – she was a part of me, a loyal companion who had been by my side through everything. The moment I took her to the vet to end her suffering was unbearable. The first few nights without her were quiet, too quiet. It felt like I was surrounded by a vast emptiness. But then, something strange started happening.

On the first night after her death, I felt it – a faint pressing down on the mattress, as if Momo was kneading the bed beside me with her paws, just like she always did. I thought it was just the grief playing tricks on my mind, the memory of her movements still fresh in my mind. But the sensation didn’t go away. It lingered.

The second night, it was stronger. The feeling of paws pressing into the mattress, kneading and shifting the fabric, was unmistakable. It wasn’t the subtle weight of a cat lying down – it was the clear, familiar motion of a cat working her paws into the bed, preparing her spot. I turned around quickly, expecting to see her there. But the bed was empty. No cat. I got up and searched the room, but there was nothing. My heart raced, but I tried to calm myself. Maybe Luna, the other cat, had come in. But when I switched on the light, Luna wasn’t there. The room felt unnervingly still.

The third night was worse. The sensation of paws pressing down, kneading the mattress, grew stronger. It was as if something was actively moving, shifting the bed around as Momo used to do. I heard the faint sound of claws scratching, the familiar noise of a cat adjusting her position. But when I turned on the light, the room was still empty. There was no one there, just the oppressive silence.

On the fourth night, the feeling became almost unbearable. I could feel the pressure of invisible paws kneading into the mattress beside me, working the fabric in a slow, deliberate rhythm. The sensation was so real that I could almost hear the soft, steady sound of claws pushing into the bed, just like Momo used to do when she was settling in for the night. My heart pounded as I looked around, searching for any sign of her. But there was nothing. No Momo, no Luna, just the chilling emptiness of the room.

Then, it happened. The pressure on the mattress became almost unbearable, the paws pressing deeper, more urgently, as if something was trying to make itself at home. I turned to the side where I felt the strongest impression, my breath quickening. With a trembling voice, I whispered, "Are you back?" But when I opened my eyes, what I saw made my blood freeze in my veins.

It wasn’t Momo. It was something else. Something darker, more sinister. In the corner of my vision, a twisted, shadowy figure emerged, its outline flickering in the dim light. And then I saw it – a grin. A horrible, diabolical grin that stretched unnaturally wide, as though it had been carved into the darkness itself. The grin wasn’t human, nor was it animal. It was something monstrous, something that didn’t belong in this world. Its teeth gleamed, sharp and jagged, and its eyes glowed with a cold, empty malevolence.

I didn’t even think. I sprang out of bed and ran, my heart racing in terror. I didn’t dare look back, the sound of my own breathing drowning out everything else. I bolted out of the room, slamming the door behind me, and collapsed against the wall. My mind was a whirlwind, trying to process what I had seen, but nothing made sense.

The next day, I couldn’t bring myself to enter that room. I cleared it out and turned it into a guest room, hoping to distance myself from the terrifying events that had unfolded. I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping in there again, knowing what had happened. But still, something lingered. An unsettling presence that I couldn’t shake. Even though the room was empty, I felt it – the sensation of something waiting, something still lingering in the air, as if it hadn’t fully left.

I don’t sleep in that room anymore. The door remains closed, the room untouched. I’ve tried to ignore it, but the feeling is still there. Something is in that room. Something that pretends to be familiar, something that can mimic Momo’s movements, but it’s not her. It never was.

And I will never be able to explain it. What I saw that night – that smile, that presence – will remain a mystery, one I can’t forget. I avoid the guest room now, though part of me is always aware of the strange, lingering feeling that remains. It’s as if the creature is still there, waiting, watching, just out of sight. And I can’t help but wonder: What was it? And why does it never truly leave?
