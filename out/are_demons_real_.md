 

It was a hot Sunday afternoon when I got a phone call from my friend Marcus. He told me had found an abandoned house in the middle of the forest with satanic signs written all over it. He asked me if I wanted to check the place  out  , which I replied with the answer no. I was grounded for a week by parents after they found me watching hardcore porn , something they didn't take a liking too. 

Marcus kept on insisting till I eventually agreed,  he told me that we should meet up at the corner store at midnight.  My parents were going to q party they had been invited to so the  only people in the house was me and my brother who was two years older. My brother had his girlfriend comeover so he didn't mind if I sneaked out . When it was 11:45 I got out of my house and walked to  the corner store where I saw a group of teenagers with Marcus in the middle.  They were all wearing dark clothing so I could  barely see the number  of the people  there . When I got closer the number looked to be about 13 with Marcus included

When I arrived Marcus told me that we would be going with them , something I did not mind at all. He guided us off the gravel road of the street and into a pathway that lead into the forest.  The pathway was long and narrow . We had walked almost 30 minutes when we reached a passage. We had to bend down to crawl through due the fact the passage collapsed.  When we reached the other side we saw a small white house in the distance . Behind the house was a large satanic pentagram drawn on it. One of the guys in group pulled out a crowbar  and Started pulling the lock on the house.  After a few batters on the lock it eventually broke. We all flooded into the house to see what was inside. 

The floors were decorated with newspaper with blood splattered all over them , there was an idol placed in the middle of the room . The sight of the doll placed in the corner of room gave me creeps , it was one of barbie dolls but life size . No when I think about it could've been a sex doll. One of the boys in the group was freaking telling everyone he wants go back home. I found it funny he was freaking out till a large bang  throughout the forest.  I opened the door to see a man with a gun with  a gun  in his hand walking towards the house.  I told the group what was happening before I sprinted out the house turning back to pathway.  Behind me I could hear another gunshot being fired.  In the corner of my eye I could see Marcus catching up with me. 

We both rushed to the  pathway crawling through there as fast as possible.  . In my state of panic I jumped over the wall of my neighbors house to seek shelter. I stayed down and waited for  a while.  Adrenaline was pumping throughout my body , I was shaking like crazy anyone who saw could of that I was having a seizure. One more gun shot rang . I crawled up to gate and peeked to see the man walking back into the forest. At that moment I thanked God,  for  saving me. Marcus called me and told me to go back to the corner store so everyone could meet up. The time was 2 :56 everyone was trying to catch their breath from what happened.  Some were excited and some  scared shirtless while  I was confused on why that man was there.
