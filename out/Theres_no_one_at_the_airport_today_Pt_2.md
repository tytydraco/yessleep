***

I didn’t leave the airport.
 
I’m not sure why some of you suggested this. Where would I go? I can’t even remember where my car is or *if* my car is. And, more importantly, I need to go home. I have to fly. Don’t you understand? What else would I do? Walk? I can’t walk where I’m going. 
 
But the man in the Patagonia quarter-zip—I managed to slip him for now. I’m not sure what his issue is. Maybe it’s a psychotic break? Maybe he’s been here too long? Was he excited to see me? I don’t know. It didn’t look like excitement in his eyes when he lunged towards me. They were empty. Hollow. He was staring right through me.
 
I still hear him, though. He’s here. I can hear his humming. But it’s coming over the loudspeaker now, wrapped in a thin blanket of crackling static.
 
*Dum da dum dum dum. Dum da dum da dum dum.*
 
Over and over again. It’’s all I can hear. What if I miss a flight announcement? What if my flight is delayed? His incessant humming is beginning to grate. I feel anxious.
 
Some of you suggested this might be a dream, but that seems silly. I mean, it’s true that my vision has that bit of fuzziness around the edges and—oddly—I can’t make out any numbers. When I look at the flight information screen I can clearly see the various arrivals and departures, but the flight numbers and times are a blur. Squinting doesn’t help. This is a problem. What gate am I at?

Still, I pinched myself. I splashed water on my face. I looked in the mirror in the bathroom—slipping in after I was sure the man in the Patagonia quarter-zip was gone—and saw myself. I must be awake. I know this isn’t a dream.

So, I’ve taken to wandering around the terminal. Not a soul. Not a soul at all…except for that humming over the loudspeaker. I imagine I’ll see someone eventually. A flight will arrive, the passengers will disembark, and then everything will be back to normal. But I’m still nervous about the status of my own flight.
 
Nothing a phone call can’t fix.

My airline’s customer service department will get me sorted.
 
Dial tone.
 
Dial tone.
 
Ah, there it is, some smooth, jazzy muzak. Not bad.
 
*Thank you for calling **garbled** Airlines. Your satisfaction is important to us. This call may be monitored for quality control purposes. One moment please.*
 
“Hello…” Someone answered, their voice is distant, drifting off.
 
“Um, yes, hi, I’m just trying to check on the status of my flight to—”
 
“Oh, yes. It’s right on time.”
 
“Well, wait, I didn’t tell you—oh, you can look it up based on my phone number?”
 
“Yes, yes. It’s right on time.”

“Could you tell me the exact boarding time?”
 
“It’s right on time. Don’t you worry. Right. On. Time.”
 
“Okay, yes, I understand, but what time is that, exactly?”
 
“Ba dum da dum dum dum. Ba dum da dum de dum.”
 
It was him.
 
“Ba dum ba dum ba dum dum. Ba dum dum dum.”
 
The audio crackled.
 
“Ba dum dum ba dum ba dum dum.”
 
My voice wavered, “Stop it, okay? I just need to know my boarding time.”
 
“Ba dum dum ba dum ba dum dum.”
 
“Stop it!”
 
The humming grew louder, more defiant, “**BA DUM BA DUM BA DUM DUM DUM**.”
 
“You’re insane. Leave me alone.”
 
Just as I was about to hang up, I heard the man chuckle. It was a long, dry laugh, followed by a short, low whisper, “*Gonna get ya*.”
 
Click.
 
Shaking. Nervous. But I didn’t have much time to react. A plane had just arrived. Gate 11. Perfect timing. I think this might even be my flight. The rest of the airfield is completely deserted. I don’t even see those little carts that the workers drive around in. Nothing but fractured cement as far as I can see. And the sky’s a little odd today. It’s quite overcast. And orange. Like the sun is illuminating the clouds from behind.
 
A woman!

I didn’t see where she came from, but there she was, standing behind the desk by Gate 11, diligently tapping away at a screen.
 
I ran up to her just as the humming resumed over the loudspeaker. “Excuse me, is this the flight to--?”
 
“Home?” She smiled at me with a perfectly crisp row of veneers. “Of course. You’re right on time. Please, this way.” She gestured to the open vestibule door.
 
Oddly enough, she followed me through the door, humming slowly as we walked along the boarding bridge. It was long. The red and gold patterned rug seemed to stretch on forever. Why were there so many turns? At various points, I looked back over my shoulder and was greeted by the attendant’s smiling visage.
 
“This way, please. You’re right on time.” She was walking quickly, gesturing out in front of us, down the winding bridge.
 
I felt queasy walking, as though the passageway was twisting and stretching beneath my feet. At one point, we turned yet another corner onto a long straightaway. At the end, I could finally see the thick airplane door. Despite seeming so far away, we appeared to close the gap in a matter of steps.
 
The attendant quickly ushered me inside, “Enjoy your flight. You’re right on time. You’ll be home soon.”
 
I walked into an empty plane. Completely deserted. I opened my mouth, turning to address the woman, but she had already closed the door. I shrugged. Well, I made it, didn’t I? Might as well sit down and wait for takeoff. So I walked a few aisles back and made my self comfortable near a window seat. I leaned down to look outside. The sky still looked strange, like the clouds were about to burst into an inferno. And it was oddly quiet, all I could hear was the steady hissing of the air jets above each seat.
 
I leaned back, finally able to relax. But just as I was putting my headphones in I heard it. From maybe a few rows behind me.


 *Ba dum ba dum ba dum. Ba da dum ba da dum dum.*
 
The humming.

The man in the Patagonia quarter-zip.
 
He was here too.
 
I felt the plane jerk back, pulling away from the terminal.
 
*Ba dum ba dum ba dum. Ba da dum ba da dum de dum dum.*
 
I just want to go home.


Can you help me get there?
