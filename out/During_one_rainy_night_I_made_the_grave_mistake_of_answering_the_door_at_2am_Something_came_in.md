This is a story about a simple word and a complex world. I do not know of anyone who does not say that word at least one time in a day, since we as humans all agree to at least one thing we are asked for during the day. You might have guessed it by now, the word I am referring to is yes. My grandmother Margaret is a really spiritual person, someone who I was never ready to become. When I lived with her at some point in my life, she used to give me all kinds of tips on how to avoid getting into trouble with evil spirits, like really. It took what happened in this story for me to realize that our old family members do not just ramble on about weird things because they are old, superstitious, or just want to talk. There is a lot of wisdom imparted at each time they open their mouths.

"Scott, listen carefully." My grandmother would quietly say when she was about to start with her advices.

'Here we go again!' I would think, bracing myself for what I considered a long moment of absolute boredom.

One of those long speeches revolved around the word yes. What is yes? Let us not bore ourselves with a long definition from a dictionary. Simply put, it is a word used to express agreement. The question is agreement to what? This is where another word comes in: solicitation. Once again, simply put, the act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone. Fresh out my browser.

You know, according to my grandmother, the spiritual world is a scary place where you cannot allow yourself to act, talk or even walk like you would usually do. It is a strange place overlapping the reality we all know, populated by many dangerous supernatural beings, which number is greater than the earth's population. It is a cruel world, filled with deceptive evil spirits, happening to be masters of seemingly innocent solicitations. When your phone rings for example, it is a form of solicitation, however, in the spiritual world it is perceived as a worded question: are you there? Are you available? Are you alone? May I hurt you? May I kill you? Just any question. Therefore, if you answer yes hulloh, what exactly are you agreeing to with that yes?

This is why my grandmother forbid me to answer yes when I pick up the phone, when someone calls my name, especially if I only hear the person, or other situations that seem so natural after all. I never really cared about all her advices until July 2022 during one rainy night.

After an intense gym session earlier, I had completely forgotten about something I had left outside and I had to retrieve it at around 2am after remembering about it. What exactly was the thing? I cannot recall, but I remember shaking it after closing but not locking the door behind me, and that is when I heard it: three gentle knocks, so gentle they could have been made by a child. Who could that be at such time? I thought.

"Scott?" I heard a woman call from behind the door, immediately followed by three soft knocks.

"Yeah, who's that? Jodie?" I called, thinking it could be my girlfriend.

Goosebumps invaded my arms and back, and a strange dread took hold of my mind. You know, it is said that we humans, just like animals, can sense danger on the spot. The advices from my grandmother flooded my brain and I trembled at the realization that the knocks, especially, were a solicitation and I just agreed to something with a casual yeah.

Something pushed the door open and all I could see at first was the transparent frame of a person under the rain. I then saw the wet and muddy footprints of an invisible person entering the house and stopping at some distance. I released what I was holding, and slowly looked up, trembling and trying to see the face of the entity standing before me, when I suddenly heard heavy running footsteps rushing towards me. I dashed to my room, opened the window and found myself out of the house in a few seconds.

I came back around one hour later with the police but all we could find were the wet and muddy footprints of the entity literally scattered around the house, and in all the rooms, all the walls, on the ceiling, just everywhere. Every door and window had been left open but nothing was stolen. I might have been skeptical up to that night but I was not crazy enough to continue staying there. Following the advice of my grandmother Margaret and even of one of the police officers, I moved the next day.

What do you think of all that? I am curious to know. Maybe this is just one more banal scary story on the internet, right? Well, I have a little solicitation in my mind that I will not tell you about, but I would like to type yes in the comment section. After all, if you do not believe about all that, what can possibly happen to you if you just type yes?
