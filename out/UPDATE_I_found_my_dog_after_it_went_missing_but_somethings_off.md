Honestly I haven’t been feeling great, I’ve been bed bound due to my ever increasing crippling anxiety. Strange things keep happening and I don’t know how to explain any of it. 
I have to go home tomorrow, my parents are getting quite annoyed over these ‘delusions’ as they call them, and want me to help out with a few things around the house, as they are doing it up a bit. 

I’ve been hearing screaming at night, not the kind from a fox or human, its a sickening, blood curdling kind of scream. The kind that would keep you up in the late hours of the night to early morning, listening closely for any slight movements. Making sure that all the windows and doors are locked, in fear of what might lurking behind it. 

On top of this locked doors around my friends house are somehow unlocking themselves. My friend keeps telling me I’m just forgetting to lock them, even she thinks all of this is going too far now, and keeps expressing how worried she is about me. 

I don’t think I’ve slept properly for a whole week now, dark circles have sunken the skin beneath my eyes, and now whenever I look in the mirror I don’t recognise myself, I look ill and malnourished, I haven’t looked this bad in years, people around me are starting to think I’m having another psychotic break. 

I’ve done some research into skinwalkers, as it had been suggested to me in my last post. All of my experiences as of late are adding up to that, but still I’m sceptical, well was skeptical... till now. I thought the only way to find out the truth, was to try and lure out this skinwalker, if thats even what it is. 

I was up late researching last night, many blogs said that whistling at night attracts them, as well as saying their name, so I did just that.

 Do I regret it? Yes.

I would do anything to take back what I did only moments ago.

So now, I feel like the only option I have, is to come on here and ask for help. 

I saw it. I saw it’s face. It’s horrific face.
I looked almost human, but not, and its eyes… they made my heart sink, my breath caught in my throat, all I could do was stare right into these cold lifeless eyes. I have never seen anything like this creature, it was tall and bony, it looked almost lifeless. I was terrified, too scared to move or breathe, It was like I was glued in place. I managed to pull myself away and quickly run into the house, locking all the doors and windows as fast as I could. 

My friend is out at the moment, so I am all alone. I can hear rustling outside the house and the occasional scratch on the wall. It’s waiting me out. 

One thing I do know for sure now though, is that that thing, is the same thing pretending to be my dog.
