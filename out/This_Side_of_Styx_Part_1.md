Darkness...real goddamn diabolical darkness exists. You'd understand too if you had seen it looking at you from underneath the crack of a door - eyes bulging like to balloons pressured to bursting and what remaining teeth cracking and breaking.

The sad reality is that I have forgotten my wife's face and her voice; but, twenty-six years later, I still remember every detail of that goddamn thing. If I could forget it, I would.

Good riddance.

But duty and a promise to the man who helped me stop it the first time prevents me from doing that. It has a new herald - I've seen the signs - and one of you is that creature's marked one. So, I am diving back into that horrible night so that maybe you will recognize the signs in yourself. If you do, contact me. We will step over the river together.

“Do you believe in darkness, sheriff? In my younger years, I believed in the undeniable truth that darkness and light coexisted, woven into the very atoms of the universe. There was good and there was bad. Period. And, if a person could but walk the straight and narrow path, they could be considered a hero in their own right. After all, that was what made me idolize those flights of fancy printed colorfully on pulp pages.”

I sighed, dragging on my Camel and the cigarette was half ash already. The old lady wouldn’t have liked me smoking again, but under the circumstances, I think she would have understood.

I stared at the tape recorder in my hand, avoiding the photos in the file. I couldn’t look at them again. Instead, I took another puff of the cancer mist before exhaling.

Yeah, Betsy *would* have understood.

I crushed the cigarette onto a newspaper clipping of the so-called miracle doctor - then lit another.

“It was not until I was older that I found the shadow between the two -the gray, if you prefer- was a much more prevalent state than light and darkness, good and bad, or hero and villain. But now? Now I am convinced that I was incorrect. Darkness, true darkness exists. You will see it, sheriff, between the stars, deep beneath the waves, and in the hearts of even those you claim as innocent. There are no ‘victims;’ just lesser shadows overpowered and consumed by a greater blackness.”

*Clcck*

“Goddamn monster,” I grumbled to myself before setting the recorder on my desk. It was a device wholly outdated, but the town barely paid my salary.

Miracle man of the valley.

Everyone in Styx knew of or knew the doctor. He was a bright spot that brought attention to a sleepy town where the buildings and people were slowly aging into oblivion. Unfortunately, now it looked as if his reputation was about to grow and so would the attention on my small little town.

I looked at the monitor. The grainy TV feed didn’t hide the doctor’s stare. His eyes, sharp despite the blur, seemed to lock onto mine through the screen. There was a sharp, salty smell all of the sudden.

I shivered with the chill traveling down my spine.

Still looking directly at the camera, the doctor smiled with his perfect pearl white teeth and took a sip of water from the paper cup before crumpling it in his hands. The jingle of his cuffs and chains filled the small room and was loud enough that I heard it through the paper thin wall next to me.

“Sheriff Grady,” he called in a singsong voice loud enough to be heard through the wall, “smoking is a filthy habit.”

I sighed and rubbed my temples, ready to be done with the shrink. The state trooper couldn’t get here soon enough. I had fourteen peaceful years as sheriff without anything more dangerous than the McCaffery boys drinking, driving, and smashing mailboxes with a bat. Now? Now there was blood in the water; sharks were circling toward us with press passes and cameras; and bodies were piled into a grotesque mound in the morgue beneath my feet.

“You aren’t gonna go back in there, are ya?” Henry asked from the kitchen doorway, voice low. At least, I hoped it was low enough.

Henry walked across my office, which was little more than the kitchen of the converted house that contained both my “office” on the first floor as well as the town mortuary in the basement. As the mortician and backup deputy whenever I needed it, Henry knew the doctor’s handiwork probably better than me.

Henry leaned against the teal painted cabinetry and yanked bloodied rubber gloves off his hands before. He had been hard at work on the Johnson boy’s body. Or what was left of it after the doctor had finished with it.

“The coffee is stale,” he said to me, but that didn’t stop Henry from drinking it.

“Heat it up, then.”

“No reason,” Henry replied, downing the remainder of the mug like a shot. “I doubt we’re getting any warmth tonight.”

I just grunted and pulled out the old Jack from my desk. He held his cup up for some, and we made a silent toast to the dismembered boy below.

I shivered and wrinkled my nose at the smell of an incoming tide.

“You get anything out of him?”

“Nothing useful.” I blackened the other eye in the clipping with the cigarette butt before using Henry’s empty mug as my ashtray. “The good Dr. E. J. Christiansen is a narcissist. He talks like he wants to be one of those killers getting interviews on the evening news.”

Dr. Christiansen spoke like what my pa would have called ‘a damnable flapping asshole of a pretentious prick.’ One of my father’s pearls of wisdom would have made me smile in other circumstances. Not now.

Either way, it was as if the miracle doctor seemed to hope his over-familiarity with an earmarked thesaurus might make him a little less forgettable. But he could throw all the fancy words and phrases he wanted into this diatribe, but I planned to forget Dr. Christiansen as soon as the man was stuffed into the darkest corner the county jail had to offer. The inmates would take care of the child murderer after that.

At least, I hoped so.

I looked at the TV showing the doctor who was still handcuffed and chained in the “interrogation” room. That room used to be a kid’s bedroom. Now a monster sat inside it. That wasn’t lost on me.

“Any news on how long the staties would take to get here?” I asked.

Henry shook his head and said, “Not a peep. But it might have to do with the buster of a storm we got brewing out there.”

“Storm?” I strained my ears, but it seemed quiet outside.

“Been all over the local radio,” Henry responded. “Popped up out of nowhere and is raging in Helena. Already killed two at least.”

“Someone we know?”

“Old Henderson and his boy coming back from fishing.”

“Damn.”

“Swept them and their truck right down the edge of the valley and wrapped them around a tree,” Henry said. “Probably wouldn’t have been known about neither if Clive hadn’t been a couple of hundred yards behind them. Said it was like a giant hand had swatted them off the road like a fly. Told Clive they would have to store the bodies in the Helena butcher freezer. We don’t have the room.”

“Damn,” I repeated dumbly before lighting another cigarette. More bodies of people I knew growing cold before the sun set on that awful day.

“A torrent is approaching, Sheriff Grady,” the untouched cassette recorder played, making us jump. “The depths are rising, and not even Noah’s vessel would endure what has awakened.”

“Christ,” I hissed, feeling my heart pounding and what little hair I had left standing on end. I smashed the stop button angrily. “Piece of junk.”

“Is all well, Sheriff Grady?” the doctor called through the wall. I looked at the TV and saw that he was smiling ear-to-ear.

“Bastard,” I growled. I stood and popped my back before picking up the recorder and Colt 1911. “Well, if this storm is as bad as you say, I might as well get the rest of the interrogation done.”

“Leave it for the staties, Grady.”

“The quicker the damn doctor confesses, the quicker he can see the chair,” I told him, holstering the pistol in my side sling. “I don’t have anywhere else to be, but you go home to Kris and the boys.”

“Leave you here alone with him? Not a chance,” Henry scoffed. “Besides, her mother is there to help with the twins. Kris won’t be alone.”

I nodded, happy that I wouldn’t be solo for this even if I was too hard headed to admit it to Henry. The idea of it just being the doctor and me was terrifying. If I’m being honest, that was one reason I had stopped the interview short earlier. Even having Henry only a flight of stairs away was too far when I had to sit across from a demon wearing a muddied, bloodied suit.

Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the file and returned to my seat across from the doctor. After flipping the cassette in the recorder and clicking in two buttons, I looked up at the doctor. He was smirking at me.

I wanted to hit him. Hard.

Leaning forward, I enunciated clearly, “June 13th, 6:52 p.m. Continuing interview of Dr. Emmanuel Judah Christiansen.” With the preamble out of the way, I sat back and sighed. “Where were we?”

“Are you well, Tom?”

“Sheriff,” I snapped like a whip. “It’s Sheriff Grady to you, Christiansen.”

The doctor sucked on his teeth before giving a deep chuckle. Predatory. He was the cat. I the mouse. Watching me with those hungry eyes, the doctor tapped on the table with long, thin fingers. They were the fingers of a city boy, clean and pristine, that had never seen an ounce of hard, manual work.

Until today. Until the butchery of the Johnson boy.

I was sick to my stomach and avoided looking at the closed file now on the table.

“I apologize, Sheriff Grady,” the doctor said with a surprising amount of warmth. “I was under the mistaken perception that we were on a first name basis after all the conversations we had after your lovely wife…”

“Stay on topic, doctor,” I snapped at the bastard shrink. “You already admitted to killing the Johnson boy-”

“Denying it would have been futile given the blood on my hands.”

“-his parents, and three others who tried to detain you. So, now I just need to know why,” I finished, ignoring his interruption.

“Why.” Christiansen nodded as he said the word. A look of deep thought gave him the appearance of serenity, which I admit shook me more than I’d have liked. The monster felt no remorse for what he did.

“Yes, *why*?” I repeated. I swallowed the bile building in the back of my throat. “*Why* did you take Ryan Johnson, a boy of twelve, and impale him with a meat hook? *Why* did you wrap his intestines around his throat like a noose? *Why* did you fill his stomach with sea salt and brine? *Why* cut out his tongue? His eyes? *Why* carve that symbol into his forehead? *Why* is a demon like you alive and that little boy lies on the slab next to his parents? Why?”

My voice had been rising till it had turned into a deep roar, and it wasn’t until the last word that it had returned to a normal level. That was a lie.  In truth, my tone was no longer a battle cry for justice. Instead, it was a whimper of hopeless desolation.

I felt sweat dripping down my forehead and neck. Realizing I was standing, I took a deep breath and sat back into my chair. In the commotion, I failed to notice that the doctor held something in his long, slender fingers.

How?

Looking quickly at the closed file, I found it open and the crime scene polaroid of the body no longer hidden behind witness statements. I looked back at the monster across the table from me. How had he done that?

Impossible as it was given the only water within two hundred miles was the lake, I was in that moment overwhelmed by the smell of seawater.

He was humming a haunting tune as his dark eyes searched the photo like it held a hidden truth. Maybe it did. I wondered if the question of “why” would be answered if he found it.

“Why,” the doctor said slowly before looking up to meet my eyes.

There was a moment where I felt the leviathan presence ready to drag me down and then…it was gone.

In a brief flash, the doctor’s eyes widened in alarm, tears formed in his eyes, and his chest heaved with panicked breaths. “Why is this happening to me?!”

I slid back my chair from the table as the doctor lunged to his feet. Luckily, his chains that were linked to the iron loop drilled into the floor did their job, and he fell back into his chair hard enough to upset it. The doctor went sprawling on the ground in a whimpering mess as blood dripped onto the hardwood from where the cuffs had tore skin.

“Christ damn, shit damn bastard!” I said as I fumbled the Colt from its holster, leveling it with shaking hands.

“Help me, Tom,” he cried from where he lay. The doctor’s bloodied fingers crinkled the picture, and he began smashing his forehead into the floor. Whack, whack, whack.

“Jesus, Grady!” Henry said, shouldering me as he rushed from the door to the doctor. “Help me before he kills himself!”

I dropped the pistol onto the table and darted forward, grabbing the doctor’s other arm and yanking his torso back to keep him from concussing himself further. Henry growled and had to readjust his grip from the slippery blood dripping down the doctor’s arms. At the same time, I hooked one arm under the doctor’s arm and gripped the collar of the tattered suit jacket with my other hand. Even with both of us, the doctor was able to repeat his headlong assault against the floor two more times.

“Calm down!”

“Kill me!” the doctor cried, spitting teeth and slop from his bloody mouth. “Kill me before *he* takes me again!”

Darkness.

The lights in the rooms flicked off completely. The air conditioning unit circulating the stale salty atmosphere through the vents had gone quiet, and I heard the blaring of the tornado sirens echoing through our small town. A moment later, the emergency lights kicked on as the generator in the morgue below took over.

Bathed in the yellow glow, the doctor went limp in our hands, his bloodied fingers still clutching the crumpled photo. Henry and I barely had time to catch our breath before the stench hit - wet sand, rotting wood, the stink of something dredged from the deep.

There was a sound of static before the radio in the kitchen cut on with the broadcast warning: “-baffling as it is, a cyclone seems to be forming overhead. Scientists are at a loss but warn residents that the high winds and flooding-”

Then came a *snap*\*\*.\*\*

The doctor was motionless except for his hands, which were contorting into every shape imaginable. There was a sickening, wet crunch as one hand slithered free from the cuff, skin peeling, bones crushed to a bag of meat and broken bone. The other pulled against its shackle, tearing flesh down to the gleaming white beneath.

 Heavy wind hissed through spaces in the attic like a death whistle, and a loud growl of thunder or something worse shook the building.

The doctor moved.

Defying all logic, he was able to launch from our grasps, striking and destroying a leg of the table like a matchstick. It collapsed on top of him with the paperwork detailing his heinous acts scattering around the room.

His face concealed from our view by the wooden tabletop, the doctor seemed to collect himself. When he spoke again, the previous emotion had been replaced by an incredibly cold pressure.

“Why, you ask, Sheriff Grady,” he chuckled from beneath the table debris. “The answer to your ‘why’ is twofold. First, happenstance and fortune delivered anguished Ryan to my door while necessity and devotion carved him with the knife.”

I reached for my colt but found the holster empty. “Fuck.”

In the emergency light, the doctor’s body twisted unnaturally. His legs flopped uselessly, as if the bones inside no longer obeyed him. His torso corkscrewed and snapped, leaving his waist to be the divide between where his back stopped and his groin began.

I gulped in horror as his bone-pulped hand flopped against the side of the tabletop more liquid than solid, but still gripping, still pulling. Pieces of white poked through the skin, leaving tiny faucets of blood across its surface.

Despite the ruined hand, he still managed to drag himself forward.

“Holy hell!” Henry gasped, staggering backwards until his back slammed against the wall.

“The second reason why…their screams were a symphony to me.”

The voice was different now - richer, layered, with something old echoing beneath it. The doctor’s eyes glinted as he pulled himself further into the light, his lips peeling back in a grin.

“Steel yourself, Sheriff. You prodded the abyss.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “And here… here there be monsters.”

The doctor let out a sharp, barking cackle that made my body go cold and my jaw lock. I was up in an instant and Henry was right behind me, pushing down against me to get farther ahead in his flight.

On all fours, like a dog, I scrambled toward the door. A bullet pierced the wall directly above me, but my mad dash allowed me to escape into the hallway beyond. As soon as I got to the other side, Henry slammed the door shut and threw the locks closed.

Another shot was followed by the doctor’s maniac cackle; but the second was much more damaging to us than the first since it only embedded itself into the thick oaken door. As for me, I pushed myself to my feet and rushed toward the front door. Throwing it open, I was met with an insurmountable torrent of wind and rain.

The hurricane was on our doorstep with all of its fury. The rain hit like needles and the wind lifted me off my feet. The flood lights shown with all their might against the oppressive darkness, and I could just barely make out my Ford and Henry’s Corolla at the edge of it, but both vehicles went rolling as a powerful gust drove through.

With my heart in my boots, I put all my weight behind the door and closed it. The sound of the storm muffled somewhat but that just made it easier to hear the doctor singing a shanty in the room deeper in the battered house.

*“Oh, the black tide swells and the dead men call,*

*Through waters cursed where no stars fall.*

*A shadow stirs in the fathoms deep,*

*Where lost souls wail and the drowned ones creep.”*

The doctor let out a gravelly laugh that gnawed away at my soul. Taking a deep breath, I walked slowly down the dark hallway toward the light coming from the kitchen. Each step seemed to drive my stomach deeper into my chest but better to be in the light…or that’s what I told myself.

Henry was sitting at the table with his head between his hands. Hearing me approach, the younger man looked up at me with the same panic that was undoubtedly plain on my own face. I took the seat across from him even as we both still heard the doctor singing in the next room.

*“A thousand arms, all slick with grime,*

*They grasp and pull beyond all time,*

*No prayers nor steel can cut them free,*

*Once ye’re caught, ye cease to be!”*

That is when I saw the doctor’s finger snake through the bullet hole and begin chipping away at the drywall.

The monster was coming, and it sang:

*“Some are torn and ground to meat,*

*Some are swallowed, whole and sweet,*

*Some go mad and leap below,*

*Laughin’ as the black tides flow!”*
