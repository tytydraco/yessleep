I always considered myself normal. Normal job, normal family, normal friends. But when my new roommate moved in, I never felt so far from normal before.

She was strange in her own way. Odd outbursts over the smallest things, and that peculiar dance she did whenever something went her way. Meeting her changed my life, but not for the better.

Ever since she moved in, my other roommate (let’s call him R) and I had this uneasy feeling about her, like she was hiding something. And we weren’t wrong. Late at night, after a long day at work, all I wanted was to lay down and sleep, but then I’d hear it—the relentless grinding of meat. It was her again. For some reason, she thought 3 a.m. was the perfect time for it.

I tried to confront her once, but every time I brought it up, she’d look at me with those sad eyes. They were too genuine to be manipulative, like I’d really hurt her by asking her not to do it so late.

So I forced myself to ignore it. Eventually, it stopped, and I didn't have to confront her again. But it had been happening for weeks, starting almost as soon as she moved in.

I never considered myself easily scared. Fear wasn’t something I felt often—unless, of course, it was the fear of being chased by a killer or tortured. But I do know what fear looks like in someone else’s eyes.

She had been with us for a year now, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that my best friend/roommate was scared of her—or maybe just very dependent on her. I couldn’t tell. Every time I mentioned one of her strange habits, like her revolving door of partners who all left abruptly, or how she was unnervingly loud, he’d get this terrified look. Yet, whenever he was upset, he’d run to her, not me. When we hung out, he’d insist on including her or FaceTiming her to make her feel included.

Something was off. He was scared of her, but also attached. It was confusing. Maybe she was using him, but I had no proof. Why was he so scared of her? And why was he so dependent on her? It made no sense. Maybe I should just ask her about it. What could go wrong, right?

I couldn’t stand it any longer. One night, I finally asked Her what she was doing to R. She just looked at me with those wide, innocent eyes and denied everything. It was like talking to a doll, a lifeless puppet.

After that, her behavior grew even stranger—especially around me. She stopped pretending to be normal. It was like she didn't care anymore. She’d sit in the living room for hours, staring at the wall, her face devoid of any emotion.

One evening, I came home to find Her sitting on the couch, her head tilted at an unnatural angle, staring blankly. R wasn’t home yet. As I walked past her, she spoke without turning her head. “You shouldn’t pry into things that don’t concern you.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What do you mean?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

She just smiled, a cold, mechanical smile, and continued staring at the wall. The next few days, I noticed small things—my belongings moved, my bed slightly rumpled as if someone had been sitting on it, and the persistent feeling of being watched.

One night, I woke up to the sound of something scratching at my door. I crept out of my room and found her standing in the hallway, her movements jerky and unnatural. “Ella?” I called out, my voice shaky.

She turned slowly, her eyes lifeless. “Go back to bed. You don’t want to see what happens next.”

My blood ran cold. I retreated to my room and locked the door, my mind racing. What was happening? What had I gotten myself into?

The following morning, R seemed even more distant. He wouldn’t meet my eyes and flinched at the slightest sound. I tried to talk to him, but he brushed me off, saying he was just tired.

As days turned into weeks, her behavior became more erratic. She’d leave strange, cryptic notes in my room, and I’d find her lurking in the shadows, watching me with those unnerving eyes. R’s fear grew more palpable, and I felt like I was losing my grip on reality.

One night, I decided to record everything. I set up cameras around the apartment, hoping to catch something—anything—that would explain Her bizarre behavior. As I reviewed the footage the next morning, my heart sank. There was nothing. She never entered my room, never whispered those chilling words. Yet, the feeling of being watched, the sense of her presence, was undeniable.

I knew I had to do something, but what? Confronting her only seemed to make things worse. And R? He was slipping further away from me, deeper into her strange, unsettling world.

I realized then that whatever she was, whatever she was doing, it was far beyond anything I could understand. And I was trapped in the middle of it, helpless and terrified.
