Hey there, new guy. Yeah, you with the wide eyes and the freshly pressed uniform. Welcome to the world of late-night patrols and eerie shadows. I know you're excited to be the hero of the night, but before you go diving headfirst into the dark corners of this place, let me share a few rules with you – the unofficial Night Shift Rulebook, if you will.

*Rule #1*: **Trust Your Gut**

Do you see that flickering light down the hall? Or that strange noise that's not quite a creak but definitely not a normal sound? Trust me, your gut instincts are your best friends. If something feels off, it probably is. Investigate cautiously, but never ignore that uneasy feeling.

*Rule #2*: **Stay Awake, Stay Alive**

No, I'm not talking about chugging coffee like it's your lifeline. Well, maybe a little. The point is, that nights can be long, and boredom can creep in like a fog. But the moment you start dozing off, that's when things get interesting. So, keep yourself occupied – read, write, draw, just don't let Mr. Sandman catch you slippin'.

*Rule #3*: **Lights On, Fears Off**

Darkness is the breeding ground for all sorts of creepy crawlies – real or imagined. Keep those lights on. You might be tempted to save electricity, but believe me, it's a small price to pay for peace of mind. Shadows tend to behave themselves when there's a spotlight on them.

*Rule #4*: **Never Mess with Locked Doors**

If a door is locked and you don't have the key, consider it off-limits. Trust me, you don't want to know what's behind there. This isn't a Scooby-Doo mystery where the ghost is just a guy in a mask. Real-life doesn't come with a laugh track.

*Rule #5*: **Buddy System, Even if You're Alone**

You might be the lone wolf patrolling the premises, but that doesn't mean you can't have a virtual pack. Stay in touch with your fellow guards, share your experiences, and let them know where you are. If something goes bump in the night, it's good to have someone who understands the language of bumps.

*Rule #6*: **Keep Your Radio Close**

Your radio is your lifeline. If you see something weird, hear something strange, or just need someone to talk to because the silence is getting to you, radio it in. It's better to sound a little crazy than to end up as the next missing person's report.

*Rule #7*: **The Night Shift is Not a Horror Movie**

Sure, it might feel like you're in the middle of a horror flick, but remember, you're not here to be the sacrificial character. Don't go investigating every little noise or chasing after phantom shadows. Your job is to observe, report, and occasionally scare off the local raccoons. Leave the supernatural stuff to the professionals.

Stick to these rules, and you might just survive your stint as the night watchman. Oh, and one more thing – never, I repeat, **NEVER mess with the old, dusty book** you find in the basement. Some rules are meant to be followed, especially the unwritten ones. Good luck, and may your nights be uneventful... in a good way.
