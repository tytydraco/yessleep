Coming from a middle-class family in India all my summer vacations used to be with my grandparents and uncle. I had 2 uncles both of them unmarried at the time, my older uncle let's call him A was a real deal back in the town. He used to be a most charming man and was the town's most famous athlete our walls used to shine with all the trophies he had won over the years. Since sports isn't taken that seriously here in India as a career option, A never got a chance to pursue what he liked the most. My other uncle who will be referred to as D used to be an introvert and by used I mean he changed after that incident.

My grandparent's house was the biggest where we lived, it wasn't enormous but compared to the rest it was huge, the neighbors were great, and the neighborhood kids were one of the biggest reasons for making my summer vacations special. They all were much older than me and could have easily found some other activities to spend their summer vacations in a much more exciting way but they didn't and made sure that their 5-year-old neighbor would have a great summer at his grandparents' place. My uncles used to leave for work early morning and then it was just me, my mum, my grandpa, grandma, and granma's sis who also lived with us. My dad who didn't get many holidays used to drop us off at my grandparent's place and would return when the vacations used to come to an end. My day would go by just playing from morning to evening with my friends and later watching TV at night with my grandpa. That was it, that was my entire summer vacation which may sound boring now but looking back I am glad I made those memories cause I am scared I won't be able to make them anymore because that summer changed our lives forever.

Of all my neighbors the weirdest and for me the scariest was Ms. S. She was mentally ill and used to live with her mother and older sister. Ms.S and her sister were my mom's childhood friends and my mom had a very hard time seeing her childhood friend like this since she wasn't born with the illness but rather she somehow developed it over time. She was notorious for trying to unalive herself a couple of times but every time she failed cause she wasn't even mentally capable enough to come up with a good plan to off herself.

Uncle A used to be a very religious man, he used to go to different holy places throughout the year while Uncle D who wasn't that much into religion stayed with granparents. Uncle D only used to go to one place and that was also when me and my mom showed up during summer vacation so that there was someone to take off the elderly at home. So it was the summer of 2010 as soon as me and mom landed my uncles began packing their bags to leave. Lots of people from the neighborhood used to join such holy trips and everyone from the neighborhood used to gather around to send them off. As my uncles began leaving I started crying as I also wanted to go with them but couldn't do some reason. I stayed in the house with my grandmom consoling me telling me I could go with them next year. Suddenly I heard screaming from outside, it was Ms.S since most of us had grown familiar with that screaming. I ran outside to my mom, everyone was trying to calm down Ms.S who was having a breakdown. Suddenly my grandma's sister who was there picked me up and turned me around to wave goodbye at my uncle who was leaving as she didn't want me to witness Ms.S in such a state. But I could hear very well what she was saying, those words still haunt me to this day as they were nothing less than the inception of our nightmare. The words were "THAT FIGURE!! THAT BLACK FIGURE!! THERE HE IS, BEHIND A, *He is following him*". Everyone in the crowd was silent not knowing how to react. My mom and S's sister carried her back home. I quickly remembered that my uncles were leaving and I turned around to wave them goodbye for one last time and that's when I saw it too.

*A dark translucent eerie shadow, it wasn't even big enough to be called a figure, hovering just above Uncle A's shoulders*. I couldn't speak a word, my mouth didn't move and it was like time had frozen and all I could see was that figure following Uncle A to the bus. And I think it knew I saw it too.

Uncle A and D returned safely from the trip 2 days later. Uncle D laughed about the incident saying that Ms. S has gone completely insane and is just seeing things now. Ms. S on the other hand still hadn't gotten over that. She was still telling everyone about the shadow and how it was latched onto Uncle A. My family was worried about all this since Uncle A's marriage had been discussed around the same time. My family feared such rumors would result in the bride's family backing out and we had to tell Ms.S's family to make sure she stopped spreading this rumor. My mom on the other hand who was an even more religious woman was so impacted by this incident that she decided to visit an astrologer. She visited one near our home even after many people warned her not considering that the visit may increase her paranoia. And it sure added the salt to the wound. The astrologer straight up told her to postpone the marriage and come meet him after one month. My mom who was taken aback by the incident decided to call the girl's family and ask them for some time. Uncle A didn't care much about it either since it was an arranged marriage and he didn't have any hurry.

A week passed I was waiting for my friends to show up, it was around 5 pm when both Uncle A and D also came back from work. As I was waiting patiently, I looked above towards the road, and for a second I saw it again; hovering above the ground looking straight up at our house. But in an instant, it disappeared and the very next moment what I saw was two guys walking towards our home. The two fellows looked shaken up and whispering to each other something. They entered our home, Mom and Grandpa came towards the front and they told something to my mom after that All I remember was my mom dropping the broom she had in her hand and running inside, my grandad suddenly sat down in horror. My mom and Grandma came running as they ran towards the road to catch a taxi. My grandad also got ready and ran behind them as I followed even though my grandma's mom in tears tried to stop me.

All 4 of us reached the hospital, Uncle D was already there along with all of his and Uncle A's friends. They all were silent. Mom broke down and started asking Uncle D what had happened. Before Uncle D could explain anything a nurse came outside. She told my family that Uncle A's condition was serious and anyone who wished to see Uncle A could see go and give him a quick look even though he was unconscious. As our family walked towards the room the nurse suddenly held my hand and told my mom that it wouldn't be good for a kid to see his uncle in such a state. My mom told me to wait there with the nurse, the nurse played with me for a few seconds before she had to leave when someone called her for something.  As I was waiting there patiently my eyes wandered off to the long hospital corridor and my absolute dismay there it was again. Standing still, observing me. Again I froze, not able to move a muscle I just stood there in horror as that being slowly lifted one of its arms and pointed right at me. I wanted to run, scream, and get the hell out of that place but it was like that being had the power to freeze a person. It slowly started approaching me and I for a second thought this was the end for me but right then my mom and family walked out of the ER and took me back to the waiting area.

I kept looking back at the corridor fearing that the thing would at any moment show up again but it didn't. We found out that Uncle A had gotten into an electrical accident when he was trying to help the electricians at his company, the manager who was also at the hospital was trying to convince everyone that the electricians and he himself made sure that the main supply was off before the work started but somehow it was turned back on. My mom called my dad to tell him about the incident when suddenly the nurse approached her from the back and said "We are sorry, we couldn't". The phone dropped from her hands and she froze, the room erupted as most of them started crying. My grandma fell unconscious and my grandfather broke down. Uncle D still couldn't believe the words of the nurse and ran towards the room.

That was it, the next time I opened my eyes I was at my home. Unlike the West here in India the corpse is brought home first and then taken to the cremation center. The screams of my family and relatives echoed through our home. Everyone was devasted and unable to still digest the incident that had just unfolded. My father was on the way and the only people taking care of me were my friends it was like my entire family had also died.

Ms.S who was locked in her home was still yelling "I TOLD YOU ALL, I TOLD YOU, *His job isn't finished and he will not stop till it's finished. First D and then the child,* THOSE TWO REMAIN".  The screams of my family were enough to block hers and luckily no one heard her except me. I could see her through our kitchen window, she saw me too and asked me by using her hands whether I had eaten something, I nodded. She was smiling at me as if she still had the common sense to not scare a child but suddenly her smile vanished, her eyes fixated on something behind me she slowly started walking behind and with her hand movement asked me not to look behind. I knew it, the thing was right behind me and how did I know I was frozen again but this time with the horrifying thought- ***"Am I next?"***
