Miles shivered as he turned the page. The house was silent, save for the sound of his own breathing. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.  
He had been reading for hours, but he couldn't put the book down. It was like he was being sucked into the story. The protagonist, a man named Miles, was just like him. They had the same name, the same job, the same apartment. Even their childhoods were eerily similar.  
But there was one difference. In the book, Miles was being stalked and hunted by a mysterious figure. Miles knew that it was only a matter of time before the figure found him in the real world.  
He glanced over his shoulder, but there was no one there. He was alone. But he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.  
He took a deep breath and forced himself to focus on the book. The protagonist was closing in on the figure. He could hear the figure's footsteps getting closer. Miles could feel his heart pounding in his chest.  
The figure stepped out of the shadows. It was a tall, thin man with long, black hair and pale skin. He had cold, dark eyes that seemed to bore right through Miles.  
Miles wanted to scream, but he couldn't find his voice. He was frozen with fear.  
The figure raised its hand and pointed at Miles. "You're mine now," it said in a low, raspy voice.  
Miles felt a wave of nausea wash over him. He tried to run, but his legs wouldn't move. He was trapped.  
The figure took a step closer. Miles could smell its foul breath. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.  
But the end never came. When he opened his eyes, the figure was gone.  
Miles sat there for a long time, trying to make sense of what had just happened. He knew that it wasn't just a dream. It had been real.  
He got up and paced around his apartment. He couldn't stay here. He had to get out of there.  
He grabbed his coat and keys and headed for the door. As he stepped outside, he took a deep breath of fresh air. He felt a little bit better, but he knew that he wouldn't be truly safe until he found the figure and stopped it once and for all.  
He didn't know where to start, but he was determined to find out who the figure was and why it was after him. He knew that it wouldn't be easy, but he was willing to do whatever it took to stay alive.  
He started by going back to the bookstore where he had bought the book. He showed the clerk the book and asked if he knew anything about it. The clerk told him that the book was a new release and that it had been getting a lot of attention. He said that he had heard some people say that the book was cursed.  
Miles didn't believe in curses, but he couldn't help but wonder if there was something more to the book than met the eye. He decided to take the book back to his apartment and do some more research.  
He spent the next few days scouring the internet for any information he could find about the book or the author. He learned that the author was a reclusive man who had never given any interviews. He also learned that the book had been a huge success, but that it had been banned in several countries due to its violent and disturbing content.  
Miles was starting to feel like he was getting nowhere. He was about to give up when he came across a website that claimed to have the answers he was looking for. The website was called "The Book of Shadows" and it was dedicated to the occult and the paranormal.  
Miles clicked on the link and was taken to a page that was filled with strange symbols and occult writing. He didn't understand any of it, but he kept scrolling down.  
At the bottom of the page, he found a section that was titled "The Curse of the Book." The section contained a brief description of the book and its history. It also claimed that the book was cursed and that anyone who read it would be marked for death.  
Miles felt a chill run down his spine. He knew that he had found what he was looking for. He had found the truth about the book.
