You don't need psychedelics to see another reality. You just need your mind.

My relationship with God has never been simple. Complicated thoughts on the matter when it comes to a philosophical level, but when in fear of what is lurking in the shadows Hail Mary's will be spoken in my mother language. If i can tell you one thing that you might ponder on, it will be that what lurks in the dark is not your biggest problem, its the things that show themself to you with confidence.

Confidence should be feared from the supernatural, because it knows there is no even playing field when you find yourself shaking in front of evil incarnate.

Ive always had this connection with things unseen and unspoken. I am aware of the dangers of communication with entities that are not my equal and so it is rare for me to be convinced to reach out to them.

I am not a runner, in any meaning of the phrase, i do not run from anything. If something calls to me i will face it. Thats the problem.

A sleepover. Teenage girls talking about nothing. Until an idea is formed. A game of sorts.

My bestfriend turns to me and says, "Ever heard of red door, yellow door?", (if your an avid reddit diver you will get it)

I look at her, tears pooling at the corner of my eyes from a joke she made just prior, "If this is some bullshit youve read about online i am not messing around with that. You should know better."

She convinced me she knew how to play, as her sister had done it and nothing happened. Against my better sense i agree. My first warning should have been she didnt want to go first.

The thing about games, is that there are always rules. You have a general idea, a goal, but there are rules and limits set in place to achieve this. Just like in red door, yellow door. We played with none. We went into the game with one goal in mind. To see whats behind our eyes.

Rules we learnt after the fact, and swear to me you will follow them, never go down the only vertical direction you can move is up, if there is a staircase, latch or hole that leads down DO NOT TAKE IT. If you walk into a room and there is someone in there with you LEAVE. If there is an empty room with eyes in it SAY SOMETHING TO YOUR GUIDE.

I lay down in her lap, the lights were dimmed, and she began massaging my temples. Rhythmically saying, the chant, which i do not even wish to write after that night.

The rules outline that the guide, the person chanting, must lead you through the house. You are in a meditative state, it makes sense for the conscious individual to paint the picture for you. For safety.

I begin in a library, ive always been fond of reading, but it was different, the isles were triangles. I walk through them for sometime but realise im not getting anywhere. There are no doors to open. I tell my friend this, describing everything i can see. (A rule we did follow so we know when to wake someone up). She suggests i try to imagine a different building.

Im outside a church, a triangle monument, like a ruin of the old world. Standing alone. If it werent snowing outside i wouldnt have gone in. But it is so sickly human to seek shelter in the wreckage of Gods house. I walk in.

There are no pews, just shelves of books, the holy cross sat front and centre of the wreckage. The light from a huge glass window hitting it from behind. It felt like looking out the window at night as a child, feeling as though you were the only one awake in the entire world. A haunting solidarity, when you would question, am i frightened or at peace?

I float through the isles, like my legs dont have to hold my bodys mass, i am weightless in this world. I move my way up to the cross, i want to examine it, i want to truly feel it. As i move closer i see two staircases appear at either side of the church leading towards what seemed like singular rooms. I go left.

As i walk up these stairs, i glance down, even in my dreams i cant escape my fear of heights, and see a latch door in the place i was just standing. I would have noticed if it was there. Is that potentially a sentiment, that sometimes not knowing is better, knowing myself i would have gone down there.

I reach the top of the staircase, i open the door, focusing on my friends comforting voice and touch that feels more distant as i progress through this church.

Upon opening the door i am met with the moist void-like, white pit i have ever imagined. My eyes scan the room. An eye, something i can most closely describe as a biblical angel, is tracking my every movement.

I have not spoken in a while, and have ignored my guides relentless attempts at questioning me. I am quiet by nature when i am taking something in, so this doesnt concern her.

I can feel my throat vibrating in attempts to speak, to reply, to not leave her with the echo of her own voice but i simply cannot. I cannot leave this room. I dont want to stop staring. I dont want to stop questioning what im seeing.

She asks me one final time, "Anastazja. What do you see?"

To which she is met with, "I see nothing."

I knew i lied. I didnt choose to say that. It came out without the decision to say it. In the corner of the room there is someone standing with their back turned to me.

I remember two different things, a man in all black with a black hat. As well as a skinless, faceless creature.

I am shaken awake in that moment. Then scolded by her. If you are to ever play this 'game' you must do it with someone you can trust, who you believe knows you, because when your there you begin to forget yourself.

I admitted that i had lied to her, and told her everything i saw. Thats how she knew to pull me out.

If your friend doesnt sound like themselves, they are lying to you, WAKE THEM UP.

I still see that figure in my mind almost everyday, dont invite something in if you want it to leave.
