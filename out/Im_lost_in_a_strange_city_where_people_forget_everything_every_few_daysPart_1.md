I used to have a larger Reddit account, but I’m using this new one due to concerns I may get into later. Right now, I just want to get this out there while I can. I already had to wait two weeks to even get this device, and then it’s been over a week more of waiting in order to meet the required rules of Reddit and this sub in order to post. The next ‘reset’ could be any time now, and I don’t want to have to wait any longer to do this if I can help it. Because I’m in a rush, I might forget a few things, but I’ll do my best to get this right. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, and I’ll either respond in the comment section or address it in a future post.

So, my name is Michael, and for the past few weeks, l've been trapped in this strange city where, pretty much every couple of days, everyone suddenly passes out and forgets everything.

It doesn't matter where you are, what you're doing, who you're talking to — everything will be fine, and then there's tiredness I can't even begin to describe, this heavy feeling in every part of your body that you can't even fight, your eyelids close, and you wake up in your bed like it never even happened. I'm the only one who even seems to remember it, but I know it happens to everyone else, too. I've seen people passing out in front of me, heard them describe how they're suddenly so tired, caught them as they started to slump over, even as I was struggling to stay alert myself. But nobody remembers. Nobody remembers anything. At least, not anything that matters — not since the day I remember waking up here for the first time.

I don't even know how I got here, and it's starting to drive me crazy. The last thing I remember before this all began, I was back in my *real* world, in the *actual* city where I lived, riding in the backseat of a car, with my father at the wheel. We were driving to my Uncle's house so we could all carpool to a big presentation they had together. I didn’t get much sleep the night before, so I was tired, and since it was going to be a long drive, I decided I would take a nap. And I did.

And then I woke up here. In this ugly hotel room in a city that looks like it was built two or three centuries ago. In clothes that aren't mine. With currency in my pocket that I don’t recognize. Surrounded by people who mostly look like they're dressing for some Victorian costume party, but in a world where there’s so much wrong that I don’t even know where to start.

Nobody even acknowledges that I don’t belong here — that one day I just happened to wake up in one of their hotel rooms, like I fell out of the sky. They act like I’m one of them. Some of them tell me these stories about how I moved here from the next city over. Some of them claim to know me, recite memories to me I don't have, about my family, about my childhood, about my life. But none of it is real. It can't be. I remember my real life. And I have proof of it right here in my hand. Proof of the world I left behind. It’s real. Reddit exists. You all exist. I'm not crazy. I know I'm not. And if I'm not crazy, if you all exist, then there has to be a way to get back home where I belong.

Even just getting this device wasn’t easy. It was easily one of the strangest experiences of my life, but I’ll talk about that in a future post… Right now, the only thing that matters is that, somehow, it works. I don’t understand it — as far as I know, there’s no cell towers here, no satellite, nothing — but I don’t really care, either. All that matters is it’s here, and I can use it to reach out to all of you. To ask for your thoughts and your help.

I have to go now. It's been too long already and I shouldn’t risk any more time. Please help me. I don't know what to do. This place is the only place I know I can go where people won't say l'm trolling and this is all a big joke. I'll return with an update and answers to all of you as soon as I can.
