About a day ago I discovered Fortnite was bringing back OG fortnite from YouTube video I saw. At first I thought they were lying, then I looked for myself. it was exactly like OG fortnite Jump out of plane, look for weapons and materials, and try to stay alive until the end. Even though I wasn’t having a lot of fun because the players,  just clicked and boom I was addicted. Each hour I spent more and more time playing. When I wasn’t playing I was on Reddit reading about Fortnite or on Twitch and YouTube watching others play OG Fortnite.

I thought of dropped out of college and quit my part time job to give myself 100% to the addicting game which is OG Fortnite. The real world ceased to exist, in my mind at least.

One game of OG fortnite traumatized my life forever. when I spawned in I checked the map I saw that the maps were renamed to…. instead of Risky Reels it was called Rapist Thrills. Dusty Divot was named Bloody Wound. Pleasant Park was renamed Agony Avenue and Greasy Grove was renamed Disembowel Drive. I won’t list the other places but you get the idea. The water in the game was blood. the skins were very disturbing one looked like a zombie with a ripped bloody smock on. The pickaxe was a huge rusty bloody scalpel with chunks of gore dripping off it and his back bling was an aborted fetus. My one of was EMOTES was CORRUPTED one of them was my character masturbating until climax complete with ejaculation. I couldn’t believe it and finally decided to leave the game but I could not leave… 

The match was brutal my gun was covered in blood and rust. when shot a player they would bleed out with Hyper realistic blood and eyes They also screamed in pain. Text came up to my screen saying “if you died in game you died in real life!!!“ in demonic voice I was very very scared of dying because video game I started to get shot from all sides!  I quickly hid Suddenly I heard a player screaming, he started smashing the hiding spot I was in he had a bloody pickaxe, he had the avatar of jonesy with hyper realistic eyes,  blood, skins of players and gore which it was covered in.

I shot him in the head he died, I ran away from scene I went into the deep woods then I saw five people wearing masks and doing an orgy I shot and killed them this was certainly nothing like I have seen before. 

slinging blood all over the screen of dead players? My assumption was for this scary game of fortnite that an hacker hack the game. also the time was 3am.

There was one player left he looked like mario but evil. He attack me with rage I shot him and he died then a nude guy popped up on screen .

I called the cops they said “they will look into this”

Im very tramated I see people doing orgies outside my window .
