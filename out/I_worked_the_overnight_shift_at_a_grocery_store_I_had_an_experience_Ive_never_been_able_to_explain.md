The year was 2008. The Barack Obama vs. Hillary Clinton primary was flaring up, the country was looking to finally move on past George W. Bush and the economy and job market was the absolute worst it had ever been in in my admittedly at the time short adult life. Probably not the best time to be graduating college. I took my time but finished at the end of 2007 winter semester and was now onto my next adventure, subleasing while another student went overseas for a semester in a different city and much bigger metro area. My goal was to find a job and get established. But at first I wasn't picky, so I took the first job I could land, which was a nearby grocery store hiring for overnight shift. I was still on a college student skewed internal clock, so although 10PM-8AM was a change, it wasn't anymore than 8AM-4PM would've been. Plus it was only 4 nights a week, even if those nights changed week by week, but still plenty of free time and time to sleep in. And the work wasn't hard, few customers, and whenever I worked the register the management let us read magazines while waiting, I basically had a subscription to Time and Newsweek. I got a shift differential in pay...could've been a lot worse.

I wondered who would shop for groceries at that hour. Truth is a lot of mixed bags. Some other overnight workers, saw a lot of women in nurse scrubs and guys in security uniforms near the end of the shift. Some people with obvious insomnia issues. Some college students and some obvious parents doing an emergency run because their kid just had to run out of diapers or need cough medicine at 3 in the morning. Generally pleasant and laid back work. Definitely not something I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life or even year, but for now, I could take it.

Then came one strange night. I was working the checkout at 3:13AM on an early Tuesday morning and reading yet another Time article on the 2008 election when a man pulled up with a full cart and I was ready to check out. The man was wearing a suit and tie. Kind of ill-fitting and not very well...but also a weird thing to wear to a grocery store ever, much less at past 3AM. He looked Asian...but kind of not. Maybe he was half-Asian? If I had to guess his age, I'd say around mid-40s, but both older and younger wouldn't surprise me. Kind of hard to place.

But what was really strange wasn't the man, it was his cart. Full of baby formula. The whole thing was just stacked with baby formula packages. Different brands too. And that was it. So strange.

He started unloading them onto the conveyer belt and I started ringing them up. "So....new kid I take it?" I mentioned to him. Maybe that was it. After all new parents are on weird times.

He didn't respond. Just a blank stare. Some customers like to make small talk, some don't. I took that as a sign he was one who didn't.

I just kept ringing them up and filling bag after bag. Then I got to the end.

"That'll be $243.18." I stated. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two hundred dollar bills, two twentys, three ones, and some change, counting out a dime, a nickel and three pennies. Exact change. All clean and crisp and obviously never used, even the coins were shiny and new. Store policy of course required any bills larger than 20s go into the safe, but since we only had one register open now, I was working the one at the safe. So I took them, went through the counterfeit check required for such sized bills, held them up to the light, and quickly drew a yellow line with a marker on them, determined they were real, made change and put them in the safe while the smaller bills and coins went in the register. I offered a receipt but he just ignored it and left it there. The man just picked up his bags, put them back in the cart and headed out. 

A strange surreal experience. But the more I thought about it, it wasn't that weird. Maybe he was a new parent who just became one a bit later in life and was so used to dressing in the suit he did then suffering from new parent sleep schedule, that would explain the ill fitness. Getting crisp dollar bills from a bank isn't hard. Maybe he worked for some charity that helped out new mothers or a food pantry or something. They always need baby formula. Weird time to shop for it...but there was likely an explanation. It was a bit weird, but not inexplicable. I would've probably forgot about it.

Until the next week. It was 4:02AM on an early Wednesday morning. I was doing the same thing, reading Time, when another man in an ill-fitting suit pulled up with a cart.

It was definitely a different man. A bit taller. He looked more Hispanic, but again, not fully, like he was racially mixed. Probably about the same age. And a similar style suit and the same tie. He also was a bit ill fitting in it. And his cart....yep full of baby formula. Even more.

I was breathless and didn't even attempt small talk. Just rang them up like a machine.

"$367.65" I stated in a mechanical voice after it was done. And again he reached into his pocket. Three crisp new hundreds, a fifty, a ten, a five, two ones, two shiny new quarters and three shiny new nickels. I went through the motions, determined the big bills were real, put them in the safe, put the rest in the register, and he was on his way ignoring the receipt again.

That's the last time I ever had such an experience, but it was also near the end of my brief stint there. I got a new job later that month. Not a great job, but more mainstream hours, and a good entry level one for experience. So I turned in my two weeks notice and worked out my remaining shifts, and then hung out on my final ever work break in the employee break room my final shift, saying goodbye to all of my colleagues and my supervisor. He told me not to worry about leaving so soon or feel guilty, there's always high turnover, and I was someone who could take better opportunities.

"Yeah and I have some stories from here" I replied with a chuckle. "You know, a couple weeks ago the same strange thing happened to me on two nights in weeks in a row. These two guys wearing business suits...they came in around 3-4 and bought a ton of baby formula..."

He had a silent look of shock on his face. "Oh...so you saw those guys too."

"Those guys", a strange way to describe it. Especially in that tone.

"Uh...yeah. Have you seen something like that?"

His face was turning more pale and I could tell he was uncomfortable. "It happens usually once a week. Some guy in a suit comes in and buys a ton of baby formula. This location is selling way more baby formula than any other one in the area, and we have no clue why. It's a different man each time. Always pays in cash and exact change, never takes a receipt. Is that what happened?"

"Yes" I replied with a big gulp.

He chuckled nervously a bit. "Well always figured there'd be some weirdos shopping that late at night." In a very anxious tone.

The grocery store is still open. I still shop there semi-regularly. It now closes at midnight, Covid put an end to the 24-hour schedule like it did for so many other places, but I wasn't shopping that late regardless. So I never saw one of those guys again. That baby formula shortage about a year ago reminded me of it...but for 15 years since it's been just a memory and something I never got an answer to. I guess the frustrating thing is not everything in life has an explanation, and I'll probably have to go to my grave without an answer as to what happened.

But every now and then whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and try to get back to sleep, if if it's those strange early morning hours, it's impossible to not be reminded of it.
