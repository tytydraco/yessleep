Hi everyone, I have a creepy story to tell, but I’m not going to share my name because, to be honest, it’s kind of embarrassing. This happened a few years ago when I was living with my parents in an old apartment, and I had just started my first job.

The apartment building was a bit run-down, with creaky floors and thin walls, but we’d lived there for a long time, so I was used to it. My room was on the second floor, and I had a pretty good view of the neighborhood. When I got my first paycheck, I decided to treat myself, and instead of buying something practical, I bought a telescope. Now, I didn’t get it to look at the stars—I wasn’t much of a stargazer. Nope, I was more interested in what was going on around the neighborhood. I mean, who needs Mars when you’ve got neighbors to watch, right?

From my room, I could see the street below, a girls' school in the distance, and, most interestingly, my neighbor Grace’s apartment. Grace was really pretty. She worked at a bank, and I would sometimes see her coming and going in her smart work outfits. Her apartment was a few buildings down the street, but with my new telescope, I could see inside her living room pretty well.

Grace often stayed up late watching TV. I noticed this because I’d sneak a peek through my telescope sometimes. Okay, maybe more than sometimes. She usually wore short clothes when she was lounging around, and, well, I wasn’t doing anything wrong, right? I was just watching.

One Saturday night, I was looking at Grace’s place as usual. She was watching TV again, and everything was normal until I saw something strange. There was an old man standing outside her building. He wore a long black coat and a white shirt, which seemed weird, especially so late at night. At first, I didn’t think much of it—maybe he was a neighbor or a relative—but then something creepy happened.

The old man looked right at me.

Now, I was far away, and there was no way he could have seen me up in my room, right? But he was staring directly at me, almost like he knew I was watching him. I felt a chill run down my spine, and my hands got shaky. I quickly closed the telescope and tried to shake it off, but I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Who was he? How could he possibly have seen me?

The next weekend, I went back to my telescope routine. Grace was there again, watching TV like she always did. For a while, everything was fine, and I thought maybe I’d just imagined the old man. But then I saw him again. He was standing in the same spot, wearing the same clothes, and once again, he was staring right at me. It felt like he knew exactly where I was, which made no sense because I was too far away for him to even notice me.

I was terrified. I turned the telescope away, looking at anything else I could see, but after a few minutes, I glanced back at Grace’s apartment. The old man was gone. I felt relieved for a moment, but then I pointed the telescope at her window again—and there he was. This time, he was inside her apartment, standing behind the window, looking right at me again. But now, he was smiling.

I panicked and moved the telescope to a different direction, but no matter where I pointed it, I could still see him. It was like he was appearing in every direction I looked. My heart was pounding, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I slammed the telescope shut and looked out my window with my own eyes, without the lens.

And there he was.

Standing right in front of my building, staring up at me.

I ran to tell my family, shouting about an old man outside, but when they checked, no one was there. My parents and siblings thought I was seeing things, and I was starting to wonder if maybe I was, too. Eventually, I calmed down, but when I went back to my room, I found the lens of my telescope was cracked. I didn’t know how it had happened, but I wasn’t taking any chances. I threw the telescope away the next day.

A few months later, I finally met Grace in person. We got to talking, and she even invited me over to her apartment. As we chatted, I noticed a photo on her table, and my heart nearly stopped. The old man was in the picture! I pointed to him and asked, “Who’s that?”

Grace smiled and said, “Oh, that’s my grandpa. He passed away five years ago.”

A chill went through my entire body. How could I have seen someone who had been dead for years?

And that’s my creepy story. Lesson learned: maybe it’s better to keep the telescope aimed at the stars after all.
