I think I'm going crazy.

I live with my parents in a house on a farm, about 15 kilometers from the city and 3 kilometers from the nearest neighbor. I lived here for 15 years, then moved for two. A few months ago, after going through a difficult episode that took me away from work, I came back. It's quiet here, peaceful—or at least it was.

My room has a tall window, about four meters from the floor. The guest room, which is next to mine, has a window close to the floor.

A few nights ago, I heard the dogs barking—it wasn't an ordinary bark, it sounded alert, anxious. Then I heard noises outside the house. They sounded like footsteps on crushed stone, but light, almost careful... as if someone — or something — was trying not to be heard.

Later that same night, I heard light tapping on the walls on that side of the house, and soft sounds near the guest bedroom window. Again, all very subtle. Deliberately quiet. I thought about waking my parents, but the sounds stopped, and the dogs fell silent.

(Important note: The house is surrounded by fences. It is not accessible to animals — except our own pups.)

A few days passed without incident. Until today.

I was lying down. All the lights in the house were off. That's when I heard it again — noises outside my window. Light, intentional sounds. I took out my cell phone and turned on the flashlight. The sounds stopped immediately. A few minutes later, they returned. I turned on the light again — silence. This cycle repeated itself several times.

The fourth time, I turned on the flashlight and sat down, shining more carefully into the gaps between the window boards. (They are thick wooden slats that block the view on both sides, but have small spaces between them where light can pass through.)

After that, the sounds stopped completely. As if it — whatever it was — had decided to go away. Or maybe he was just waiting.

But then I heard something else—something metallic falling to the floor. It wasn't high, it seemed to have been dropped from a small height. Then more subtle noises near the guest room window. And then… nothing. Total silence.

There is a group of temporary workers in the region — contractors who change teams every two weeks to work nearby. I don't know any of them, but they come by sometimes. None of them have ever come near our property, at least that I have seen.

And… well… there are also stories. Everyone around here knows the stories that come out of farms during Lent. The ones that people only say in whispers, without ever explaining properly. Stories about shadows and strange lights and things that knock but never speak.

Maybe I really am going crazy. Maybe the stress is messing with me. But I've lived here almost my whole life, and I've never heard anything like it before. I haven't told my parents anything yet, but honestly... I'm scared.

Someone — or something — could be trying to get in.

And you have no chance of me sleeping that night.
