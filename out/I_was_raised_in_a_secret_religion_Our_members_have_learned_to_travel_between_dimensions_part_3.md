Those of my group on the outside of the circle disappeared first into the crowd of rotting, grasping hands. The cyanotic blue fingernails of the demonic children in the camp had what looked like dried blood and dirt caked underneath. They bit and clawed like rabid animals. One Reepiner fell underneath a dozen of them. His face quickly turned into a mask of blood and gore as they bit and ripped at his eyes, nose and mouth. In his last fading moments of life, he pulled out the pin on a grenade and blew himself and all of his remaining grenades sky high. The force of the explosion shook the ground and knocked me off balance. My ears rang as I tried to back up, but found the fence at my back.


The enemy swarmed us in human wave attacks that quickly overwhelmed our positions. I fired as fast as I could, shooting into the crowd at the head or chest of anything that moved outside my group. I know I personally killed at least twenty, seeing their heads explode from the impact through my scope, the attached flashlight giving everything an eerie, overly bright LED glow. I stopped to reload a fresh magazine, breathing hard. As I inhaled, I could smell the blood all around us, a rusty, metallic odor that mixed with the scent of death and shit in the camp to create a most foul mixture. I wanted to vomit from the cloying mix of rotten smells, an odor that hung so heavy in the air that I swore I could actually taste it, but I sucked my saliva down, trying to focus on the battle around me.


Things started to go wrong quickly. We had lost at least four men that I had seen, yet the waves of attack kept coming. I looked to my side to see Samuel, sweating heavily, his eyes wild and wide, a huge grin on his face on his shot as fast as the semi-automatic weapon would allow, pulling the trigger violently over and over until the magazine ran dry. I heard the slight click when he tried to keep shooting the last time and realized the chamber was empty. I looked forward and saw a potential path to a nearby barracks.


“Samuel!” I screamed as loudly as I could. He looked over at me and I pointed to the barracks. “We can get to that building if we stick together and shoot. Then we can try to pick them off one by one as they come in the door.” He needed no more urging than that. He turned to my father and Earl Arkovitch as they stood behind us, a few feet apart, shooting and throwing grenades. I heard another explosion from nearby, then Samuel started bellowing, his deep voice carrying across the whole camp.


“James!” he screamed to my father. “Earl! We’re going to try to make it to that building.” He gesticulated wildly with his gun, pointing it at the building for emphasis. They nodded, and we started running as one.


Hands tried to grab at my clothes as the bleeding children closed in around us. We had made it most of the way to the door by this point, and the way ahead still looked clear. We opened fire on anything close that moved, and my father and Earl each threw a grenade at a large mass of children that staggered and writhed towards us.




With a satisfying explosion of blood, bone and gore, I saw the heads of one after another explode. But we were outnumbered maybe 100 to 1, and no matter how fast we shot or how many grenades we threw, they kept closing in around us.




I vowed to keep a grenade for myself, in case I found myself surrounded and alone. I would not let myself be eaten alive, my skin ripped off or my eyes bitten out. I would blow myself up if it came to that, and take as many of these abominations with me when I went.


But we reached the door to the barracks, Samuel barreling into it without stopping, his massive frame splintering the rickety wood into a thousand small pieces that flew into the barracks. I sprinted in behind him, then my father and Earl, their feet pounding heavily on the bare dirt ground.


I found myself in a pitch-dark room, the only light coming from the flashlights attached to our guns. The room looked much larger on the inside than it did on the outside, and the light didn’t even reach the far wall. We had no time to stop and clear the area, however, as the first enemies had already reached the threshold.


My plan worked well. We all opened fire, piling bodies up at the door as fast as we could. After a couple dozen had fallen, laying bleeding and sprawled on the ground in their black-and-white striped uniforms, the rest piled up, pushing and trying to get through. Pools of blood spread around the emaciated, inhuman bodies of those we had shot, and those behind had slowed enough to the point where we could easily pick them off one by one.


“It’s just like the Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae,” Samuel said. He looked over at me. “They can’t easily get through because of the narrow entrance, so it allows us to ambush and kill them in small groups rather than taking on the whole mass of them. Kid, I think you saved our lives.” I smiled over at him. By this point, so many bodies blocked the doorway that the ones behind couldn’t possibly get through. The thin, twisted bodies piled up three or four high, all the way from directly inside the door of the barracks to ten feet beyond it. Of course, this also meant we couldn’t easily get out- and soon, that became a problem.


\***


We checked the rest of the barracks for any signs of movement, traps or creatures. It looked totally clear. In the back half of the barracks lay bunk after bunk, all made of cheap plywood. A single bunk had three levels, and a person could slide into each and lay down. The space would not allow someone to raise their head, however. They would have to shimmy back out. The space above the first and second bed looked to be only about 18 inches tall. The person on the top had no such issue since the top level was open.


Behind these hundreds of bunks, I kept seeing shadows move. I cleared the area as fast as I could, but with only the flashlight on the gun for light, it still took a few minutes. And I gaped at how many beds lay here. They must have crammed all the kids together like sardines. Each bunk only had a space of an inch or two to the next, and I couldn’t have even slept on such a narrow wooden platform, unless I slept on my side. I saw no pillows, no blankets and no sheets anywhere.


I returned to my father and Earl, sighing. Samuel walked through the inside of the barracks, checking the walls for any holes or secret doors or anything else that could surprise us. He found nothing, and then we were four again, standing in front of a pile of dead bodies. My father brought out some peanut butter crackers from his jacket, passing around a sealed, snack-sized packet to each of us. I realized just how hungry I was when my hands wrapped around it. Ripping it open, I started eating the peanut butters quickly. Earl Arkovitch had bottles of water he had secured in a small pack, and we each got one, though to my disappointment I saw they were the small half-bottles. I knew I would finish that in a single swallow.


“We need a plan,” Samuel said, a thousand-yard stare in his eyes as he stared beyond the front wall of the barracks into something he could only see in his mind.


“Yeah,” my father said. “This is a nightmare. We have already lost four men…”


“Come on, James,” Earl said to my father, “we don’t know for sure that all four have died. It is possible some got away.”


“I saw those… possessed or undead kids or whatever they are rip off one of their faces and eat it,” I whispered, my voice carrying in the darkness. “I saw them eat his eyes.”


“Yes, yes, it is very sad,” Earl said in a calm, flat voice, “but…”


“Our plan needs to be that a couple men should cover the door while Earl brings out the red mirror. The other can help him in whatever way he needs. We need to evacuate as soon as possible,” my father said. Earl’s eyes looked like they might bug out of his head.


“We haven’t even found my son’s body yet!” he said, his voice rising in anger and indignation. “How can you possibly want to leave? That is utter cowardice!”


“No,” Samuel said, ripping his eyes away from that unknown point in the distance and looking straight at our High Priest. “No, he’s right. We need to leave. The sooner the better.” Earl looked around, amazed, as if he expected to see hidden cameras in the room. Then he stood up as tall as he could, whacked his right fist on his chest and grinned. That grin did not look like his normal one. It made him look insane and unhinged. At that moment, I wondered how much his only son’s death had really affected him. I felt sure his madness would lead us all to our doom, if we allowed it.


We all sat in silence, staring at each other for a moment, when something grabbed my father from behind. It was so black that I hadn’t noticed it approaching in the shadows behind him, as my attention had been focused on the High Priest. But when my father started shrieking and calling for help, we all raised our guns

.
One of the black spider creatures had gotten in somehow. This one looked much smaller than the one I had seen kill Alaric Arkovitch, no taller than a man, but it had the same dozen skittering legs, the same huge mandibles extending from its face, constantly tasting the air as they opened and closed in rapid succession. It used these mandibles, sharp and long and curving, to grab my father by his leg and drag him quickly away.


The speed at which the small one skittered was eerie. I instantly raised my gun to try to shoot, but it moved so fast that I barely had time. I fired a single shot which went high, and then the spider had taken my father down a hidden tunnel in the back of the barracks, disappearing from view.


“Fuck!” I screamed. “We have to go get him!” The other two men still looked somewhat shocked. Earl’s eyes had gone wide, while Samuel shifted from leg to leg uncomfortably, running his huge hand over his shaved head repeatedly. Sweat poured down his face, and to my horror, I saw that he looked scared. The same man who had been a soldier and mercenary in countless war-zones looked scared.


“Yeah, yeah, you’re right…” Samuel said. “Now we *can’t* leave, God dammit. God fucking dammit. We should have left immediately, as soon as we blocked the door. This place is a death-trap.” He shot an angry glance at Earl Arkovitch. Samuel looked like he wanted to strangle the man. Earl didn’t even seem to notice. His eyes had glazed over, and he seemed to stare at nothing.


“Let’s do this,” Samuel said, grabbing Earl by the shoulder and pulling him forward. We all started running.


The hole in the ground didn’t even look large enough for the spider to have gone through, though I assumed it could squeeze and morph its body into tight spaces, just like many insects on Earth. I wasn’t surprised that no one had seen the trap door. Dirt and filth absolutely covered every square inch of the floor of the barracks, and the seams of the wooden door fit perfectly into the rest of the floor. Underneath all that debris, no one would have seen the seams anyway, even if we had far more light.


The tunnel had been carved right out of the packed dirt. A man could walk through it, if he crouched. Samuel might have trouble, since he was extremely tall, but Earl and I wouldn’t have too much issue.


I went first, and started sprinting as fast as I could, hoping to catch up with my father. I heard the other two drop down on the dirt behind with a dull thud, and the pounding of their steps. I didn’t look back, but only focused on navigating the winding dirt tunnel.


It seemed to go on forever. After about ten minutes of running, crouched down and carrying my gun and gear, I was tired. I kept pushing myself, remembering the screaming face of my father. I kept hoping it wasn’t too late.


After fifteen minutes of running, the tunnel opened up into a cavern, filled with rocks. I could stand up straight again. The ceiling extended twenty feet above me, with filthy drops of water dripping down on my head and making the rocky floor slippery. I saw remnants of what looked like spiderwebs sticking to the walls, wispy and falling apart as if ancient.


A few seconds later, Earl and Samuel emerged behind me. With the opening of the tunnel, we could walk side by side. If we had to start shooting, then moving in a line didn’t seem wise.


The cavern continued to open up, until my flashlight no longer illuminated the ceiling far above me. The floor stretched hundreds of feet to my left and right, with sharp, rocky projections standing straight up. Water continued to drip down the walls and fall from the ceiling, and we had to slow our pace so as not to slip on the slick, wet ground.


I saw pieces of webbing sticking to the cliff-like walls, and these looked much fresher. Most were just individual strands hanging down, as thick as an arm and stretching dozens of feet long. I knew what had made those, and I dreaded having to meet them again.


Up ahead, I heard shrieking and cries for help. I ran forward, seeing the silhouette of my father suspended in the air a couple hundred feet away, held in place by the thick strands of sticky web hanging down from each crevice in the wall. It didn’t form a traditional spiderweb, but rather just many interlaced strands hanging down dozens of feet. I saw lifeless bodies further ahead, totally wrapped from head to foot in the white strands.


“God, help me!” my father cried down to us.


“Where are they?” Samuel yelled over to him. My father shook his head violently.


“I don’t know, I don’t know,” he said. “Just help me, please!” I looked up at him, realizing how difficult it would be to get him down. He hung over a dozen feet in the air, suspended with his arms out in a T, reminding me of statues of Jesus on the crucifix.


Samuel pulled gingerly on a thick strand of spiderwebbing that hung down in front of my father. Satisfied that it would hold his weight, he began shimmying up, wrapping his thick legs and arms around the strand until he was nearly face to face with my father. He pulled out a huge knife and began to cut the strands holding him in place.


At that moment, I heard the skittering of hundreds of legs. Looking behind me, I saw Earl Arkovitch crouched over a dark silhouette, wrapped in many layers of webbing. He began to cry and scream.


“It’s Alaric! It’s Alaric! My son! My only son!” he screamed, falling on his knees and hugging the body. He threw his gun to the side, weeping. I could see his mind had finally snapped.


Samuel began to throw the last of his grenades at the dozens of approaching spider monsters. The first one blew the front three apart in a cataclysmic blast, sending legs and chitinous shells flying in all directions.


I knew we had to get the red mirror and leave immediately. I ran over to Earl Arkovitch, reaching into his robes. He didn’t even seem to notice I was there as I took the mirror from him. He still lay on the ground, kissing and hugging his dead son’s mutilated body.


Samuel was in the front, and quickly became overwhelmed. Dozens of spiders poured in through every opening in the cave. As my father ran over to me and I drew the mirror up to my face, activating the silver ruins, I saw Samuel pull the pin on his final grenade, holding it to his chest as the mandibles of the giant creatures bit into his chest and neck. Spurts of blood went out in all directions.


As we were transported back to the door at Hollowhead Cave, I saw the silhouette of Samuel- grinning wildly as flames burst from his body and took the lives of a dozen of the spider creatures with him.


Meriope ran over to us, checking us for injuries. I kept screaming over and over, “They’re all dead! God, they’re all dead!” Then I blacked out for the second time.


In my dreams, I kept seeing Earl hugging his dead son’s body, the grin of Samuel as he died, fighting and taking his enemies with him. I woke up in my bed, covered in sweat with enough nightmares to last me a lifetime.


So in the end, Earl Arkovitch got his desire. He ended up finding his son’s body, and they may rest together forever- until some abomination from that world eats them, I suppose.
