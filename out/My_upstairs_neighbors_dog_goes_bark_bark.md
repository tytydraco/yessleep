My upstairs neighbor’s dog goes bark bark.  
I hear him, bark bark, barkbarkbark, bark, I hear him barking all of the time.  
I think of ways to tell my neighbor barbark that he is bark barking.  
“Hey neighbor,” I think of bark writing, “your dog goes bark bar, bark, barkbark all of the time. Could you try to bark get him to stop bark barking?”  
I think of knocking on my neighbor’s door while the dog is in a barkbarkbark fit, pounding on the barking door with my fists,  
“Don’t you know there’s barking people barkbark barking people trying to barkbark sleep in this building? Don’t you think of bark anyone but your barking damn self?”  
When I first bark moved in, the dog would barkbark sometimes. The bark dog would run around, and I’d hear its loud banging noises it made as its feet pound pounded the ceiling. That bark bark bothered me too, but this bark bark bothers me more. As the dog has gotten bark bark older, my upstairs neighbor has left it barking home barkBARK for longer periods of time. It’ll be barkbarkbarking two straight hours of the bark damn barks. Working hours? Barks. 1 AM? Barks. They leave their barking windows open, too, so the barkbark sounds like it’s everywhere, echoing in our barking courtyard.  
I tried everything. Noise canceling barking headphones with the barkbarkBARK, BARKBARK white noise playing to barking drown it out, but I’d give myself barking ear damage if I turned it up loud enough to actually bark cancel out the noise.  
I tried meditation exercises. It’s not the bark barking, it’s me, I have the control. That works for 20 barking minutes max, but at some point, my barking mind can’t do it anymore and the BARK takes over again.  
Last night, it kept me awake an hour past my barking bedtime, and then it still poundpounded the ceiling when my neighbor barking got home. I had a big job interview today, and it didn’t barking go well. I don’t barking think I got the job. When I got home from the interview, I barking ran into my neighbor in the elevator. I tried to get the barking courage to say something, to beg my barkbark neighbor to turn around and go grab their BARK,BARK dog, but my barking neighbor brushed past me and the moment was barking lost.   
So now I’m waiting for my neighbor to come back. It should be any moment now. Ah, yes, there it is. I hear the “AHHHHHH” screams of my barking neighbor.  
“AHHHHHHHHHH!”  
And this sound is new, it’s shrill and it’s scared and it gives me shivers, but it’s a new sound so I enjoy it, and it barking mixes with my screams, although I’m not sure if they can hear me, but I can barking hear them, of barking course I barking hear them, I always hear them.  
“BARK!” I scream, and it mixes in with their “AHHHHH!”  
“BARKBARKBARK!” I scream. “BARKBARKBARK!”
