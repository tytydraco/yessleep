I must choose a door

And I see there are three

They are different colors

Only one can make me free

.

My education loan scared me

The campus job paycheck wasn’t big

So I applied for many scholarships

Feeling like a desperate pig

&#x200B;

I am a student

And I work hard

Why shouldn’t I have some security

Why can’t I have a financial guard

&#x200B;

And one day it arrived in my inbox

“Congratulations, you are the winner of the Leviathan Scholarship!”

It felt like a dream

Or as if I was high on a drug trip

&#x200B;

It felt like it was too good to be true

It had been a simple poetry contest for an application

They’d pay off my loan and also give me $15000

Enough for all costs in this run

&#x200B;

There were terms and conditions

Of course, there had to be

I would need to follow instructions

And then the money I could see

&#x200B;

Once the carrot is dangled

It is hard to look away

I didn’t care what they wanted

I’d do anything that they’d say

&#x200B;

They needed to me go to

The Leviathan Society conference

I’d talk about my experience and sign off some rights

Wasn’t thinking about if it made sense

&#x200B;

I didn’t even have the funds

To travel to the place

So I gave thought to my choices

A way to complete the final steps of this race

&#x200B;

I asked to borrow some money

But the place was far away

My friends didn’t have money either

Without options, I had to stay

&#x200B;

Then a knock on my door

A few days later

There was a man who looked like a wizard

Presented me with a paper

&#x200B;

The man was old with droopy skin

His stare was creepy

Every expression would make the hair on my arms stand

But I had to take it easy

&#x200B;

He said he would help me with the travel

Said he was an agent of the Scholarship society

He even got me formal clothes, a crisp suit

That dude made me look mighty

&#x200B;

I appeared as if I were a true intellectual

By the magic of his skills

However, his help came with limits and conditions

For his help, he gave me a bill

&#x200B;

His services were only for the day of the conference

And at midnight they would stop

I had to be done and back by then

Then he led me to the terrace top

&#x200B;

The bill said he needed my adherence

And I were to listen to what he wants

Or I would pay the price

And permission I was to grant

&#x200B;

Permission for them to monitor

All the use of my money and time

That’s when I figured

The price was surveillance of mine

&#x200B;

Privacy was secondary in my head

Money to me was first

So I struck the deal

While internally feeling an emotional burst

&#x200B;

And on my terrace was a private jet

A pilot for my private services too

Somehow the jet looked like the colors

Of my pet bird ‘Ms. Moo’

&#x200B;

The pilot looked like a sinister human

version of my pet dog

I didn’t have time to process it though

I jumped in the plane like a frog

&#x200B;

I know the rhyming words are lazy

But please hear my tale

For nothing after this was ordinary

It was a surreal sail

&#x200B;

Across the sky and I was soon

At the Leviathan society

It was a big, gothic, dark, and enchanting building

Just like academic royalty

&#x200B;

And once I entered

I met the society leaders

They were all dressed in dark formal garments

Soon the event started with the speakers

&#x200B;

One by one they spoke

And many talked to me

The leaders made me feel

Like an artistic and intelligent prodigy

&#x200B;

The scholarship was mentioned briefly

They quickly made me sign some papers

A dinner was arranged

And I was anticipating the money coming later

&#x200B;

The conversations made me feel important

I felt rich

Not just financially, but in terms of purpose

That’s when I felt a sudden mental itch

&#x200B;

A bad feeling

And I heard the building tower clock

How was it so late already

I ran to the next block

&#x200B;

The next block where my plane was

But as I ran

I dropped my CV

Which I hadn’t planned

&#x200B;

I brought it just in case they asked

But I didn’t have the time to pick it up

So I ran before time ran out

Ran from their close academic society club

&#x200B;

I got home somehow

But the wizard man was waiting for me

He told me I wasn’t back on time

So I would need to pay the fee

&#x200B;

The society man now watches me every day

He watches how I spend every penny

I never get used to him

No matter how many

&#x200B;

Times I see him daily,

I never get used to him

He gets very angry when I don’t listen to his constant words

Makes my life dim

&#x200B;

Literally,

I see less and less

When I disobey his wishes

The scholarship made my life a mess

&#x200B;

With the money came this man

Who is always dictating

What my choices should be

It’s freedom not money that is worth fighting

&#x200B;

I got another email today

From the Leviathan society

They’ve been looking for the person

Who they met in the conference, alrighty,

&#x200B;

They claimed they didn’t remember

That I was the scholarship winner

But they want me to join the society

Promising rewards even bigger

&#x200B;

They just had my CV

And remembered me from the conversations

I thought I’d get rid

Of the Wizard man’s supervision

&#x200B;

The Wizard man decided to show me

What would happen if I joined

He showed me the dark dark things

Which for me, they have lined

&#x200B;

I said I didn’t care

I just wanted to get rid of him

In his anger

The wizard did something on a whim

&#x200B;

So now I’m in this circus-like

Room with cartoony doors

They have shades of red, yellow, and green

They’re making me dizzy as I sit on the floor

&#x200B;

I must choose a door

And I see there are three

They are different colors

Only one can make me free

&#x200B;

One will take me to the Leviathan society

(and they will make me pay)

With the other, my scholarship I will lose

(but they will make me pay)

One will make me go back to being with the man

(he will make me pay)

Which door should I choose

(because they will make me pay)
