Today, I woke up feeling unusual. It was a workday, and I followed my routine by cracking my right hand's knuckles, then my left hand's, but something didn't feel quite right. I did it a couple more times until I felt better.

In the shower, I accidentally bumped my right shoulder against the glass door. I tried to balance it by bumping my left shoulder against the wall, but it only made me feel worse. I ended up banging both sides of my shoulders against the surroundings until I felt some relief.

I hopped out of the shower and began brushing my teeth, I cleaned each and every tooth with ease. 

Now it was time for my tongue. I try to maintain the brush's position on the center of my tongue, if I accidentally deviate to either side, no problem. I'll just brush the other side and fix it. 

My hand is not quite as precise as a surgeon's one. And deviate I did. I tried to fix it the usual way but something about today was... off. I brushed my tongue for so so long I almost gagged.

My mouth is clean now. better get dressed and head out.

On my way to the train station, I noticed people with their brains floating above them, tethered to their heads by a thin string. I tried not to focus on it, but today, it bothered me more than usual.

"Nothing unusual about this" I repeat to myself. I see this all the time.

But I feel it much more today. If the strings connecting their brains to their heads interfere with any surroundings, then they would disconnect and their brains would fly away I am can't let that happen.

Sometimes my eyes emit a laser that shoots out and hits anything I look at.

Today the laser was more vivid than ever. I worried my laser eyes would sever those fragile connections.

"I have to look away" I said to my self. and so I did. I closed my eyes. 

That's better. 

Now all I had to do was get to the train station without looking at people or their floating brains.

Despite my efforts, and amidst compromising my own vision and rushing to the station, I bump into a person, quite hard. she fell down and cracked her head on the pavement. I opened my eyes and looked at her. she fell down to her side. the right side of her head is bleeding. 

She's still alive and awake. 

I breath in with relief. 

But my compulsions have enslaved me more than ever today. 

I get down on my knees and grab her head. barely conscious she looks at me, I can sense the fear in her eyes. I turn her head to the the other side. then bang it on the ground.

Ohhh that's much better.

Whilst doing all this, I failed to prevent my laser to cut the string binding her brain to her head. 

Her brain is floating away. I have to bring it back. 

And so I urgently began doing so. I focused all my energy into it. I tried to force her brain back into her head. 

I squeezed it so hard into her until it felt just right.

I stand up. But then it sinks in. I must've killed this woman. she isn't moving.

I begin to panic. my compulsions feed on my fears and escalate. I run away trying to avoid any people. I cannot hurt another human. I'm a good person. 

I take a right turn. It's another area in the station. 

I cannot control my self at this point. I must take a left. Then again right then left. right then left.

I reach an unfamiliar train stop. the train is coming, it's on the right side of me. 

On the left is a group of people.

Mothers. Fathers. Children. 

I cannot let myself hurt them.

My lasers are going crazy and bouncing off of every object in the area like a light reflects off a mirror.

All their innocent brains are floating away.

I've managed to hurt them all. 

I hear the train siren. It's coming. I have to save these people. It's coming quite fast.

I'm faced with a horrifying decision, only one choice remained.

To step to the right.
