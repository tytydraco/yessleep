Around one millennium ago, I made the mistake of insulting a witch for not giving me the potion I wanted. Ever since then, I was cursed to roam the universe for an eternity, even if the Earth were to be destroyed. There was only one way to be free.

At first, immortality was a blessing. Having all the time in the world to create a meaningful life for myself was all I ever dreamed of. I made a good fortune, traveled the world, married a few people and had a few children over the years, and lived my life to the fullest. 

Then… my secret got out. Before I knew it, the whole world was after me. I ran for hours. I could not die physically, but I could be injured. The insides of my body felt like they were being torn apart and put back together again as I trudged through forest after forest, city after city. Eventually, everything went dark.

I awoke to only a faint torch illuminating the space, and the shadows on the walls seemed to conspire against me. I tried to move, but I was tied to a table in tight constraints. There, a shadowy figure appeared in my vision. 

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out of me. The figure slowly creeped to my bedside. Its eyes were a glowing red, and a low gurgle emitted from it. I tried to close my eyes, but it was futile. 

As the figure leaned over my bedside, its hand brushed against my face. Its touch was almost endearing, as if it was luring me into a false sense of security. It whispered to me, its voice nearly unintelligible, “You’re safe here. It will all be over soon.” 

But the creature lied to me, and I believe decades passed. Day after day strapped to a table 24/7, experiment after experiment. One time it was seeing how I could withstand general pain, the next time it was burning me until my flesh melted or fell off, and another time it was cockroaches seeping beneath my skin and bones.

The worst part about being immortal was never watching my loved ones all pass on—it was the cruelty of humanity itself. And I was going to make humanity pay for hurting me.

Eventually, the torture became too much for me. I am not sure how, but one moment I was in the lab, and the next I was standing next to a pile of dead bodies. I could have finally broken the curse. The one way to be free was to swap places with a human who was alive. But I killed them all in a fit of rage I do not even remember. I failed. 

Nevertheless, I decided to search for someone else to take my place. As more time passed, I knew it would not be much longer until I reached civilization. Unfortunately, the universe whispered to me that it had other plans. Its voice was the same tone as the creature’s was.

A gamma-ray burst brushed against Earth. It was not direct enough to end all of humanity, but it quickly wiped out most of the population. It seemed every time I thought I had hope or ideas, the universe betrayed me.
