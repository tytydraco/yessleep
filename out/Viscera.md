The call came at 05:13. Dawn was a rumor in Vegas. Carter’s voice was ground glass. “Industrial yard off North Nellis. A night watchman came across it. Says it’s not right.” That’s all. When a man like Carter says it’s not right, he means the world has tilted on its fucking axis. 

  

The drive was a passage through Vegas’s backside. Scrapyards, wholesale suppliers, stretches of cracked asphalt where weeds grew through the center line. Carter’s sedan ate the road in silence. He lit a cigarette, the glow painting his face in brief, orange strokes. 

“Watchman’s name is Eddie Ruiz. Sixty-eight. Heart condition. Paramedics are with him. He’s not making much sense.”  

“What did he say?” 

“Said he thought it was a mannequin. Then he saw the hole. The hole where the chest should be.” 

  

We turned into a fenced yard for a defunct trucking company. Ace Freight. The chain-link gate was open. Two squad cars, lights spinning in the pale gloom, painted the gravel and the hulls of old semi-trailers in pulses of blue and red. An ambulance was there, its back doors open. An old man sat on the bumper, an oxygen mask over his face. 

  

Carter went to him. I walked past, following a uniform’s pointed finger toward the back of the lot, near a towering pile of shredded rubber. 

  

The smell found me first. Out here, it was different. The clean, cold desert air carried it—coppery, sweet, with a faint undercurrent of diesel and decay. 

  

They had laid him on a patch of bare dirt between a tire mountain and a rusted shipping container. A white male, laid on his back. He was fully dressed in a grey suit, white shirt, tie. Good shoes. The clothing was neatly arranged, not disturbed. But the suit jacket and dress shirt were open. They had been unbuttoned, not torn. 

  

They had opened him. 

  

The wound was a dark, yawning mouth from his sternum to his navel. The work was brutal. The ribs were cracked and pried apart, a violence of leverage, not a slice. The cavity inside was empty. The heart, the lungs—gone. His liver rested on his stomach, a dark, purplish mass. His intestines, a complex, glistening knot, had been carefully arranged on the ground to his right, placed on a sheet of clean, unfolded cardboard, as if on a display tray. 

  

A single plastic patio lantern, the battery-powered camping kind, stood sentinel near his head. It cast a weak, steady glow over the scene. It had been placed there. To see by. Or to be seen. 

  

Carter came up beside me, his breath fogging. “Watchman says this wasn’t here at his 2 a.m. rounds. Had to have been placed between then and 5.” 

“He had time,” I said, my voice low. “He brought a light. He brought the cardboard. This wasn’t a dump. This was an installation.” 

We stood, the cold seeping into our shoes. The scene was a violation of two kinds: the violence to the body, and the calm, deliberate staging in this lonely place. 

“Why here?” Carter asked. 

“Privacy. Space. No casual traffic. And the contrast.” I gestured at the suit, laid out in a yard of industrial decay. “He’s making a point.” 

  

I moved closer, crouching. The ground was hard-packed dirt. I focused on the left hand. It was curled slightly. Not a fist, but not relaxed. Using my pen, I nudged the fingers. They were stiff with cold. Tucked against the palm was a small square of paper. A Polaroid. I carefully extracted it. 

In the faint light from the lantern, I could make out the image. The victim, alive, smiling in a bar booth. A neon sign. An arm around him, cut off at the shoulder. A red ‘X’ on his forehead. 

I bagged it. A piece of a puzzle I couldn’t see yet. 

  

I stood, my knees cracking. I played my flashlight over the ground around the body. Near the cardboard, something gleamed. A small, dried piece of flesh. Wrinkled, pale. The curve of a human ear. The cut was clean, the edge healed. It was just sitting there on the dirt, like a dropped button. 

“That’s not his,” Carter said, shining his own light. 

“No,” I agreed. It was a fact. A separate, grotesque fact. It meant nothing. Just an object. We bag it. 

  

A uniform called us over to the shipping container. The door was slightly ajar. Inside, on the floor, was a single sheet of white printer paper, weighed down by a stone. Laser-printed text: 

The third will beg. 

  

Carter looked from the note to the ear on the ground to the hollowed man. “The third? What, this is number two? The ear is from number one?” 

“Maybe,” I said, refusing to jump. “Could be he’s messing with us. Could be a fantasy. We have one body. Let’s start with him.” 

  

The morgue was a return to clinical order. Lin, the M.E., was a scribe of final truths. 

“Cause of death is exsanguination from the massive thoracic trauma. The incision tool was something like a serrated survival knife. Tremendous force. The organ removal was neater. A sharper blade. He took the heart and lungs intact. The placement of the liver and intestines was post-mortem. He had time and no interference.” 

“How long was he out there?” Carter asked. 

“Body temp and lividity suggest he was killed elsewhere, then transported and staged. He was cold when you found him. He’d been dead several hours before being placed in the yard.” 

So. A private studio. Then a public exhibition. 

  

The victim’s prints gave us a name: Paul Mabry, 48. Timeshare sales. DUIs. Sister in Reno. 

We found the bar from the Polaroid—The Sundown Lounge. The bartender, Leo, said Paul was a local who came with an old friend named Alex not too long ago. Quiet. Glasses. Paid cash. 

An old friend. A thread. 

  

At Mabry’s house, we found a birthday card. A reminder of louder days. – And the book: The Quiet Men and Other Poems. 

“Poetry,” Carter said, flipping it. “Great.” 

I skimmed it. It was just a book. A weird gift from an old friend. A data point, not a revelation. 

  

The revelation came later that afternoon. County Search and Rescue found a body in a shallow desert grave twenty miles north. Decomposed. Animals. The M.E. noted two details: a clean, healed amputation of the right ear tip, and the absence of the tongue. The hyoid was broken. He’d been choked. 

Officer Ruiz—no relation to the watchman—came to our squad room. “The ear, detectives. The cut on the desert body matches the ear from the scene. It’s from him. He’s Victim One.” 

The ear had a source. Paul Mabry was Victim Two. 

I finally opened the book of poems to the dog-eared page. I was looking for the “louder days” from the card. I found the poem “Elegy for the Unheard.” And there were the lines: 

What is the heart but a lonely hunter? 

What is the ear but a begging bowl? 

What is the tongue but a silent prophet, 

Screaming to be made whole? 

  

The air in the room changed. The words from the scene weren’t madness. They were citations. Sang for the tongue. Listened for the heart. Beg for the ear. The killer was using the poem as a schematic. He was harvesting the symbols from the verse. 

“It’s a pattern,” I said, the theory forming from the accumulated weight of evidence. “He’s making the poem literal. Mabry was the ‘lonely hunter.’ The heart. The first victim was the ‘silent prophet.’ The tongue. He’s collecting them.” 

Carter read the lines, his face hardening. “The next victim is the ‘begging bowl.’ Didn’t he already mutilate the first guys ear?” 

The theme didn’t spring from my head. It was built from the photo, the card, the book, the two victims, the matching ear, the specific removals. The killer was creating fucked up puzzle pieces for some unfortunate Vegas PD wage slave. 

  

The sister called back, remembering: Paul’s old friend, the quiet poet from college. Alex Sandoval. He’d moved to Vegas, was renting some kind of workspace as an artist. 

  

The warehouse address, pulled from a utilities hookup, was in a bleak industrial park. It fit. A private studio. 

We went in without a SWAT team. Time was a fluid we couldn’t afford to waste. The note said “the third.” 

  

The unit was silent, the door unlocked. Inside was not a slaughterhouse. It was a white, clean studio. The smell of clay and chemical preservatives. On shelves, his finished works in jars: a heart, lungs, a tongue, ears. Labeled. On the wall, his grand plan: Project III: The Beggar. Laryngeal extraction. 

  

He emerged from a back room, wiping red clay from his hands, calm as a potter. “You’re here about the work, but the piece has been finished already.” 

The confrontation was short. Carter’s commands. Sandoval’s serene explanation—he claimed he was giving them voice, making the silence audible. His hand drifted toward the drawer. The glint of a long, thin boning knife inside. 

In that moment, theory and poetry vanished. There was only the geometry of the room, the threat to my partner, the end of the cycle. 

My shots were not an interruption. They were a full stop. 

He fell, looked at the jars on his shelves, and breathed his final word: “Coda.” 

  

Carter confirmed the knife in the drawer. He looked at me, gave the nod that covered the threat, the justification, the closure. 

 

The third victim turned up behind the Flamingo, knees on asphalt, throat a clean hollow. Voice box gone. Ears removed. The begging bowl, emptied. 

  

Sandoval did the work. He’d just saved the last piece for a final display. A posthumous fuck-you. 

  

We tagged him, bagged him, and filed the update under a closed case. Sandoval’s “collection” is in a cardboard box in an evidence locker. The formaldehyde’s gone cloudy. The jars are dusty. 

  

That’s where your masterpiece lives, Alex. In the dark, under a flickering bulb, between a broken stapler and a box of old subpoenas. 

  

The end to his poetry is the punctuation holstered on my hip.
