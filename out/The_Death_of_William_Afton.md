There stood William Afton, scanning the room around him and gazing upon what he had done.

There laid the animatronics that had been looking for him; disassembled and broken beyond repair. William's hands were shaking; the adrenaline was still fresh in his veins. The hammer in his left hand was still grasped tightly. The relief that washed over him was incredible.

He had finally done it.

All those years of paranoia, all those nightmares of his creations hunting him down and ripping him apart, all those sleepless nights of voices in his head. He destroyed them. All of them. Finally, he was free… But that relief quickly dried up, as the animatronics’ battered and broken suits started to shake on their own.

“*N-No!*” William thought to himself, looking around the room again at the events unfolding before him. Each of the animatronics slowly rose up, their suits now started to glow from the inside. The light emitting from the bodies were so bright that William quickly covered his eyes and looked away to protect himself, and backed up into the hallway behind him, dropping his hammer in the process.

After a few moments, the lights emitting from the bodies had fizzled, followed by a series of loud thuds. When William finally looked back at the scene in front of him, he was in complete disbelief. The animatronic suits had fallen back down to the ground, but something else was standing above them; The Five Victims.

The five children that William killed all those years ago. The five children he stuffed into those suits in a desperate act to cover his tracks. The five children who saw their killer get away. All the rage and sorrow was so strong in their little hearts, that they manifested into ghostly apparitions of themselves from when they were still alive. Each of them dawned a paper plate mask of the animatronic they would each respectively possess.

William couldn’t believe his eyes. The five children from that old Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria that were left to rot in the backroom were back to take revenge upon the monster who took their lives.

William’s mind was overwhelmed by the memories of that day; the music, the singing, the smells, everything was rushing back to him. This was the souls’ doing. Having that day replayed over and over in his head was maddening. “*STOP!*” William screamed out in pain, begging for the torture to end. The souls obliged. William could finally hear himself think again. But the torture was far from over, as the souls started to slowly walk towards William. The souls were not in a rush; they wanted this torment to last as long as possible.

“*S-STAY BACK!*” William demanded. He then realized that the hammer that was in his hand moments earlier was now on the floor in front of him. William quickly lunged forward, grabbed the hammer, and stood back up to ready himself. “*I-I’M GOING TO USE THIS!*” William threatened, this time with a more confident tone. But the souls didn’t not stop their march; fine, William wasn’t going to stop moving either. With a firm grasp on the hammer once again, William swung the hammer at the leading soul… nothing happened. William swung again, and again, but the souls were not fazed by his attacks.

With no other option, William threw the hammer at the souls, and ran like a bat out of hell. The hallway he was running down led him to a backroom. In a quick scan William made around the room, he had noticed some spare animatronic parts, boxes of tools and party favors, a broken endoskeleton with its left arm missing, and a malfunctioning arcade machine. William had also seen a few holes in the ceiling, with some of them leaking water from the rain outside, with the hallway behind him being the only way out.

**William was trapped.**

In a short time, the souls had caught up to him. The leading soul walked into the room, while the remaining souls formed a blockade in front of the exit of the backroom to ensure William’s capture.

All William could do now was back himself against the wall of the backroom, and hope that the souls would give him a quick and painless death; but the leading soul didn’t have an ounce of mercy left in his little heart. He wanted this torment to last for as long as possible, before taking the life of this lifeless, heartless monster, and sending him to the deepest, darkest pit of hell that awaited his arrival.

With nothing else to do, William took one last glance around the room for something, anything he could use to protect himself… and then he saw it. The Yellow Rabbit Suit he had used to take the lives of those children was still here.

**Perfect!**

The souls would never be able to get him in that suit. Without a second to spare, William bolted towards the suit, putting it on as fast as he could. Meanwhile, the leading soul silently gestured to the other souls to get behind him and watch.

A few moments later, the suit was tightly fitted around William’s body. That rush of adrenaline had come back to him, but it was much stronger now. William couldn’t help but quietly chuckle to himself. He thought he was victorious against the souls. But the suit started to feel… odd. William could feel small parts of the suit winding up and stopping in place. The water leaking from the ceiling had soaked into the suit. Combined with William’s trembling body loosening the springlocks, he could do nothing but wait for the inevitable.



**\*CRUNCH\***



At that moment, the springlocks in both of the Suit’s legs went off. William screamed from the searing pain. He tried to move forward but he couldn’t regain enough control, causing him to fall backward onto the floor and against the wall. The next part of the suit that went off was the Torso. There was so much blood spewing out that the once inviting yellow of the suit was starting to get stained with that all too familiar dark crimson liquid. William’s arms were the next part of his body to go. All he could do was scream and try to pry off the suit, but the springlocks had already dug themselves deep into his flesh. In one last act of desperation, William tried removing the suit's head off of him with what little control of his arms he had left, but the springlocks had already started clamping down. The springlocks tightened in such a way, that William’s screams were now muffled by the springlocks piercing his jaw closed.

As the last of the springlocks finished tightening and the gushing of blood continued, the souls held each other’s hands, and started to ascend. With one last bright light, the souls had vanished, leaving nothing but their paper plate masks behind.

He killed those kids in the backroom, now he’s dying in one as well. He left those kids to rot in those suits, now he’s rotting away in the same suit he had used to kill them. Those kids died alone, now William is dying alone.

As William’s life flashes before his eyes, still coughing up the blood that filled his lungs, still twitching in pain; he hears a voice in his head…

“*...rest…*”

“*...father...*”

William slowly closed his eyes...
