Hey there! It has been a minute! Sorry about that, it's been a bit of a busy week and a half for me. After my colossal fuck-up last week, Isaac decided I needed a *partner*, someone to keep an eye on things, and more importantly; me. Their name is Van, and so far, they seem like the only normal part of this place. It was considerably surprising to find out literally anyone else worked here, to be perfectly honest with you. They studied business and management at the University of Oregon, play guitar sorta well, and literally NEVER. STOP. TALKING.

Don't mistake me, having someone along for this fucking weird ride has been really nice, but holy SHIT. I'm a generally reserved person, I feel I'm at my best when I only speak when something needs to be said, or if I'm making small talk. Their conversations could hardly be described as small talk, for instance, last night, I got to hear a literal uninterrupted 45 minutes hearing about the lore surrounding a game called Detroit: Become Human. What's upsetting about this isn't that they rambled for 45 minutes about it, but rather by the time that rambling ended I was INVESTED!

Uncharacteristically, however, was how little they actually had to say about what pushed them to start working here, or really any details about their employment. When I asked them about the rules Isaac laid out for me on my first day, the only thing they had to say about it was "Yeah, they're pretty weird". All things considered, though? It's been nice having someone around. Something no one seems to consider (or at the very least, ***I*** never considered) about working overnight shifts entirely on your own is the... well... loneliness of it. There's a certain feeling of isolation sitting behind a desk for countless hours a week with your only conversations being the occasional conversation with a guest. Having this new face around, I think it's made this job a little bit more bearable. Not to say there still hasn't been batshit crazy things going on, of course!

Two nights ago, for instance, we had the same guest check in 12 different times. Now when you hear this you may think I mean they had booked 12 rooms, no, I mean I would check them into a room, and then 20 minutes later they would walk in through the door, and it was as if they had never even been here until that moment. I checked them into room 505 TWELVE FUCKING TIMES. After the 8th I had to ask if they were fucking with me.

Something else I should note about this place is that our coffee maker has been broken pretty much my entire time working here. I usually bring my own sustenance but occasionally I'll find I've forgotten to put an energy drink or six into my backpack, and MAN that coffee maker would have come in real handy on those nights. I've emailed Isaac via the email I've found in our employee registry no less than ten times about it over my employment here. He never responds.

Van asks a lot of questions about me, too. If I grew up here, if I've been out of town for things like studies, if I'm in a relationship, how my relationship is with my family, etc. It makes me a little uncomfortable if I'm being perfectly honest, but given how forthcoming they are with their own life story, I feel it's only fair I indulge them, although I'm not NEARLY as open as they are. I think they know, they get this certain look on their face when I give a half-assed answer, and they've made it a point to call me out on it. I decided today I'd turn it into a game.

"I'll answer fully if you start answering some of my questions fully, you get a point if you flat out refuse to answer." and they agreed.

They asked if I was in a relationship, I said "No, in a town where everyone knows everyone, I hold zero desire to look at romance, it comes with FAR too much drama"

They seemed satisfied with that answer, so I asked them:

"Exactly how long have you worked here? This place seemed to just pop up out of the blue, and as far as I could tell, I was the only employee on staff for the front desk aside from our *glorious* leader."

They paused for a moment before answering. "Isaac found my resume on Indeed about a year ago", they started.

"He stated he was in need of staffing for this hotel that he managed out in the sticks, and I had just finished my Bachelor's, I was desperate to get out of Eugene, so I agreed. I was given a room here, it's basically a studio apartment, it's entirely paid for and I get paid well enough that I don't really think about it all too much."

Well, that explains why they aren't surprised by the rules.

They then asked me if I ever thought about leaving Maelstrom Hills. "I have, truthfully. The idea still sits pretty firm in my brain, but I feel like I can't. The Hills are all I know, and truthfully, I'm scared of changes that drastic. I don't know where I'd go or what I'd do. I don't exactly have many marketable skills, and save for our creepy ass security guards and our occasional guests, I don't mind this job too much"

They looked at me, almost confused. "But aren't you curious about what's out there? Surely you've gotta be bored of the monotony!"

I paused for a minute, because honestly? I've never looked at leaving the Hills that seriously before.

"Yeah, I am. And maybe once I find some time to go and pursue those curiosities, I will. But for now, I gotta stay put"

My phone cut off the surprisingly deep conversation I was having with this person I had just barely had the opportunity to really get to know, it's 7 AM. Otherwise known as time for us to part ways for the day.

"Quittin' time! I'll see you later!" I shouted, half-way out the door.

"Take it easy, and hey! Thanks for not being a stranger tonight!"

"Yeah, yeah! So far the score's tied, see you tonight!"

Unfortunately, besides the usual brand of crazy this place tends to exhibit, I regret having no super fucked up shit to report on this time around, just a talkative new coworker that's spending a weird amount of time trying to get to know me.

A storm's rolling in. Shaping up to be one of the worst Maelstrom Hills has seen in decades. I'll try to keep you guys updated provided we don't lose power. For now, this is your friendly Night Auditor JC logging out for the day!
