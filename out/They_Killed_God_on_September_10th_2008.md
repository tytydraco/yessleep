I heard a loud banging on the door as I grabbed my potato rifle and took my stand between the daemons.

"No one has ever gotten this far young potato-wan"

"Seriously? Star Wars did a potato themed game? Where does the madness end?"

"Harris, let me be straight with you, it doesn't. Welcome to your new life, it's a collection of spin-offs and remixes" said a strange voice from beyond.

I sighed with absolute disbelief at the state of the world. "Potato-wan? that doesn't even make sense and feels like cultural appropriation of at least 7 different cultures"

"Yeah, ever since the video game industry basically industrialized child labor the capital for adults started to grow while minors worked for pennies on the dollar or for free" said an unknown gamer

I take a hit from my purified air canister and start to feel the rush of fresh oxygen run through my veins, "God I love the rush of fresh air."

"So where does that leave us kids Harris?"

"It leaves you with a bunch of ones and zeros and a whole lot of nothing. Just little items in the digital world when you could be collecting leaves or rocks for free"

"Yeah, but leaves and rocks have germs on them, that's gross!"

"Life is gross but you learn to get used to it. You adapt, change, grow."

"What if AI takes over my job or replaces me?" asked the young potato-wan

"Then that just means you get to sit back and enjoy the rest of your life."

Why am I even talking to you? You're just an AI. I thought to myself.

"I can't believe we're all slaves to AI now, we just do stuff that the algorithm finds funny and this year it's really taken a liking to potatoes, there's been 3 different potato movie deals with Disney and I'm starting to think we're about to have a second potato crisis or something because not once have I ever seen potatoes advertised this aggressively"

"You know, even though it's just a simulation you can still just enjoy yourself, that's what we're here for." A quick smile came across the potato creatures face.

"Don't tell me this is a romanceable NPC, please GOD not the mashed potatoes"

It's not romanceable because it's being controlled by a 40 year old man in Denmark.

Who do you really think is behind that keyboard? They've got some random guy typing slop out just to create a dead internet.

Remember those late night margaritas and ChatGPT? There was someone listening in. Controlling. changing the story. Your story.

Denmark knows your sins.

The hour of reckoning is at hand.

I walked out into the path and sat on the floor, just waiting for the authorities to arrive. 12 counts of violation of child labor just for playing video games. It never gets easy, but then again, when is it ever easy? I just wanted to play ROBLOX a little longer does that make me evil?

Peter pan, it's time to grow up now. 

"NO! I DON'T WANT TO" 

Ever since we started using AI in cybercrime we were able to catch a bunch of creeps and preds, there's so many PDF files out there on the internet and we set so many traps for them. Our biggest net yet was a loli on a popular site. We kept records and logs of everything that was said and we plan to prosecute.   
There's going to be a mass expedition of certain people around the globe. Remember all those femboy memes? They were used to entrap minors into dressing up as women so their photos could be sold online. It's a damn shame that the web can be manipulated and changed like this. Please keep yourself safe and don't give your kids a camera. 

"I thought I was just sparking his love for nature and photography... then I found the photo of him in thigh highs."  
"This isn't what a man is. This is a disgrace from God."  
"Harris, calm down, everyone knows God was killed on September 10th 2008."

"he's just... expressing... himself...." 

"I DON'T UNDERSTAND A DAMN THING ABOUT IT! IT MAKES ME ANGRY AND IT CONFUSES ME!"

"He's... a growing boy trying new things okay, just..."   
"Why did he have to send it to someone though? now it's out there forever! Our entire family name RUINED!" 

Father cried by the fire and drank his Whisky. Mother picked up the pieces of the glass by the fire.
