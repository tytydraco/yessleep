The werewolf

Bayou Noir has always had a peculiar smell. A mixture of rotting moss, soggy wood and the rusty metal of abandoned boats in the swamp. But in recent days, this smell has become heavier, denser, almost suffocating. Walking through the narrow, dirty streets filled me with a strange feeling, as if the city itself was decomposing. The recession has wiped everything out; People live in rags, waiting for a miracle that will not come.

 

The bodies began to appear a week ago. First, an old man, who everyone said was half crazy, was found on the edge of the swamp. It was shattered in a way I've never seen before, even in the worst murder cases I've investigated. The smell of fresh blood and torn flesh was intense, invading my nostrils like a slap. The sight was almost unbearable, but the hunger... hunger was worse. With each body, it grew inside me, a devouring monster that I struggled to keep in check.

 

But it wasn't just hunger that tormented me. It was the smell. A different smell hung in the air, something that chilled me to the bone. It wasn't the familiar smell of a vampire. It wasn't the metallic, earthy scent I was used to smelling. It was something much wilder, primal. Something that made me think of dark forests, of animals lurking in the tall bush. It was a smell of wet fur, sweat, and fresh blood.

 

I knew I wasn't dealing with vampires. But, damn, I wish it was. I wanted it to be the Bellemonts, or any other damn vampire who wanted revenge. At least, I would know what to expect. But this? This thing that was tearing people apart on the streets? That was something else entirely. Something I've never faced before, not even in my worst nightmares.

 

Jeremiah came looking for me last night. He is still the same, despite the wrinkles and fatigue in his eyes. The weight of the years of investigation and the deaths he witnessed have turned him into an embittered man, but he still has that eagle eye, attentive to everything. He entered my hiding place with the same caution as always, as if at any moment I was going to jump on him. But it wasn't fear I saw in his eyes; it was respect. And maybe, just a little, compassion.

 

"Damon, there's something strange going on," he said, his face grim. "These deaths... This is not the work of humans. Nor vampires, from what you've taught me."

 

I knew he was right. I had been trying to get the idea out of my mind for days, but that smell, that feeling on my skin... It wasn't something I could ignore. I felt it deep in my bones. Something more cruel, more savage than a vampire was lurking in Bayou Noir. And he was teasing me.

 

"I know, Jeremiah," I replied, my voice hoarse from trying so hard to contain my hunger. "But that doesn't change anything. Whatever it is, I'm going to hunt this thing. And I'm going to kill her."

 

We didn't exchange any more words that night. He knew what I was about to do. We would go hunting together, just like in the old days. I, the dark protector of this cursed city, and Jeremiah, my only friend, the man who still considers me human despite everything he has ever seen.

 

That same night, we began our search. The streets were deserted, except for the wretches who still wandered around looking for food or a place to sleep. Bayou Noir was smothered with fear, and I could feel it in every shadow, in every whisper of the wind. The smell of the swamp mixed with the stench of fear, creating an atmosphere that made my skin crawl.

 

Then, the smell changed. It became more intense, more ferocious. An odor of wet fur and sweat began to invade my nostrils. Jeremiah felt it too, I saw him harden his jaw, his eyes attentive. We followed the smell, stronger and stronger, until we reached a narrow alley, where the air was almost impossible to breathe because it was so dense.

 

There, we found the body. Or what was left of it. It was a boy, maybe 14 years old. It was completely shattered, its limbs scattered on the ground as if severed by a gigantic animal. The smell of fresh blood mixed with the wild smell was so strong that it almost made me lose control. But that's not what made me freeze. It was the one next to the body.

 

A huge, hairy creature, with eyes glowing with inhuman fury, was standing there, staring at me. It was a werewolf. I never thought I'd see one, but there it was, a monstrosity made of muscles, claws, and fangs. I knew, deep in my soul, that I was facing something far more dangerous than any vampire.

 

Before I could react, the werewolf pounced on me. There was no time to think, only to act. My vampiric reflexes were all that saved me from being torn apart at that moment. He was fast, brutal, but I was faster. Still, his strength was almost impossible to contain. The smell of wet fur and fresh blood enveloped me, distracting me, making me falter.

 

Jeremiah shot the werewolf, but the bullets had no effect. He laughed, that deep, animalistic laugh that made the ground shake. I took advantage of the distraction to dig my claws into him, trying to push him away. But he just grunted, as if I were a mere nuisance. The battle was fierce, brutal, and I felt my strength waver. But I couldn't let that thing live.

 

With one last blow, I managed to seriously injure him. Blood gushed out, mixing with the unbearable odor that was already hanging in the air. The werewolf retreated, but he was not defeated. Before he could deliver the final blow, he fled into the darkness of the swamp, leaving behind a trail of destruction and death.

 

Jeremiah helped me up. He was injured, but still whole. The hunt was just beginning, and I knew that the fight against this werewolf would be unlike anything I had ever faced. He wasn't just a beast, he was a force of nature, something wild and untamed. But I was also a force, a shadow on the streets of Bayou Noir. I would hunt him down, and kill him, whatever the cost.

 

Now, the smell of blood and wet fur never leaves me. It is impregnated in me, like a constant reminder of what is lurking. Bayou Noir is in danger, and I'm the only one who can protect her. Every night, the swamp gets darker, denser, and I feel his presence, waiting, watching. But I'm no longer the man I once was. I am Damon Cordovil, the protector of this cursed city, and I will face this beast with everything I have.
