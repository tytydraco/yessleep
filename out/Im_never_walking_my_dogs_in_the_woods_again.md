This all started a few days ago. For some context I live in a neighborhood right next to some woods, with a lake right at its entrance. I take my dog Blu on walks through the woods pretty much everyday. she’s a German shepherd husky mix and loves sniffing and tracking, and exploring the woods.

It was Monday and I had taken my dog out into the woods at about 4:00 pm. one thing that was off is she seemed very nervous, her head was on a swivel and she was constantly sniffing, she pretty much dragged me home. This is odd because she’s fight a bear if it came to it, but I chalked it up to her being weird that day.

When we got home at around 4:50 pm. I went upstairs and into my bedroom closing the door behind me. not long after I sat down at my desk to play some video games, I hear the sound of blu booping the door with her nose and I let her in she comes in and lays down on my bed, which is off because she never does that and she stayed with me for the rest of night only leaving for food and coming right back.

That night I heard some weird yell/laugh noise coming from the woods it was high pitched and would break into a deep throaty sound. I got up kind of terrified and looked out the window (my window faces the woods) and I didn’t see anything and assumed it was a coyote or strange duck because I didn’t want to know what really made that noise. Blu however went into her guard mode, she sat straight up her ears stood up and she began to look around. I joked to myself that she was a big coward and went to bed not long after as it was quite late.

The next morning Blu was much calmer and stopped acting like the secret service. I got ready and went to school and came home at around 3:00pm and got ready to take her on a walk. Once we got to the woods Blu resumed her intense guard and began to stand much close to me and not pull like she usually does. I still foolishly took her down the deer paths deeper in the woods.

On the deer paths it was just wide enough for one person to walk and I’m pretty skinny. We walked for no longer than 45 minutes I think it was about 4:15 and the dune was beginning to set when I checked my phone. I realized my stupid mistake and began to pick up the pace home, because my parents would kill me if I was out past dark in the creepy woods. 4:20 pm, 4:25 pm, 4:30pm sunset.

After the sun set the woods went to sleep. Blu began frantically looking around terrified she began to almost whimper and her hair stood up. Naturally I also began to pick up pace and then it started, that same horrible laugh began again but it was closer louder more distinct. I practically began to run and we made it to the main clearing with the entrance to the woods, then. 

I spotted something off in the distance it was tall maybe 7-8ft impossibly skinny like a skeleton with skin, it was deathly pale and has arms so long it could have touched its own feet without bending down, it’s face twisted into a terrible smile laughing. It slowly turned to face me and I began to run the fastest I’ve ever run before. I don’t know if it chased I just ran home, when I got there I closed and locked the door and acted as if nothing happened because nobody would believe me.

I still hear that same laugh in the woods, it’s been two days since I ran into that thing I’m never taking my dog into those woods again.

If anyone know what it is I’d accept some help.
