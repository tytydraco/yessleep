The wallpaper in my apartment was a sickly shade of yellow, peeling away in long, dry strips like dead skin. I had been sitting in the same armchair for six hours, staring at the corner of the ceiling.

Dr. Aris had called it "sensory gating deficit." He said my brain was a broken radio, picking up static and interpreting it as voices. He gave me Clozapine—heavy, chalky pills that made my tongue feel like a piece of lead.

"They aren't there, Elias," he would say in that soft, patronizing voice. "The tall men with the needle-fingers. The way the walls pulse like a throat. It’s just your dopamine receptors misfiring."

I wanted to believe him. God, I tried.

At 11:42 PM, the scratching started. It began inside the radiator—a rhythmic, metallic scraping that lasted for twenty minutes. In the past, I would have closed my eyes and counted backward from one hundred. It’s just the pipes expanding, I told myself. Thermal expansion.

But then, the sound migrated. It crawled out of the radiator and moved across the floorboards. I watched the wood. I watched it with an intensity that made my vision blur. Slowly, agonizingly, the floorboards began to bow upward, as if something incredibly heavy was stepping on them from underneath the solid oak.

"It’s not real," I whispered. My voice was a dry croak.

Then, the first "hallucination" appeared. It emerged from the shadow of my coat rack. It was nearly seven feet tall, its limbs as thin as willow branches, draped in a translucent, oily membrane. It didn't have a face—just a cluster of wet, blinking eyes arranged in a vertical line down its torso.

I watched it for an hour. It didn't move fast. It moved with the agonizing slowness of a clock hand. It reached out a limb, the joints clicking like a bag of marbles, and touched the edge of my coffee table.

In the past, my hand would have passed right through it. Hallucinations don't have mass.

But the table creaked. The wood splintered under the creature's touch. A glass of water tipped over, the liquid spilling across the floor, soaking into the carpet.

"No," I gasped, the leaden weight of the medication making my heart thrum. "You're a projection. My brain is misfiring."

The creature leaned in. I could smell it now. It didn't smell like a hospital or a pharmacy. It smelled like the deep, pressurized salt of the ocean floor and ozone. It opened a slit near its collarbone, and a sound came out—not a voice, but a frequency that made my teeth ache.

“We are tired... of being... invisible,” it vibrated.

I grabbed my bottle of pills and threw it at the thing. The plastic bottle didn't fly through the air and hit the wall. It hit the creature's chest with a dull thud and fell to the floor. The creature picked up a single pill with two needle-like fingers. It crushed the medicine into a fine white powder.

"If I'm crazy," I screamed, "why can I feel the wind when you move?"

I stood up, my legs shaking, and ran to the bathroom. I locked the door and stared into the mirror. This was my ritual. Dr. Aris said mirrors were "grounding."

But as I watched, my reflection didn't mimic me. My reflection stayed still, staring back with an expression of absolute, soul-shattering pity. Behind my reflection, in the "mirror world" of my bathroom, dozens of the eye-covered creatures were huddled together, their limbs intertwined like a nest of snakes.

I realized then, with a coldness that turned my blood to slush, that the medication wasn't meant to stop the hallucinations. It was meant to dim my vision. The world I thought was real—the world of parks, and jobs, and doctors—was the hallucination. The "static" I was picking up wasn't a broken radio. I was the only radio in the world that was tuned to the right station.

I heard a knock on the bathroom door.

"Elias? It's Dr. Aris. I let myself in with the emergency key. You missed our check-in."

"Doctor!" I yelled, pressing my back against the door. "They're here! They're solid! They broke the table!"

"Elias, open the door. You’re having a breakdown. I have the order for the inpatient ward right here."

I unlocked the door, desperate for a human face. Dr. Aris stood there, his clipboard in hand. He looked normal. He looked safe.

But then I looked at his shadow.

His shadow didn't look like a man in a suit. His shadow was a sprawling, multi-limbed mass that covered the entire hallway. And as Dr. Aris reached out to touch my arm, I saw his "human" hand flicker. For a split second, it wasn't skin. It was the same oily membrane I had seen on the creature.

"You're one of them," I whispered.

Dr. Aris stopped smiling. His eyes didn't move, but the skin on his forehead split open, revealing a row of wet, blinking eyes that matched the thing in my living room.

"We tried to keep you sedated, Elias," he said, his voice now vibrating with that same horrible frequency. "It's so much more painful for the cattle when they can see the butcher."

He stepped toward me, and the walls of the apartment finally gave up the illusion. The yellow wallpaper dissolved, revealing that I wasn't in an apartment at all. I was in a cage made of bone, suspended in a vast, dark cathedral of flesh. Thousands of people were in similar cages, all of them staring blankly into space, their mouths moving as they talked to "doctors" and "families" that weren't there.

I wasn't a schizophrenic man in a messy apartment. I was a conscious mind in a harvest field, and the medicine had finally worn off.
