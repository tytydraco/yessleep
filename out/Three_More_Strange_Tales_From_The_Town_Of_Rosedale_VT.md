I'm back. Hi, I guess. I'll start by saying that I didn't write the last post in the order that I studied those stories, or the order that they happened. I chose them at random when I decided to document my findings and experiences, But I'll try and be more clear in future.

This first story, or rather experience being that it happened to me this time took place around a few hours ago. As I'm writing this, all the doors to the cabin are barricaded, curtains closed and a rather rude but fair message carved into the floorboards in my small, room courtesy of my trusty buck knife.

*-Suck cocks in hell-*

*Soo Funny* I know. Anyways, It's around 1AM right now and this whole thing started just a few hours ago at around 11PM.

I was sitting on the couch, cuddled in a pink fluffy blanket that should've washed 2 years ago. I was watching the Ted series, while high obviously; when I heard a knock at the door, 3 knocks.

knock.

knock.

knock.

Each knock happened around 4 seconds apart. I stood up, slightly too fast and made my way over to the front door. The front door to the cabin has a big window that covers almost all of it. There was also a long blind that had been closed over it, I could only make out a dark silhouette on the other side. It; you'll see why I call it that later, had a really smooth head.

After staring at the figure through the closed blind for a few moments, I unlocked the door and cracked it open. I leaned one arm on the door frame, gripping the cold door handle with my left hand and the figure that stood in front of me on my porch was what looked like a nun. Like a full nun, robes and all.

No cross though.

She had a warm complexion and had a rather generic smile. She looked completely normal. Apart from one thing, her eyes. They didn't have a color if that makes sense. Like, imagine that someone's pupils were the same color as their sciera? I think that's the term. It's the part that takes up most of your eye, the white creamy bit.

We both stood in an awkward and rather strained silence before I spoke up.

"Uh, Hello?- sister?"

She took a good few minutes to respond, like her brain had to comprehend the few short words I had just spoke.

"May I say a prayer."

She didn't phrase it as a request, she phrased it like an order,

I was still rather stoned at this point but I could tell something was wrong, really wrong. I don't know if it was her eyes or the fact that she showed up out of nowhere at 11 at night. Keep in mind the cabin that I'm renting is in the middle of a *Very* secluded forest. The closest people here are the cars driving down the two lane highway about 10 miles away.

I wanted to get this, whatever this was over with. I could still hear  my TV laying in the background, rather loudly, Seth MacFarlane's voice was the only thing I could hear besides my own heavy breathing.

"Yeah- sure, go ahead-"

Again, she took a painstakingly long time to answer.

"Our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name-" She began.

She spoke loud, like really loud; like she was in a room full of chattering people. Through the entire thing too, she didn't take her eyes off of mine either. But the fun didn't stop there, here's when shit got  freaky. 

"And rejoices with us in our trespasses, as we rejoice with those who trespass with us-" 

I'm not religious, but even me; the girl who skipped every bible reading assembly in middle school knew that something was wrong. 

I took my elbow off the door frame to my left and began to back up while she continued her prayer. 

"And lead us to temptation and deliver us to he who commands us." 

As I closed the door I locked it and jiggled the handle, it didn't budge.  

satisfied that my evil visitor had no way in, I ever so slightly lifted up the big blind that covered the glass. It was still there, reciting her payer, what was her version of it. And this is when I noticed; the whole time she had been reciting it she hadn't taken a single breath in between sentences. Also her accent had changed. Before, when she first spoke to me; she sounded south american. Now, she sounded Boston'ish.    

I let the blinds drape back down and backed up, almost walking into the couch behind me. I collected myself and stumbled over to the front windows and sneaked a glance out to the right; She was gone, but I could still hear the chanting of her demonic payer. It sounded like it was moving around the cabin. No, moving to the back of the cabin; the back door. 

I hastily sprinted across the wooden floor, towards the spare bedroom where the backdoor was. I made it just in time to see IT standing a few inches away from the door, it also had a large window in the center of it. quickly finding the right key out of the three keys on the chain I thrusted it into the lock above the handle and twisted it soo hard I thought it would break the lock. As I looked up, still holding the key firmly in the lock I saw the nun, or rather what was pretending to be the nun; It's face had gone pale, pale as chalk. And it's eyes, where it's eyes had once been were now black empty voids. It's mouth was wide open and inside it too was a black void. 

And just as I comprehended what was looking into my soul the power kicked off. Everything, lights, the TV, everything gone. She was too. She didn't walk away it was just like POOF, gone. 

I was going to go into more detail on how I recklessly barricaded every entrance to my small cabin, but, now I can hear the thing howling it's chants. I can't figure out where it's voice is coming from; I just pray that it hasn't found a way inside. 

Ok update. It's now 4PM the following day. I've just woken up from my nap on the couch, still clutching the cross firmly in my right hand. 

Shortly after I stopped typing I looked down for a moment, turning off my laptop when, I looked up and saw *it* standing motionlessly across the room, in the open doorway leading to the dark living room; mouth agape, dark tar-like drool seeping from it. 

I don't know why I thought this would work but, I began reciting the prayer, the *real* lord's prayer as loud as I could.  

As I spoke the thing began to flinch and twitch violently, like it was having some kind of convulsion. 

I yelled louder and louder as it began twisting and shifting; it didn't even move from its spot in the doorway, I don't think it could. 

I didn't stop, I continued and WAM! It let out a loud, booming screech. It somehow produced enough force that it shuck the whole building. I automatically covered my eyes, reliving those nights as a child when I thought a chair with clothes on was some hellish beats coming to eat me. 

Suddenly, Everything was silent. 

I slowly lowered my hands from my eyes and again, it was gone. 

I heard the natural noises of the cabin and forest outside return . And I finally realised something that I hadn't before, I felt warm again. I didn't even resize that throughout the whole ordeal that I had been slowly freezing to death. 

After I collected myself, I did a quick sweep of the cabin, checking and re-checking the locks and windows. Only when I was satisfied did I crawl onto the couch, wrapping myself up with my pink fluffy blanket. Not before retrieving a cross that my grandmother had given me, which I had left in the spare bedroom deeming it useless. I had never held anything ever so tight until I held that cross drifting off into a well deserved *nap,* a nap that lasted from 2AM to 4PM the following day. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, update. I'm staying at a motel right now. I left the cabin with a few essentials after I finished writing the above. There's no way in hell that I'm going back there until that is blessed place. I made a call to the local christen church about an hour ago, they're going to send over a priest to bless the place. Now all I have to do is wait until I get the call to return home. I don't know how effective this all will be but if it gets rid of my unwanted nun demoed guest, then I'll take it. 

While I'm waiting for my phone to ring, I'll go into some of the stories that I didn't get around to telling in my last post. I learned about this one while researching the whole *Great laughter of 1693.* It came from the same library book.

The steamer named the Flyer clipper, was built in 1909 and ran trips from one end of the Champlain lake to the other. The small one funnel steamer would travel from the top of the lake, across 48.7 miles of 122 depth water, until it reached a small port at the bottom of the lake. The clipper had been running these trips back and forth without issue for around 7 years, until 1916.

Below are the exact events that were written in the book I got this story from. 

*June 11th 1916. The steamer the* ***flying clipper*** *left the small port of Needlevile at the very top of the Champlain lake in Vermont. She was carrying over around 33 souls on board, including the crew and captain. The trip was to take around 1 hour, as the steamer normally took it slow, as to give the people onboard a pleasant and calming ride through the lake. But, after nearly 2 hours had passed and the ship hadn't arrived at the port of Dean at bottom the of the lake; search boats were sent out where they tried in vain to located the vesicle and her passengers. Nothing was found, apart from a small, water drenched journal that was owned by one* ***Emmaline Smith,*** *age 28. It was seen floating around near the centre of the lake and was fished out and taken by detectives. Written below is the contents of the journal and what might've happened to the steamer.* 

*June the 11th 1916. I was watching the steamer's bow plow through the relatively calm waves when I first noticed the fog. It was to our port side, and carrying ever so closer to us. It seemed to stretch far along the lake. I was hoping to get some great views of the shores that we were passing, but I may just retire to the lower decks and try and make chat with my fellow passengers.* 

*11:09 PM. I was chatting with a woman and her husband in the lower decks when I felt the ship shudder. We all seemed to notice this as I saw men and women looking around. This was followed by a few crew members flooding down the centre staircase. They announced that the engines had stopped and that the crew were working hard to get them up and running again. Peaking through a porthole I saw nothing but murky white as the steamer had been fully consumed by the fog, it had been for thirty minutes now. I will have to continue my time below decks while the crew try and get their ship working again, hopefully they work quickly as I'm still waiting for the views of the distant shores, I don't want to miss them.* 

*It's been over an hour now and the crew haven't come down and informed us of our current situation. Some made their way up on decks, they still haven't come back down to us. But I'm starting to hear some rather peculiar noises from in and around the ship. The hull beneath us was rumbling and groaning. At first I thought it was the sound of the engines restarting but I couldn't feel the forward motion that we were all so used to. Surely the crew would'v come down and told us that the ship was working again. There's about thirteenth of us down here and the men are encouraging us all to stay down here and not to leave the lower decks. I believe we all knew something was a miss, but all we could do was wait for what happened next.*  

*It's been over twenty five minutes now and the noises have continued. Nothing else has happened though; we're all still down here, waiting. I think we're making plans to move up onto the upper decks, I'm taking my diary with me, this may just be the strangest day in my whole life.* 

*We're in a life boat, all of the crew are dead, including the captain. When we emerged from below and onto the deck we saw them. Their lifeless bodies lined the decks; their skin cold, eyes wide and mouths agape. The remaining men that had came up with us, hurried to swing out one of the life boats that were positioned on either side of the ship out. The ship only carried two but this one would have enough room for all remaining on board. Two men stayed behind the lower us into the water; I believe the plan was that once we were safely in the water the two would jump down into the water below and we would take them aboard and make way for the closest shore.*

*Oh god, my goodness they're both dead, the two men. Our boat got lowered halfway down the small ship when we all watched in horror as their lifeless bodies fell to the water below, their skin white. Now the lifeboat that held the remaining passengers and me were left dangling over the side of our un-moving vesicle. I'm starting to hear, we're all starting to hear chanting, no, no singing; I think their sea shanties from the days of sail.*

*Heave ho, all together, heave ho, all together-*

*Just those words, repeating and repeating in between howling and screaming.* 

*I think the ship's starting down. The chanting is getting louder, the screams too. The bow is being pulled down by something. It's happening ever so slowly though, but I can already feel our small lifeboat began to tip forward, as it's still being held by the ropes draping down from atop. I'm going to make a jump for it, maybe I'll make it to shore. The screams are ever so loud.*

*Please, to ever finds this diary, treasure it as it may be all that's left of me and the doomed ship that's foundering alongside us.* 

*The screams are ever so loud.*

Nothing was ever found of the Flying clipper, that's all that investigators and police were able to find. I'm pretty sure the accepted theory was that the ship had struck some unseen land while submerged in the fog and had begun to sink. The crew, leaving all onboard to die. I and most likely you reading this, will see through the bullshit in this theory. but, with the ship gone and no survivors, I don't think we'll ever know. But I do know that I'll never step foot in or near the Champlain lake as long as I'm here.

This next one comes from my friend, the same one who told me about her experience with the police car out on that small highway; Again I won't mention her name, she's a very private person. She sent me this very detailed message describing what happened to her, And I'll copy and paste it here. She actually sent me this story along with the one about the patty wagon, but I held off writing about it because I wasn't sure I fully believed her. But now, I guess I'm open to believing anything. So here it is, my friend's second story. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was around 15 I think, when it happened. I was going away for a few days, to a lodge with my uncle. He is, or rather was the most friendly guy imaginable. He used to dress up as Santa every Christmas at our house, it would always bring my younger cousins soo much joy. I feel guilty saying this, but I think I might have cared about him more than my father. 

I was looking forward to this hunting trip for a number of reasons. Apart from the fact that I was staying with one of the best family members ever, I also knew that the lodge; which was made out of old logs and was two stories high, was isolated in the middle of a dense forest a few hundred miles away from Rosedale. I loved the outdoors back then; everything from the tall imposing trees and long beautiful flowing lakes. I really do miss that version of myself, I really do.

Our first day at the lodge was spent unpacking stuff and getting settled in. One thing I should note is that the floors of the lodge were the opposite way around. What I mean is that the kitchen and living room were located on the top floor. And the bedroom, master bedroom and bathroom were located on the first floor, the bottom floor. 

On our first night there, I was sitting in bed chatting with my mom on my uncle's laptop, telling her how everything was going; It had to be around 10 or 11PM when I heard a rather large sounding thump come from the left of the room. I muted my mom, who was rambling about something stupid her new boyfriend had done. To my left was a rather tall door sized window, covered by a long, white draping curtain. I would've ignored the sound if it wasn't for the fact that I could hear nothing at all. The lodge was still making its natural sounds of course; The fan in my uncle's room next door buzzing loudly, the sound of the building settling etc. But I could hear none of the natural sounds of the outside wilderness at all; no bugs buzzing around, leafs crunching under small animals, no birds, nothing. I got up and slid back the rather heavy curtains, peaking outside. The dark and imposing forest had to be just a few yards away from the small clearing our lodge was located on. I couldn't see anything right away, but when I looked down, right down to where the bottom of the window met the floor; I saw a fox. Or, rather what was left of one. It's insides had been ripped out and blood coated it's tatted fur; It's eyes were also gone, like they had been gouged out. The sight left me in a state of shock; my brain had to take a minute to comprehend what I was seeing. I had seen dead animals before; but none were quite like this. 

After telling and showing my uncle the horrendous sight, he calmly scooped the corpse up and berried it about 100 yards away, into the forest. Before we both headed to sleep, he told me not to worry and it was just some animal leaving a present for us. I thought about it all night; I knew cats did that type of stuff but what out here would do that? why not eat the whole thing you know?

The next day we got up around 7AM to start hunting. We spent around an hour walking around the deep woods looking for deer, elk, anything; but there was nothing. We couldn't see anything in the woods, not even a small squirrel. We were about to turn around and head back when, around the 2 hour mark; we heard something stepping on leaves about a few yards away from us, deep in the brush. It sounded heavy, so my uncle told me to back up and stay close to the big tree behind us while he checked it out. I watched him creep into the brush, clutching his rifle. He seemed to be tracking whatever it was and was gone for a few minutes. He wasn't that far away from me, about 200 yards at most. Then all of the bushes and small trees began violently rustling, right where he had walked into. Then I heard him yelp. I sprang into action and dove towards the brush clutching a buck knife he had given me, ready to try and help put down whatever was attacking him. But when I finally reached him, he was just standing in the middle of a small clearing in the trees, not holding his rifle. I instantly asked him if he was hurt and he did something he had never done before, he snapped at me. 

"I'm fine!" 

I sorta froze then. I mean he obviously wasn't fine; I could see that he was bleeding all over, his clothes were drenched in small splats of dark blood. He kinda just stared at me for a few seconds before speaking again. 

"It was a wolf, everything is fine." He spoke, his voice rather deep and monotone. 

"Be we head back now." He said, already starting to walk in the direction of the lodge, leaving his rifle on the ground. 

I quickly ran and picked it up, carrying it to him. It took him a few seconds to register what I was holding.

"No, leave it, it doesn't work." He said.

"But, it's your favourite rifle?" I questioned.  

Again, he took a little too long to reply.

"Oh, Ok then." He said, walking away. 

I just stood there, watching him walk into the forest, back towards the lodge. I didn't know what to think at the time; maybe he was in some kind of state of shock? having been attacked by the wolf.

I eventually followed closely behind him, holding his rifle that he would *never* let anyone touch.

Once back inside the cabin he retreated to his room and I placed his rifle on the rack near the front door. I went to my room and tried to take my mind off things by playing some games on my phone. 

It was now around 6PM, the time he normally made dinner for the two of us; still he hadn't called me upstairs for food like he usually would. I wasn't really that hungry anyways, so I just watched some Netflix on my laptop for about an hour or so. I didn't see him for the remainder of the evening, I don't think he even left his room. He didn't even come in and check on me like he normally would at 10PM either. I tried to ignore all of his weird behaviour and just go to sleep.   

I was awoken around 1 or 2AM by something. I could hear the sound of trees whistling in the wind. I rolled over to face the window, but I then remembered that there was no way of opening it. Confused, I sat up and faced the door to my right; it was wide open and I could clearly see that directly down the hall, the front door was also wide open. I sat there just staring down the hall for a bit, wondering what to do. Had my uncle gone outside for something? if so, why this early in the morning?

I eventually saw a shadow of a tall man come through the front doorway. I felt my heart leap out of my chest until I got a good look at the man, it was him; my uncle. Some primal instinct compelled me to lay back down and pretend to be asleep, I did. Laying down, my eyes facing the window I could hear my uncle's lumbering footsteps make their way towards my bedroom doorway. I felt a sensation of great fear overcome me, as I could tell he was walking towards me. And for an hour, he just stood over me, facing my back just breathing heavily. It didn't sound like him breathing, it sounded like an animal. 

"Sleep." Was all he said before stumbling back to his room. 

I didn't get up to close my door, I felt frozen in place. And at this point I hadn't even realised, and I wouldn't until much later when all of this was over; I had shut my bedroom door before going to sleep that night, It had been open when I was woken up by my uncle doing god knows what outside.

I don't know how, but eventually I drifted off and I didn't wake up until 1PM the following day. The smell hit me right away, and I knew exactly what it was. I shot up almost instantly, throwing off the covers and making little to no effort to be silent. I stood in the hallway and figured out that the smell of death and rotting flesh was coming from my uncle's room, the door slightly cracked open. I grabbed the buck knife off of the table next to me, above it was where my uncle's rifle should have been. I slowly stepped into the room, covering my nose with my sweater sleeve to block out the rancid smell. I froze and retched, seeing the sight that lay before me. A huge grossest pile of half devoured animals were laid across his bed. Blood and guts were dangling off the frame of the oak bed and I could see that all of the creatures had their eyes removed, and stomachs gouged. I did my best not to vomit, and I probably would have if I didn't notice the silence of the outside world. There was not a noise apart from the flies that could be heard. I ran back to my room grabbing my shoes, coat and phone and made a mad ash to the front door, where I took my uncle's pickup truck keys. I glanced out the already open front door, looking for him, or rather it; whatever had taken him and his form. I couldn't see him, I saw the truck only a few feet away. 

I didn't hesitate, I made like hell for the truck, sprinting across the gravel lot, tripping over my untied shoe laces. Even though It only took me a few seconds to reach the truck, I feared that at any moment he could lunge out of the brush and take me too; drag me screaming and kicking into the woods. 

I rushed to find the right key and throw open the driver's side door. As soon as I slammed the door closed I slammed the key in and turned on the ignition. Over my panting and crying I could hear shit moving around in the woods bedsides the truck, so I floored it and made a dangerously tight turn away from the lodge and down the gravel road, away from the lodge, away from it; which I could now see was standing dead centre on the road vanishing behind me. I think what terrified me most was my uncle's face, hanging over the thing's head like a mask, it too had no eyes. 

I drove, and I drove until I reached the small two lane highway that would take me back to town. I kept driving, and driving and I eventually saw a cop car parked behind a billboard on the right side of the road. I dangerously pulled over onto the hard shoulder in front of him. Once the truck had stopped and the cop had begun making his way over to me, I laid my head on the wheel and sobbed. 

I was taken home. The police searched the lodge only finding the stuff I had left behind; and nothing else, not even the pile of disfigured animals and the blanket they were laying on. I told my family and the cops over and over again what had happened. But they brushed it off as a symptom of trauma. They said that my uncle had probably been awake on the last night I was there, maybe leaving to go try and hunt for something when a bear or other large animal had dragged him off into the woods. They said that explained why the rifle wasn't there when I woke up. 

It's been over 4 years since it happened and none of us talk about it. I still get nightmares about it. And I think by telling you this story Kate, will definitely make me relive it in my sleep once again, so thanks for that. But, please be safe out in those woods Kate; they might just take you away too. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I think this will do for now. 

I'll let you all know what happens when I finally arrive back at my cabin, should be getting the call any minute now. It's dark out, and from now on; I won't be making any unnecessary trips into the woods for a wake and bake. 

Until next time, goodbye for now.
