I was taking a hike into the woods. I was all alone, as usual, when I found a black box. I decided to open it. Inside, there was what looked like a pair of goggles.

I decided to pick them up, as I was curious about them. As I kept walking, I reached the city. I decided to put the goggles on. 

As soon as I did that, I saw the sun getting dark, even though it was midday. I saw demons floating around among people. And I saw one enter a man. He attacked his wife. So ferocious was this assault, that the woman was killed.

People walked as in a trance, oblivious to all this. I then removed my glasses.

The sun was shinning as usual. There was no man and no woman.

I was so scared I wanted to throw the glasses away. But something inside of me wanted me to keep them.

Later that day, on the news, I heard a solar eclipse would happen the next day. I knew about it, but I forgot.

The next day, it happened. I watched it unfold from my balcony. Then, the day went by as usual. At the news I heard that, during the eclipse, someone beat his wife to death on the street. Creepy!

The next day, I was at the library. I was reading a book. I decided to put my glasses on. Then, I saw demons crawling all over the shelves. I saw them leave a trail of fire behind, as they moved.

I saw the shelves catch fire. I saw the fire spread. Then, I took them off. The next day, on the news, I heard there was a fire at the library. The building burned down. Twelve people lost their lives.

I was browsing the internet, when I heard a noise. A picture fell off the wall. I didn't pay attention. Moments later, I heard a loud noise coming from the kitchen.

I went there, but nothing was wrong. In the living room, the TV turned on by itself. I heard footsteps. I put the glasses back on and I saw the ghosts walking all around me. Three of them.

Three people. I remember seeing one of them at the library the other day. I tried touching one of them. They talked to me. They were angry with me because I didn't prevent the library fire.

I took off the glasses. I couldn't hear them anymore. The next day, I was walking downtown.

I put my glasses back 
on and saw the ocean. Except it was now made of blood. 

I saw something like a meteorite that was shining like a star plunge into the ocean. Then, I saw a huge wave that came forth unto the city and swept everything. Flooded everything and killed many.

I took them off, and e everything was back to normal. The ocean was calm. And blue, as usual.

But now I knew. I decided to warn the authorities. I couldn't just tell them about the glasses, as they'd lock me up.

Instead, I thought. And thought. I realized what I saw was a tsunami. I browsed the internet. I found a potential warning due to a storm that could form. 

Armed with this, I went to the mayor's office.

I convinced him of the risk, and, after talking to experts, they indeed studied the reports I found and decided to issue a warning. People will be evacuated.

Then, a man in a black suit, pretty tall, said he was FBI, decided to question me. Apparently, they thought I had something to do with the library fire, as I was present at the scene.

I was taken into custody and into an interrogation room. It begun. Something made me put my glasses on. I saw then, the agent's true form: A demon.

Sharp teeth, twisted face, eyes dark as two black holes. 

I fought to escape. The agent followed me. I ran. My glasses fell off. The agent was back to normal again. The chase was on. I left the headquarters. 

There were cars everywhere. I entered one and paid the driver to drive the hell outta there! And that's how I escaped both a demon-agent and a tsunami wave.

I still use them occasionally, but they no longer show me the imagery I witnessed before. I still see ghosts and spirits when wearing them in certain places, but they are peaceful. Benign.
