The house I lived in was a two story structure set on a hill. It was situated in a developing area that straddled two counties. We sat on the corner of two roads and could witness over the years the ever constant march of progress, which in this case took the form of row upon row of cookie cutter suburban homes being thrown up. The view from the other road, which the other county was in, was a pleasant and consistent view of natural woods and golden fields. My family never fully understood why the the more rural county never sold its land for development and even after attending multiple small town meetings we never got a clear answer. Reasons ranging from “we simple don't need to sell.” to “this land is straight up cursed.” had us scratching our heads and a little worried. Ultimately after some personal research came up with nothing we settled the issue and just enjoyed the fact we could relax with a view that included the occasional deer traveling through tall grass and, at night, an owl swooping toward various rodents.



There was a downside however, and that was the drunk speeder. For you see our corner lacked certain signage and due to that, every once in a while we would get some crazy stooge under some influence racing by our home at speeds well above the unspoken limit. The loud engine revving they do after hitting that turn caused all of us to have a small moment of still alertness. Like prey pausing to check for predators. Not all were lucky though. In the ten or so years I lived here, I've been privy to at least a dozen crashes through our fence and one event where a car went and settled into our spare bedroom. The subsequent insurance payouts have been nice for more than just repairs. Used to settle debts and pay for the occasional trip. It was simple and dangerous but it was our life. Now that I look back I long for those times.



The first time I heard that sound I assumed someone was seriously hurt. At midnight I was awoken to the loud cry of an individual outside the house. Since my room was on the second floor and had a window overlooking one of the streets I raced to see what the commotion was. What I saw caused me to experience equal parts confusion and discomfort. In the middle of the street about thirty to forty feet from the house I could see a rotund clown sitting and crying. He didn't look all that different from your run-of-the-mill type clowns, except the material he was dressed in looked cheap and aged. From what I could see He didn't look hurt but was wailing so loudly. When he cried my name out I instinctively ducked down and hid. How did he know who I was? Did he know me? I don't remember ever meeting him. I peeked over the bottom edge of my window frame. He had stopped crying, instead he was staring directly at me. Grinning.



I raced down the stairs to my parent's room, screaming my head off. My mother and father drowsily came to alertness, realizing my distress. As they wiped their eyes I stuttered out a panicked depiction of what I had just seen. I could tell they thought I was just experiencing a bad nightmare but with a reassuring sigh my dad picked up his metal bat and my mom armed herself with a small pistol they kept locked up. Armed and with flashlights, my parents explored the front of the house, the street, and even some of the area around the property. I stood clinging to the door, panning my view around in frantic motion, comforted only by our little dog, Mitzy. Twenty minutes passed when my parents returned and shook their heads, discovering nothing outside.



I was escorted back to bed and what I saw was explained away as just a vivid nightmare or sleep paralysis. But I knew what I saw, and the following night at midnight I heard that loud wail once again. He appeared every night, always crying and yelling for my name. 'Come out' he'd angrily demand. I couldn't sleep and every time I'd bother my parents again about the scary crying clown I could see their patience deplete. For weeks they'd go out and explore only to come back with nothing to report. Eventually it broke them and my dad took me by the arm and dragged me outside to 'show me' once and for all. I was forcefully brought to the middle of that road and in the bright moonlight we looked and there was nothing. I scanned and scanned but it was quiet. Nothing but the night's cool breeze shifting the plants and trees. I caught my breath for a moment of reassurance only to hear the rapid jingle of bells and for that clown to burst out from the bushes and race directly toward me. I yelled and fell upon the cold pavement. My parents had a shocked look of surprise, not at the clown but by my sudden outburst.



I motioned to the clown and breathlessly pointed but they couldn't see him, instead they raced toward me but not before the clown could reach me. He grabbed me and with a twisted snarl dug his hands into my body. It burned and stung, like I was being torn into. My vision filled to a blurry white and I fell unconscious.



I awoke to the sound of mechanical rhythmic beeping and murmured speech. I was surrounded by doctors and nurses who were quite relieved at my recovery. Everything felt off, my senses a fuzzy discomfort that slowly worked their way back to some kind of normalcy. I looked to see where the clown had attacked me and to my surprise I couldn't spot any wounds. Doctor Ramirez explained that I had a very severe seizure and was lucky my parents were so close when it happened. I tried to protest and explain I was attacked but he rebuffed it with an mere explanation.



“Its on the rarer side but some people do tend to see things before an epileptic attack.” he said.



“I know this is traumatic and scary for someone your age but I assure you we are all here to help. With some proper medicine and a dose of preventative preparation we can make sure your life will be minimally impacted in the future.” He tried to reassure me.



I was tired and stressed so everyone eventually left me to recover for the day in the medical room. The room was large and had two other individuals sleeping in beds to my left and right. The TVs that were hanging on the ceiling all had the same channel set and cycled through various cartoons. I explored the room I was in, afraid the clown that attacked me might be present. To my relief it was just a normal recovery room. I settled in and watched what was on. After a number of hours a show I hadn't seen cycled through the channel. It was like a retro block of entertainment had started, complete with narration. 'And now its time for our throwback hour' a cartoon football player would pop up, throw his ball and the screen would transition to the old show. The screen tore a bit and became a bit fuzzy when the title 'The Jamboree Jigglers' flew up.



It was odd, the show played like it was a competitor to the Teletubbies but with its own cast of colorful characters. There was Mr. Leapy, who liked to jump around whenever something good happened. Mr. Quick, he liked to run around and often got impatient. Ms. Solve, she was a teacher and often led the group to various clues. Lastly there was the clown, Mr. Tumbles. I immediately felt sick and paranoid when I saw him. He looked exactly like the one who attacked me that night. But I've never seen this show. This is impossible. I watched closely but all he would do was play games with the others and trip a lot. In fact his whole gimmick seemed to be that he was clumsy.



I didn't want to finish the show and reached for the button to call the nurse. I wanted her to change the channel. I froze. Standing next to me blocking the button was Mr. Tumbles, grinning as he peered down on me. I screamed and fell out of my bed. I scrambled to the corner of the room, pushing various objects away from me, desperate to get distance. Mr. Tumbles just silently laughed at me and pulled out a large piece of paper and a marker from his suit. The doctors and nurses rushed in to assist me and I pleaded that “He's there! He's here in this room right now!” Yelling my head off.



In desperation they tried to calmly tell me that there was nothing. I even saw some of them pass right through him unintentionally as they moved about the room, looking for him. Mr. Tumbles wrote on the large paper, 'I want to play' He wrote some more, 'If you do I won't hurt you again'.



I was given medication to calm down. I skeptically took it. All I did was stare at him, just standing and pretending to wait until we had some privacy. Like he needed it. He'd jump and celebrate mockingly when the last nurse left the room. As I felt the kick of the pills I prayed he'd disappear but was left laying in bed disappointed as more and more time ticked by. He rushed up and wrote 'So what do you say?'. For a brief lucid moment I tried to rationalize what was happening, to explain away what was going on with me.



“Why me?” I pleaded.



'Because you ignored me for so long' he relied through gritted growls.



“What do you want?” I asked.



He didn't write anything new but merely tapped on the word play from the other sheet. So I nodded in agreement and when I awoke after my little nap our first game of hide and seek began in that hospital. Observing this new behavior of me, Doctor Ramirez assumed and explained to my parents that due to my mental state and trauma I was developing 'certain' behaviors . He believed it'd go away with time, proper treatment, and therapy. It didn't.



For weeks Mr. Tumble played games with me. At first it was fine, I'd just set aside an hour or so to play when he demanded it. The longer we spent time together the more he'd begin to ask at inappropriate times. It went from him stopping me playing video games or doing homework to getting up from the middle of dinner to engage with his 'fun'. Whenever I'd protest he'd just raise his white gloved hand as a threat. Play or pain was my choice. This was slowly turning into my own little hell.



As the weeks turned to months it only got worse. The games came at more awkward moments, like in the middle of class. He'd have me play in front of others and made to look like a fool. The demands also began to slowly change. It went from things like tag, hide and seek, hopscotch, and scavenger hunts to stealing a teacher's desk calendar, mixing weird things into my mothers cooking, putting glue into my dogs shampoo, and popping my friend's bike tires. From time to time I would also catch Mr. Tumble's form change. It was only bits here and there, like an ear, a finger, or foot but I knew deep down this clown exterior was not what he truly looked like.



Eventually the tasks got violent. First with animals then eventually, people. “This is getting really mean.” I said.



I flinched when that hand rose. He smiled and tapped his large paper, 'Stab your dad' it read. I refused, shaking my head. I immediately felt that jolt of searing pain rush up my body from my arm. His hands dug into me. It felt like his fingers were under my skin. I blacked out from his horrid touch and awoke a few hours later to my parents tearfully caring for me. Their gaze had a deep look of remorse and I could hear them blaming themselves for having dragged me outside that one night months ago. They promised over and over they'd never do anything like that again and that they were going to help me through this. Mr. Tumbles just stood staring angrily behind them.



I couldn't rest that day. When I was alone I begged him to stop with the games and the pain. He just stood there, mouth agape and stared in disgusted judgment of me. He pulled his marker out and wrote 'One more game'. Relief washed over me and in my excited exhaustion I agreed, unaware of the nod my head made. Follow the sound of the bell he wrote. I was told to blindfold myself and to listen for the jingle of his bell.



It was late and I was led through the house, occasionally bumping into walls or furniture. It was quiet, the only thing to protest my movement was Mitzy, she'd stand and press against me like she knew something was wrong and when I felt grass under my foot, I felt a pit in my stomach. Where was he leading me I thought. I attempted to pull the blind but was greeted by the angry gaunt face of a horribly rotted form. Gone was the clown facade and what stood was this twisted tortured form of a gargoyle like thing. I stood in horror as it laughed and the bright yellow lights of a car passed through him and toward me.



Everything burned and broke as I was hit. My body buried under debris and metal. I felt the rasp of my life drift away with every ragged breath. It was warm, then hot, then cold and my consciousness faded.



I awoke in a hospital. My body clung to life. The amount of broken bones, torn muscle, and damaged organs I had draped through a long folded report. I couldn't speak but my eyes could and tears streamed from them as I saw my parents rush in. I spent over a year in recovery, fighting to reclaim every part of me. I hadn't seen Mr. Tumbles since that night. The day I returned to school I was heralded as a hero and everyone wanted to be my friend. Save for one. For every now and then that one kid acted out and at the strangest times, but I knew what was really happening.

 I wasn't going to let him hurt another.
