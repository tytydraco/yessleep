I’m writing this so people know the truth when they hear my name. I can feel it taking over. The voices are getting louder and the visions are getting more real. I know this might sound like the ramblings of a man who finally snapped but believe me, I’m not crazy. I just don’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. So remember this while you read my story: It peeks into your windows at 3am. No matter how much it tries to lure you in, no matter what tricks it pulls, do not let curiosity win.

When I first moved into this apartment, I told myself the noises were just apartment things. You know the ones. Pipes clanging like they’re coughing up phlegm, radiators ticking like an old pocket watch, the neighbors upstairs dropping God knows what at ungodly hours. The first week, I kept waking around 3am to faint sounds by the window. I thought it was cats in the alley, maybe someone taking out trash, even wind whistling through the small cracks in the window frame of my old, cheap apartment. They seemed like normal things. Innocent things. But the noises grew stranger. Less like “old house settling” and more like…voices. Not full words, but cadences. As if someone was trying out syllables or attempting to learn the rhythm of human speech, but couldn’t quite figure it out. Some nights it sounded like my name. Other nights it was little knocks, like fingertips drumming on the pane. Always from the same window. Always at the same time. I tried to ignore it and convinced myself it was nothing. That was my mistake.

The noises got more consistent and that’s when I noticed something different about them. They were getting smart. They started mimicking sounds inside my apartment. Simple noises, like the buzz of my fridge, the creak of my chair, even the soft squeak of my shoes when I paced the kitchen…but always from the same window. These sounds quickly evolved back into the garbled sound attempting to mimic human speech. The voices would change from an angry scream to an almost welcoming whimper. It wanted me to come closer, it wanted me to look. For weeks, I resisted. I didn’t know what it was but if it had eyes, there was no way I was letting it see me. I stayed tucked under the covers, trying to drown out the demonic sounds coming from my window every night. But eventually curiosity won. I was awoken once again at 3am to the sounds coming from my dark, unwelcoming window. I couldn’t take it anymore. What was causing this? Surely it’s just someone pranking me or something, right? So I went and looked. 

That was when the nightmares began.
They weren’t just bad dreams. They were scenes staged with precision, filmed with a clarity no dream should have. A girl I loved mutilated in my bathtub, her eyes gouged by hands too long to be human. A scene of my family screaming for help through a barred window, their mouths full of broken glass and their fingertips bloody as they tried to claw their way towards me. Me lying in bed while something pressed its face against the window, smiling wider and wider until the skin cracked. The nightmares didn’t end when I woke up. They followed me into the day burned into my eyelids, making my skin crawl and my anxiety peak. I haven’t slept more than a few scattered hours in weeks. My body shakes from exhaustion, my eyes sting, and I can’t tell if the shadows I see are hallucinations or previews of the future. I’m gonna attempt to get some sleep now. The bright sunlight is illuminating my room right now, protecting me from the deep, disturbing darkness that lingers when the moon comes up. Later I’m gonna look for new apartments. I need to get out of here, FAST. 

EDIT:

Something odd happened today. A woman down the hall, this sweet old lady that usually keeps to herself, cornered me by the mailboxes. She stared at me for a long time as if she was studying my face. She was clearly taking notice of the haunted, soulless, tired look I had and the bags under my normally joyful eyes. She didn’t say anything for a while, staring at me like I was some sort of lost cause or something. The tension in the air was so deadly that I wasn’t sure if I should say something or leave. Before I could make that decision, she said something that made no sense at first, but now sends shivers up my spine. 

 “Wrap yourself up. Head to toe. Like the children do. Don’t let it see you. Not a finger. Not a hair.”

I tried asking her what she meant but she quickly walked away and disappeared before I could press her. I thought about it all day, to the point where I scoured forums, archives, even weird local blogs. I was shocked by what I discovered. There was a pattern that showed up again and again. Children tucked under covers, told bedtime stories that sound more like survival guides. Adults sleeping with knives or other weapons under pillows, blackout curtains nailed to frames and locks on every window. All of these stories had one thing in common. The Rule. According to legend, “The Rule” goes as follows. If it sees you, any part of you, you’re marked. If you’re “lucky,” it kills you. Horrifyingly slow and brutal for sure, but merciful compared to what happens if it chooses to keep you alive.

Because the survivors don’t last. Nightmares, hallucinations, paranoia until they break. Some kill themselves if they can still control themselves. Those who aren’t as strong commit atrocious acts and kill others in barbaric, horrible ways. But every story ends the same way. One or more deaths and a tragic story behind all of them. And me? I saw it before I even had a chance. I looked into that window and now the nightmares won’t stop. They’ve been growing worse for days, and I can feel myself slipping. I’ve tried killing myself. I won’t say how, but every time something stops me. The rope snaps, the blade slips, the bottle spills. It’s not a coincidence though. That…thing, that grinning, disgusting abomination from hell with its paperthin skin and distorted, not quite human like features, wont let me die. It wants me to suffer. I can feel it laughing behind the glass every night, watching me rot. I’m not a person anymore. I’m a pawn in its game. And it’ll decide how and when I die.
So if you hear my name in the paper…whether it be suicide, murder, some grotesque tragedy…please know, it wasn’t me.

It peeks into your windows at 3am. 

And it saw me.

Don’t let it see you.
