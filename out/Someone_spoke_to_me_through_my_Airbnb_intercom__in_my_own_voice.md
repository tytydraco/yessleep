I collapsed onto the couch, exhausted. My feet ached in the damn dress shoes—I’d been standing in them all day at that stupid conference. I’d only arrived in the city yesterday, but since getting off the train, it felt like the endless event had swallowed my entire life.

All I wanted was to eat something and finally get some sleep. At least the Airbnb I’d booked was comfortable—quiet, calm, a decent place. I headed to the kitchen, remembering I’d left a sandwich in the fridge that morning.



But as soon as I got up from the couch, the intercom buzzed.

The building I was staying in was five stories tall, and the only way inside was through the front gate downstairs.

I shuffled over and picked up the little white handset that played that familiar tinny melody.

  


“Finally!” said a familiar voice. “Listen to me, right now—”

  


“Who is this?” I snapped, irritated.

  


“Shut up and listen, Hank!” the voice cut me off, tense and urgent.

  


I froze.

It wasn’t just that the voice knew my name - it was my voice.

  


“What the hell is this?” I barked. “Who’s messing with me? Why do you sound like me?”

  


“Shut the fuck up, Hank!” my own voice screamed through the speaker. “We don’t have much time, so listen!”

  


My breath caught in my throat. My own voice was yelling at me—like a second version of myself was on the other end.

  


“Hank, listen carefully,” it continued. “Don’t let anyone in. Got it? No matter who knocks, no matter what they say—don’t open the door. Understand? This is important!”

  


“What are you talking about? Who are you?” I asked, my voice trembling.

  


“That doesn’t matter right now!” it snapped. “Just don’t let anyone in!”

  


And then the line went dead.

Silence.



I stood there, holding the receiver in my hand. The room was completely still.

It was my own voice that had spoken to me.

But… how?

  


I paced back and forth in the living room. Who the hell had that been on the intercom?



I looked out the window, but the street below was empty. Not a single soul in sight—just darkness and fog thickening in the late-night silence.

Should I call the police? I thought about it. But what would I even tell them—that someone had talked to me in my own voice? They’d think I’d lost my mind.

But that wasn’t what really scared me.

What scared me was that the voice had warned me—like it had genuinely tried to save me.



Then, suddenly, a loud knock rattled the door. I flinched, staring wide-eyed at the entrance.

I didn’t say a word. I didn’t even dare breathe.



Then again—knock, knock, knock!—louder this time.



I crept closer to the door, meaning to peek through the peephole. But before I could, a heavy pounding shook the apartment.

My heart slammed in my chest, and sweat started rolling down my forehead.

  


“Hank… please, open up,” said a voice from the other side of the door.

  


I froze. Sweat trickled down my back, my hands trembling. That voice—it was mine.

  


“Hank, I know you’re in there,” my voice said again. “Please, open the door. We have to fix this.”

  


I couldn’t speak. I just stood there, frozen in my dark-blue suit jacket, my throat bone-dry.

  


“Hank, don’t fuck with me,” the voice growled, angrier now, pounding again and rattling the handle. “Open the goddamn door! I know I told you not to—but this is different! This is the only way!”

  


“No!” I yelled back. “Get the hell away from here, whatever you are!”

  


“Jesus Christ, Hank, don’t be stupid!” my own voice shouted from the other side.

  


“Fuck you!” I screamed. “I’m not opening it!”

  


The next moment, the door shook violently— as if someone were kicking it full force, again and again, until I thought it would burst from the frame.



And then… silence.

One last thud—and then nothing.



I waited, hoping a neighbor might come check on the noise. But no one came.

  


I sat on the couch, nervously rubbing at the stubble on my chin. I’d already taken off my jacket—only my sweaty, wrinkled white shirt clung to me.

I had no idea what to do. What the hell was going on? What did those voices want from me?



Then it hit me: if not the police, maybe I could at least message the Airbnb host—tell them someone was screwing with me.

I jumped up from the couch—and in that exact moment, a cold, crawling feeling ran down my spine.



That’s when I realized all my stuff was gone.

No suitcase, no work laptop, not even my phone—the one I’d set down on the coffee table after getting back from the conference.

I tore the place apart in a panic. Checked the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom—nothing.

  


“Impossible,” I muttered. “It was all right here…”

  


I hurried back to the living room, hoping at least my briefcase—with the company documents—was still there.



But then something much worse happened.

A sharp click broke the silence—the sound of the front door’s deadbolt turning.

Then I heard it slowly creak open.



The blood drained from my face. Someone was out there—and now they were coming in.



Panicking, I slammed the living room door shut and dove beside the bed. My chest felt like it would burst, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

From the outer room came the sound of footsteps—shoes tapping against the kitchen tile.

Then a dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the floor… toward the living room.

  


“Where the hell did I put my wallet…” a voice muttered.

  


I froze. That voice… was mine. My own voice was talking to itself out there.

My eyes darted around, searching for any way out. Then I saw it—the fire escape outside the window.

That would be my way out.



I lunged for the window, shoved it open, and climbed out into the cold night air. My shoes clanged against the metal as I raced down the fire escape, heart pounding, lungs burning.

I reached the last ladder leading down into the alley—and kicked it loose beneath me.

But before I started climbing down, I looked back—just once—toward the apartment window.



And I saw it.



Someone was standing there. Leaning out of the window. Watching me.

I couldn’t see the face—only the outline, staring down at me.

And then terror hit me so hard, I lost my balance, and fell.



Down into the dark alley below.

  


I came to, dizzy and disoriented.

I couldn’t have been out long—it was still pitch-black. Or maybe it was the adrenaline that yanked me back so fast.



I pushed myself up from the cold, wet ground of the alley and rubbed my forehead.

I didn’t wait—I started moving right away toward the exit that led out to the street beside the building I’d escaped from.



The night was cool, the air damp, the wind barely stirring. The city felt completely dead—only a few streetlights flickered in the distance.

I looked around desperately, hoping to see someone—anyone. But the street was empty.

No one there.



No one… except one figure.

Across the street, a man stood motionless. His clothes were torn and filthy, his hair long and greasy, his face half-hidden behind a rough beard.



I had no idea who he was. But when the light caught the blade in his hand, my stomach clenched tight.

He didn’t say a word. He just stepped off the curb, straight into the road—coming right toward me, not even looking around.



That was all I needed to see. I ran.



Back into the alley, toward the opposite end where a faint light glowed between the buildings.

I ran as hard as I could, lungs burning, heart pounding so loud I could barely hear my own footsteps.

But when I burst out of the alley… everything inside me froze.

I was back where I’d started.



Right in front of the Airbnb building I’d just escaped from. The same street. The same houses. The same empty silence.

Only now, a taxi was parked in front of the building, and a man was stepping through the front gate.

  


“Wait!” I shouted after him as the cab began to roll forward. “Wait—please! Help me! Someone attacked me!”

  


The driver didn’t hear—or didn’t want to. The car sped up and disappeared into the darkness within seconds, as if it had never been there at all.



The gate swung shut.

I turned back—and saw someone rushing out of the alley I’d just come from. I knew it had to be the man with the knife.

I didn’t hesitate.

I bolted down the nearest side street and threw myself behind the first trash bin I could find.



My whole body trembled. My teeth were chattering. Panic had completely taken hold of my mind. Then, on the ground right next to my foot, something glinted in the dim light.



A knife.

A large kitchen knife.

How the hell did that get here? flashed through my mind. Someone must’ve dropped it.

At least now I finally had something to defend myself with.

  


I sat there for minutes behind the dumpster.

But no one came. No knife-wielding maniac. No one at all.

The silence of the city pressed down on me. The nerves, the hopelessness—it was tearing me apart. I couldn’t sit there in the filth any longer. My pant legs were soaked through, and I was gripping the knife so tightly I thought the handle might snap.

I crawled out from behind the dumpster and carefully stepped back into the street.

My feet ached, but I couldn’t let the exhaustion take over.



The street was just as empty as before. No sign of the man with the knife.

But someone was there—standing in front of the Airbnb building, fiddling with the intercom.



I moved closer, cautiously. The man wore a gray shirt; his long hair was greasy and clung to his head.

  


“Shut up, Hank!” he yelled into the intercom. “We don’t have much time, so just shut up and listen!”

  


I froze. That voice… it was familiar. Too familiar.

  


“That doesn’t matter right now!” the man snapped into the device. “Just don’t let anyone in!”

  


“Who are you?” I asked, holding the knife out in front of me. “And why do you sound like me?”

  


The man ended the call, then spun around in one quick motion, and pointed a knife right back at me.

That’s when I saw it clearly.

He was me.

Except this version of me looked like he hadn’t slept, eaten, or even showered in weeks.

  


“Get the hell out of here, man!” he shouted. “This isn’t the way! This isn’t how you fix it!”

  


I just stared at him. My head was spinning; none of this made sense.

  


“Oh, God…” he muttered, lowering his knife. “You’re new.”

  


“New? What are you talking about? Why do we look the same?”

  


“I don’t know everything,” he said, his voice strained, almost frantic. “But there are two things you need to remember. First—if you see the one covered in cuts, don’t go near him. If you see him… run. Second—if you want to get out of here, you’ll have to do something.

I don’t know what yet. Not exactly. But there’s a way.”

  


“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked. “Get out of where? Who’s the one with the cuts?”

  


“Shut up and listen,” he growled. “Do you remember when you came here? Or how?”

  


His words hit me like a hammer.



I tried to remember. But nothing came. I didn’t know when I’d arrived. Or whether I’d driven or flown.

I couldn’t even remember if there’d been a conference at all.

The harder I tried to recall, the more my thoughts began to unravel.



How did I even get here?



And… where the hell was I?
