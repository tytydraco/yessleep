(This is my first real work of writing so please don't be to critical, thank you)

I was never an athelic kid. I would spend most of my days inside and when did anything physical I would often get hurt. I never had much energy and I was very pale. Everything was because of a sickness that prevented me to get as much energy as I should. It also why I had rashes and scars on my back. Except not having little energy I lived a normal life like any other child. These days I have just left college and being assistent to different porjects in biology and I live in a small apartment.

Anyways, a couple months ago I started getting backpains and I felt really weak. Whenever I woke up I would feel severe backpain. I would start to go to weekly doctors visit and he said it was a harmless damage from stress and work. The medication I would get didn’t do anything and my sickness becam really noticeble. I had scars and rashes all over my back and my energy was almost gone.

Two weeks ago I got sleep paralysis and my body cracks when I move. My mental health got worse and I started to feel claustrophobic. I couldn’t go to work anymore and my doctor visited me daily now.

A night a couple of days ago I woke up on midnight. I had an usual sleep paralasis but I felt lighter and my arms looked thinner than before. Then I heard a ratteling. It was a sound filled with cracks and it was real loud. It was dark but I started see the shape of a figure in the corner of my room. He walked around but when he saw that I was awake it didn’t scream or rush to me like a normal person instead it walked softly over to my bed and calmly put a hand over my mouth. It was a really skinny and fleshy hand. It didn’t feel like anything I ever had touched. I couldn’t call for help but not because my mouth was covered but because my jaw felt weak and fleshy. After a while I fell asleep. When I woke up I searched my entire apartment but it was gone. It didn’t seem to be burglar because everything was at it’s place. I thought about calling the cops but no. Why would anyone believe that a skinless man would just disappear like Houdini.

This bahvior continued for days. The man came, I had a sleep paralasis and when I woke up it was gone. After days of this I finally called a doctor. I went to the doctor and took several tests and after an hour I got my results.

”How is it Doctor?” I asked.

”I never thought I would ever have to diagnos anyone with this,” He answered.

”Please don’t say I have cancer,” I begged.

”It’s not cancer but something bad, maybe even on cancers level,”

”What do you mean?”

”You have one of the rarest diseases in history. It’s called ossa mortem,” He answered.

”What does it do?”

”It’s a disease were the skeleton becomes it own organism and feeds of it’s owner. Essentially your skeleton has blood vessels, muscle and the bare minimum to be called ”living”. It’s often caused by a genetic deformity when a child in the womb absorbs it’s twin,”

I sat there quiet. My whole life a parasite ha lived inside me feeding of my energy.

”What’s the weirdest thing about this sickness?” I asked.

”The skeleton can leave the body anytime and this will give the person scars and rashes over the back,” He answered.

”I am afraid you can’t do anything you can do, it will hurt specifically backpain, lack of energy and trouble sleeping,” He continued.

After the nightmare of a doctors visit I got home and just sat in silence. Barely being able to comprehend the fact. Suddenly, my jaw started moving relentless.

”Brother, don’t worry I won’t hurt you,” Came out of my mouth in my voice but distorted.

”Who are you?” I asked.

”I’m brother, I’m your bones, don’t listen to the man in white, I would never hurt you brother,” said the voice.

I was silence. I didn’t trust him. He had put me through months of mental and physical damage. I finally accepted him and that was about the extent of it. He would mostly be just crack and sometimes hum in his distorted voice. After a while we actually started growing closer. We were actually like brothers. We would joke around and laugh. We spent time together and I felt better. He would always leave my body at night. It felt fine, until my final night.

He woke me up in the middle of the night.

I tried ask what it was but my jaw was gone so I just gave him a confused look.

”I had fun brother, but your time is over,” he said.

”I’m sorry it had to end like this”

He grabbed my flesh and started ripping. I couldn’t scream so I just suffered in silence. He left and didn’t come back. The worst part wasn’t that my brother had betrayed me but that he didn’t kill me. I was left like towel on the floor watching myself dacaying without any way to call for help. I finally realised that my fate was sealed since my birth and I had no way of changing that. This what was meant to become of me. A weak man who was to plauged by something he had no control of.
