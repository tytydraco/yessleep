I moved into my new apartment last week. It’s a small, one-bedroom place in a building that’s been around since the 1920s. The rent was cheap, which should’ve been my first red flag, but I was desperate. The walls are thin, the floors creak, and the windows rattle when the wind blows, but it’s mine. Or at least, it was supposed to be.

The first few days were uneventful. I spent most of my time unpacking and trying to ignore the faint smell of mildew that seemed to linger in every room. But then, on the third night, I found it.

I was cleaning out the closet in the bedroom when I noticed a loose floorboard. I pried it up, expecting to find nothing but dust and maybe a few dead bugs. Instead, I found a small, leather-bound diary. It was old, the cover cracked and faded, but it was still intact.

I opened it, and the first thing I noticed was the handwriting. It was neat, almost elegant, but there was something off about it. The letters were too precise, like they’d been written by someone who was trying too hard to keep their hand steady.

The first entry was dated January 1st, 1987.

“Dear Diary,” it began, “I’ve moved into my new apartment. It’s small, but it’s mine. Or at least, it’s supposed to be.”

I froze. That was exactly what I had thought when I moved in. I shook it off as a coincidence and kept reading.

The entries were mostly mundane—grocery lists, reminders to pay the rent, complaints about the noisy neighbors. But as I read on, I noticed something strange. The writer kept mentioning a sound. A faint tapping, like someone knocking on the walls. At first, they thought it was the pipes, but then they started hearing it in other parts of the apartment. In the closet. Under the floorboards. Behind the walls.

The entries became more frantic as the days went on. The writer talked about how they couldn’t sleep, how they felt like they were being watched. They started seeing things out of the corner of their eye—shadows that moved when they shouldn’t, figures that disappeared when they turned to look.

And then, on January 15th, the entries stopped.

I flipped through the rest of the diary, expecting to find more, but the pages were blank. Except for the last one.

The last entry was dated tomorrow.

My heart skipped a beat. I checked the date on my phone, just to be sure. It was today. The entry was dated tomorrow.

I don’t know why I kept reading. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was fear. But I couldn’t stop myself.

“Dear Diary,” it began, “I don’t have much time. They’re here. They’ve been here all along, waiting in the walls, in the floors, in the shadows. They’ve been watching me, listening to me, learning from me. And now they’re ready.

“If you’re reading this, it means they’ve chosen you too. They’ll start with the tapping. It’ll be soft at first, almost imperceptible. But it’ll get louder. And then you’ll hear the voices. They’ll whisper to you, call your name, beg you to let them in.

“Don’t answer them. Don’t even look at them. If you do, they’ll take you. They’ll take you like they took me.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t want to do this, but I don’t have a choice. They’re making me.

“Goodbye.”

I closed the diary, my hands trembling. I told myself it was just a prank, some sick joke left behind by the previous tenant. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. The handwriting was too precise, the details too specific. And the date—the date was impossible.

I spent the rest of the night sitting on the couch, clutching the diary like it was some kind of talisman. I tried to convince myself that I was overreacting, that I was just letting my imagination run wild. But then I heard it.

A faint tapping, coming from the closet.

I told myself it was just the pipes. But then I heard it again, louder this time. And then again, and again, until it was a steady rhythm, like someone knocking on the door.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I just sat there, frozen, as the tapping grew louder and louder. And then I heard the voices.

They were faint at first, just whispers, but they grew louder, more insistent. They were calling my name, begging me to let them in.

I don’t know how long I sat there, listening to the voices, but eventually, they stopped. The tapping stopped. The apartment was silent.

I thought it was over. I thought I was safe.

But then I saw it.

Out of the corner of my eye, a shadow moved. I turned to look, but there was nothing there. Just the empty room, the flickering light of the TV, and the diary, lying open on the coffee table.

I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop them. But I do know this: if you ever find a diary in your new apartment, don’t read it.

Just don’t.

**Author’s Note:** I’m posting this because I need to know if anyone else has experienced something like this. I’ve tried to research the diary, but I can’t find any record of it. If you know anything, please, tell me. I’m starting to think I’m not alone in this.

And if you hear a voice, no matter how faint, don’t answer it.

Just don’t.
