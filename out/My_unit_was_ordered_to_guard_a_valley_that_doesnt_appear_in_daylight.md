The first time I saw the valley, it was already wrong.

We were moving through it at night, single file, night vision washed in green. On the map, it was just a shallow depression between two ridges. In reality, it sank far deeper than it should have, the ground sloping away at angles that made my depth perception rebel. The stars above it looked dimmer, like they were farther away over that stretch of land.

No one spoke. Not because of radio silence, because every time someone opened their mouth, they hesitated, like the words needed permission to leave.

The order was simple: hold the valley until sunrise. No patrols, no flares, no firing unless directly engaged. That last part should have bothered me more than it did.

We set up along the edges, backs to the stone, eyes on the dark below. The valley floor was invisible beyond a certain point, swallowed by shadow so complete it felt physical. My night vision couldn’t pierce it. The darkness there wasn’t absence of light; it was something in the way.

About an hour in, I heard breathing. Not close, not loud, but slow.

It came from the center of the valley, deep in the dark, rising and falling with a rhythm that didn’t belong to lungs. Each exhale carried a faint vibration that traveled up through my boots and into my bones.

I keyed my radio, static. Then a whisper, not from command, not from any voice I recognized. 

“Still,” it said.

The breathing stopped, something moved in the darkness.

At first, I thought it was the terrain shifting, rocks settling, maybe. Then I realized the movement had direction, purpose. Whatever it was, it was circling, tracing the perimeter just beyond where our vision failed, learning the shape of us.

I glanced left. My teammate was standing rigid, weapon raised, eyes wide. He wasn’t tracking anything. He was staring straight ahead, like he was afraid to look down.

“Do you see it?” I whispered. He shook his head once.

“Don’t,” he whispered back. “If you see it, it knows you can.”

The breathing started again, closer this time.

A low shape emerged at the edge of the dark, too large to be a man, too narrow to be an animal. It pulled itself forward without lifting, like it didn’t need to understand the ground to move across it. The surface of it wasn’t skin or fur. It looked like compacted earth, packed tight around something that kept trying to push out.

As it moved, I realized something worse, there wasn’t just one.

The valley floor shifted as multiple shapes began to rise, unfolding themselves from the darkness like thoughts being formed for the first time. Some were tall and thin, others wide and low. None of them were complete in a way that made sense.

The whisper returned. “Still,” it repeated, firmer now.

One of the shapes reached the slope beneath us and stopped. It lifted what might have been a head. The stars above it vanished, as if blocked by something taller than the sky itself.

It spoke using a voice I recognised, my voice.

“We’re not here for you,” it said calmly. “You can lower your weapons.”

My hands started shaking. Not from fear, from the pressure. Like the air was thickening around my thoughts, slowing them down, smoothing the sharp edges.

Someone screamed, gunfire erupted, brief, panicked. The flashes lit the valley for half a second.

That was enough, the darkness surged upward. Not like a wave, but a decision.

I don’t remember being dragged. I remember the ground rising to meet my face and the sensation of being pressed flat, like something was trying to imprint me into the earth. All around me, I heard wet, crushing sounds and voices cutting off mid-breath.

Then, suddenly, weight lifted. Silence, I was alone.

Dawn found me lying at the edge of the valley, weapon gone, hands coated in dust that smelled faintly of iron. The valley looked normal in the morning light, shallow, empty, harmless. No shadows, no shapes, not even bodies.

Just footprints, dozens of them. All leading down into the centre, all ending abruptly. Command called it an ambush, an IED, enemy combatants, anything but what it was.

They asked me what I saw, I told them nothing.

Because when the sun hit the valley floor just right, I could still see where the darkness had been folded away. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I feel the ground breathing beneath me again, slow, patient, waiting for night to give it permission to stand up.
