[There are rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zw5djj/how_to_survive_college_obviously_i_get_to_be_bait/)  Of course there are rules.  We want life to make sense.  We want bad things to happen only to people who deserve bad things.  If we can believe the world operates according to the laws of fairness, then we don’t have to be so scared of a chaotic world, cruelly indifferent to right and wrong, just and unjust.

So when something unnatural - these manifestations of our fears and our hopes - drags someone into the darkness, we find a reason that this happened.  Just as breaking a mirror brings bad luck, so can a messy house or poor hospitality bring destruction.

We die because we earned it.

There was trespass.

A taboo was violated.

A rule was broken.

This university may not follow the *traditional* rules, but it is not exempt from this condition.  College students probably adhere to the concept of deserving what happens to you more than most.  We earn our grades, after all.  So there *are* rules.  And we are going to get the flickering man to break them.

That is our plan.

Of course, I don’t know all the rules yet, and the laundry lady is loath to share.  Despite our current alliance, we’re still technically on opposite sides here.  I’d get rid of her if I knew how and she’d get rid of me if she were permitted to.  She wasn’t willing to give me any more information than she absolutely had to.

Besides, she told me, it wasn’t relevant to our goal.  We wanted the flickering man to go after me *without* his rule being violated.  That’d get someone’s attention.

“Go out in the rain,” she told me, “just long enough to get his attention.  Then seek shelter and wait.”

“And then what?” I asked.  “He makes an attempt to kill me and… they get rid of him?”

We were still meeting in the dorm laundry room.  She was always there when I entered, which made me think she was either waiting for me or somehow knew when I was coming.  I tried to pick odd times so that we wouldn’t have anyone walk in while we were talking.  I didn’t want people to start thinking she’s my mom or something.

“I don’t actually know,” she said thoughtfully.  “They can’t do to him what they did to me.”

“What did they do to you?”

She had mentioned briefly that I’d gotten her into some kind of trouble, but had stubbornly refused to elaborate.  This time was no different.  She ignored me.

“Snatching the odd student here and there outside the rules isn’t usually enough to anger them.  It’s unusual though, because we…”

She hesitated, searching for words.  Even though she was certainly the most humanlike of the creatures I’d encountered so far, she was still inhuman and our experiences could not be easily translated.

“...it doesn’t sustain us.  And I don’t mean it’s the difference between a real meal and a handful of stale peanuts you find in your pocket.  It… doesn’t fit.  Like eating gravel just so your stomach doesn’t feel so empty.”

I told her that I understood well enough.  And I think I do.  These creatures can’t change themselves like humans can.  We can reflect and make choices and become different people if we set our minds to it.  We have a will.  The inhuman, however, have no such ability.  Going against their nature would be like one of us trying to evolve to breathe water.

I wonder if an inhuman could… unmake themselves… if they defy what they are often enough.

“Anyway,” she continued, “if the flickering man attacks you without you having broken his rules, then that means something else is going on.  He’s either starving - unlikely - or he’s got a grudge.”

“And that will be enough to upset the administration?”

“That’s my hope.  They might turn a blind eye to one attempt, but if he *keeps* trying they’ll be forced to take action.”

He’s already made one attempt.  The devil intervened, so I had to assume that meant that the flickering man was violating his own rules.  After all, the devil is a stickler for rules.  If the flickering man had any legitimate claim on my life, I doubted the devil would show up to rescue me.

However, that meant that I still had one more encounter to go before this became a pattern.  I thought of his unnatural strength.  How he grabbed me by the throat.  How he tore a student in two.

“I don’t think I’ll survive an encounter with him,” I said quietly.

“So make sure someone intervenes, then,” she snapped.  “It can even be another human.  He won’t dare leave a witness behind and he certainly can’t get away with killing two people for no reason.”

I stared at my feet.  I’d promised I wouldn’t get anyone involved in this.  I wasn’t going to make my friends targets for the flickering man.

“You do have friends, right?” she demanded.

“Of course I do!  I just don’t want to ask them to do something this dangerous.”

“Then don’t tell them in advance.  Why do I have to think of everything?” she complained.  “You’re human.  You can actually lie.  Make use of that.”

Then she stormed off into the hallway and when I poked my head out after her, she was nowhere in sight.

Grayson was the obvious choice.  He presumably has some kind of protection as the son of the university’s president.  As a bonus, if I told him what was happening and asked him to help, he might let slip some information that’d give me a clue as to how much he knows or doesn’t know.  I’m pretty sure if I’d asked all of you about this, you’d have come to the same conclusion, right?

I couldn’t do it.  I had all my justifications lined up and ready to go, but I couldn’t bring myself to message him.  I kept thinking - what if the flickering man remembers Grayson?  What if he goes after him as well as me?  And I’m sure that sounds like it could be a good thing, pitting the inhuman we all hate against the son of the university’s president… but I’m just not that ruthless.  The laundry lady would do it.  She’d do it in a heartbeat and if she knew about my friendship, I’m sure she’d have been advocating for that all along.

And that’s why I can’t.

I’ve gotten myself into this on my own.  It wouldn’t be right to drag anyone else into it or take advantage of my friends.  This was my problem to deal with.

Instead, I decided to go out into the rain right when classes are letting out.  There’s a handful of common class times and when they end, campus is swarmed with people.  The flickering man couldn’t really single anyone out for retaliation when the interruption was just a normal function of this being a university.

It took a couple of tries to draw him out.  It rains fairly often around here, but I was also making the most use out of a rainstorm and hitting multiple locations throughout the day.  On the second day of trying and the third attempt of that day, I finally, regrettably, succeeded.

I was outside of the building that houses the thing in the hallways because it has a broad overhang in one corner.  I did exactly as the laundry lady told me.  Step out in the rain, just enough to get a little damp, then step back inside the overhang.  I stood in the middle of it so I had plenty of distance between me and the edges.  I’d see him coming and still have an escape route.

And he did exactly as I expected.  Stepped out of the rain right at the corner of the overhang, so that he had equal distance between both of my possible escapes.  I’d been watching for him, but his approach was subtle enough that I hadn’t noticed, and I jumped at his abrupt appearance.  My heart hammered.  I let out an unsteady breath, trying to calm down.  It was fine.  I had a plan.  I just had to stick to the plan.

“You think I didn’t notice your little strategy?” he smirked, hooking his thumbs into his jean pockets.  “Always making sure there’s a crowd?  That won’t work this time.  Because just before you got here, I pulled the fire alarm and since it was so close to the end of class the professors just let the students all leave a few minutes early.”

I no longer had a plan.

If I made it out to the rain, I might stand a chance to escape.  Last time I’d encountered him, he said I was partially right about my theory that he had to jump between the raindrops and therefore couldn’t hurt me.  I’d been wrong about him not being able to leave the rain.  I might be wrong about him not being able to hurt me as well.  In fact, as he watched me panic with a smug smile on his face, I realized I probably *was* wrong about that.  There were such things as mostly harmless inhumans, but the flickering man didn’t seem like one.  At all.

It was my best option, though.  If I fled inside the building, he’d follow me.  At least out in the open I stood a better chance of running into another student and he’d be forced to abandon the chase.

I picked a direction.  I dove towards it, throwing myself into a sprint, but he lunged to intercept.  I don’t think I’d have made it even if he weren’t inhuman.  He was positioned too strategically.  I was too slow.

I slammed into him.  My head and shoulder hit him in the chest and he absorbed the blow, taking a single step backwards but not allowing himself to be knocked aside.  Then I felt his hands on my shoulders and he spun me around so that we were side by side, facing the rain just beyond the overhang.  It wasn’t a heavy rain, but it was steady, and puddles were forming on the sidewalks.

“Are you *trying* to make me angry?” he asked.  “I didn’t think you’d push your luck after the last time we… *talked*… but then you went and killed one of us.  Granted, those creatures are mere beasts, but *still*.  It’s the principle of it all.”

His fingers tightened on my shoulder.  I winced.

“Well?” he demanded scornfully.  “Answer my question.  A yes or no will suffice.”

The condescension cracked through my fear.  He could stalk me.  He could threaten me.  Hell, he might even kill me right here and now.  But I’d be damned if he talked down to me like this.

“Yes,” I hissed.

“Ahhh, there it is,” he sighed happily.  “Finally standing up for yourself.  Now you can die with some dignity.”

“You’re not allowed to,” I said.

He considered it a moment, tapping his fingers on my shoulder.  I stood there, stiff and shaking, my skin crawling from the touch of his arm draped across my back.

“Yes, there is that little problem,” he sighed.  “And your little devil friend is watching to make sure I don’t try it.  But I think I’ve found a solution.”

I looked sideways at him.  He smiled down at me, his eyes glittering with malice.  Then he removed his hand from my shoulder and planted it on my back instead.  He shoved.  I stumbled forward a couple steps, out into the rain.  I began to shiver as it soaked into my clothing, stealing the warmth from my skin.

“Run,” he said.  “I’ll give you a head start.  If you make it far enough… I’ll let you go.”

“How far is enough?”

His smile didn’t change as he licked his upper lip in anticipation.

“You’ll find out.  If I crush your windpipe with my bare hands, you’ll know you failed.”

“This is bullshit,” I snapped.  “You can’t just make up arbitrary rules for me to break.”

“*I’m not*,” he hissed.  “Now *RUN.*”

I ran.  These creatures didn’t lie.  He *would* kill me if he caught up.  I saw him step forward, into the rain, and then my back was to him and I was running towards the center of campus.  I needed to get to where there were likely to be other students.  Strength in numbers.  If I couldn’t outrun him - and I didn’t think I could - then I needed something else to protect me.

My scheming with the laundry lady isn’t the only measure I’m taking to make this campus safer for me.  I’ve also been running at the gym.  Trying to build up my stamina.  It’s slow progress and I kind of hate it but it’s *something* and as I ran through the rain, I was glad I had at least a little conditioning to keep from getting winded so quickly.  The water splashing at my feet was quickly soaking my shoes and jeans, but I ignored it.  I had to keep going.

Then I realized I’d ran straight into water that was now up to my ankles.

A flat sheet of water stretched before me, covering the sidewalk and spilling out into the grass.  It didn’t look like a river, but that was how it started.  Maybe it wasn’t this time, maybe it was just a spot of ground lower than the surrounding terrain and the water was collecting here.  But maybe it was.  I had only seconds to decide.

I didn’t know if the water I was in was the river, but I *did* know the flickering man was coming for me.  One of those deaths was far more certain than the other.  I kept running, straight through the water, not daring to waste precious seconds by detouring around it.

I’d made the wrong choice on all counts.  It *was* the river.  And my moment of hesitation was long enough for the flickering man to catch up.

He grabbed hold of my hair.  A sharp yank pulled me out of my run and I staggered and would have fallen, if not for the grip at the back of my head holding me up.  I couldn’t see him, but he was there, I caught glimpses of movement in the corner of my vision.

And he’d grabbed me.  Not the fleeting, futile attempts like the last time I encountered him.  This time he could use his full strength.

The water was at my knees.  I saw it spreading before me, swallowing up the ground, and the surface began to ripple as a current strengthened around me.  I felt it tugging at my legs.  I didn’t pay it any attention, because it wouldn’t kill me fast enough.

The flickering man was going to get me first.

He *could* kill me out in the rain.  I don’t know what changed or how he did it, but suddenly he was *in front of me* and grabbing at my neck, then a current surged and my feet were pulled out from underneath me and I was falling backwards into the river.

I saw the look of surprise on his face before the water closed over me.

It tumbled me about and I desperately kept my face turned upwards, tracking the diffuse light of the hidden sun.  I had to keep track of the surface.  I kicked, pulling myself upwards with broad strokes, and then my head burst through the water.  I sucked in air and looked frantically around, searching for something to anchor myself on.  There.  Just ahead.  A stone.  I swam with the current, angling at a diagonal to take me closer to the stone that was protruding from the river.  I hit it square on and wrapped my arms and legs around it, holding on for dear life.

The river receded just as quickly as it had come.  I found myself sitting on the damp ground, pressed up against a gravestone.

The river had dumped me inside the cemetery.

Okay.  This was probably good.  Cemeteries can be places of refuge in some circumstances, after all.  I could just wait here for the rain to stop and then exit through the front gate.

You know.  The front gate that’s kept locked with a chain and padlock.

My brain decided instead of finding a solution, it would be much more helpful to concoct worst-case scenarios.  You know how it goes.  One moment you’re trespassing because an unnatural river whisked you away from certain death, the next you’re being expelled because you can’t find an excuse for being in the cemetery that anyone will believe and your whole future is ruined and no one will ever want to associate with you ever again because you’re such a failure.  When I found the end of that particular doom spiral I was a crying mess, though I’m not entirely certain it was solely because I was trapped in here and the school was going to expel me and then everything would be terrible forever.  It was probably also because I almost *died*.

Somehow it’s much worse when the flickering man is involved.  The swimmers just wanted a meal.  But the flickering man… it’s deeply personal for some reason.  I feel like… he doesn’t just want to kill me.  He wants me to suffer.

I’d rather not think about that any more right now.

Anyway, crying in the graveyard.  I was on the verge of calling Grayson and asking for help when I realized that I wasn’t alone in here.  There was another person, not too far from where I sat next to the headstone.  His back was to me.  He looked pretty ordinary, dressed in khaki work pants and a rain jacket.  Probably worked for whoever manages the graveyard.  I slowly got up, a plan working its way through my head.  I’d go over there and admit I slipped in because the gate was open and I was curious, but I hadn’t disturbed anything and now I was locked in.

There’s some fringe benefits to being timid and weak.  Once the waterworks start, people want to help.  How could something so pathetic be doing anything wrong, after all?

I was on my feet and about to take a step in his direction when someone hissed my name.  I whirled around.

“What are you doing!?”

The laundry lady.  She was on the other side of the fence, sticking her face between the iron bars.

“You need to get out of there before it sees you!”

I glanced back at the man.  He still had his back to me, but he was turning his head back and forth.  Searching.  He moved ponderously slow.

“How!?” I hissed back.

“Get over here and I’ll give you a boost.  You can climb over the top.”

I eyed the fence.  It’s easily six feet and the only crossbar is at the top.  But if someone else boosted me up, then perhaps I could make it over.  The tops of the iron bars were blunt, thankfully, so I didn’t have to worry about falling on any pointy bits.  I hurried over to where the laundry lady was sticking her arms through and linking her hands together.  I put my foot on them, she tersely counted to three, and then she, uh, threw me.

Pro tip: when an inhuman says they’re going to give you a boost, what they mean is they’re going to use their inhuman strength to yeet your ass into the air.

I cleared the top.  Easily.  And thankfully the laundry lady was on the other side waiting to grab me on the way down so I didn’t break an ankle on the landing.  I was pretty rattled though, so when she seized my arm and dragged me away from the cemetery I numbly followed.

“Who was that?” I asked, once I’d recovered my wits.

“I don’t know what you call them.  Groundskeeper?  Gravedigger?  They take care of the cemetery.”

“What’s wrong with him?”

“I don’t know.  They make me nervous though.”

Plural.  Something that made an inhuman uneasy.

“They’re… not human, are they?” I ventured.

“Not at all.”

I ran my hands through my hair.  This just kept getting better.  I had to focus on the biggest of my problems though.  The flickering man.  I told the laundry lady what had happened and she nodded approvingly.

“So… what happens next?” I asked.  “Is the… administration…? going to intervene now?”

“Patience, sweety,” she said.  “You have to walk before you make him crawl.”

“That is not how that saying goes.”

“Well I like my version better,” she sniffed.  “I think you’ve got their attention now.  Likely he’ll be warned to leave you alone.  But if you incite him to the point he loses control of himself - then they’ll be forced to stop him.  They don’t like being defied so blatantly.”

“Before or after I’m dead?” I asked miserably.

She stopped walking and turned to face me.  She grabbed both of my hands and squeezed them between hers.

“*Before,*” she hissed.  “They will rip you from his grasp and you’ll see their vengeance with your own eyes.  Won’t that make all of this worth it?”

No.  It wouldn’t.  That wasn’t something I wanted to see happen.  I wanted him gone, I wanted to be safe, but I didn’t want to see whatever retribution the administration could dole out in person.  I didn’t want to even think about it.  But I told the laundry lady that all sounded great and she released my hands and walked away, humming happily, as the rain petered out and finally stopped around us.
