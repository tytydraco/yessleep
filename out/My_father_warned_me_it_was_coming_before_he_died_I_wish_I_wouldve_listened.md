My father died of cancer 5 years ago, it was hard losing him like that, after his passing, I stayed home more helping my mother around the house and helping to take care of my younger sister.

But during this time, one thing always stayed in the back of my mind.
My father's last words to me. They weren't the usual departing words you would expect...

My father's last words had been "whatever you do, don't sleep on the 18th. It is coming." 
I didn't have time to ask him what that meant.
I was rushed out of the room immediately afterwards.

I wish I had known.
If I could've warned them too... They might still be alive.

I think my father's belief was that this creature was after me, but for whatever reason. It didn't take me.

I still remember the night I awoke to my younger sister's petrified screaming, and I launched myself out of my bed and rushed through to help, but it was already too late, I found my sister in the jaws of a hiddeous creature.

I can barely describe it... it's arms were long with bloodstained claws at the tips of each of it's fingers.
It's mouth was filled with rows of long pointed teeth, designed for the tearing of flesh.

It was hunched over in an extremely unnatural position, bits of skin dangled from its mouth as it looked at me, my sister's limp body cradled in it's arms.

I stared back at it in disgust, and fury.
Before I even had time to process what was happening, this creature had rushed past me, it rushed through into my mother's room.

And I heard the most disgusting sound I could possibly imagine.
I knew it must've already killed my mother, she would've been here immediately at the sound of my sister's screams.
I slowly crept through the hallway and into my father's old room, I took his baseball bat and I walked through into my mother's room.

But I was confused to see the creature just. Gone.
There was no sign of my mother's body either, it was just gone.
I walked back through into my sister's room and her body was gone too.

I didn't understand what was happening, but I didn't have time to think about that.
I had to get out of the house.

I rushed out and down the street, I passed by a very grisly sight as I was heading towards my uncle's house.

One of my neighbours was out in his yard, I could hear the cries of the poor animal as he repeatedly stamped on it.
And then he suddenly just stopped, and looked right up at me.
A shiver ran up my spine and I just ran for it, straight to my uncle's house.

I woke him up by pounding on his door.
Needless to say he was annoyed, and I couldn't even bring myself to tell him what really happened...

I explained that my mother and sister were gone, and that I had woke up to my sister's screams.
I couldn't tell him the rest, but judging by the look on my uncle's face. I didn't need to.

Somehow, he knew what had happened.
He sighed and nodded. "lucky to be alive boy." He said looking at me and shaking his head.

I was confused, and I waited for him to explain himself.
"That creature that killed your mother comes back on the 18th of June every single year.
It always kills 2 women in our family.
When your father died, he wasn't warning you that it would attack you.
He wanted you to protect them from that... Thing." My uncle said.

His explanation had still left me with several questions, and I wanted to know more but my uncle silenced me and shook his head. 

"No. Go get some sleep." He replied, and he looked down. "I cannot talk about it. I cannot say its name. It will come when called." He added.

I shivered and nodded, I didn't need to ask what was meant by that. And he ushered me into the spare bedroom.
"Get some sleep, it'd do you good." He said. 

I nodded and walked into the room, I sighed and sat on the edge of the bed.
Sleep was the last thing I wanted to do right now, a million questions rushed through my mind.
I wanted to know what that thing was.
Could I find it? Could I kill it?
Was there anything I could do at all?

But eventually, I drifted off into a restless sleep.
And when I awoke, my uncle was standing at the edge of my bed, two police officers by his side.
I was confused as one of the officer's said
"You are under arrest for the murder of (sister's name) (mother's name)"
And that is where my story ends.
Locked behind bars. 
I am innocent.
I did not kill them. It killed them.
But I cannot tell anyone the truth. 
Aside from you reading this.

All I can say, is if you're reading this.
Then you already know. Do not sleep on the 18th of June.
Your family may be it's next victim.
