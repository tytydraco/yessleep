Hello folks, I’ve spent the better part of my life studying the unknown. As a trained paranormal investigator, I’ve explored numerous haunted locations, strange occurrences, and unexplainable events. My team and I rely on advanced investigative tools, experience, and careful planning to uncover the truth behind the phenomena that others can’t or won’t understand. But sometimes, the truth is far darker than we could have ever imagined.

It was late October, 2023 when I received an urgent call from my old friend Arup, who lived near the outskirts of Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The last time we spoke was years ago, but when his name appeared on my screen, I could tell something was wrong.

“I need your help” Arup said, his voice shaking with fear. “There’s something strange happening here, near the forest. People have been disappearing—just vanishing. No one knows why.”

Arup had always been level-headed, but his tone was full of unease, and I knew something serious was going on.

“What’s been happening?” I asked, concerned.

“At first, it was small things animals going missing, strange noises at night. But recently, people have started hearing voices whispers calling them into the forest. And then... nothing. They disappear without a trace.” He paused. “Some say it’s a spirit... but I’m not sure. I can’t explain it.”

“I’m coming over with my team,” I assured him. “We’ll figure this out together.”

The next day, I assembled my team, Sanskriti, our medium with a deep sensitivity to spiritual entities, in short a psychic, and Joe, a tech specialist skilled in operating advanced paranormal investigation tools. We landed in Guwahati and started our to Kaziranga, a journey that took us deep into the heart of Assam’s dense forests.

As we reached the village of Ramsing, a quiet settlement on the edge of Kaziranga, we were greeted by Arup. His appearance confirmed his distress, his face was drawn, eyes tired from sleepless nights. He led us to a small, dilapidated house at the edge of the village, where an elderly woman named Keteki had disappeared days earlier. Her daughter had been the latest person to hear strange whispers calling her into the forest.

After a brief discussion, we decided to start our investigation at the edge of the forest where these disappearances had occurred. The atmosphere around us felt heavy, oppressive. The usual sounds of the jungle the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves were eerily absent. It was as though the forest itself was holding its breath, waiting for something.

As night descended, we set up our equipment just outside the tree line, using a combination of tools we’d relied on in the past but had never needed more than tonight. Joe unpacked the EMF meter, which measures fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, and the thermal camera, designed to capture temperature differences that could indicate the presence of paranormal entities. We also set up a few motion sensors and infrared cameras to track any movement in the dense darkness of the forest. 

Meanwhile, Sanskriti stood silently, her eyes closed, focusing on her connection with the energy around us. 

“I feel it,” Sanskriti murmured, her voice low and steady. “It’s here. There’s something ancient, something that’s been waiting. But it’s not a typical spirit. It’s far older.”

The air felt colder, the temperature noticeably dropping despite the warm evening. Sanskriti nodded towards the forest. “I can feel its presence, but... it’s not responding to me. It’s watching us, but it’s not speaking.”

We all sensed it something wasn’t right. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and Joe, monitoring his equipment, seemed on edge.

“This doesn’t feel like a standard haunting,” Joe said. “There’s something... deliberate about it. These readings are off the charts.”

We’d expected some fluctuation in the readings due to the environment, but the spikes were strange too powerful, too erratic. Something was definitely messing with our equipment. I checked the EMF meter, which was buzzing wildly.

And then, we heard it.

At first, it was so faint we thought it was the wind a soft rustling that didn’t quite match the surrounding foliage. But it grew louder, a whisper, not from any human voice but from somewhere deep in the woods.

“Kun (who)”

My pulse quickened. It was unmistakable. It wasn’t just the wind. The voice seemed to come from all directions, like it was surrounding us.

Sanskriti tensed, her expression filled with unease. “It’s trying to lure us in,” she said. “It wants us to follow... but we mustn’t. We can’t listen.”

I nodded, trying to remain focused. “We need to get clear evidence of what we’re dealing with.”

I activated the Spirit Box, a device that scans radio frequencies to capture voices from entities in real time. The static was unsettling at first, a harsh buzzing noise. And then, a voice cut through the static a deep, guttural whisper.

“Jah... Gusi jah (leave... leave this place).”

The voice wasn’t clear enough for a direct communication, but the message was chilling. Something or someone was definitely trying to engage with us. 

“We need to keep moving,” I instructed. “Let's go deeper into the forest, but stay alert. This thing is trying to manipulate our senses.”

We cautiously moved forward, stepping into the darkness, guided only by our flashlights and the infrared cameras. The thermal camera caught strange heat signatures ahead of us, not human, but a large, shifting mass, like something moving swiftly through the trees. The readings were inconsistent sometimes it was a creature, sometimes it was a figure. But it didn’t make sense.

As we ventured deeper, Sanskriti suddenly stopped. “It’s close. I can feel it. It’s waiting.”

The temperature dropped sharply, and I could see my breath in the air. Through the viewfinder of my camera, I saw it a pair of glowing yellow eyes, watching us from the darkness, low to the ground. The moment I aimed the camera at it, it disappeared, vanishing into the thick underbrush.

Then, the whispers intensified, almost deafening, now accompanied by the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps moving toward us. 

“Ki lage... jah (what do you want... Leave).”

It was unmistakable now. The creature’s voice was deep, and though it was trying to communicate, it didn’t feel like a spirit, but something far darker. It was intelligent, and it knew we were there.

We tried again to communicate through the Spirit Box, but no clear response came. The entity would only whisper, its voice shifting like an animal.sometimes a low growl, sometimes a soft voice, sometimes a harsh, breathy hiss.

Joe’s equipment malfunctioned, his EMF meter spiking uncontrollably. We checked our surroundings, but the creature was hidden, just out of sight, moving with such speed and agility that we couldn’t track it.

We didn’t run. Instead, we focused, trying to gather evidence. Sanskriti tried to reach out, but there was no response, no direct connection with the entity. It wasn’t giving us answers, it was testing us, circling us, waiting for something. But we couldn’t figure out its intentions.

After what felt like hours, the activity slowly died down. The whispers faded, the readings settled, and the oppressive atmosphere lifted, though we still felt watched, as though the creature was still there, just beyond the edge of the forest.

We returned to the village at dawn, exhausted but determined to figure out what we had encountered. We had no concrete answers, only fragmented readings and a chilling experience that we could not fully explain.

“What was it?” Arup asked, his voice tight with apprehension.

“I don’t know,” I replied, my mind racing. “But whatever it is, it’s not human. The characteristics... the way it moves, the way it manipulates the environment... it’s not something we’ve encountered before. It’s intelligent, but it doesn’t want to communicate directly. It's controlling the space around us.”

Sanskriti was silent, lost in thought. “It’s something ancient. It’s not a spirit. It's more... predatory. A shapeshifter of some kind. The Pichach, maybe. But I can’t be sure.”

We didn’t have all the answers, but one thing was clear, Kaziranga’s forest was hiding something far darker than we could have ever imagined. The entity, whatever it was, was waiting for its next victim, lurking just beyond the trees, whispering in the dark.

And as we left the village, the whispers followed us, still haunting the corners of my mind.

It wasn’t over. Not yet.

Before leaving, we performed a cleansing ritual to purify the environment, using sage and chanting prayers to dispel any lingering dark energy. Sanskriti led the ritual, her voice steady and firm as she invoked protection and peace for the land. Afterward, we packed up our equipment and said our goodbyes to Arup. As we drove away, I received a message from him several days later. He told me that ever since we left, the whispers had stopped, and the tension in the village had lifted. The oppressive presence was gone, and for the first time in months, the villagers could breathe easy again. Whatever we had encountered, it seemed to have retreated, at least for now. But I knew deep down, this was only a temporary victory.
