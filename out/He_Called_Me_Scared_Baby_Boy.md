When I was a kid, my dad beat my mom.

Oh, I’m sorry. Was I supposed to sugarcoat it? My dad beat my mom. Just like Gramps beat my Gramma. And I’m sure his dad beat his mom. What a legacy I come from, huh?

I was a scrawny thing. Finally Dad got the son he wanted, after two girls, and he got a wimp. I covered my ears when he yelled. I ran to mama and cried. I begged him to stop hurting her and I couldn’t even take my punishment like a man. I was too old to act like that. I was worse than my sisters. What a disappointment. After a while, he stopped calling me by my name. He didn’t want anything to do with me, but when he had to talk *about* me, he just called me ‘scared baby boy’.

I was probably nine, ten, when mom grabbed us up in the middle of the night. He was passed out on the couch and she made it into a game to see if we could sneak past him without waking him up. By then we knew exactly how little noise to make to stay on his good side.

It was after midnight when we got to the [safe house](https://www.thehotline.org/get-help/directory-of-local-providers/?service=shelter). Mom didn’t make us go to school the next day, which was awesome. But the most awesome part was that we left Dad behind. I didn’t even miss him. Much. But when I thought about him yelling or shoving us down or giving mom another black eye, the missing went away.

We were there for a few months then we got our own place. We didn’t see mom as much. She had to work two jobs to pay the bills. My older sister made dinner most days. But when Mom was home, she was smiling. We had family movie nights. We made cookies. We did all that Hallmark BS. We were a team. A damn good team.

I was thirteen when he found us.

It was a Saturday. We were all teenagers by that point, so mom was the only one up. He knocked on the door so politely and it had been so long that she forgot to be afraid all the time. I woke up to her screaming.

I was the last one in the kitchen. I saw mom on the floor. My older sister pushed me behind her like she did when we were little, even though I was inches taller than her now. My oldest sister demanded to know what the hell was going on. She ran toward Mom and Dad backhanded her, hard. We didn’t realize he had a gun in that hand until we saw the blood. 

Dad saw me, crouching behind my sister like all 5’4” of her could protect me. He laughed. He actually fucking laughed. He hadn’t spoken directly to me for probably five years but he laughed in my sister’s face and said, “There’s that scared baby boy.”

And I was. I was scared when he shot my mom. I was scared when he shot my sister when she ran for help. And I was scared when I heard the last bang.

I was still scared when I woke up.

And when I stood up, Dad was pretty fucking scared, too.

He started screaming, saying something about *how could I be standing up when half my head was blown away*. Somehow I knew he wasn’t just seeing blood; he was seeing it pouring like ink down my neck, my teeth grinning through a gap where my cheek had been, my eyes black and hollow like burnt-out bulbs. I just looked at him. I had never seen my father terrified. And he was terrified of *me*. I liked it.

I took a step forward and he took a step back. I raised up and he cowered. I laughed and he sobbed. It might have been the best moment of my life.

The kitchen light was on behind me but the shadows it cast were weird. I guess Dad’s looked normal, but my shadow was huge and humpbacked. It moved when I moved, but it was Dad’s shadow that looked like a scared little boy. Mine looked like a monster. The monster grabbed Dad’s gun and fired.

After that I lived with Gramma. Every night when I closed my eyes, I saw my dad with his gun. I saw my mom and sisters on the floor. I heard the shot that I thought killed me, that the medics could find no trace of. And I saw myself cowering, not doing a damn thing to stop any of it. I heard his voice over and over and over. *^(scared baby boy scared baby boy scared baby boy)*

I took to walking the neighborhood in the evenings to tire myself out. I tried to fall into bed so exhausted there was no time to remember. One night, as the sun set and I made yet another loop through the neighborhood, I heard shouting. It was coming from a house that might have been yellow, but was streaked with red in the dying light. I wanted to cover my ears and hide. *^(scared baby boy scared baby boy scared baby boy)* Instead I drew closer.

The light from inside made the family look like shadow puppets on the curtains. The tallest figure was yelling and pacing. I could see the medium shadow shooing the smallest into another room. Doors slammed and there was a crash. 

It was just as loud on the sidewalk as it must have been to the neighbors, but not a single shade twitched. Instead, TV volumes ticked a bit higher. Startled dogs were shushed. Windows were closed and latched. 

I couldn’t stand it. I had been there. I had lived it. I had a right to be scared. But these assholes? Why should they be allowed to close their ears and cover their eyes when I never could? 

The next scream came from a different house, a blue one with two stories. The middle-aged woman standing at her kitchen window was screeching and pointing… at me. Her husband rushed to her side, looking confused, until he followed her gaze. Then he, too, began to shriek.

House after house, window after window, terrified face after terrified face. Finally, the tallest shadow from the yellow house slammed open his front door. He stopped mid-tirade when he saw me. His pupils blew wide like someone had turned out the lights; his breath came in gasps like he was drowning. I took a step forward and he stumbled back into the house, forgetting to close the door behind him.

I followed him. It was the second time I ever felt powerful. He was heading toward the back door with no concern at all for anyone left in the house. He tumbled over a pair of boots and hit the floor, scooted himself until his back was pressed against the wall, and covered his face with his hands. 

The wallpaper around him blistered and peeled, the family photos on the wall dripping black as if the smiling faces were melting away. He tried to shut his eyes, but every blink made it worse; his own hands seemed to crawl with movement, his veins pulsing under the skin like worms trying to get out.

I think I heard him praying. Maybe it was begging. He stopped when the lamp shattered across his skull.

His wife and daughter didn’t hear a thing. Heart attack, they were told later.

It took a couple more times for me to figure out what I was doing, and even longer to do it consciously. I’m not actually changing anything you know. I can’t shoot you with this apple, but I could make you think it was a gun. 

I trolled the suburbs for four years, picking them off one by one, before I chose the wrong house. I found an abuser. But he was also an agent who dragged my ass here.

The Visionary, your doctor calls me. Capital V. Like I’m a goddamn superhero. But you see the *truth*, right? So what do you see? 

That’s what I thought. Just some scared baby boy.
