My name is Savino and it was after my 18th birthday. It was senior trip, to a ski resort in a beautiful setting. I saw sights I'd only seen on the television. The day was fun, I enjoyed a day of skiing and talking about the future with my best friend Alex.

That night is when it happened. I woke up at 3 in the morning to a sweet smell that overwhelmed my senses. I didn't know what the smell was, but it felt like the way coffee smelled first thing in the morning. The smell led me out of my room and into the hallway, and that's when I saw it, a door that was out of place.

A door that didn't exist earlier. A door made of stone, black and decorated with designs of red serpents and demons that appeared to bow down to a circle in the middle of the door. Within the circle was the outline of a left hand. I raised my left hand and put it against the outline and it fit perfectly. The door then opened, and beyond it was an endless staircase that went far down into a darkness only lit by red flames on the walls.

I was unsure what to do but there was a feeling that I had to walk down the stairs, and I felt like I was in a daze.

The walk felt like an eternity and the bottom of my feet began to hurt. I reached the bottom of the staircase and entered a tunnel with a red glow at the end of it. My breath was visible but I felt warm. As I walked to the other side of the tunnel, I then saw it. A temple, a place that should never have been found.

The entrance of the temple was an archway made of dark weathered stone with carvings on it that resembled the ones on the door for earlier. The door to the temple itself was slightly open.

Every instinct in my body was saying to turn around and leave, but there was an unnatural feeling out of my control that pushed me forward. The air was light and warmth overtook my body. The temple was vast with pillars that reached the ceiling that appeared like an endless darkness. My eyes met what appeared to be an altar, and behind it an idol that appeared to be a large demon with a bright golden crown on its head. It's hands extended towards me as if it was waiting to be embraced. It had a smile on its face with sharp curved teeth. It's eyes were dark and still. 

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I looked around and saw many idols, and carvings of lowly serpents and demons. Their eyes were watching me, moving as I walked towards the altar.

I got close to the altar and my eyes met the gaze of the large demonic looking idol. At its feet I read the name "Sanguisrex". The large idol then came to life as I stood motionless. I could not move. It got closer and closer to me. It looked me in the eyes and embraced me. I felt warmth like I never felt before and closed my eyes in the embrace. I felt both scared and calm. He whispered something to me in a language I have never heard before. It took a step back and placed his left index finger on my chest and smiled.  My chest began to burn as it pressed its finger into my flesh, carving something onto me that appeared to be a spiral.I felt no pain. In a weird way, I felt comfort. 

Suddenly I saw sights that I wish I had never seen. A world on fire. A world filled with suffering. I began to laugh uncontrollable as tears streamed down my face. I then turned around and saw many demons congregated and bowing before me as the large demon placed its crown on my head. The feeling of falling then gripped my body as I felt I was being plunged deeper into the earth. The world blurred around me as I fell into the darkness.

My eyes opened and I woke up in my bed. I didn't jump out of bed, I woke up calmly. Covered in a cold sweat, I got up quickly and went to the bathroom and washed my face.

I began to think about everything I dreamt about.

"What the hell was that?"

"What was the smell?" 

"What was the place?" 

"What is Sanguisrex?"

I rested my head in the sink allowing cold water to fall on the back of my head. At that moment I caught my breath and told myself that what I experienced was just a nightmare. It wasn't real, just a nightmare

It was at that moment when I said those words that felt a sting on my chest that caused me to stand up straight, and I saw it. The marking that the large demon left on my chest was there, the spiral. It appeared as a healed scar. I then knew that what I experienced wasn't just a nightmare.
