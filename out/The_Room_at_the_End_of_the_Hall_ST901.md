The door at the end of the hall is still slightly ajar, just as it was that night. I haven’t ventured near it since that terrifying experience, but the memory haunts me daily. The whispers and scratching are relentless. It’s as though whatever was inside is still reaching out to me, even through the walls.

I did some research, desperate for answers. The landlord’s vague and unsettling responses led me to believe there’s something more to this place than I was told. I found an old building directory in the basement, and one of the documents had a cryptic note about a room labeled “ST-901.”

Curiosity got the better of me. I returned to the building’s archives, digging through dusty files until I found a reference to ST-901. It was labeled as a “containment unit” that was sealed off after a series of unexplained incidents. There were no details about what was contained, only that it was “not to be disturbed under any circumstances.”

That was when I realized—ST-901 was the room at the end of the hall.

I started paying closer attention to the sounds coming from the hallway. The scratching had a rhythm, almost like a code. Each night, the noises grew louder and more frantic, as if whatever was inside was trying desperately to get out. The whispers, too, had become more distinct. I could make out fragments of words, though they were always just out of reach of understanding.

One night, unable to stand it any longer, I decided to confront whatever was in there. Armed with a flashlight and a crowbar, I pried open the door. The darkness seemed to swallow the light as soon as I stepped inside.

The room was enormous, much larger than the exterior suggested. The walls were covered in the same disturbing stains I had seen before, but now they seemed to writhe and shift, as though they were alive. I noticed a series of old, dusty containment pods lining the walls. Each one had a thick glass window, but the insides were obscured by grime and shadow.

At the center of the room was a large, metal chamber with a single, small window. The whispers were now deafening, their urgency palpable. I approached the chamber, my flashlight trembling in my hand. Through the window, I saw a shadowy figure huddled in the corner, its form shifting and pulsating like a living liquid. It seemed to be reaching toward me, its movements erratic and desperate.

I reached out to touch the chamber, but as my fingers brushed against it, a jolt of cold surged through me, and the whispers turned into a cacophony of screams. The lights flickered violently, and the scratching noises became an agonizing crescendo. I stumbled back, my flashlight falling and illuminating the true horror of ST-901.

The walls of the room were covered in claw marks, deep gouges where something had tried to escape. And in the center of it all was a message scrawled in red, smeared with what I hoped was paint but feared might be something far more sinister. It read: “THEY KNOW.”

I bolted from the room, slamming the door shut behind me. I’ve been unable to sleep since, and every creak of the building feels like it’s taunting me. Whatever was in ST-901 is still there, trying to get out, and the whispers are growing louder, more insistent.

Now, I live in constant fear. I don’t know what ST-901 contained, but I know it wasn’t meant to be disturbed. And whatever it is, it’s not finished with me yet.
