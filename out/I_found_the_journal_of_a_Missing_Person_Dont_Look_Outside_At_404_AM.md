“There i was sitting in my couch watching TV, it was 3:43 AM i just got home after drinking with some friends, I suddenly heard knocking at my window, 43rd Av, a really dangerous street at night, I didn’t answer or tried to look out because although I was half asleep and half awake, I still have survival instincts. I went back to watching TV watching Gordan Ramsey calling people doughnut’s made me chuckle and that was a great way to pass some time. That’s when I heard growling and scratching at my window, I checked my watch, it was 4:03 AM. I kept hearing growling and even more scratching, and on top of that some mumbling. Stupid homeless people, if only they could just not disturb people. I decided to check my window, 4:04 AM. Thats when everything started to turn black. The once bright healthy green trees suddenly rotting and turning black. What the hell? I wondered how is this happening? I checked my watch, 4:04 AM. Suddenly I remembered what my friend had told me when we went drinking. Andrew was there laughing and sipping his booze. “My dad told me that in 43rd Av, you CAN NOT look out your window at 4:04 AM, they say that growling and scratching can be heard at that time and if you look out your window, everything fades away” I looked at him in confusion, “Andrew quit trying to scare me, it’s obviously fake, grow up” I laughed at him, “Just incase don’t look out your window, who knows what might happen?” 4:05 AM I came back to my senses and locked myself in my basement. 

Everything started to fade, I smelled a metallic smell all over the place, purple and black liquid and goo started spilling out from my house. I closed my eyes and put my hands against my ears. If i was gonna die, i didn’t want to see the entity that would kill me, i didn’t want to also die by black goo. Suddenly i felt a burning sensation everywhere in my body, I never once opened my eyes. It felt like my skin was withering away. The pain soon started fading away. I kept my eyes closed for an hour. 5:00 AM My eyes started to get tired from closing them shut. So i eventually opened them. Everything was back to normal, I went outside and it was still somewhat dark but the sun was rising up. I sighed out of relief. Must have been a dream right? I wen’t upstairs to my bathroom to clean up and wash my face. I had no skin. My veins were showing, The outline of my skull was visible. Then i saw it. A tall white man with no eyes, no mouth, no ears, black holes instead replaces his “eyes” I wen’t running outside of my house and into the woods, he is everywhere i go, he will soon catch up, I pray for those who find this journal i warn them, DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE AT 4:04 He is getting near, i can’t run. Oh god, He-“ He never finished his sentence, The book was covered in blood when i found it. Who knows what that man saw. It was a fate worse than death.
