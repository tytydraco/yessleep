Gaia, despite creating the Earth was and is not a benevolent being. Being the mother of Kronos after all. Those who delve into the unknown secrets she and her son created within the depths of the world, she herself had created will find nothing worthy of wealth or glory. However, the folly of man is ceaseless, despite being her children, when they seek out the mysterious places of their land. Will find nothing but mystery, madness and most likely of all, inevitable death.

Andrew, Emily, Evelyn, Douglas and I were all studying at the university of Exeter. :Douglas studying mechanical engineering, Emily being a student of geography, Andrew of history, Evelyn studying philosophy, and I being a student of medicine (trying my best, but struggling with the workload). Which as it turns out we all were. Douglas suggested during exam season "We should really go on a trip so we aren't wasting our lives reading books, textbooks and ancient history books of no note, there's only so much Gibbon you can read before it gets dull". Douglas was a foolhardy person and was obsessed over his passion project of working on a 1980s Jeep bought for Â£300 at auction, which he insisted would work a beauty once he'd finalised his 'alterations and repairs'. We were all young, just out of adolescence with me being 22 and the rest being 21 almost touching 22 themselves. I progressed to say "To be honest Doug, despite how silly you are that isn't the worst suggestion you've ever made", which the group found amusing and we settled on the idea of the weeklong jaunt.

We decided a nice trip would be towards the coast, as the beaches around Exeter were beginning to bore us, having lived most of our lives in the area. Anyways, we settled on our destination being to a cottage on the south-western coast of Cornwall in a small village Doug had heard of called Anglesand in one of his silly car magazines. He insisted that we set off as early as possible stating "I'm not quite sure if these headlights will last too long, and the battery isn't fantastic". This obviously filled us all with apprehension, but foolhardy as we were, this plan seemed good enough. I was the one to pack for the journey; I didn't necessarily plan particularly well - I packed an optimistic set of summer gear: some raincoats (being England after all), enough blankets for us all incase the cottage was undersupplied, and two sleeping bags. Along with a set of food, and obviously booze, some bottles of whisky, far too many cans of beer and a couple bottles of wine for when we felt bougie. I perhaps should have packed some tools, and even some binoculars, for spotting birds and eventually our final illusive hope of rescue.

Setting off as Doug had suggested early in the morning much to Emily's chagrin, her being a night owl stating "Why couldn't we just move on at midday, its summer, doesn't even get dark until near bloody 10pm" To which Douglas responded "Because despite how fantastic an engineer I am, I don't trust the headlights and I'm quite frankly shocked the car passed the MOT". This did nothing to unsettle Emily's nerves about Doug's engineering 'prowess', but as we rolled through the English countryside in pleasant weather, Emily fell asleep on my shoulder. I had been crushing on her since I'd met her 3 years prior, so this seemed like maybe my flirtatious attitude had finally had some success. A beautiful brunette with stunning hazel eyes, the moment I set my eyes upon her I was smitten.

Whilst we travelled through the beautiful rural English summer countryside, Andrew had grown bored and brought out a book he had 'borrowed' from the university's library, describing the history of Anglesand. Andrew began talking with most of us ignoring him out of disinterest "Anglesand was founded in the 4th century AD by the Roman's, apparently according to this book drawn to the area by the hot pools and the easy access for trade back to Gaul and even Rome itself. But, they abandoned the town shortly after establishment and it was later inhabited by the Anglo-Saxons, who seem to have done the same. The history ends there, odd but maybe the chronicler got bored of this project and moved on before he had finalised his last edit". None of us frankly cared about Andrew's rambling, and continued to enjoy views of the English countryside.

Our group arrived in Anglesand in the late afternoon, and journeyed straight to our cottage with Evelyn unsurprisingly taking 20 minutes to figure out the process of opening the rusted keybox (her not being of the handy, nor precise kind hence why we tasked her with this, as sort of a crass joke). During this time we conversed about what we should do on our weeklong trip. Douglas piped up "We should visit the town hall, and check it out, from what I read it sounded beautiful and masterfully conserved", I then suggested the church first as that was the primary building of the village, but sadly Emily overruled me (maybe our budding romance wasn't going as well as I had thought). Once Evelyn finally finished the convoluted process of opening the aged keybox I said and Doug agreed " We should take an early night and begin exploring in the morning" However, our party had endured our final exams that week and despite Doug and I's protestations to catch a nice early nights sleep to start early in the morning, we ended up drinking and playing cards and drinking games late into the night. Andrew being the last to pass out on to the couch, after finishing off a bottle of rum he'd brought privately.

When we eventually awoke surprisingly and almost suspiciously early, with me being the first to wake with a shocking headache. I began making the classic hungover travail of making breakfast and probably pissed the group off by shouting "Breakfast is ready!" which in a small cottage probably wasn't necessary. We sat down, drank some coffee to help heal our hangovers and ate the frankly delicious mix of food I had prepared. Bacon sandwiches, toast with marmite, butter and jam - and the most beautiful item in my most honest opinion, some croissants I had made the day before. I had meant to bring a pancake mix, but sadly in our hurry to begin the journey I had left it at home.

First on our list of sites to visit was as Doug had previously described the infamous town hall. Which we were surprised to find dilapidated and generally in a poor condition; not the highly maintained and beautiful regal building Doug had described on our journey down. Evelyn thought this hilarious, and said whilst stifling laughter "Doug, I know you always think you're right but I don't think you can tell your left hand from your right", Doug clearly annoyed by this commented "Well I only read a fucking magazine about this place, making the magazine wrong not me - I'm always right" We all disagreed, but figured we shouldn't inflame Doug further by continuing what was becoming an argument. I tried to diffuse the situation saying "C'mon guys this is meant to be a holiday, not a riot and bout of arguments", this diffused the group's condition a bit and Emily gave me a pleasant smile for my unusually neat handling of the situation; unusual for me being quite unconfrontational normally.

The growing confrontation sorted for now, we finally decided to actually do what we had intended, explore the town hall. I said "We should probably be wearing masks or something, its a bit damp", Doug retorted "Shut up with your medical nonsense, a bit of damp has never harmed anyone". Almost falling through some of the rotten floorboards, we travailed up to the centre of the town hall. Finding nothing of interest really, some charming paintings on the walls being of most interest, and some inscriptions in Latin written on the walls which Andrew found fascinating, but not knowing how to discern Latin just took a photo for later examination. Bored by this time, and the weather looking quite pleasant from the dusty windows, we decided to set off to the beach which had been one of the original intentions of the trip, and enjoy some beers and maybe even brave the cool Atlantic waters.

Hopping in Doug's car, figuring that it being a tiny village a bit of slightly drunken driving wouldn't be too treacherous. The trip to the beach was short, although Doug's car was starting to show his shoddy alterations hadn't exactly improved it's performance. I said the car was a pile of rust and rubbish, which didn't improve Doug's mood from earlier but I thought was humorous nonetheless.

We settled down on the beach with: blankets, beers and some snacks I had brought from Exeter. Lounging there for hours, with us even venturing into what we found was quite an unusually warm sea, pleasant as it was. Leaving all of us a little confused - especially Emily, being a young geographer she thought the water was far too warm for that time of year, or any time of year at all. Eventually, it began growing dark and Evelyn insisted we get back to the cottage before it was too dark, probably remembering Doug's previous comment on the state of his headlights. They made it back safely, and after the day's excursion were tired and actually followed my advice from the night prior and we settled into a pleasant sleep before midnight.

Awakening on the crack of dawn, unusual for students and especially the night owl Emily. We had a quick breakfast, and I quietly suggested "Maybe we should visit the church early today, so we can have another nice day on the beach, or even visit the cliffs above". The group agreed, with Doug being especially excited as the town hall and church were his primary reasons for visiting the town initially. Little did they know, this is where their happy holiday turned for the worse.

The church was a short walk from the cottage, but at this point we realised we had not seen a single person since arriving in the village. Evelyn being the first to mention this fact "I thought this village was meant to be a tourist hotspot, at least based on your magazine Doug". Doug, as vehemently defensive of his proficient planning said "Well, there was an advertisement for a village festival this week and they probably just all got a bit too jolly and are sleeping of their previous night's drinking, maybe its even turned into a camping trip of sorts. We might not see them all week!". This seemed reasonable to me, small villages of this sort do tend to host these kinds of events, similar to the ones up in the highlands of Scotland near Lochs Tay and Lomond.

Upon reaching the church, it was a beautiful sight - cladded with aged marble, with intricate indentations in said marble and small, albeit aged statues of ancient characters: Moses, Christ, and strangely Icarus; famed for flying too close to the sun and tumbling to his untimely death. None of this bothered the group, aside from Andrew being the only one with knowledge of Icarus grew slightly unnerved, believing their fates may have became intertwined. Inside the church was again, similar to the town hall, a dilapidated and clearly unkempt building. But, with fascinating statues: a masterfully crafted statue of Caesar during his death throws on the ides of March, situated beside a small statuette of Romulus and Remus being weaned by their surrogate wolf mother (this being an originally Roman church), a painting of the vestal virgins - and all the other less unusual things you would find in a church. Emily exclaimed "Despite the state of this place, it is absolutely beautiful, someone should really come back to this village and do it up, even pop it on Home's under the hammer" I was the only one to laugh and agree to this frankly silly, perhaps sarcastic suggestion, continuing my flirtatious attitude towards Emily. The others in the mean had found something peculiar. Some floorboards (all being rotten within the building similar to the town hall) which seemed to have been the most recently placed and heavily secured. Doug and Andrew, both agreed to dig up the boards to see what was hidden beneath, maybe ancient treasure or some secret from the elder days. Andrew ever the bookish and scholarly man said "These old churches tend to have large crypts, filled with corpses and coffins of wealthy men, worth checking out for sure". I didn't agree, this church seemed strange, there was a strange odor in the air and a faint whisper which only I could hear, coming from beneath the floors of the church.

Doug, ever the handyman eventually broke through the boards revealing a set of stairs leading to a crypt of sorts. The group followed silently, the first thing being noticed by the party being a wall of skulls with a door set inbetween, in almost perfect symmetry. Emily remembered a passage from a story she had read as a child, and unusually not skittish as usual said "These skulls likely belong to the priests and noblemen of the time. It was meant to be an honour to be entombed in such a noble church at the time". Whilst Emily was waffling on, Andrew discovered scrolls and ancient books in a  partition of the crypt, which he packed into his rucksack to read later on, back at the cottage.

I, not normally of the suspicious sort, thinking of myself quite sensible was starting to grow wary of this crypt, I guess thats what being surrounded by partial corpses does to a young man. Doug then figured in his ever widening wisdom, along with Andrew (more centred by curiosity than brutality) proceeded to break down the door centred between the wall of skulls. 

What they found inside shocked us all, even Doug. An enclosed room, with skeletons wearing preserved togas, and disturbingly an image of the cross drawn in blood bordered by an icon of a three headed daemon. Finally, an image of Cerberus the three headed dog who guarded the entrance to Hades domain of the underworld, a mix of Christian and ancient Greek iconography. I, strangely for me once again said "The men entombed here were probably just imprisoned for some heinous crime, or sacrilegious act subsequently going mad in the darkness they were confined within". Figuring we had explored enough and all quite spooked by the whole affair (Andrew especially, but being a quiet character didn't say a word), decided to leave and head back to the cottage or beach for some rest. 

Whilst walking back through the church, making sure to maintain ourselves on the steadiest floorboards. Suddenly, Andrew fell through the floor - the group being obviously worried for their friend precariously made their way to the chasm which had formed where Andrew had fallen calling out his name as they went. The floorboards had concealed a chasm, thinking perhaps a concealed old well but Emily suggested flippantly (given the likely death of their friend) "Perhaps this is why they founded this town, being built on an extinct volcano with warm generating nearby hot pools, mentioned in that magazine of yours Doug?" The group had no response, and Emily despite her calm reaction to Andrew's sudden demise began to sob. Eventually saying they should leave the village immediately before anything else horrible happened. Our now smaller group, agreed.

We were all by this point distraught, at the presumed demise of Andrew and the generally increasingly supernatural nature of the village, still having not seen a single person. The car was packed up, and we drove back the way we came with Doug being cautious with his car as his 'alterations' were beginning to prove not exactly precise nor efficient. After an hour, we noticed we had passed the same signs multiple times. Then in horror to us all, 'Welcome to Anglesand', we had returned to the village. The opposite of our failed escape attempt, which was the aim of leaving and returning to Exeter.

Growing dark, exhausted by the day's strange events we retired early with Emily and I sleeping in the same bed as she was the most unsettled and required company. Despite all the goings on I was greatly pleased by this as I could finally embrace the girl I had dreamed of being with for years. None of us slept well, dreaming of daemons and creatures of the night which terrified all of us.

Meanwhile, Andrew regained consciousness at the bottom of the chasm which he had tragically found himself falling down earlier that day. A broken leg, light concussion and confusion around his location and a glowing red light beckoned him further into the cave, even in his condition curiosity was one of Andrew's many follies. Despite his injuries, he quickly as he could (a broken leg not being conducive to speediness), staggered towards the light. What he found was a shock to even the bravest of souls. The volcano sitting beneath Anglesand was not inactive, but in fact highly active; with liquid magma and fumes spitting forth from the pool of boiling rock which sat directly beneath the town. Andrew recalled the original town's people's exodus from the town and realised in a spitting gargle of angst; The Roman's entombed within the tomb were maddened by the fumes from the deep volcanic stream, with the following Anglo-Saxons having no knowledge of this, resettled the town and likely succumbed to the same fate. Hearing whispers, and approaching heavy footsteps, with a sense of dread - Andrew, exhausted, bruised, broken. Sat down leaning against one of the warm rocks of the cave and passed into a pleasant sleep, from which as far as we know, he never awakened.

We awoke on the 4th day, Doug ambitious as ever tried starting up his 'glorious' jeep, but his 'additions' had clearly not been sufficient enough, and the engine only lasted half the drive to the cliff we had planned on seeking aid and rescue from. Despite this, Evelyn said nervously, but with a highly affirmative tone "We need to do something or we'll be stuck here till we die, and why are there no people here? I just don't understand". I responded "I agree this is turning into a folly but we should stay positive, maybe the people will return from the festival and direct us home". This did little to console our group, and we headed to the cliff. Carrying the bare necessities, the last of our whisky, wine, beer and what little food remained. Upon which we found another unusual aspect of the village; the cliff was warm, similar in warmth to a lightly heated blanket. Emily, ever to have an explanation for anything geographical suggested "Maybe the volcano isn't inactive, and is what drove the people from the town". We couldn't disagree as none of us had a better explanation. Setting up a small camp (I neglected to bring a tent), we made a fire with the wood from the benches in the church hoping to flag down a boat. We slept roughly that night, with Emily and I coupling together once more, under a multitude of blankets, with Doug and Evelyn claiming the sleeping bags and sleeping closely between each other.

Once again, we awoke and in a surprising change of our fate spotted a boat. Ecstatic with our change in fortune, we flagged the ship down and it approached slowly. We stripped down to the bare minimum and slid down the cliff into the again surprisingly warm Atlantic sea. We swam embraced in a spasm of joy in circles awaiting the boat to arrive to save us from our horrible previously approaching fate. Sadly, the boat never came, and in fact was likely an illusion caused by the same madness which claimed the previous inhabitants of the town, Andrew being the only member of the group to suffer a similar fate; and probably by this point deceased or turned into the very daemon which cursed the town. What occurred afterwards we will never know, but if you ever see a sign directing you towards Anglesand, do not follow it and immediately turn around; as you will likely never return.
