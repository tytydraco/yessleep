I saw the soldiers coldly look up at the two scientists in lab coats as they walked into the building. One was a tall man with blonde hair and blue eyes, the other a short Asian woman. The man walked up to me, extending his hand.

“Sorry to meet you under such horrible circumstances,” he said with a half-smile. “We’re doing everything we can to deal with this issue, those monstrosities outside. You are Jason Emery, right?” I nodded, not trusting this man at all. 

“Where were you two?” I asked. 

“Oh, just taking some samples from the nearby streams,” he said. The Asian woman looked away. “My name is Dr. Booth, and this is Dr. Lao.” She looked back at us, nodding her head quickly. She looked incredibly uncomfortable to be in the room with us.

“Are we being evacuated?” my wife asked. The doctor looked over at her, narrowing his eyes slightly, as if Beth were a fly he wanted to swat away. Then the charismatic half-smile returned to his face.

“Of course!” he said, his tone one of total confidence. “The National Guard, the Army and the Green Berets are on their way. We are simply trying to evacuate as many of the uninfected to a secure location as possible before undertaking such a large evacuation procedure. But the Air Force is sending countless helicopters as we speak.” I saw X and the other two soldiers look away, their faces still cold and emotionless. I had a feeling I was being fed a line of bullshit, but to what end? I didn’t know.

I heard screaming, muffled but distinct, coming from the direction where we had entered the underground laboratory. There were panicked shrieks, gunshots and slamming noises as I heard the hatchway open with a soft beeping noise. 

“Help us!” a male voice cried. “They’re coming…” His words were drowned out in a deep gurgling sound, as if he were choking. I couldn’t see the hatchway entrance, but I heard a thudding sound, as if a body were being dropped down the ladder. The soldiers looked at each other before rising to their feet and running towards the hatchway.

“What’s going on?” my wife asked. 

“Just stay here,” Dr. Booth said. “The military has it under control.” It didn’t sound like the military had it under control in the slightest. I heard a few male voices screaming, then automatic rifle fire began echoing throughout the tunnels. I heard X yelling, “Retreat!” 

I pulled my wife and daughter closer to me on the sofa.

“I think we need to get out of here,” my wife whispered to me. My daughter had taken Dr. Hoppy, her stuffed rabbit, out of her backpack and was hugging it tightly.

“Daddy, I don’t want to be here anymore,” Sarah said to me, looking up at me with her big eyes. I nodded, grabbing both of their hands and rising. We could use the distraction to try to run further in. I heard more and more commotion coming from the hatchway, then suddenly X tore down the hallway, blood gushing from a huge slice in his forehead. It soaked the entire right side of his face. Dr. Lao and Dr. Booth were in the corner of the room, whispering to each other, and I nodded to my wife and daughter, pulling them up. We took off down the hallway in the direction X had gone. Dr. Booth tried yelling something after us, but I ignored him completely.

I saw drops of blood in the direction X had run, like breadcrumbs that would hopefully lead us to the correct path. I couldn’t believe how huge this underground laboratory truly was. It was like a maze, and without the drops of blood to follow, I would have become impossibly lost in minutes.

After a few minutes, I saw X up ahead, seeming to slow down significantly. He was limping now, constantly wiping blood out of his face so he could see. Somewhere along the way, he had lost his rifle. He pulled out his pistol, putting it to his head.

“Wait!” I screamed at him. He looked back at me.

“It’s too late for me,” he said. “I’m infected. I can feel it. It feels horrible- like something is grabbing my heart and squeezing it…” He coughed up a wad of bloody sputum, spitting it on the floor before wiping his mouth quickly. His other eye had started bleeding, but he still stared through the trickle of blood at me as he put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. 

He fell as if in slow motion, his brains spraying the white-painted walls of the hallway. I heard footsteps running behind me and saw Dr. Booth coming up.

“Dammit, he wasn’t supposed to die!” Dr. Booth said. I sprinted ahead to the corpse of X, grabbing the pistol out of his hand. The words of the black-robed man who had come into my house at the beginning of all this rang in my head. “Do not trust the man in white.” I turned around to raise the pistol towards him, but he was one step ahead of me. He had already grabbed my daughter. He had a small revolver he was holding up to her head. He must have had it in a hidden holster.

“How about you drop that gun before I kill this little bitch?” the doctor said, smiling like a corpse. His charismatic persona was gone now, and the monster underneath was revealed. His eyes looked as dark as black holes. 

“If you kill her, I’ll kill you,” I said, raising the gun at him. I wasn’t giving up the only leverage I still had here. My wife was standing a few feet next to him, her eyes haunted and shell-shocked. My daughter stood there like a mannequin, just looking down at her shoes. I wondered what kind of psychological trauma she would have to live with after this was all over- if we survived. “Why don’t you tell us what this is all about? I don’t believe that you had nothing to do with it.” He laughed uproariously, but his eyes didn’t laugh. They stayed dark and flat.

“You’re not a dumb man,” he said. “I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out earlier. I’m the one who released the pathogen into the town’s water supply.”

“But why?” I asked. “Why would you want to kill an entire town?”

“*Kill* them?” he repeated. “I never wanted to kill anyone. Though surely, to make an omelet, you need to crack a few eggs. I think we all know that.

“We had originally found the alien fungus, if you can even call it a fungus, in a meteorite that landed in Antarctica. It appears on the world where this organism evolved, the differences between fungi, plants and animals are not as distinctive as on Earth. On its own, the fungi can move, breathe and even hunt small animals. But more interestingly, this fungi also has the ability to overtake any animal life and create a hivemind out of them. They also take memories and skills from the individual members of the group and use it for furtherance of the hive.

“In our early experiments, we found that certain leaders of the hivemind, the soldiers and kings and queens, produce a substance that reverses cancer, injuries, even death, in other members of the hive. 

“We call it the ‘royal jelly’, just like in bee colonies, but this is far more monumental of a discovery. If we allow the fungus to reproduce among large groups of humans and reach its natural state, we can find the alpha organisms among the hive, harvest the royal jelly, and use it to reverse aging, heart disease, cancer, AIDS, and countless other diseases. Can you imagine the potential scientific value such a discovery would have? We could potentially keep people alive forever- at least, those with value to the world.”

“And how do you know that it wouldn’t just turn the patient into one of those things?” I asked. “How do you know this royal jelly doesn’t just make you a slave to the hivemind?” He shrugged.

“It never did in animal studies,” the doctor said. “Now that you understand, why don’t we both put down the guns? You realize that, with this kind of scientific advance, your daughter could live for centuries.”

“Just one more question,” I asked. “Did the US government know you released this alien fungus into the water supply?” He laughed at this.

“The US government is too slow and fat to move quickly,” Dr. Booth said. “They gave me funding for animal studies, but no, I took it upon myself…” That was the last thing I heard him say. At that point, my wife quietly came up from behind him. She yanked his gun hand back with all of her strength in her right hand while slamming an open folding knife into his eye with her left hand. The shock and pain made him fire a single round, but it went high, into the top of the wall. My daughter screamed, falling to the floor and crawling towards me.

“Daddy!” she said, and I ran up to her, scooping her up and checking her for injuries. She seemed totally unharmed other than some scrapes and bruises.

The doctor was screaming something. It sounded like, “You bitch!” but with all the blood running into his mouth it was almost incomprehensible. My wife had taken his gun and pointed it at the back of his head.

“Should we kill him?” she asked. I shook my head.

“You should take Sarah and go forward,” I said. “I’ll take care of him.” As they walked forward, I took the pistol I had gotten from the body of X and raised it, pointing directly at the center of the doctor’s head. He was blubbering and shrieking, but in his last moments, a certain clarity came over his one good eye.

He stared at me with hatred as I fired, blowing the top of his head open and covering the ceiling and walls in gore. Some of it even splashed back on me, tiny droplets of blood that scattered over my mouth and face.

As I looked around at the mess, the corpses, the blood and everything else, I had a totally absurd thought.

“Well, someone’s going to have a hell of a time trying to clean this up,” I thought to myself, laughing like a maniac.

\*\*\*

We wandered through the hallways for hours before accidentally stumbling upon Dr. Lao in a room. She was sitting in the corner, drinking a cup of tea. She looked up, surprised. As she took in the three of us, covered in blood and scratches, she frowned.

“Is he dead?” she asked simply. I nodded. She sighed. “Thank God. He was a lunatic, Dr. Booth. I was afraid of him. I always thought he would try to make me into one of those things without telling me, maybe putting a drop of it in my tea or something. He became so obsessed with seeding the fungus into larger and larger animals that I knew it was only a matter of time until he tried infecting humans. I had no idea he would do it to a whole town, though.” She stopped and sipped some more from the green tea.

“Do you know a way out of here?” I asked, holding my daughter close to my side. She nodded.

“You know, he was going to take you and your family as subjects,” she said. “Purposely infest your whole family.” I nodded at that, thinking back to the warning of the black-robed man. “Yes, there is a way out that leads to the middle of the forest. I’ll take you there. I’m not going with you, however. I’m staying down here until reinforcements arrive- if they ever do.” We followed her through the labyrinth of halls and rooms until we reached a ladder at the end of one hall. At the top was a hatch. “The code is 339. Good luck.” She turned and went back in the direction she had come.

I climbed through it, helping my daughter and wife out. We looked around and saw a seemingly endless forest. Luckily, I had grown up around here, and I knew a lot of these woods like the back of my hand. I knew we were in a state park that bordered the tobacco fields at the north of town, and that the park had trails extending to the surrounding towns. It was just a matter of finding one of the right ones.

We hiked for miles, eventually coming to a clearing. In it, I saw another circle of mutated humans. Their tendrils intertwined in the middle.

Beneath it, I saw the corpse of X, half of his face missing. They allowed drops of some black liquid to fall into his open mouth, and he began to stir. Tendrils shot out of his shattered face, sewing up the hole and leaving a writhing mass of stubby, gray spikes in its place. In low grunts, he pointed to various directions. The tallest and strongest members of the group ran in those directions. I heard sniper rifles firing, then men screaming, and within minutes, everything was silent. I thought to myself that this must be the royal jelly that the doctor was so obsessed with. It appeared it could even bring back certain infected individuals from the dead.

The hivemind still gathered, and I wondered if they would use the knowledge taken from X and the other soldiers to break any military quarantine and expand beyond the borders of this destroyed town.

As I thought about this, I saw all the members of the circle moving their heads up in unison. They turned their faces up to the sky, their mouths open, as a soft rain began to fall.
