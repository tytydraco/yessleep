It’s 10 PM. We’ve been in this building for just over twelve hours.

By now we’ve searched the entire place about a dozen times over, checking every corner, every hallway, every room, coming to the same conclusion every time. On the third floor, we found a maintenance room with a ladder presumably leading up to the roof.  We broke through the hatch and do you know what we found?

A bunch of wet dirt. As if the building had somehow become buried underground. The dirt was at least soft enough that if we were really inclined to, we might be able to crawl up through it. But we’re not desperate enough for that. Not yet.

We’re sitting in the library now. We’d moved away from the cafeteria because the group digging into the wall was starting to freak us out.

They were looking worse for wear every time they came back out. Faces dripping with sweat, the skin on their hands slowly tearing away. The cafeteria was running out of chairs. We tried convincing them to stop. Told them they must have excavated hundreds of feet of drywall and yet they were still going nowhere. But they wouldn’t listen. They almost seemed possessed, deathly intent on the idea that eventually they’d make it out.

I got a message from James telling me that there’s still police surrounding every inch of the building. That they’ve expanded the perimeter so that nobody can get a good look at it. That multiple SWAT teams have arrived and he’s heard sporadic gunshots ringing through the air.

I don’t want to say that we’ve given up but we really don’t know what to do. There’s four of us here. Rachel, Jason, Amira and myself. We didn’t know Jason or Amira. We just happened to end up together. Most people have split off into smaller groups, though I’ve also seen a few sitting or standing by themselves.

We’ve been talking a lot. Trying to figure it out. To rationalize things. Amira thinks we’ve ended up in hell. That it explains why everybody else has disappeared. I told her that doesn’t make any sense because why us? Why a bunch of university students writing a philosophy exam?

She looked at me, asked if I’d ever done anything terrible. I told her sure but so has almost everybody else. So why were we singled out? She didn’t respond to that. She then changed the topic, asked us what we’d seen on the second page of our exams.

I thought about that strange-looking machine. About why it seemed so familiar. But I still couldn’t place it. I guess it was some memory that’d been buried too deep.

Amira told us that the only thing on her paper had been a sketch of a man’s face. Middle-aged, disheveled hair, scars all across. She said that she’d seen that man before, a long time ago. She’d been on a family vacation, on a beach somewhere. It was nighttime and she’d snuck out of the hotel with a cousin. They were sitting on the sand in the dark, staring out at the ocean when they saw a figure ahead, sitting waist-deep in the water.

Each wave that rolled onto the beach was heavy enough to completely submerge the guy. But this didn’t seem to bother him. He just sat there. This entire time they’d thought that he was facing towards the ocean. But then then the clouds cleared and the moonlight revealed that he was actually looking straight at them. Staring with eyes so wide he had to be forcing them open She said that he stood up and seconds later, he was running towards them. Of course they immediately began sprinting away. But by the time Amira got back to the hotel, her friend was no longer there. She told her parents and police were involved. Neither of them were ever found.

Jason said that his paper contained only a phone number. 123-456-7890. The same number he’d gotten a call from the day that his former roommate had committed suicide. He was in his old apartment, working on an assignment when he saw the number pop up on his screen. Bored and curious, he picked it up. He said that the voice on the other end was robotic, genderless. It sounded automated. And the only thing it said was that his roommate, Kyle, was about to die.

He thought it was some fucked up prank until he heard a banging noise coming from Kyle’s room.

He rushed over there and swung open the door. Kyle was standing on a chair in the middle of the room with a noose around his neck. There was a little girl sitting on the windowsill behind him, wearing a large hat that covered her eyes and nose. Kyle grinned at him before suddenly kicking the chair away. Jason tried to save him but wasn’t able to. After Kyle went unconscious, the little girl laughed at him and then jumped out of the window. They were on the 17^(th) floor. Then he remembered that Kyle never had a window in his room. The police were never able to trace the call. It came back as a dead number.

This entire time Rachel hadn’t said anything at all. The blood had drained from her skin and she was staring down at the floor. We assured her that she didn’t have to talk about it if she wasn’t comfortable.

She took a deep breath and said that her exam had a polaroid photo taped to it. A photo of herself in her childhood bedroom, taken from inside the closet. She said that she had a boyfriend in high school named Chris. One night, they were both sitting in her room and for whatever reason they began to argue. It turned ugly and then Chris ran into her closet and shut the door.

She thought that he was being immature and told him to come out. But he said nothing and just stayed in there. She then walked over and opened the door. But he wasn’t there. And her closet was tiny. There was nowhere he could’ve been hiding. But then she heard a noise coming from above. Coming from the ceiling. Sounded like somebody laughing. Not Chris’s voice. Like an elderly woman’s. She closed the door and told her dad what had happened. He called the police and they searched the entire house but they could neither find Chris nor the woman. Chris was never seen again.

Then they all looked at me. I told them that I’d seen the diagram of some sort of machine but that I genuinely couldn’t remember what it was supposed to be. I’m not sure if they believed me, but none of them pressed me about it.

Of course it freaked me the fuck out. Because if those things had happened to them, then what the fuck had happened to me? What was my brain trying to erase?

Amira suggested that we go back into the exam room so I could take a look at it, jog my memory. I told her absolutely the hell not. That I had no interest in finding out. But then Rachel said that she was pretty sure she’d left her phone charger in that room so she was going to go over there anyways. We agreed to accompany her.

When we got there, we found that somebody had turned the lights off. Problem was, we didn’t know exactly where the lights were. Maybe somewhere on the rightmost wall. We walked inside and I was about to turn on my phone flashlight when Rachel stopped me.

She told us to be quiet. So we did. Then we could hear it. The faint sound of several pencils scribbling against paper. As our eyes adjusted to the dark, we could make out the silhouettes of several figures sitting down, hunched over the desks. We ran out of there and shut the door behind us and then barricaded it with chairs.

On our way back to the library, we passed by the hole in the wall and noticed that it had gone silent. It hadn’t been silent for a while. Jason took this mean that they’d finally tunneled their way back outside. That they just hadn’t bothered coming back to let us know. I wasn’t so sure about that, but he’d already ran inside.

We followed after him, doing our best to traverse through the crooked, uneven path. It was surprising just how long it stretched on for. But at some point, the air started to become really cold and crisp. And then we could see daylight. Grey and muted. But unmistakable against the darkness.

Jason became ecstatic. He turned around with this huge smile on his face and said that we’d done it. That we were going to make it out.

But something wasn’t right about this. Because there shouldn’t have been daylight. Because it was half past midnight.

He began running faster and we struggled to keep up. But soon the tunnel had reached its end. Soon we were outside. Just not anywhere I recognized. Not anywhere we should’ve been.

Somehow, we were now out in the fucking ocean. Thick, dark-grey clouds rolled across the sky above. Heavy thunder rumbled in the distance. Rain came down in a light drizzle.

In front of us was what looked like a giant metal platform. Like a vast, sprawling sewer grate hovering above the water. I was hesitant to step on it, but I tested it with my foot and it seemed to be sturdy. We walked out onto it and looked around, though it was hard to describe what we saw. It was like a floating city constructed entirely out of steel.

The more I looked around, the more uncanny the architecture seemed. The buildings were too pointed, almost sword-like. They were also built in a way that seemed haphazard, nonsensical. There were vast stretches of empty space but also areas where several buildings converged into one, forming a grotesque-looking metallic behemoth of a structure. They almost looked like giant metal tumors. Some buildings were tall enough to pierce the clouds, while others were no larger than a shed. Some of them were unorthodox shapes. There was a pyramid, a sphere, a pentagon. Some buildings seemed to be hovering in the air without any visible support.

There were lights on in some of the windows, though there didn’t seem to be anybody around. The air smelled like raw fish, smoke, gasoline. There was a constant, grating noise in the background. Sounded like metal being sharpened.

Every time lightning flashed above the clouds, we could see the outline of colossal figures in the sky. One of them looked like a human skull. Another like a serpent with thousands of tendrils.

Jason’s expression took a sharp turn from hopeful into unbridled anguish. He knelt down, buried his face in his hands. We tried to pull him up to his feet, but he wouldn’t budge.

Rachel pointed out somebody in the distance, standing on top of one of the buildings. We thought it could’ve been Arnold because he was wearing the same red shirt. It looked like he was watching us. We debated whether or not we should try calling out to him. But we decided to stay silent. After a while, he walked off the edge, plummeting what looked like hundreds of feet down to the platform. The fall should’ve been high enough to turn his body into a pancake, but he landed perfectly on his feet, seeming no worse for wear.

Then he got down all fours and began crawling towards us.

It was a shocking enough visual that it kinda paralyzed us for a moment before we were able to regain our bearings. We turned, bolted back towards the tunnel. But we couldn’t find Jason. We looked around until we saw him sitting on the rails at the edge of the platform. We called out to him but he paid no attention to us. Then he jumped. Before he could even hit the water, a gigantic, pale hand shot up from the ocean, grabbed him, dragged him down. I looked at my feet, through the openings in the platform. Hovering just below the surface of the water was what looked like a human face. It was probably about a dozen feet wide. The best way I can describe the expression on its face is that of enthusiastic malice. As if it just couldn’t wait to hurt us.

I looked back at Arnold and now he was close enough for us to see that his head had been twisted all the way around. We ran back into the tunnel, crashing through the drywall until we made it back inside the building.

We began barricading it with tables, chairs, whatever we could find. But nothing followed us back. We sat on the floor, caught our breaths.

We’re still sitting here. There’s been little discussion about what we just saw.

Seems like we’re all at a loss for words.
