Cashiering is so easy it’s boring. It eventually becomes an endless line of faces I don’t care to remember, with mundane items I scan on auto pilot.

A pineapple. *beep.*

A pizza. *beep.*

A gallon of milk. *beep.*

I check the clock for the tenth time during my shift. It’s only 4 PM. I don’t clock out till midnight. I sigh. 

New customer. I greet them with a standard “How you doing?”

A hoodie covers their face, they nod in response. 

A shovel. *beep.*

A roll of duct tape. *beep.*

Rubber gloves. *beep.*

I raise my eyebrow and take a second look at the customer. I see stubble, a scar on his chin. His head is down so I can’t make out the rest of his features. He’s tall. 

A hunting knife. *beep.*

A pack of Ziplocks. *beep.*

A flashlight. *beep.*

I glance around to check if anyone else is seeing what I’m seeing. The other customers in line are paying more attention to the magazine selection than Ted Bundy over here.

Welp. Gotta do my job.

Three gallons of bleach. *beep.*

A box of garbage bags. *beep.*

A meat grinder. *beep.*

*What. The. Fuck!* I risk yet another glance. He’s looking at me. *Shit!*

“That’ll be two hundred forty three dollars and eighty cents.”

He pays in cash. Of course he pays in cash. 

“Have a good one.” My voice cracks.

He nods and walks away. I realize I never heard him speak. 

I’m put off. Then the next lady in line wants to know where the eggs are when they are literally in her eye-line and it’s a normal boring day at work again. 

After my shift is over I’ve got a headache and my feet hurt. I’m ready to go home, soak in my tub and binge watch something. 

It’s cold outside, winter has been holding our town at gun point for a week. I put my hands in my sweater pockets to warm them on the short walk to my car. 

As I’m approaching the employee parking lot I see a dark shape huddle down behind my car, the only one in the lot other than my boss’s truck. *What the hell?* I instantly remember the shady customer. My heart starts beating fast. 

*I ain’t going over there by myself.* I head to go straight back inside the store. I see my boss, Rick. He’s locking up. 

“Hey can you walk me to my car? I think I saw someone hiding over there. . .”

“Hiding?”

“Yeah, like someone ducked down behind my car.” My teeth are chattering, I regret not bringing a jacket. 

“Yeah, I’ll walk you.” He finishes locking up and we briskly walk to the employee parking lot. 

He circles my car a couple times while holding his phone as a flashlight, indicating with his hand that I stay back. I’m happy to comply. 

“I’m not seeing anything. If there was someone out here they’re gone now.” I can see Rick’s breath. 

“Thanks for checking.”

Inside my car I check the back, just in case. Empty, other than the fast food wrappers. I breath a sigh of relief. 

It’s a calm ride home. It’s not until I’ve pulled into the parking garage that I notice a slip of paper on the dash board. A receipt. I don’t remember making any purchases, and I’m in the habit of throwing trash in the back. (Don’t judge me)

I scan the list of items and my heart stops.

:SHOVEL:
:CTTAPE:
:GLOVES:
:EKNIFE:
:IPLOCK:
:HLIGHT:

:GEBAGS:
:RINDER:

There’s something written on the back. I turn it over, my hand shaking.

**You forgot to check the trunk**
