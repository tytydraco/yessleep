Franny and I were in the off season of our job and were longing for a bit of an adventure. Neither of us had quite saved up enough money to go on vacation, so we were locked in town and the surrounding area.

She was one of the only girls I knew who was down to camp in the middle of nowhere, and she was the only girl I feel I could spend the rest of my life with. Nobody at work knew we had a secret relationship either, but it was love, sunshine, and rainbows between late June and late August. .

After indulging in a bushcraft rabbit hole on youtube, we decided that building a miniature fort and camping out in it for a night or two was the perfect, pint-sized getaway. We got shovels, ropes, tarps, and the standard hiking essentials.

Franny also brought a night-vision camera that could hook up to her phone via Bluetooth. She wanted to "document the night" in a much different way than I was expecting a pair of 29 year old teachers to do.

We wasted no time after we parked at a nearby parking lot that is a short distance from a hub of hiking trails. We had an idea of where we wanted to go already.

It didn't take longer than an hour and a half of pure bushwhacking until we reached the spot: a clearing with a deep pond that linked underground to a nearby lake. Our province has a few of these underwater cave systems, so nothing out of the ordinary. Our site was also complimented with a near ten foot cliff right above the pond.

Business came first though, we needed to construct our fort.

We dug out an opening not far from the shore. It was all muddy clay that was easy to mold and shape. Franny started snagging some deadfall, and I sawed it up to make walls and a roof. Franny was inspired by a video she saw where someone made a chimney out of dried clay, and let me tell you that thing was cool.

It wasn't massive, it was more of a shelter than a fort. You couldn't stand up in it, but something was so goddamn satisfying to build it up. Franny set up her special camera to face the pond. I was just as curious as she was in what we were going to find.

With a few hours of sunlight, we did some cliff jumping. The water was almost hypnotic when I was fully submerged, like I could stay there forever even if I couldn't breathe in it. Franny felt the same. Whatever hypnotic effect the water had got us in the mood because the love-making that followed was absolutely insane.

It was about 11:00pm when we finished putting out the fire. We crawled into our sleeping bag amidst our newly made fort and passed out to the sounds of nature.

But it wasn't long after when Franny shook me awake.

&#x200B;

She told me she could hear laughing outside the fort. After about thirty seconds of silence, I heard it too. It sounded like a couple of girls laughing. Drunken girls who got lost, maybe? They still sounded somewhat far away.

I didn't think much of it until I heard a splash from the pond.

I urged Franny to check the camera, and after reluctance that the light would shine from the fort, she did. It was nothing short of abnormal what we saw coming from the pond.

Something was there, two figures side by side. It was difficult to make out from the distance but fortunately there was a zoom feature built into the camera. Franny zoomed the camera in and we both nearly jumped so bad we could've banged our heads on the fort ceiling.

Two sets of eyes reflected the light from the camera.

We studied it, doing our damndest not to make a sound. With a bit of jittery adjustments to the camera from the safety of our fort, we could make out a few more features, which made the situation difficult to understand regardless. 

It appeared to be two girls, treading the water in the pond. At 2:25 in the morning. They didn't wear anything on top, but they looked perfectly content. Not even a shiver? They continued to laugh and splash for some time. We watched them through the camera. Their eyes were uncanny and also unblinking, even amidst the laughing sounds the shape of their eyes didn't change. It was like it was rehearsed, rather than genuine laughter.

Franny and I both agreed to put the phone away for now. We heard them treading water, but no longer laughing.

Eventually, we heard another noise from the other side. It was an animal of some sort, it approached the pond. Franny quickly opened her phone up again, and we saw that it was a deer.

The two girls, still in the pond, stared at the deer as it approached. The deer took a look at them, and bounded off. The two girls dipped themselves underwater in unison. What on earth were they doing?

Franny wanted to leave the fort and check on the two, but I protested heavily. She insisted they could've gotten dragged under by something but then we noticed movement on the camera. She stayed to look at it, and honestly I'm so glad she did.

It was an elk. A big bull elk.

It approached the pond, and began drinking for only a brief moment when it noticed, as we observed  through the camera, the water began to stir.

The elk bounded back as the two girls resurfaced. They shrieked, slashing at the elk with clawed, webbed fingers. They were too slow for the elk, however.

One of these things left the pond, where we saw its whole body. She had the lower body of a slimy eel. She started to scream and trash. 

That's when the other one decided to act. She screamed, unhinging her jaw to clamp onto the beached one's torso. With a swift tug, the beached one was back in the water.

Shocked by what we just witnessed, we were wondering if these things even noticed us. We put the phone down, catching our sanity. Fucking mermaids exist? And they're carnivores, too? Franny and I could hear the persistent laughing and cooing until we eventually fell asleep.

Morning came around, and hearing no laughing or splashing, we decided we were in the clear. We packed up our things and got out of there.

When we got back in the car, Franny was disappointed to find her night vision camera ran out of batteries. After getting back into town, showering up, and having a joint together, we decided we would see if the camera's SD card saved any recordings.

After popping it open and linking it to her computer. We found footage of some of our late afternoon diving activities, and then the evidence we were after: the two she-monsters.

They surfaced around midnight, laughing, splashing, and singing a little. About every ten minutes they'd dive down and wait for something to walk by. When something would get close, they would slash or bite. This happened to an unfortunate badger, who unfortunately was gobbled in one go.

Then we saw when they stared at us and then when they went for the elk.

Unsettlingly enough, once we put the phone down, the rest of the footage was them staring at us, with the periodic laugh or song.

The last of the footage, around 3:15am, showed three more of these creatures appeared from below the pond, eyeing the fort. 

If I didn't know any better, I'd wager it has our scent. I don't want to chance that pond again...but something tells me that with how the underwater systems are connected, much of the smaller bodies of water aren't safe for us. 

If the water you dive into in British Colombia leaves you feeling hypnotic, don't you dare go back in it. 

Stay too long, and you may be dragged under by [something beautiful, and deadly.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ)
