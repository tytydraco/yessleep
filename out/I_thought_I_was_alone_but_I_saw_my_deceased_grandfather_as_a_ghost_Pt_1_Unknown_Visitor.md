I was home alone while my wife and 2 young children are visiting her home country. The next morning while getting ready for work I received a phone call from my mother and I hear her sobbing.                                                                                 

Me: Hi mother is everything alright? What’s wrong 

Mother: (Crying) Your grandfather just passed away this morning. We found him unresponsive. We took him to the hospital where we heard the news of his passing.

I immediately started crying 

Me: (Crying) I’ll just call in sick so I can come over for his funeral.

Mother: (Still Crying) Ok see you soon 

“1 hour car drive later”

I arrive at my parents house where my brother greets me at the door. We exchanged hellos and bantered a bit. I walk over to the living room where my mother was crying on the couch and my father trying to console her. We all go to hospital so I could see grandpa one more time.

The funeral came and everybody on my mother’s side came with some coming out of state for the funeral. Everything went smoothly.

I stayed a week with my family while we mourned his loss. I headed home early in the morning. Told my family goodbye and I was off. In the afternoon I face-timed my wife and kids and told them about my grandfather’s passing. When I got off the call It was already 10:30 PM. I had not realized how much time had passed. I went straight to bed because it was a long day.

1:00 AM came about and I was abruptly woken up by a loud crash. I felt that that a thief broke into the house while I was sleeping. I decided to go investigate. I grabbed my gun and my phone getting ready to call the police. I walked down the stairs to the living room where I hear someone calling my name. I was wondering who is here at this hour. It wasn’t until I set foot into the living room when a ghost. But it looked kind of like my grandfather. The ghost approached me while I froze and touched me on the shoulder and I passed out.

The next morning I found myself in a hospital bed. I was confused about what had transpired. Later a doctor who was coming in to check on me saw me.

Doctor: You’re awake my now sir. I was coming in to check up on you. Is there anything you need?

Me: I’m alright thank you doctor. I just want to know how did I end up here?

Doctor: Your neighbor saw you passed out in your so she called an ambulance and the rest is that.

Me: Ok thank you doctor. 

I get discharged from the hospital and went home. While at home I started to wonder what I had saw last night. Was it my grandfather who passed away a week ago? Should I tell somebody even though they’ll all think I’m sounding like a crazy person? I decided to purchase several security cameras to put around the house and to find out who was there last night. For all I know it could’ve been a nightmare but it all felt so real.
