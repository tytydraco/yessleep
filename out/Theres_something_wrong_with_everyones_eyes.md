I (20m) need help. I'm writing this out locked in my room. Everyone's been acting so weird, like the worst of their personalities are all cranked up to 11. It started at school the other day. 

I was on my way to class, sleep deprived as all college students are, when my friend (let's call him Jack) who's always nice and cheery, even under the most upsetting circumstances, was absolutely silent. I ask if something happened, and he just snapped at me. Called me annoying and walked off, grumbling about how much he hated everyone in the school. Jack always dealt with his fair share of bullying, so I assumed he was having a bad day and decided not to bug him about it. Everyone has bad days, right? 

So I head off, wondering what's up with him, when this other kid who I know semi-well (let's call her Tia) immediately runs up to me and latches onto my arm. I'm confused, because I barely ever talk to her unless she needs notes, and she goes off on this rant about how much she needs me. Now, I think I'm either dreaming, or someone slipped sometimes into my morning granola bar and coffee this morning. So I shake her off, and make some excuse to get away. Weird, right? It gets weirder

My entire class is either arguing, screaming, making out, or asleep. Now, usually, this would be the calmest little bunch of college sophomores you'd ever see, but this was next level. There was definitely booze in the air too. Someone was drinking something. The few kids I made eye contact with? Their eyes we're grey. At this point, I don't know what's happening. After verifying that our professor (and every other faculty member) was out of commission, I decided to cut my losses and head back home. 

Yeah, yeah, a college student living with his parents still, real pathetic, but that's beside the point. I walk inside my house, expecting some semblance of normalcy. At this point, too much to hope for. My parents are screaming at each other, which is weird, because usually they're the most lovey dovey pair you'll ever see. It's almost sickening, but I'd prefer that over this. It was starting to get violent. 

I tried to yell over them, talk some sense into them, but the moment my mom hit my dad in the face, I decided to stay out of it. Maybe not a smart move in hindsight, but I was freaked out by then, man. 

Thinking back on it, my dad was facing the door. His usually brown eyes were grey. 

I head to the bathroom, and check my own eyes. Brown. Thank whatever gods are left. I head upstairs to my room, and lock the door. At the point, I don't know what's going on, and I don't want to be in the line of fire. 

So, weird, right? You're probably expecting something along the lines of "and then I woke up" or "then I found out it was a *really* elaborate prank", but nope. It's been 3 days now. Whenever I try to go outside, someone with grey eyes, usually someone I know, for that matter, comes over and starts talking crazy. And it's not like these traits are 100% out of character. Yeah, Jack has some minor anger issues, but he's never exploded like that, and yeah, I'm pretty sure Tia has a mini crush on me, or something, but that was some straight up obsessive crap. 

I stopped going outside yesterday. I only go downstairs for food when I don't hear anyone.

I'm not proud to admit this, but I'm scared. Granted, I'm sure anyone would be in my situation. What do I do??
