No I’m serious, this is a warning for the people lucky enough to stumble upon this post.



Be good and do the right thing, and don’t question it, trust me. You do NOT want to know what’s on the other side. 



Before people think I’m crazy, I’ll explain my experience.



It all started while I was walking home from a mundane day at school (for context I’m in my final year of high school). I got out of the train station and was walking home before I heard a blood-curdling scream from close by.



Looking around, I noticed that it was coming from an alleyway, more specifically the alleyway that I would usually walk in, as it was the faster way home.



Taking a peak, I saw a scrawny boy surrounded by two bigger dudes. While one of them was rustling through the scrawny boy's backpack, the other one was slamming his fists onto the kids ribs. As he coughed out blood and fell to his knees, I grimaced and looked away, hoping that none of them noticed that I was looking.



*Fuck that, I’ll just take the longer way,* I thought.



Subtly walking past the alleyway, I pretended to ignore the clear assault that was going on in front of me. I figured that the cops would take care of it themselves and left it at that. No way was I gonna risk myself getting beat up.



A few minutes later I walked up the steep road that took me to my neighborhood. It was a slightly longer route, but at least I got out of trouble.



However, no matter what, I couldn’t get the kids face out of my head.



The utter pain he showed while getting punched, the desperate attempt to grabbing a hold of his bag that was getting emptied by one of the guys. The eyes that subtly conveyed the fact that he was used to this kind of life. It was all too clear in my head.



As I walked to my front door, a man was standing in the middle of the road.



It was a man that looked to be around 60 years old wearing disheveled clothes. He didn’t have any shoes, his nails looking sharper than toothpicks. His white beard reached down to his chest. His clothes looked like they haven’t been washed in years, his teeth crooked and brown-stained.



As I walked to the front door, the man maintained eye contact, his face remaining deadpan.



“Uh, can I help you?” I asked.



“Oh, what have you done, boy?” Asked the man, shifting from a deadpan stare to a panic.



“I’m sorry?” I replied, reaching for the house key in my pocket and moving away in discomfort.



The man, distressed, ran over to me and grabbed my shoulders. He was breathless. His eyes were filled with fear, shaking.



“What have you done, boy?!” He shouted even louder, now grabbing my shoulders even harder and shaking me, as if he was trying to wake me up.

  
"What the hell?!" I shouted.



As I pushed him away, I gasped at a sudden force of pressure thrusting against my chest. My vision became blurry, a ringing noise piercing into my brain. It felt as if I was becoming less and less in touch with reality.



“Boy, are you ok?!” I could hear the man screaming, although muffled. He tried shaking me awake, but it was useless.



As the world began spinning and my vision became progressively blurrier, I jolted myself awake in a place I didn’t recognize.



It was dark.



Quiet.



Empty.



However, it didn’t feel like I was anywhere. No surfaces to touch or lay down on, no light to see, no sounds to hear, no body to feel like I’m inside of. Not even a place to stand up on.

  
Just my conscious.



Suddenly, I felt a jolting pain surging across my body, a sense of pressure overwhelming my entire being.



I tried to push myself away from this sensation, but it was useless. I was trapped.



I then heard screams overlapping each other, the cries for help and shouts of suffering screeching throughout my surroundings. Even though no one was around me, it felt like there were millions of people.



It was a sensation where my heart felt like it was about to explode out of me, but without the feeling of having a heart.



The feeling of my skull being crushed by thousands of pounds, but without the feeling of having a head.



The screeching of loud cries for help piercing through my ears, but without the feeling of having ears.



I was empty, but in pain. Like if my body was being torn apart, even though I physically couldn’t feel my presence existing.



Powerful, disgusting stenches filled my sense of smell. I wanted to gag, but couldn’t. I wanted to vomit, but physically didn’t feel like I had a body to do that.



Even though I tried shouting, no words came out of me. As if I was perpetually having my existence being torn apart and slammed back together over and over again.

  
It was loud, brutal, but also empty. Everything was felt, but I couldn't do anything about it.



As the pain got progressively worse, I suddenly saw the first shed of light from a distance. As it rapidly lit my surroundings, I opened my eyes and shot a frightening scream that echoed around me. 



Looking around, shaking in fear, my body feeling numb, I realized that I was in my room. Every hair in my body was standing on end. 



My skin was completely wrinkled, as if the stress was too much for my body to handle. Running towards the mirror, my hair was completely white. My eyes were widened, lips thinned and shaking. My body was thinner, almost skeleton-like. I felt trapped.



I was still, but shaking uncontrollably. Terrified, but numb. It was a feeling that I do not want to and cannot describe.



Turning around, I saw a note that was left on my bed.



*“Be good and do the right thing. Don’t question it.”* It wrote.



I don’t know what I just experienced or what the meaning of it was, but I do not wish it upon my worst enemy.



I’m scared of going out, scared of looking at or speaking to anyone. 



I’m worried that I will go back to that place, a place of nothing but perpetual pain.



Who was that man? Why did I suddenly appear in a dark place?



And why do I feel like it’s about to happen again?



I don’t want to go back. Please, anything but that.



I don’t know what to do and I need help.



But one thing’s for sure:



Be good and do the right thing. DON’T question it.

  
Trust me, you do NOT want to see what's on the other side.
