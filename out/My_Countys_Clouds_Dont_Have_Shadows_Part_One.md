This started with a strange local phenomenon. In my county, clouds have no shadows.  No matter how ‘cloudy’ the sky was, the earth beneath was crystal clear and sunny. A strange meteorological thing, really. We get rain, occasionally snow, but we never get a cloudy day. It sounds strange, and it is. When it rains here, it just drips water from the sky. We don’t get that ‘dark and stormy’ night; we just have a stormy night. Of course, when the sun goes down it gets dark, but no weather affects how cloudy it is during the day.

We’ve had hoards and hoards of scientists trying to figure this out. Nobody can. Simply put, it’s a mystery. A harmless mystery that people have sunk millions of dollars into investigating it. The fact of the matter is, nobody has ever found out why they don't have shadows. At this point, it was seen as so benign, let's not waste  more money investigating it. That, of course, does not stop the rogue conspiracy theorists or independently funded studies from coming and disturbing the peace.

My town has become somewhat of a tourist trap due to this, not only from curious neighbors from other counties but from scientists. We get meteorologists all the time wondering about the ‘mysterious clouds that don’t make shadows’. Urban legends aside, these clouds haven’t affected anybody, and after decades of study, nobody was able to find out why exactly they just…don’t have shadows.

I am one of these dreaded meteorologists disturbing a quiet local community with my conspiratorial antics. In reality, I grew up in this county and just like the weather, enough to get degrees to study it. I work for the local news, so I get a bit of respect. Anybody, including me, who grew up in a tourist area hates tourists, but unfortunately, it’s a good bit of the local economy.

Because I work in the news, I’m essentially always on call, so when I received a frantic call from a coworker, I didn’t really question it.

“You need to get over here, now.”

It sounded like somebody was about to shoot her. I grabbed my clothes and asked for the address. It was only about a five-minute drive, so I decided to walk to save gas. As I got closer to the address, I noticed this large cotton-candy looking structure. It fell in the local playground, and people had already surrounded the scene, police chasing off curious onlookers. Since this is a smaller town, they knew me and gave me no hassle about coming through.

It was strange; when I looked ahead, I saw a cloud. A cloud in all its fluffy white glory had encompassed an entire playground, the tops of the swings and playhouse peaking out through the fluff. In my ten years, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it before. It looked like a typical cloud, but it was...here for some reason.

The first thing that I considered odd was the size; most clouds are massive. The only reason they seem small to us is simply because of the distance. This cloud was barely any larger than the playground it fell onto. Second, clouds need specific conditions to appear.. Third, they’re not supposed to feel sticky. Clouds are little more than droplets of water, maybe some salt or dust. There is nothing there that could cause a cloud to feel sticky.

It wasn’t exactly smart, but everybody else was doing it. When I dipped my hand into the ‘cloud’, it came out sticky, clinging to my hand like an old Jolly Rancher sticks to carpet. Others had done the same, trying to wash the cloud off their hands with bottles of water or spit. A thick, gamey smell came from the slime that covered my hand. I looked at my coworker, who had started to work on her own slime-coated hand with her car keys.

A police officer placed his hand on my back,”Any clue what the hell is going on here?”

“Not a damn clue, any chance you could get these people back a little bit, making me claustrophobic.”

The officer nodded and started escorting people away from the scene. It didn’t make me feel much better. Now that the police had set up a ‘do not cross’ tape, I could more accurately see the people watching my every move from beyond the rope. I was the only real professional around. Not that I was doing much, in fact, I was just trying to figure out how this could even happen. Ignoring that a cloud should not be sticky or cling to anything, how did this happen? Assuming this even was a cloud, which was a question I was all too ready to bring up.

You’d expect it to smell gross, but it didn't. At worst, it smelled faintly of cream, but unless you really tried to smell for something, it was just nothing. The smell was almost a bit pleasant. I wasn’t about to taste whatever this was, so smell was what I had to go off. I knew at this point this was either some insanely rare one-in-a-century event, or this was not a cloud.

The idea of a rogue prankster wasn’t exactly something my town wasn’t accustomed to; there isn’t a lot to do, so teenagers get bored and do what teenagers do: property damage.
I just questioned how they did it, but I quickly realized I didn’t need to. Security cameras, I just needed that security camera footage, and those kids would be half-heartedly reprimanded by their parents, and I’d have a cushy 2 hours of overtime. I asked the police to see the footage, telling them it couldn’t be a cloud. The police looked around, like each of them hid some dark secret. One of them nodded her head and led me to the security room. The playground was in a public park, and after a kidnapping scare a few years back, the mayor demanded cameras on the playground; Everybody in town knows that. 

“Ain’t gonna answer any questions, but here ya’ go.”

I sat down in the duct-taped-laden chair and watched the footage. There was no teenager, there was no mysterious prankster, there was only the playground. It just happened, in an instant, the cloud just came down and overtook the playground. Didn’t even break anything, just molded around it like clay, only the higher portions of the park came through the cloud.

“I told you it didn't answer any questions,” The officer looked over my shoulder to the screen, shaking her head.

Dumbfounded. That’s the only word that scrapes the surface of how I felt in that moment. What the hell happened? What the hell is that thing out there? It’s certainly not a cloud. Clouds don’t smell a bit like cream, nor are they sticky, nor do they just fall onto things. Why here, why now? I didn’t wanna answer that question, but I’m the only one who might have even a bit of an answer. Animals have fallen from the sky before, so had mysterious meat, but I never had to try and come up with an answer for those. Those are just disconnected mysteries; I don’t have the choice to just throw my hands up. I’m risking my credibility here.

“Hey, officer, any chance you could completely clear the scene so I can investigate?”

“Give me fifteen, I’ll tell you when they’re gone. You need water? You’re pale.”

“Water, please, if-if you could.”

With that, she left the room. I watched those 3 seconds of tape religiously, trying to look for a cut, or some sort of edit, something to explain this. Maybe this prankster was more…I dunno experienced? This isn’t necessarily illegal, at least I don’t think, but why?

“Place is cleared out, we’re blocking off the area best we can. Here,” The officer handed me a bottle of water, and she left that room with me in it.

My habit of nail-biting came back viciously. I didn’t even realize I was doing it, but my nails were nibbled down to stumps, my thumbs bleeding. I left the room, my coworker still standing near the ‘cloud’, clearly awaiting an answer. As I walked back to the ‘cloud,’ she opened her mouth, to which I just shook my head. 

Oddly enough, the cloud seemed to have shrunk a bit from when the video was taken, when it first dropped. I didn’t realize it until I saw it again in real life. It was a stupid idea, but the only one I had. I poured a bit of the water on to the cloud. It simply ran off of it, which did answer two questions I had. One was a crack theory that maybe the prankster was just really good and used a ton of cotton candy for this.  Second, a cloud is not a solid object, water should’ve just passed through.

I circled the thing, over and over, trying to collect my thoughts as my other coworkers began to pile in, asking questions and shoving their cameras into my face. I didn’t wanna admit on live television that I had no idea what was going on here, but I had no other choice.
“I’m not entirely sure what’s happening, but I’m doing my best to call in the best professionals to assist me in this matter,” Was what I said, which is News talk for ,”I got nothing.”
After a while, I decided to get some sleep. I told my boss I needed some rest, I didn’t sleep much, and the sun was well out by now. She agreed to let me leave, but made me promise I’d be back ASAP.

I went home and collapsed on the bed, got about an hour of sleep before a call woke me up. The temptation to just not answer was there, but for the sake of ‘professionalism’, I did. Like the first round, I was just told to get over there ASAP. Which I did. Nothing seemed off visually, but the smell. Good. God. The smell.
I walked again, a bad choice, and every step brought me closer to the most putrid scent my nose has ever been forced to metabolize. It was like stale cat urine mixed with a moist, moldy smell. 

Every step brought me further into vomiting. I was just lucky I hadn’t eaten anything within the last 12 hours, so when it inevitably happened, it was just water and bile. I couldn’t imagine that other people couldn’t smell it; I’m shocked the neighborhood didn’t evacuate based on smell alone.

When I got there, the cloud had condensed more; The chains of the swingset were finally visible again, and the floor of the playhouse was covered by only a thin layer of cloud. Worst of all, the cloud seemed to almost pulse. It moved slightly, almost like it was breathing. I don’t know what made me do it, I don’t really know, but I grabbed a rock and threw it at the cloud. The cloud absorbed it, paused, before the rock came hurdling back out at me. It hit my knee, and the rock clinked back into the ground.

I don’t really know what possessed me to text my coworker. I just know that I wasn’t expecting her ringtone to echo through the cloud. The mass twitched and writhed slightly, oozing out her phone at my feet. It rejected the rock instantly, but for some reason held on to that phone. Even worse,  I don’t know when she lost her phone, maybe this cloud texted me?

I don’t know what to do here. I decided to barricade myself in the security room. I don’t know what law enforcement would even do about this. What could they do? I have her phone with me right now. What am I supposed to do? Text her? I’m shocked I haven’t seen anybody else out here. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been here for over two hours now, religiously watching that camera. Waiting. Watching. I want something to happen. I want to confirm to myself that I am, in fact, seeing this right.

I didn’t even notice it, but the smell has dissipated. I don’t know when or how it stopped, but it’s gone. It’s still trapped in my nostrils, but it’s tolerable. I wanna go outside, but it’s movements have become more rapid, looking like the cloud itself is gasping for air. I just feel like…nobody but me is seeing this. Come to think of it, you’d think the police would treat a possible biohazard a bit more seriously; I think I’m just overly tired and possibly spiraling. 

Does anybody know what’s going on here? I will take any theory you throw at me, please.
