I guess I'll start by giving a brief description of myself.I'm a normal guy in an South-Asian Country.I come from a village in the countryside.The local diety is the "Vaman".The urban legend is that he founded the village.Anyway,I returned to my hometown for a couple of months to take care of my parents,who were not in the best of health.Everything seemed fine for the first couple for weeks.The village was slow to modernise,and seemed how it was when I lived here in my childhood.

About 2 weeks into my visit,my family and the rest of the village was woken up in the middle of the night.Everybody was told to assemble at the shrine of the "Vaman".The shrine was really just the brass statue of the diety below the largest tree in the village.Mob frenzy overtook the villagers.I narrowly escaped the stampede which ensued.Worry and curiosity seemed to be in the air.

After we assembled under the banyan tree,the Village Headman climbed the makeshift platform and announced that the brass statue of the "Vaman" was bleeding.Hushed whispers reverberated through the crowd.He gestured at us to form a line and inspect the statue.

When my turn finally arrived,I looked at the statue at awe and fear.The statue had a deep gash across it's right thigh,above the knee.The wound was bleeding profusely,and a steady stream of blood oozed out of it,forming an ever growing puddle at its base.

An primal fear overtook the village.People were speculating about the arrival of the Kali Yug(the Era of death and judgement),daemons,or were praying to God to forgive their sins.The Headman,and the Village Pandit,who were not to be seen for the last 15 minutes,returned with an old,dusty,thick book.It was bounded with reed,and had a Sanskrit heading.They ascended the platform,and began reading the book around.

"This book is the story of the Vaman and the foundation of this village.This village was founded by the Vaman long ago.At that time,the entire realm was ravaged by daemons called "rakshash".These daemons were once pious men who gained the favour of the God's,but now misused it for their own gain.They used their powers to terrorise locals,practising cannibalism and other dark rites.One fine day,a "Vaman",an enlightened young man bestowed upon gifts by the God's,decided to save mankind.However,there were too many "rakshash",and the only recourse for humanity was to relocate the few remaining dispersed survivors to an village.The Vaman took the conflict to an incomprehensible plane pf existence.He "voided" all the "rakshash" and himself to the plane.The Vaman knew he could never defeat the rakshash.He could only delay the inevitable.When you read this,be warned,it is the beginning of the end."

Pandemonium erupted all over the village.People rushed home,and began fleeing.Only a few stubborn villagers remained.Well,I had heard enough to know that there is no escape.I overcame my primal urge to flee and walked to the pandit's home.He must surely have an grasp on the situation here,or so I thought.The pandit was a short plump man,who wore the traditional saffron robe.He and his wife were praying to the God's to come and save them.I waited outside the door and knocked(I couldn't enter the house as I was of a different caste).The pandit met me outside.

Well,obviously,I asked him if there was anything else that he left out during his previous recitation.He sighed,and replied Do you really want to know?There is no turning back."I replied affirmatively.He went in and brought out an book.It was bound with what appeared to be human skin.I resisted my nausea and listened.He explained for it:

"By choosing to open this book,you will have bounded yourself to your fate.The only way to change anything now is to be sucked into an energy warp that might take you to the plane where the Vaman is.You might however,be transported to an plane with horrors beyond your imagination,not assuming the horrors you might see the Vaman fighting.Not to mention that you might be stuck in an void,where you will exist till the end of time.Do you still want to proceed?"

I hesitated.This new found information took me aback.Yet,I decided to proceed as at least I wouldnt be hunted and cannibalised by monsters for sport.The pandit gestured me into his house,an rare sight.He gestured me to wall into a room located at the back of rhe house.At an instant,I was tunneled through an void.I saw and felt an kaleidoscope of colours,emotions and other indescribable things.

I exited the portal just like how I entered.It seemed like the door was behind me.I was in stasis,a dream like state.I couldn't move my head,limbs,or any other part of my body.I couldn't even blink or move an muscle.As such,I was forced to see the horrors ahead of me.The Vaman still resembled a human,but had a deep gash on his thigh.The Rakshash were monsters in every way,and had deformed humanoid forms.

Blood dripped from some of them,few had multiple limbs and other mutations,few wore crude clothes made of human skin,and a couple of them had rotting flesh.

All of them,rakshash and the vaman,seemed to be phasing in and out,taking a physical form,and then suddenly shifting to the form of an unknown energy which could only be felt,not seen.The feeling was strange,to say the least.Its almost like I could sense their positions.Yet,they couldnt see or hear me.After what seemed like an eternity,I finally voided back to the pandits home.
