Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyqexx/stories\_from\_a\_goreham\_park\_ranger\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyqexx/stories_from_a_goreham_park_ranger_part_1/)

After we had returned to the ranger’s station, I had a couple shots to calm my nerves. Looking down, I realized I had been spattered in the blue-black blood of the creature from the forest. Tiny droplets had dried on my arms, chest and face, and as I licked my lips, I realized I just ate a little of the blood too. I gagged for a second, furiously wiping at my mouth and spitting on the floor.

Wickie seemed mostly unaffected by what had just happened. He was a teetotaler, avoiding all alcohol but smoking cannabis and occasionally even taking psychedelics. Whenever I drank, he always told me, “Alcohol rots your brain and kills your liver,” though I doubted any of that would matter if the things in this park killed me first.

I was looking into my empty shot glass with trembling hands when Sheriff Ames came into the ranger station, flanked by two agents in black suits and sunglasses.

“Back already?” I asked him. He didn’t respond. “Care for a drink?” He looked at the bottle of Skye vodka, seemed to consider, then glanced at the agents next to him and shook his head no.

“Son, did you find anything out there?” he asked in a fatherly tone, his Southern drawl receding a bit now that he apparently had company from one federal agency or another.

“We had a bit of a problem,” I said. Hardwick nodded.

“Wickie, Little Jay,” the Sheriff said, turning to Hardwick, “did you actually search the area? I need to know. We had a tip that someone involved dropped a critical piece of evidence…”

“You don’t understand, Sheriff,” Hardwick said, “we were attacked.” I tried motioning to him subtly with my eyes but I think I just made a weird face, one that failed to communicate anything. I was trying to tell him without words that spouting off about fifteen-foot tall, emaciated monsters with grins as wide as basketballs would probably be a bad idea and make us look totally insane to boot. It didn’t work. “I swear, we were less than a mile away from the site where the little girl’s body was found, when something just grabbed me from out of nowhere. It was an arm, but not human. The arm must have been twelve feet long. It was like something out of an HP Lovecraft story. The thing it was attached to… words cannot describe how horrible it looked. Its eyes were like filmy blue cataracts, its grin made the Cheshire cat’s look like nothing. Its fingers were bony claws and blood dribbled down its mouth constantly, as if it was chewing on its own tongue. And the smell! It smelled like burning metal, like failing car brakes combined with cooking onions, with a little bit of rotting meat thrown in for good measure.” Hardwick stopped, taking a deep breath, then looked from Sheriff Ames to the two agents. They all stared at him, dead-pan.

“Son,” the Sheriff said, “you didn’t take any drugs today, did you?” In fact, Hardwick had smoked a joint, but I wasn’t about to say that. They already were looking at us like we were a danger, raging psychotics who had somehow escaped from the loonie bin and stolen a couple ranger uniforms. One of the agents was writing in a notepad, talking softly to himself, saying things like, “Seeing monsters… rotting onions… bony dribble…”

“Wickie,” I said quietly, “please let me do the talking.” Hardwick frowned but nodded. “Sheriff, what he means is, I think we were attacked by two people wearing masks. It all happened very fast, but they were tall, he’s right about that. Very long arms. It must have been some sort of costume or make-up job, perhaps two gang members trying to cover their identities with some cheap Halloween costume…” Of course, all of that was total bullshit. I knew those two things were not human, and they definitely had no masks. But would it do any good to tell the truth in this situation? At best, it would be laughed off, and at worst, the police would think us untrustworthy and fail to take us seriously in the future.

“OK, OK,” Sheriff Ames said thoughtfully, reconsidering his pitch. “I believe you, Ranger.” With this, he gently put a hand on my shoulder, as if calming down a child having a temper tantrum. “These are Agents Rowe and Yimenez, from the FBI. They are investigating similar cases across the US, where children were taken and apparently used in some kind of sacrifice. That little girl had her heart taken out, and that wasn’t the only internal organ missing. Apparently there is a pattern of these bizarre cases with the organs removed, and because it crosses state lines, the FBI is adding its resources to ours so we can hopefully catch the bastards who are doing this.” Sheriff Ames shook his bulldog-like face ruefully, looking down at the ground.

“Ranger Salem,” Agent Rowe said, stepping forward, his face lacking any discernible emotion, “have you by any chance found any jewelry abandoned on the paths around the park? I know it is a long shot, but at other crime scenes, there was always a piece of jewelry left days or weeks after the murder had taken place. As if the suspect came back and planted it, maybe in an attempt to send some kind of message to law enforcement. The jewelry never belongs to the murder victim or anyone known to the victim. In fact, a lot of it appears connected to voodoo or other types of witchcraft, generally with obsidian carvings. Does any of this ring a bell?” I shook my head.

“I’m sorry, no,” I said. “We can try to go back to the scene…”

“Like Hell we will!” Hardwick cried, but I gave him a look that shushed him.

“But we would like additional protection. Of course, we can guide you both there, but we were just attacked a couple hours ago and I believe the suspects are still roaming the trails.”

“I am not going back there,” Hardwick muttered silently. “No fucking way. I do not get paid enough to die at the hands of some cheap Slenderman knock-off.” I smiled slightly at this.

“Actually, now that we have federal resources involved in this case, we don’t really need you to physically return to the site,” Agent Rowe said. “But if you could draw us a map of the trails, including the less-traveled ones, and their relation to the murder site, it would help us.” I nodded and got a piece of paper. While I am no DaVinci, I did a passable job of connecting the spiderweb of trails and labeling them. With that, the two agents left, heading behind the ranger station towards the first of the trails that would lead deep into the woods.

“Boy oh boy,” Sheriff Ames said, pouring himself a shot of vodka now that his federal babysitters were gone, “this is going to be a clusterfuck. Anytime the feds step in, they make things so much worse. In my experience, anyway.” He took the shot back like a pro, not even grimacing as the burning liquid went down. Without hesitation, he poured himself another one, and knocked that back as well. “Well, I’m off to the station. Your job is to help those agents in any way they see fit. If they tell you to jump, ask how high. The quicker we get this mess sorted out, the quicker they can leave.” With that word of advice, he tipped his hat to me and headed back to his car.

As I heard him take off, his muffler sounding as if it was about to fall off as he peeled away, an old, broken, rust-bucket of a truck pulled in. It was a local that I knew well, a rancher named Bud Beacon with more kids than teeth and a sickly yellow cast to his skin. He had a Budweiser hat on and a grease-stained plaid shirt with multiple missing buttons on it. He stumbled in, and he did not look healthy. He had never looked healthy, but now he *really* didn’t look healthy.

Due to budget cuts, the ranger station also doubled as a small convenience store, to try to bring extra income into the park. We sold odds and ends, like umbrellas, trail maps, hats, hiking shoes and some food and drink. Because there were no other stores around for miles, the locals often came here, despite our high mark-up and suspiciously missing expiration date labels on many of the items. Bud Beacon was one of our most regular customers.

“Good afternoon Bud,” I said, nodding my head at him. He acted disoriented, as if he didn’t even know where he was, and kept stumbling into the racks and walls, knocking some sunglasses to the ground before kicking over an umbrella stand.

“Uh…” he said, a slight puddle of drool coming out of his mouth. “Do you sell, you know…” He pantomimed unbuckling a bra and sucking an imaginary nipple. I had no idea what he was talking about.

“I think we may be out of that right now, but maybe check Walmart or Costco?” I said convivially, giving him a reassuring smile. His eyes rolled back and forth, never focusing on me for a second. “Bud, are you feeling OK? You look a little under the weather.” That was the understatement of the century. He looked like he might collapse and have a seizure at any moment.

“They took… my kid…” he said, and with horror I realized that he had a massive slice on the back of his skull. It looked as if someone had sent a throwing knife into the back of his head. I hadn’t seen it before since he was facing me, but he put his head down and I saw the back of his shirt was totally covered in blood.

“Wickie…” I said, “I think we have a problem.” Hardwick looked up from his phone, his mouth opening in astonishment as he saw all the blood on Bud’s back and head. He approached him cautiously, and began speaking like someone talking to a rabid dog whose testicles were caught on a piece of razor wire- very softly and slowly.

“Oh hey buddy,” he said, putting his hands out, palms up, “what happened to you? Do you need us to call someone?”

“Of COURSE he needs us to call someone!” I shouted at Hardwick. “His freaking skull is split open!” But Bud grabbed my hand in a vice-like grip and brought it to his lips, then began whispering.

“No! Don’t worry… about me… my boy… is in the woods… still alive… kidnapped…” he said, his words becoming increasingly disjointed and drawn-out before he lost consciousness, toppling backwards onto the well-worn hardwood floor. A small puddle of blood began to pool around his head as his glassy eyes stared up at the ceiling, his face taking on an animalistic and terrified cast as he swam between consciousness and unconsciousness.

“Wickie, call the police,” I said, breathing hard and looking around quickly. I saw nothing out of any of the windows to alert me to imminent danger but I had a feeling of being watched. “The state police,” I amended, thinking of Sheriff Ames’ alcoholic bulldog eyes. The town cops had never been of much use around here, except at covering up crimes and displaying a level of incompetence I could only characterize as admirable. I mean, I thought I did the least amount of effort required in my job, but locals like Sheriff Ames really put me to shame on so many levels.

Hardwick was already one step ahead of him and I heard him murmuring to the dispatcher behind me. I stopped and wondered, how had Bud driven here with such extensive head trauma? He was barely aware and conscious enough to formulate a sentence, less likely to drive a car through the poorly-maintained and pothole-ridden roads of our dilapidated Southern town.

I walked around the desk and peered out the front door. I saw he had totally demolished the ranger station mailbox a couple hundred feet away, where the dirt road met pavement, and that his truck had four flat tires. Some of the tires were so badly worn away that he had apparently driven on the broken, rusty rims for the last part of his journey. The rotors and rims were all shot to shit, and the car would definitely need to be towed out of here.

Taking a deep breath, I walked out the door and decided to have a look around. Maybe his son was out here, somewhere. I began to circle the log cabin facade of the station, going behind the dumpsters, when I saw a familiar face, or rather, two familiar faces- it was the two-headed bear who had saved my and Hardwick’s lives earlier in the day. He stared at me with a calm, impassive intelligence that I had never seen on any animal’s face before, then started speaking. Except his mouth wasn’t moving- it was like he was speaking directly into my head, bypassing the auditory facilities entirely.

“Do not be scared, Jay,” the one on the right said, nodding his head and baring his teeth in a simultaneously friendly and terrifying gesture. For once, I did not have to look down at the person, or in this case bear person, who conversed with me. Even though I stood around seven feet tall, the bear stood only an inch or two less than that, his front paws at his sides in a very human-looking stance. “My name is Rowlf.” He ceased speaking and the one on the left, who still had his Herbalife hat on, continued, “And my name is Growlf.” They had two separate voices. Rowlf’s voice was considerably deeper and slower, while Growlf spoke quickly in a more excitable and high-pitched cadence.

“We have been watching you for a long time,” Rowlf continued. “You have potential. And I believe you are one of the few things keeping the evil in these woods contained. If it were not for you, it would spill out onto the world, and all would be lost.”

“Are you sure you have the right guy?” I asked aloud, looking between the two heads. “I mean, I’ve had the same job since high school. I have like zero friends, except maybe Wickie but he’s kinda forced to be here with me so maybe that doesn’t even count. I can’t even get a credit card and two of my toes are fused together. None of that strikes me as ‘hero of the century’ kinda stats.” I paused for a moment, then continued. “I do still have all my teeth, though. I guess that’s fairly unusual for this town.” Growlf shook his head, a bemused expression crossing his intelligent, furry face.

“Do not underestimate yourself,” he said. “You are told by your society that unless you have many friends, constant beautiful women and ten whole toes, then you are a failure. But you have something much more valuable inside of you.” He pointed to my heart with his right front paw. “You have chutzpah, grit, the ability to run into a situation even when the odds are clearly stacked against you. You have no idea how rare that is in your species. Did you not put your life on the line just to find a necklace that could solve a little girl’s death earlier today?”

“Oh, I think you’re confused,” I said. “That’s just because I’m stupid. I don’t really worry about death when…”

“Enough,” Rowlf said with an audible, low growl emanating from his black lips, silencing me instantly. “We have no time for frivolous arguments. You are the one we need to save this forest, and that’s that. If you want to stop this evil from flowing out into your town, your state and eventually, your whole world, you will listen to what we have to say. Time is short.”

“Uh, OK,” I said, nodding.

“A child has been taken, from the litter of the man you call Bud,” Growlf continued. “This child, like you, is not normal. He is special. He is deeply autistic, but within his mind, he is more powerful than the greatest saint or magician your kind can imagine. You must save his life. If he dies, all will be lost. The tall ones plan to bring him to the sacrificial grounds by tonight, to the same spot where the girl’s body was found. You must save him at any cost.” I nodded.

“We will give you a seal that will allow you to pass through the woodlands at night, unmolested by any of the forest guardians,” Growlf said, pulling a small vial from his back somewhere. I really don’t know where it came from, because it wasn’t like he had any pockets, or clothes, or anything else that could possibly hold a vial. On second thought, I didn’t want to think of where he may have pulled it out from.

The two-headed bear began to do a slow, rhythmic dance, moving one foot, then the other, then raising his paws to the sky and looking up with his two heads. He opened the elixir with his teeth and poured it out onto his hand. He then began to shake his furry butt as he moved forward in a kind of dance-like motion, before wiping it on my forehead. The elixir, I mean, not his butt. The elixir was cold and smelt like licorice, but it dried quickly, leaving no trace on my skin.

“Now I must go, but I will see you again. Take care, and try not to die.”

“OK,” I said. “I’ll do my best, as always, not to die. No promises, though.”

I went back into the ranger station, and Bud Beacon was gone. Wickie was sitting behind the counter, smoking a cigarette and looking at his hands.

“Wickie!” I yelled. “What happened? Where’s Bud?” He looked up suddenly, a confused frown creasing his face. Then he looked down on the floor where Bud was lying, then back up at me, then around the entire ranger station. Then he shrugged.

“Are you serious right now?” I asked. “How did you lose track of an unconscious man who was just bludgeoned in the head and was bleeding all over the place?”

“Well, in my defense,” he said calmly, “I wasn’t actually paying attention.” I rolled my eyes at this. Just then, one of the agents came running into the ranger station, his suit torn, a nasty gash across his forehead dripping blood into his eyes. It was Agent Rowe. There was no sign of Agent Yimenez, which I took as an extremely bad sign. Agent Rowe had his pistol out, and was breathing at an alarming fast rate. His pupils were dilated, his eyes wide and roving around, and he looked like he was overall not having a good day.

“Lock the doors!” he screamed. “Do you have any more weapons in here?! MOVE, Goddammit!” I calmly walked behind him and engaged the deadbolt on the front door. Wickie took another drag of his cigarette, calmly looking the agent up and down.

“So,” Wickie asked, “how did it go?”

“How’d it go? How’d it go?!” he screamed back at him. “My partner is dead, and I barely got away! They ripped his goddamned arms off his torso and flung them at me like some… some kind of arm-shaped boomerang!” His metaphor game was not up to par, but I wasn’t going to criticize, as I felt he was in a very trigger-happy mood.

“OK, OK,” I said comfortingly, “we will go check it out.” Wickie looked at me like I was insane.

“Ah, no, we most certainly will *not* check it out,” he said to me.

“Well we have to at least find Bud,” I said. “*You’re* the one who let him get away, after all. All you had to do was watch over a bloody, unconscious man, and you failed at that. I know I talk about setting the bar low, but…” I shook my head in disappointment. “That blows even me out of the water.” After a minute of discussion, the FBI agent gave us one of his guns. He apparently had an ankle holster with a Judge attached as a last resort- not the kind of judge that sentences you to thirty days for urinating in the local fountain downtown, but rather a squat kind of pistol that shoots shotgun slugs. It felt heavy in my hand and looked totally bad-ass. The FBI agent had another pistol, a .45, but he wasn’t going to part ways with it under any circumstances.

Wickie agreed to come with me for a little while at least. We moved the barricade out in front of the door and, after heaving a deep sigh, I stepped outside. Wickie stayed behind me, his little .22 held out in his hand, now reloaded with spare bullets from the ranger station. I had a lot more faith in the stopping power of the Judge than some little .22, however.

As I stepped away from the building, I realized something was monumentally wrong. The entire forest sounded as silent as the grave. Somehow it also looked darker. And there was a smell in the air like rotting meat mixed with burning plastic. The smell was so pervasive that it felt *thick-* like it had its own weight. I felt it on my tongue, my nose and most of all, my eyes, which immediately began to water.

“Oh my GOD,” Wickie yelled loudly, “what is that smell?!” I turned around to shush him but as I did, I saw what the origin of the smell was, and immediately froze.

The first thing I saw was Bud Beacon floating in the air in front of me, his eyes rolled back in his head, dried blood caked around his hair and face and staining his shirt. Behind him, I saw a vision out of a nightmare.

The man, if it was a man, was hunched over. It looked like he had been stitched together out of dozens of bodies. The skull was half-eaten away by writhing maggots, showing the grinning teeth and jawbone underneath, some tendrils of black flesh and liquifying goo still holding on against all odds. It looked like someone had stitched four arms to a gigantic torso, which now clenched and unclenched their blackened fingers in unison, the blue cyanotic hues of oxygen deprivation trailing streaks all the way up to his shoulders. He had two immensely long legs, twice the height of a normal human leg, which made him stand taller than me- at least eight feet tall, and towering over the floating form of Bud Beacon in front of him. In the center of his decaying face stood a single massive eye, bloody teardrops running out of it as it constantly looked right, left, up, down and in all directions. He opened his mouth to speak, and as the words came out, so did a fresh wave of the nauseating smell.

“A favor for a favor, a life for a life,” he said in a voice that sounded like thousands of voices all mixed together, rising and falling in tone randomly as he spoke. “You give up and go home, and I will let you and your friend live. This man and his offspring are all mine. He gave them to me.” The creature sent out a long forked tongue and licked the maggots off its decomposing lips. I raised the Judge, pointing it at his center mass, but I couldn’t get a good shot with Bud floating in between us.

“How about you leave right now,” I asked in return, my voice trembling, “and I might let you live?” His grin widened. From the forest to the right of us, I heard the sound of loud rustling. The son of Bud Beacon appeared, his eyes wide and tear-streaked.

“Dad?” he yelled, seeing his father floating and catatonic. “Dad, what are you doing?” The distraction was all I needed. I sprinted a few feet to my left, giving me a clear shot without risking the life of Bud, and began firing.

The shotgun shells opened up large exit wounds all over the creature’s torso, sending out sprays of maggots and rotting meat. But just as soon as they opened, a writhing mass of maggots would begin to stitch the flesh back together. In all the excitement of the gunshots, I didn’t realize Bud Beacon had fallen to the ground until I saw him sprawled out there, his eyes closed now, looking as if he were asleep.

I continued shooting the creature as it ran at the boy until I ran out of ammo, but it did no good. The maggots just re-stitched its skin together as soon as the bullet exited. So I watched with horror as its four long arms wrapped around the crying child and they disappeared into the forest.

I turned to Wickie, who looked fairly calm and placid despite all that had occurred.

“Well,” I said, “now we really have to go after them.” His eyes widened.

“You want to go after an unkillable and gag-inducing eldritch deity? What do you plan to subdue him with, good manners?” I shook my head.

“There’s an innocent child involved, Wickie, and now we know he is alive. We can’t just let him be sacrificed.” He groaned.

“I hope you at least have a plan,” he said to me as we began trekking towards the forest.

“Not at all,” I replied.
