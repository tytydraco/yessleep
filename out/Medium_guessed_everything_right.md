It was 2014 when i heard about a medium that lived in a nearby village. A few weeks passed and i told one of my friends about this medium and we decided to go.

we called a number that was answered by the medium’s secretary (just a random person from the village). We got an appointment for 50 Turkish Liras which at the time was good money.

A few days have been passed and our appointment was due. We got to the village and there was a huge mansion on the hill just on top of the village. Turns out, that was the medium’s place. We made our way there, there were a bunch of luxury cars. We got inside and waited for our turn outside. When the medium called us inside, and got us seated. She was a very dirty, kinda crazy looking woman with ripped clothes. The room was around 10 by 10 meters and quite dark. She sat on the middle and me and my friends sat in front of her. She asked for our and our mother’s names. Nothing else. She had a pen and a paper and would scribble stuff while talking. She also talked and sometimes argued with voices in her head. I asked if my kids would be successful. She said my older child would go to his 2nd choice university and my smaller child would work a job that he would love. I never told her that i had 2 children. My older child really did go to his second choice and my smaller child is at high school. 

then she talked to my friend. That was the craziest thing. She said “you have 2 girls and one boy that died.” Thats when i learned that my friend that i’ve known for 7 years had a boy that died on birth. She continued by saying that my friend’s wife had an underlying condition and while saying the name of the condition, she argued with the voices and told them that she couldn’t pronounce the sickness. It was like “what do you think i am, a doctor? I can’t say that”. This condition was indeed the case on my friend’s wife. We couldn’t take it anymore and we got out.

Around a year had passed when my same friend wrongfully got arrested. On his behalf, we decided to go to this medium and ask about the situation. She said that he would stay 49 days in that jail and would be moved to a place closer to his hometown. In exactly 49 days, he was moved.

I tried contacting this medium again but turns out she stopped doing this. There are similar stories about her and someone even pointed out that she had a bookcase full of quantum physics books and no religious books at all. Im a very unreligious person, and this still creeps me out. I just wanted to tell this to some other people and get it out my chest. Thank you for your time
