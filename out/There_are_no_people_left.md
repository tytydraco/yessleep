But I’m still here.  
  
So many of us are – too many, some might even say. Many more than were initially expected to survive.  
  
And although we’re here, walking around – many of us playacting out a facsimile of our lives from before, our humanity died a long time ago. No one that managed to make it this far did so by being a saint. Myself included.  
  
When I said that, my sister CeCe glared at me, an odd mash-up of anger, pity, and something else I couldn’t place at the time, showing on her face. But, I’ve had nothing else to do in my spare time here, other than ponder my current, albeit, short-term, existence. If I didn’t talk to someone, anyone, about it, I was going to lose my damn mind. Well, I suppose I’m going to lose it soon, regardless.  
  
They say I defaulted on several loans, but I *know* that can’t be true. I’ve paid the only bill I’ve ever needed to long ago – I’m missing a good percentage of my liver to prove it – and that wasn’t even for my debt.  
  
CeCe is one of the few people left that works with computers, it must have been a clerical error or a glitch, she said – these old systems were archaic and iffy even twenty years ago. She told me she’d filed a complaint and that they’d review my case in 15 business days. When I asked if I even *had* 15 business days to spare, she could no longer meet my eyes. Of course, the detached ruthlessness of bureaucracy was one of the few things that had managed to survive.  
  
For most of the visit, for the first time in our lives, I couldn’t read the expression on my sister’s face.  
  
I hate to say it, but if one of us was going to end up here in the plant, I always thought it would’ve been CeCe. That’s an awful thing to say about your own sister, I know – but let’s be real, she’s always lived way above her means and years ago I even had to pay what she owed so she wouldn’t end up in this very place. Even when she visited me in this hellhole, she fiddled nervously with a new diamond necklace, held the fabric of her expensive looking blouse over her nose.  
  
It’s funny, I don’t even smell it anymore, but to be fair, it did take a while to get used to. Who would’ve guessed that despair had a scent? I’d best describe it as a mixture of resignation, fear, and that stinging smell of bleach.  
  
Every so often her eyes would flit towards the wall and widen a fraction at the muffled sounds coming from the other side, focus on the rust colored stains that had managed to seep in from underneath. I understood her discomfort, but unlike myself, at least she doesn't have to watch people go in; see what comes out.  
  
What can I say, we’ve got far more humans than we have resources or even landmass to support them, and desperation brings out the worst in everyone. It’s a bit frightening how quickly we got to this point though – how efficient the processing, reuse, redistribution all has become.  
  
Nothing goes to waste, here.  
  
Did you know there are so many uses for spare parts? When I was a kid, before everything went to shit, I learned that. I learned that marshmallows and gelatin came from hooves and ligaments, collagen beauty creams from skin and muscle, some beers were filtered through fish bladders, sugar bleached using bone char. All those everyday items that we had the luxury of taking for granted – we turned a blind eye to where they came from. The whole time, right under our noses, they were made out of the bits and pieces – leftovers – of livestock.  
  
I suppose that technically, in a way, they still are. Some people, well, they live almost exactly as they did before – sure, some days the stubborn and acrid black smoke fills your lungs when you dare to venture outside. And yes, sometimes the ashes blow in from the east, made out of who knows what and coating the streets in a grey-black, but you can *almost* pretend. Maybe you can’t buy happiness, but you sure as hell can buy ignorance.  
  
It’s surprising how, as all of our other resources dwindled, humanity became surprisingly adept at recycling. Too bad we didn’t figure that one out sooner, right? Well, as long as they have people, they’ve got a renewable resource on their hands, at least.  
  
CeCe didn’t like that joke, either.  
  
That one time she visited me, I tried to keep things civil with her, after all, she’s the only family I’ve got left. So, she ignored my morbid attempts at humor. I tried my best to contain my anger at the audacity of her wearing that disgusting new jacket – the fluorescent lighting dancing across the pale leather – here.  
  
*Here*.  
  
Of all places.  
  
*To visit me.*  
  
And yes, some of my motivation may have stemmed from trying to stay on her good side. Knowing that it would be our only visit. A part of me was hoping beyond all hope that CeCe would maybe offer to – you know – go in and …fix… the clerical error that landed me here, I knew she could. She could swoop in at the last minute and make everything right. But, she never offered and I didn’t ask. At first, I thought maybe it was because she knew that if she got caught, she’d be right here in the same situation that I am. Maybe we’d end up in the same batch of face cream, form an entire volume of leather-bound books together. Damn, I should’ve told CeCe that one.  
  
It's true, though. Unpaid debt, fraud, rule breaking of any kind – hell, simply being a person that wouldn’t be missed that was in the wrong place at the wrong time – any of that could land you down here.  
  
But no, that would’ve been too kind.  
  
Like I said, some of us may have survived, we are still here, we still walk this earth, but our humanity died a long time ago.  
  
When they said it was time to go, they called my name – my full name – for the first time and beckoned me over. I hadn’t even heard my name since that last glorious day before everything went wrong, before I was brought here. Since then, I’ve only been a number. It’s less personal – easier for those that work here – that way, I suppose.  
  
As I went to stand, I stared at my sister, my mouth agape, I let out tears of relief, felt the flood of hope I’d been trying to hold back, all of it, return – she’d done it, she’d had them fix the mistake!  
  
She didn’t so much as look at me as she too rose to her feet. They stopped me as I made to follow her, I stood there dumbly – the entire turn of events had confused me. It took me a moment to realize that they were calling CeCe – my sister, the one who always spent money that she didn’t have – my name. I waited anxiously for her to correct them, but she never did.  
  
Instead, she just pulled that leather jacket tighter around her, as if the thick silk-lined flesh could shield her from this place, from what she’d done, and never looked [back](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/).
