I worked for a while as a technical analyst at a company not open to the public. Our goal? To develop a neural simulation technology capable of condensing an entire lifetime into just a few minutes.

We called it “total immersion.” The individual was connected to an augmented reality system so advanced they couldn’t distinguish what was real from what was programmed.

The promise was simple: to acquire knowledge, maturity, and emotional balance through simulated decades — love, loss, growth, purpose — and then return to reality with all of it recorded in the mind.

The process, in theory, was straightforward. They sought willing testers: criminals, death row inmates, volunteers desperate for money. They were placed in capsules and connected to the system via special augmented reality goggles.

The experiment rarely lasted more than thirty minutes, except for rare cases. But inside... they lived a whole life.
Births, adolescence, love, loss. Sometimes children. Sometimes wars. Always, an end.
And then... they woke up.

The problem? Most of the test subjects didn’t react well. They went insane, out of their minds, and screamed — screamed a lot. Sometimes they didn’t even recognize their own voice. They would tremble uncontrollably, crying desperately.
They blamed us for destroying everything they had lived through. We were called monsters. More times than I can remember

They lost everything they had gained in the experiment, and the worst part was returning to reality: there was no escape, only an empty world where nothing made sense.

Many were disturbed and tried to attack the scientists. Unfortunately, we had several losses, but the experiments had to continue.

I remember the case of a woman.
She cried for hours, calling out her son’s name. The problem was that son never existed.

The most disturbing part is that she had a real son, outside the simulation. But she never mentioned him once.

She preferred the one from the artificial reality.

Due to some code flaw — or perhaps some unintended cruelty within the algorithm itself — some test subjects didn’t live just one simulated existence… They lived dozens. Each memory, a fresh wound. Each existence, an unbearable weight.

This explains why so many didn’t survive the end of the experiment.
The shock was too much.
They returned as if they had lived for centuries — and, in a way, they had.

After we discovered the flaw, they tried to cover it up.
They called it an “unforeseen side effect.”
They said they would update the system. That new tests were on the way. That future subjects would be monitored more closely.

The experiment would only be a success when the test subjects came out sane and absorbed the knowledge. As long as they kept breaking down or dying, the experiment was still flawed — and it would continue until success.

After working there for so long, it started to affect me. So, for several reasons, I resigned.

Before leaving, I saw a new file on the coordinator’s desk.
It was an eleven-year-old boy.
“Child test. First full life simulation.”

They are going to do to him what they did to the others.
He will live, love, lose... and then wake up alone, with his brain screaming for a life that never existed.
