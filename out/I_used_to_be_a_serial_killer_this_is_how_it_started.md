I used to live in a small remote city in Wisconsin. The town had around 6,000 people in it. It was a sort of town where almost everyone knew each other, which was suprising for its size. I grew up absolutely loving slasher movies. I watched all the Scream movies, Chucky, Halloween, even the Leprechaun. I grew attached to these movies, mostly because my Dad collected merchandise from them. I would borrow his coolest outfits and dress up in them all the time.

When I was about 16-ish, our house was robbed and a bunch of my dad’s things were taken. I got home from school before everyone so I was the only person who knew what happened. So, when no one was looking, I snatched my dad’s coolest outfit (It was an exact replica of the original Michael Myers outfit) and pretended it was stolen by the robbers. I kept the outfit hidden from my parents and then called them about what happened. My dad rushed home and was pissed. My mom tried to call my father down but he was losing it. We lost tens of thousands of dollars, and our house was trashed. My dad immediately left in his car and sped down the road. 

Two weeks had passed. No one knew where my dad was. My mom was a mess. She would get drunk and yell at me every day, and our house was never cleaned. I tried my best to keep it cleaned up but she would just  trash it instantly. I started staying with my Girlfriend and her parents after they found out about my situation. 

I got back home from school one day and turned on the TV. The screen flickered to life and the news was on. It was then I learned nine people were brutally murdered in Dane county, Wisconsin. Then, the next thing I saw, still hurts me to this day. My dad was the man who did it. He dressed up as Michael Myers, and killed the 3 robbers who stole from our house, as well as a bunch of random people he took his anger out on I guess. It turns out my dad was a serial killer. He has over 20 confirmed murders, and is suspected to have killed half a dozen more or so. The last person he killed before he was caught, was my mom.

I jumped in my car and slammed on the pedal. I got to the police station and asked if my dad was there. The man at the front desk  asked for my name. After half an hour of confirming my identity, and that I wasnt trying to break him out or whatever, they let me see him. An officer escorted me to him and before the officer opened the door, I thought for a second, about how my dad did this horrible thing, and how he shouldn’t live any longer. 

At that moment, I grabbed the officer by his shoulders and slammed him into the wall. I tackled him down and repeatedly bashed him in the head with my boot in-hand. I ripped the gun out of his hip pouch and stormed through the door. I yelled some profanities and angry words at my dad, and aimed the pistol at the glass between us. But, I looked into his eyes and realized what I was doing, and how I could never betray my own father like this. I immediately left the room and saw officers coming around the corner. Out of natural instinct I shot the cop who came around the corner right in the chest, the bullet exploding through his collar bone. The other officer I shot in the space between his neck and shoulder. I dropped the gun and bashed his head into the wall. I needed to finish what my dad started. I couldn’t fight this instinct that came over me. 

I rushed into the room where they confiscated item from arrests and grabbed the man in there by the neck and pinned him against the wall. I noticed the knife my dad must have used in a case next to me. I punched my hand through the glass, the shards getting stuck between my knuckles, and stabbed the man through the eye with the knife. I then repeatedly cut through his chest and gut with the knife and dropped him. The power that came over me felt amazing, I didn’t want to stop. I ran out a back exit to the station and sprinted home. My legs were killing me, and there was state wide manhunt after me. I climbed up the gutter running up my house and through the second story window into my bedroom. I looked through my closet and found the Michael Myers costume I stole from my dad. I got in my mom’s car and left town.

This was in the summer of 2017. And I didn’t return to my hometown for around 2 years. But when I did return, everyone would remember.
