I’m different. People look at me funny. They don’t mean to. But they do.

They can fuck right off.

Yeah, you heard me. Oh, how they whisper, staring secretly through interrogating eyes, judging me. Then I become invisible, and they ignore me, like I’ve never been born.

Yeah, I’m the life of the party.

Like I said, I’m different.

As a child, I had a pet ghost named Biff. Biff lived under my bed. Sometimes, he would spring out head first, rip his face off, and scream, “BOOO HAHAHA,” leaving me crippled in fear. 

Sometimes I’d piss myself.

Or worse.

When I told my parents, they sent me straight to the doctor, who didn’t believe a word. They said I was nuts.

By high school, Biff stopped visiting me, but something far worse was about to take his place.

First time it happened, I was handing in my science project, two days late mind you, and Miss Hellfire made an offhanded joke. Ignoring the urge to throttle the wench, I retreated to my desk, wallowing in self pity.

“You’re going to die,” she blurted. “Sooner than you think.”

I recoiled, as if being stung by a bee.

She looked at me with cold, accusing eyes, then she said it again.

“You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.”

Was that a threat?

A month later, while stopped at a red light, some jerk darts onto the road, just as the light turned green. The guy points and says, “You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.”

This became an ongoing occurrence. After high school, I got a job at a graveyard. Seeing how I’m the guy who’s about to die, maybe I’d get dibs on a nice plot of land.

One particular morning, while stopping for coffee on my way to work, the drive-thru person said, “You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.”

I was rattled.

Five minutes later, a transport truck cut me off, nearly killing me. My car was totaled. Hot coffee scorched my crotch. Shit, I’m lucky to be alive.

I was rushed to the hospital, where a nurse, a curvy blonde with a big caboose and bratty eyes, sneered as she said, “You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.”

When I asked her to repeat herself, she looked at me like I was a turnip.

Did she really just say that? Or did I imagine it?

Don’t know.

You see, I’m different. People look at me funny.

Fortunately, my new car came equipped with all the latest gadgets. Maybe my luck was changing.

Wrong.

One day while driving home from work, I was surprised by a neon sign advertising junk food. The caption read:

You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.

Okay, I told myself, for the fiftieth time, this can’t be real. I must be dreaming.

Whenever I bring this up with friends, the few friends I have mind you, they become uncomfortable, and quickly change the subject.

I was at a loss.

A few months ago, while walking to the convenience store on a cold winter’s evening, someone knocked me flat on my ass. Cracked my head and sprained my wrist. Standing over me was a haggard-looking man, long-fingered and dirty brows. As our eyes met, his lips pursed.

“No!” I pleaded. “Don’t say it.”

He grimaced as his voice crawled into my mind, thick like semen:

“You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.”

He meandered away, and I dragged my sorry carcass to the hospital.

“Help,” I told the blonde bombshell nurse. “I’m going to die.”

She rolled her eyes and patched me up, then muttered that insidious phrase.

…

Scared to leave home, I got a job at a call center, so I can stay put. I mean, why would I want to go ‘Out There?’ Home is where it’s safe.

Yeah, I’m different. People look at me funny.  

These days, even my phone is against me, with its constant stream of spam.

Last night, my phone leapt from the coffee table, scaring me stupid.  There’s no way in hell I was answering the damned thing. I do enough of that at work, thank-you-very-much.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

My heart shattered.

Who could be knocking at this hour?

Knock. Knock. Knock.

There it goes again.

Pizza!

I’d ordered pizza!

Phew.

Nervously, the pizza guy handed me two large pepperonis. His eyes were moon pies, his skin like sandpaper. As he drove away, someone blindsided him. It sounded like two trains colliding.

I locked my doors and sealed the windows, just in case. Hungrily, I reached into the pizza box, and gasped. The note was stapled to the inside, smothered in cheese and grease:

You will die.

The pizza must be poisoned. There’s no way I’m eating it.

My tummy growled in protest.

Cautiously, I took a bite. It seemed okay, so I took another. I ate ravenously, until hot grease scolded my throat. Mouth ablaze, a lump of fried dough lodged inside my throat. I panicked, clutching my throat in a desperate attempt to clear my windpipe.

I’m going to die.

Gasping for air, I started bashing my head against the coffee table, anything to clear my throat. If only I’d bought drinks! Eventually, the bread dislodged, and I survived yet another brush with death.

But for how long?

...

Something happened at work today. Something bad.

The phone was ringing non-stop. With the warming weather, people drive to cottages, getting flat tires, plus a long list of roadside emergencies. Every caller said the same thing:

You’re going to die. Sooner than you think.

I can’t take much more of this.

People look at me funny. 

Now I know why:

I’m going to die.

Sooner than I [think.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
