Moving the old man out of the pub always seemed like a bad idea to me. I was happy to help take care of him, and have him working alongside me, as was his routine for decades. But my uncle Kevin, Mike’s dad, thought it best for Grandad to move in with him.

I have to confess, the reason I've put off speaking directly to Grandad was because it's too painful to be around him sometimes. It's terrifying to think you can know your grandchild for twenty something years, help raise them, leave them your legacy, then look that grandchild in the eye and be completely unable to remember who they are. Dementia took hold of him fast. One day he was forgetting old names to long gone relatives. A few short years down the line he can’t recognise his own face. And to him I'm just another face he doesn't know. Another face that moves in and out of his life like all the rest. His life, which he, for the most part, can't remember now.

Except, for these brief moments of clarity he has. It's almost more unnerving when he fades back into his old self for a little while. After these brief glimpses of the Grandfather I knew, he fades away again and whatever scrap of sensible conversation you shared dissipates from his decaying memory. You never know what sort of state you're going to find him in either. But he is always better in the mornings hence why Mike and I were there at 10am.

“You better not set him off with all this ghost bullshit.” Uncle Kevin said in a hushed angry tone, as he stood in the doorway. His cold blue eyes were fixed on us both, and when we moved through the hallway, his eyes followed. As if Mike couldn’t be trusted in the house he was raised in. And as if we couldn’t be trusted around our own Grandad.

“We won't set him off Dad.” Mike assured him. Uncle Kevin looked us up and down with pursed lips and held our gaze for a while. Finally, reluctantly, he moved out of our way and let us scoot past him into the front room.

When we entered the room, Grandad was sitting watching TV. He caught us out of the corner of his eye and gave us a smile. But not the kind you'd give your own family, the kind you’d give a welcome stranger.

“Oh hello.” He said as he sat up and put his hand out for us to shake. “Are you a friends of Kev?”

“Yeah.” I replied cheerily, taking his hand. It felt good to hold it. It had been a long time since I’d been able to hold his hand.

The first time I ever went down into the cellar I was holding his hand. The skin of his fingers was rough and cracked from years of DIY. He was a manual labourer before he bought the pub. And his large hand engrossed my own small four year old hand completely. He held it firmly but gently as we descended the cellar steps. There was always so much thought in the old man’s every move, especially when it came to children. Hence why he took me down there himself to calm my fears. Because at four I had already decided I hated the cellar with every fibre of my being.

“Do ya live local?” He asked, snapping me out of my memory.

“Yeah down by the seafront.” I told him. Mike awkwardly took a seat on the cream leather sofa as I kept chatting to my grandfather, who had zero idea who I even was.

“I can't say I've ever seen you and I've lived here for years.” He said taking a moment to think.

“Just not in each other's circles I suppose.” I jumped in, worried the pensive look on his face would warp into panic.

He smiled and shrugged. “I guess not. Nice to meet you.”

“You too. You own the local pub don't you?” I asked him, trying to jog his memory.

“Yes. But my son Charlie and his Mrs are running it for me today.” He informed me. Charlie is my father who I haven't seen since I was eight. The less said about him the better. “I don’t usually like to leave them there alone though and I really ought to go home.” He said.

“Why?” I took a seat next to Mike and leaned in to listen.

“Well my granddaughter doesn't like the basement ya see. And rightly so.” He nodded to himself. His tone became lowered and I wondered if for a moment he knew what was happening, and why I was there. I tried not to get my hopes up but like I said, he has moments of clarity.

“Why's that?” I asked, feeling my heart start to pound. He was always on the verge of a mood swing and this topic felt like a powder keg.

He turned to look at me and put his hand on my shoulder. The sudden focus on his grey eyes and expression unnerved me. I almost got up and ran. But his hand was warm and safe.

“Because of him of course.” He said in a whisper. I opened my mouth to reply but then he turned his attention to Mike.

“Kev.” He grabbed Mike's hand. Mike’s eyes went wide with barely contained panic. Grandad got violent sometimes. And he was a very strong man. “Tell your older brother to make sure he locks up them doors.” He instructed my cousin.

“Yes gr- Yes Dad. Where are the keys for the doors?” Mike asked. I looked at him suspiciously. That sort of question seemed even worse than mine.

“Your Mum has them.” Nan has been dead since the 2000’s. Breast cancer.

“Mum?” Mike cocked his head sideways.

“Yes. She'll be coming back from taking your sister Tanya to school in a minute. So you ought to get your homework done before dinner.”

“Right. That's enough. Get out.” Uncle Kevin appeared from the hallway, where I assume he had been listening the whole time. Neither Mike nor I had thought to close the door. Kevin looked like he wanted to smack both our heads together. He got up from our seats and Uncle Kevin frog marched us outside like two disobedient Children.

We did as we were told, knowing we were probably on the verge of giving the old man a melt down. I already felt guilty even though I had justified talking to him about it to myself over and over again.

“Listen to the two of ya's. You can fuck around with this spiritualist bullshit all you want but keep it away from your grandfather.” He waggled his finger at us, scowling.

Suddenly, Grandad appeared in the doorway behind Uncle Kevin. He’d managed to do so silently and Kevin jumped in shock before cautiously moving out of his Dad’s way.

“Mum. You forgot this.” He pulled a key out of his pocket and reached it out towards me. Trying to keep my composure, which was difficult when my own grandfather called me mother and gave me an expression of earnest love I can only assume is reserved for mothers. Something I have never and don’t plan on ever experiencing. I took the key from him and gave him a thank you accompanied by a kiss on the forehead. Which made him beam at me before Uncle Kevin ushered him inside.

Mike and I drove back most of the way in silence. I sat in the passenger seat, turning the newly acquired key over in my hand. It was a long brass key with an elegant design. It looked old. I’d never seen it before. Most of the pub’s keys were quite modern due to the renovations.

“Why do you reckon he wanted his Mum to have this? She never lived at the pub did she?” I asked Mike, who was staring at the road in a solemn daze.

“No. She died before he even bought it.” He said without turning to me.

“Shall we try it on the doors?” I suggested.

“Yeah if we can get down there.”

“Do you reckon we have any hope of getting the keys for the rest of them if he doesn't even remember where they are?”

Mike shrugged. “Can we talk about something else please?”

We changed the subject to something light hearted until we were back by the sea front. But once the drive was over I couldn’t resist the urge to keep decoding what Grandad had said to us.

“I reckon we ought to go talk to someone else. Someone that can go down there with us.”

Mike mulled it over. “I reckon if someone else is meant to go down with us they'll show up in one way or another. I'd rather not go and rope someone else into this on purpose.”

“What if someone volunteers? No problem with asking.”

“We probably don’t want word getting ‘round that we’ve got a sea monster in the bottom of the pub. Seems bad for business.”

“True. But business hasn’t been all that great anyway. What with the shitty management. What have we got to lose?”

“I just have a bad feeling.”

“See I feel the opposite.”

“Hm. what do you mean?”

“Just that I have a good feeling.” I stood tall, holding my chin high. Mike looked at me for a while as if he was trying to figure me out. He also had that melancholic look he always gets after talking to Grandad.

“Do you wanna go walk along the beach for a bit?” I asked gently.

“That would be great.” Mike sighed then smiled.

We took a detour down to the beach, got some beers and spent the rest of the day chilling on the sand. Mike began to cheer up eventually once we started talking about the kind of things he likes to yap about when he’s under the influence. In the evening, we walked across the beach watching the sun set and the moon come up while the two of us made plans for the future.

“I reckon we turn the pub into a gay bar and turn the town into the new Brighton.” He suggested.

“Erm. Not sure the pensioners would like it.”

“Thats the point. I hate the stuck up cunts round here. Aside from our patrons of course….actually no some of them were rude to us growing up. They used to say horrible things about my mum behind her back.”

“Well your Mum was…”

“Yeah I know but still.”

“You’re right this place is cliquey. I wonder what made Grandad move here. I guess it was different back in the day.”

Mike looked at me a bit surprised, with a smile on his face. “You don't know?”

“No. I guess I never thought to ask.”

“This is where great nanny Bea was evacuated to. Because her grandparents lived here.”

“Oh. Of course!” I snapped my fingers as the story clicked into place. “I knew it was a seaside. Didn’t realise it was this seaside.”

“Well I only know because my dad told me, to be fair.”

“Y’know grandad never really spoke about that stuff until recently.”

“He was always a live in the moment type of man. Hence packing up everything and moving to the seaside.”

“And marrying nan a month after he met her.” That was one of my favourite stories, and one of the few he would tell about the past.

Mike’s smile turned solemn again. “...We shouldn’t talk about him like he’s dead.”

I nodded. “You’re right.”

Once you reach the end of the sandy beach you get to some cliffs.These cliffs have caves in them that we were strictly warned not to explore as kids because they were prone to rock falls. They do tours down there sometimes. It’s an important geological site. And also secretive spaces like that attract adults that well…want a private space. So of course when we were allowed to go to the beach ourselves as tweens we would go there and look around. But both Mike and I were too pussy to properly explore the caves so instead we hung around outside them all the time and occasionally dared someone to go in. I got quite far into it once when I was a teenager.

The whole family was having a day on the beach. I was about thirteen with my braces, baggy Arctic Monkeys t-shirt and skinny jeans in August. It was the mid 2010’s and that was cool. Mike and I had wandered off to go take swigs from a bottle of vodka we swiped from the picnic basket.

“Do you reckon these were smuggler caves back in the day?” Mike asked me as he handed me the bottle, his voice hoarse from swigging neat vodka.

I took a swig myself, barely kept it down, then told him. “Oh they had to be….Do you think there could still be stuff down there.”

Mike laughed. “Yeah sure.” I couldn’t tell if he was being sarcastic or not.

“What do you actually think there could be?” I asked naively.

“Maybe. There might be a crate of some super old expensive rum or something.”

“Really?”

“Well you never know. If there’s anything like that still down there it’ll be super well hidden though.”

“Reckon I should have a look?” I goaded.

“Go’on. Odds on.”

“Five.”

If you don’t know how to play odds on, it’s a British game or sorts where you dare someone to do something and then they give you a number for how likely they are to do it. The lower the number the more likely you are to do it because then the person being dared and the one doing the daring say a number at the same time (in this case they pick any number between 1 and 5) and if they say the same number the person has to do it. Look it up if you still aren’t sure, I have a story to tell.

We counted down and blurted out a number. We both picked five. If I pussied out now I’d never live it down. So I took a second swig, coughed from the horrid taste, before I handed the bottle back to Mike. I took a deep breath that tasted like hand sanitiser and began trudging across the moist rocky sand floor of the cave which began to squelch under foot as the sun disappeared. Soon the sand turned into rock and the light started growing even dimmer and more distant. I used my phone torch to light my way. The cave gets flooded whenever the tide is in, meaning the rocks were still glistening with moisture in the bright white light of my phone torch. I took some time to search some of the nooks and crannies just so I kept to the dare of looking for old smuggler’s rum. I hadn’t been exploring for that long when I came across a huge fallen rock blocking my way through the previously walkable tunnel. But I could peak over the top of said rock. I placed my hands on the cold stone and hoisted myself up to get a good look, using a smaller rock underneath as leverage. If I was a little taller I might have been able to scale it. The sounds of me shuffling echoed through the cave and made me uneasy. That was the only sound I could hear other than the very distant beach sounds of waves and seagulls.

“Go’on. Odds on.” Mike shouted again, I could hear his footsteps crunching somewhere nearby. But it didn’t sound like he was necessarily behind me. Just in the cave somewhere close by. I chalked it down to the echo of the caves.

“Yeah there’s a blockage! I’m having a look then I’ll come back!” I called to him, my voice resounding off the rock.

I shone my phone torch into the darkness on the other side of the boulder.  The tunnel went on as far as the light would reach. It was upheld with decaying wooden beams, a little like a mine shaft. In the far distance I could make out that the caves split off into multiple paths. It seemed too obvious to be a smuggler cave. Maybe the beams were a later addition. Personally I wouldn’t hide my stolen goods in such an obvious tunnel. I let my light linger in the quiet darkness for a little longer. Letting the image of the darkened tunnel settle in my mind. After waiting a while and not seeing anything in the distance that looked like a crate of rum or a treasure chest, I hopped down from the boulder and walked back out.

Mike, who I assumed had walked in a little, hence the footsteps I heard, then walked back out once he realised I was fine, was waiting at the mouth of the cave with an eager grin on his face.

“Yeah I couldn’t see anything, I don’t actually think these are smuggler caves.”

“You were in there for ages.” He said, looking me up and down suspiciously.

“Was I?”

“Yeah like half an hour.”

“Thats not that long.” I said, even though my time in the cave felt like five minutes or possibly less.

“Felt long. I started worrying about you. But I didn’t wanna shout or go in case someone came over.”

“You did call after me. You said odds on again.”

“No I never.”

“Oh don’t be a dickhead.” I tried to kick the back of his knee and he matched my attack with a poke to the ribs which descended into a tipsy brawl between us.

Mike refused to admit he’d shouted into the cave. I didn’t believe him back then. But now I’m not so sure. As we stood looking at the mouth of the caves I thought about asking Mike whether it was him afterall. But I didn’t want the answer. I feel like I know what that answer is.

“I think…” Mike began to speak, I felt him take a hold of the sleeve of my hoodie. I looked over at him, I’d started walking toward the cave. “I think we should leave.”

“Yeah.” I said wistfully. My gaze drifted from the cave and over to the sea, the tide was going further and further out as the moon rose.

“I’ve had an idea.” I beamed at him, feeling the dots connect in my head. “We’ve got to get to the pub.” I began running across the beach when suddenly I stopped. “Wait. I have to ask you something to prove my theory. Was it you that called after me when we were kids and I went into the cave?”

“Yeah I was messing with you.” He admitted.

“Uh huh! And the tide was out wasn’t it?”

“Yes.”

I nodded and started speed walking again with Mike following close behind. We rushed through town, dodging pensioners on their evening stroll and dog walkers.

The pub was full of the usual patrons and my crew were busy at work. Feigning our calmness, Mike and I casually walked through the bar and then disappeared behind the door to the living quarters. There was the cellar. Dark and cold as usual. But I knew I had nothing to fear down there now, not until the tide came in. Without turning the light on I thumped down the steps and down into the dark cellar. Mike followed me without hesitation. That’s how I knew I was on the right track, because if he truly thought I was being stupid he wouldn’t have followed me.

I stood in the bottom of the dark cellar in silence. A part of me, for a moment though I’d gotten it wrong, that the monster didn’t come up with the tide but instead dwelt here all the time. That I had fed myself and Mike to it inadvertently. While lost in panicked thought, Mike touched my shoulder and I yelped before I burst out laughing. He laughed as well. I went and turned on the light.

“I can’t believe it.” He smiled. “So as long as the tide is out, it isn't down here?”

“Apparently so.”

Curiously I looked over at the old wooden door with the cracks. I put my hand in my pocket and felt the cold brass key that Grandad had handed to me. Biting my lip, I turned it over between my fingers as I pulled it out, looking at it in the yellow light of the cellars hanging lightbulb. My face tightened into a nervous expression, I looked over at Mike, who gave me a quick encouraging nod. I stepped across the cement floor and over to the door. Inhaling a steadying breath I placed the key in the lock and tried to turn it.

It was the wrong key.
