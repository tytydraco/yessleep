My name is Clara, I’m 19, and I live on a Scottish island about twenty miles off the coast, which is itself about thirty miles off anywhere; maybe off Earth itself, given what’s happened. I’d give you the exact location and beg you to come and save me, Reddit rules be damned, but that would be bad for you. It’s actually a good thing, the seclusion of our island, which is more of a skerry; just a wee clump of green and grey, barely staying afloat out at sea.

Point is: be glad you’re all very far from this place.

Last Saturday, I was stumbling through the park, five bevvies deep; up to my eyeballs, folk would tell me the next morning. None of them believed my story. None of them believed I’d seen something in the sky that night. A flash of blinding white, though not like a car’s front beams. This was a different kind of light. A different kind of dazzle.

This *hurt*.

I remember tripping over my damn laces, and being scared to find the pain continued even as I lay face-down in the grass. I wasn’t looking up at the white light in the sky anymore, but I could still feel it in my eyes.

I cried like a bairn as something burnt cold around my eyes, making its way through my sockets and into my skull. It was sharp, and pointed, and penetrating; felt as if that otherworldly light had beasted me.

Then I threw up.

And I continued throwing up the next day. Of course, my da blamed the liquor, as did my mates who’d been drinking with me in the pub that night. But even if I had dreamt up the panic, I didn’t dream up the bloated stomach that came with it. A bloating that, much like my nausea, only got worse over the next few days. Most girls of 19 don’t have three-day hangovers, as far as I’m aware, and that was when it struck me.

*I’m pregnant*.

That was impossible, of course, as I broke up with Danny three months ago. I hadn’t been with anyone since. I couldn’t be pregnant. But I was, and the pregnancy test proved it.

*You see him at the pub from time to time*, I told myself as my chest thrummed. *Maybe you hooked up one night and forgot, eh?*

But that didn’t feel right.

I visited the village clinic to talk to Dr Haliburton: a podgy little man with the gait of a penguin, and about as far from the epitome of good health as any doctor’s ever been, I reckon. But he looked worse than usual this day. Looked as pale and sickly as I felt, and he told me a few villagers had come to see him that day about feeling “under the weather”. He dismissed me. He never really believed lasses about their medical issues. I had to show him the positive pregnancy test to get him to pay attention.

What really caught his attention, though, was that I wanted an abortion. He got angry. Flat-out refused to help me. *Isnae God’s will*, he said. A man of bloody science. Unbelievable. And I knew he wasn’t qualified to perform such a procedure, but I thought he’d at least point me in the right direction. Tell me who to see on the mainland.

The next morning, the mob came to my da’s house, armed with forked words. I hadn’t told him about the pregnancy yet. He had to find out when they called me blasphemer, harlot, and aw that. I suppose Dr Haliburton had told them I wanted an abortion. So much for confidentiality.

My da protected me from the wolves. His only mistake was telling them they wouldn’t stop me. It was my choice to have an abortion. He was gonnae take me off the island to get it done.

Well, that night, someone torched his car. Most terrifying thing I’d ever seen, right after an inseminating white light coming out of the heavens. From my bedroom window, I squinted through the fire at the trees by our road. I saw them, standing there: folks, who used to be our friends, reduced to outlines in the black, like shades of themselves.

Da and I went to the polis, but they shrugged us off. We tried to get off the island, but the ferryman shrugged us off. People were turning against us. And each day, my belly was getting bigger. My face was getting paler. My da was getting more scared. He kept us locked up in the house for “our own safety”.

My friend texted me about other islanders who’d been experiencing similar symptoms since that Saturday night. The bloated stomachs. The sickly complexions.

Something unnatural was happening.

Then, this evening, I answered the front door to Dr Haliburton. Da was passed out on the sofa, drunk and exhausted from the week’s witch hunt. I damn near shut the door in fright, but the doctor didn’t look ready to tear me limb from limb.

He was crying.

And begging me for help, I think. Truth be told, I don’t remember the exact wording, and that’s only partly on account of his mumbled, jumbled speaking; mostly, I was horrified to see what had become of him. The man’s belly was distended, jutting out twice as far as normal, and Haliburton had already been a heavyset man. He jabbed a finger at my own bloated stomach.

*Surely not*, I told myself as a horrid thought crossed my mind.

“What happened to you?” asked Dr Haliburton as he clutched his bulging abdomen. “What did this to you… To *us*?”

*Surely not*. “The… The light in the sky…”

His eyes glinted with tearful recognition. “No. *No*. That was a dream.”

“You saw it too,” I gasped, before pointing at my eyes. “You *felt* it too?”

“*IT WAS A DREAM!”* screamed Haliburton insistently, legs buckling and sending him to his knees; he looked up at me from the ground, as if at worship. “Please, Clara. Tell me what happened.”

“I know as much as you. Doctor, did you take… a test?”

Haliburton’s eyes swam with fury. *“HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST WHAT YOU’RE SUGGESTING?”* He keeled forwards in seeming agony. “I’m a man… That’s impossible.”

“Impossible’s here, Doctor. We need to pray for God’s mercy.”

“This isnae the work of God.” Haliburton looked back at me, eyes more ferocious than before. *“What have you done, Clara?”*

I was stunned. “Me?”

“Aye, you. This all started with you.”

“No, it didn’t. We’re not the only ones who are…” I was more careful this time, “… sick.”

Haliburton doubled over, face nearly against the porch. “Tell me how to make it stop… Whatever witchcraft you’ve pulled, make it stop…” Then sounded greater cries of pain. *“HELP ME! STOP IT! KILL IT! GET IT OUT!”*

It was my turn for rage, but delivered with a deceivingly warm air; the one before a tempest. “Sorry, Doctor. That isnae God’s will.”

Haliburton yelled upwards, then was sent onto his back, as if snapped backwards by my very words. Possessed. He looked possessed. There was a damp spot below his bulging gut, and I realised his yell had been a hark. *It* was arriving. And the labour was as impossible as the pregnancy itself, lasting only seconds.

Then something exited Dr Haliburton.

With no natural means of escape, the thing tore through the doctor’s groin and the crotch of his jeans, bringing with it a flood of screaming and innards. Haliburton’s torment was short-lived, mercifully; his cries died in a gargle of blood, and he lay unmoving on his back, mangled from the waist down. My own cry of horror, on the other hand, persisted into the night as I eyed the birthed thing on the driveway.

*It was crawling towards me.*

A newborn thing. A fleshy thing. A vaguely humanoid thing with facial features bulbous and misshapen. More than that, it was too developed. Too knowledgeable in the eyes, and too dexterous in movement.

I nearly tripped over myself as I backed through the open front door, then I threw it closed on the abomination.

And a gentle knocking followed.

I’ve been listening for three hours. Listening to the knocks, my father’s snores, and the distant shrieks from other islanders. The babies are arriving.

There is a wet patch below my own bulge, and the contractions have started. I pray my parasite finds a natural exit, but I’m not afraid of dying during childbirth. I’m afraid of surviving.
