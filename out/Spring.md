The flowers bloomed today. They sprang to life all at once around my home, revealing a hidden kaleidoscope of color. I bore witness to shades and hues I can’t explain, as if I weren’t meant to see them at all, and the colors I could recognize were so vibrant it strained my eyes looking at them. Blues, reds, yellows, pinks, and any other color you could possibly think of danced like the sea inside a vibrant green backdrop. They swayed softly in the wind, in rhythm with the trees looming over them against the blue horizon. It was beautiful, mesmerizing. I found myself lost tracing petal patterns and watching blades of grass wrap themselves around the veiny stems coming from the soil. 

I then looked away and realized I had let them in. 

Looking at my watch told me that thirty-five minutes had passed in what seemed like seconds. My hands started perspiring as I stared at the open door in front of me. I slowly turned and looked toward the hallway to see dirt trailing to my son’s bedroom. My heart sank but I followed wearily, listening to what sounded like a loud cicada echoing off of the hallway walls. I stopped before reaching for the handle and closed my eyes, my body tensed as thoughts raced through my mind. My hand found the cold metal and I slowly pushed open the door. I strained to open my eyes back up, and as soon as they finally gave me sight again, my perspective on reality shattered.

There he was, wrapped in a web-like substance hanging from the ceiling. He was nearly a pile of bones at this point; I could see him through the semi-translucent silk. He was being consumed by, well, how do I even explain it? Arachnid-like in ways, centipede-like in others. Its multiple legs wrapped tightly around the webbed body of my son, alongside tentacles crushing whatever was left into a substance that its proboscis sucked down. It writhed and pulsed, its shell clattering as it swelled up. The large stinger remained in the cocoon, acting like a drain plug to keep its meal in place. The creature dwarfed him. He stood no chance; my wife before him stood no chance; and I stand no chance.

Every spring, they hatch. Their eggs sit beneath the earth and sprout like flowers when they’re nearing maturity, and then they hunt. They bring whatever is left of their victim into a burrow where they lay eggs inside of the cocoon, and they continue to multiply. Whatever toxin their flowers release puts people into a trance and most of the time, causes them to open windows or doors and let them into their homes. They seem to target the young or the elderly, but they've been different, more aggressive. We don’t know what they are, what purpose they serve, or if they’ll ever leave, but I know I’m not making it through it this time and I’m taking everything I can with me. 

Gasoline and a match, that’s all I need.
