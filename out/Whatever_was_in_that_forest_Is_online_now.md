Anon, I can’t sit on this anymore. I have to tell someone.  
I don’t know what this’ll turn into. Odds are I’ll get called a LARPer, and this whole thing will be tagged as stale copypasta. But I genuinely feel guilty. So here it goes.

I’m 21, postgrad student, live in Moscow. Recently, I started spending more time at our summer house. It finally got finished, and I just like it out there. The whole area’s full of old folks—veterans WW2, mostly. The land was originally handed out to them back in the day, and barely any are still alive. Their kids are old now too, and their grandkids don’t show up much during the school year. So by fall, it’s all retirees left. They like me. I’ve got decent hands, help with fixing stuff, don’t ask for anything in return. In exchange I get homemade food, fresh veggies—stuff like that. I don’t grow anything myself except some lazy onions and horseradish, but I do love foraging. Mushrooms, berries, hazelnuts. I love the forest, probably the main reason I keep coming out here.

Anyway, it started on one of those fall days. There was some big sports thing on TV, and my next-door neighbor (old dude, looks 80 but is probably 60—drinks like he’s trying to die) got his satellite dish busted by some local punks with a bottle. I was heading into the woods—knife in my pocket, face wrapped in a rag, cap on, boots and pants tucked. Looked ridiculous, but better that than coming back covered in ticks and mosquito bites. The path into the forest runs past his plot, and as I walked by, I saw him watching me with that foggy “been drinking since noon” look in his eyes. He called out just as I passed his fence. I stopped and asked what’s up. He seemed kinda awkward, but eventually asked me to take a look at his satellite. Felt bad saying no. I knew if I didn’t get into the woods early, everything good would be gone, and it looked like rain. But still—he’s a neighbor. Can’t just leave him hanging.

Messing with satellite dishes is hell. Takes forever to align it right. We wrestled with it for a long time, but finally, the picture came back on. He lit up like a kid. Invited me for a drink—hard pass. My liver wants to live. I told him I had to get going, and he scratches his bald head like he's about to spill state secrets. Says: “Sorry for holding you up, kid. Listen, since you’re heading out, I’ll give you a tip. There’s this spot closer to the tracks. Not too deep, but mushrooms grow like crazy. Been going there for years, always come back with a full basket.” Of course, I said yes.

He quickly scribbled out a map. The place was a little ways off the tracks, down in a ravine. Our forest is kind of pear-shaped, cut across by a railroad. It’s not Siberia-tier, you can’t get lost-lost. Worst case, you just walk till you hit the edge. It was around 2PM, so I figured I’d go straight there—no point going home first. Mosquitoes were already buzzing, so I kept up a good pace. About a third of the way in, I heard thunder.

Side note—I always carry a netbook with a 4G SIM. No smartphone, too stingy for that. The netbook works fine, and honestly, if it weren’t for that habit, I probably wouldn’t be writing this right now.

Anyway, I wanted to get to the spot fast. Going back felt like a waste, so I looked at the old man’s map. It was weird. The trail was a straight line for the most part, but right where I was, it made this weird loop like a detour for no reason. Looked like something you’d do to avoid a fallen tree or a bad slope. I figured I’d just go straight through. What’s the worst that could happen?

At first, the mosquitoes vanished. Which was weird—usually, they swarm more right before rain. But they were just... gone. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if it wasn’t for how dead quiet it got. Like, forest-quiet is one thing, but this was unnatural. Birds were chirping somewhere in the distance, but around me—nothing. Dead silence. Took my headphones off. Still nothing.

Then I saw a clearing. Didn’t expect one this soon—it was still a ways to the train tracks. Got a bit hyped. Clearings sometimes mean strawberries. Yeah, no. What I found wasn’t a berry field.

Right in the middle of the clearing: an old brick foundation, half collapsed, mossy as hell. Just a stack of stones in a rough rectangle, overgrown with weeds. If I’d been in a different mood, or if I’d processed everything like I am now, I might’ve just walked away. But no. I had to peek inside.

There was a hatch. Old, half-rotted, wood. It covered a hole that went deep down—too deep. I tried lifting the lid, but the wood just snapped in half and fell inside.

Then came the first real spike of fear. First, because the wood fell way too long before hitting bottom.  
And second—when it landed, it splashed, but not in deep water. It sounded wrong, like something echoing in a cistern or an empty well. I instinctively jumped back. And then the dread hit.

I realized how alone I was. Middle of the forest. No signal. Rain’s coming. No one around. And that crash had been loud. I felt like a hundred invisible eyes were suddenly on me. Like the whole forest turned to stare. I stood frozen for a second. Then it passed. Felt stupid for panicking.

But then I looked into the hole.

Two eyes stared back. Way too far apart to be human. Just... glowing faintly in the dark.

I couldn’t move. Just stared back, paralyzed. Then thunder cracked again, and I snapped. Ran. Didn’t look back. Didn’t care about direction. Didn’t care about anything. Branches slashed at my face. I ran like hell.

Somehow ended up near the edge of the dacha village. Still had to walk through the rain, but seeing houses again calmed me down a bit. Still didn’t dare look back at the forest. It felt like it was watching. Got to my house, locked everything, turned on all the lights, collapsed into bed, and blacked out.

Dreams were fucked. I remember teeth. Clacking, two rows. Something like an inside-out dog’s head flying after me. Slowly. But no matter how fast I ran, it kept getting closer.

Next morning, around 10, someone knocked. It was the old man. Red-faced. Hungover? Maybe not. He looked relieved just seeing me.

“S-sorry, kid... stupid old man…” He trailed off mid-sentence. His expression changed, like he remembered something he shouldn’t. Then he just said “I’ll be going now...” and walked off.

I wanted to ask something—anything—but nothing came out. The moment I mentally replayed what happened, it all sounded so stupid. Like I just got spooked by shadows and bolted. But he came. He came to check on me.

I decided to leave for a while. Then I noticed my netbook was gone. Must’ve dropped it during the sprint—or maybe right when I panicked. Whatever. Even if I had the balls to go back, it’d be long gone.

Could’ve ended there. But it didn’t.

When I got home, I couldn’t log into anything. My VK account (The Russian Facebook equivalent, which used to be popular in the post-Soviet space) —locked. A couple of forums I posted on—banned. Only thing that worked was IRC, and none of my usual channels had any users.

Trying to distract myself, I called my girlfriend and we met up at a cafe. Two hours later we were having coffee when she said:

“Someone hacked your VK while you were at the summer house.”

“What, did they post weird shit?”

“Not really. At first I thought it was you messing around. But then it got... creepy.”

“Like what?”

“They kept asking about feet.”

“...Feet?”

“Yeah.”  
She showed me her phone. A wall of unread messages:

Dozens more. Just as messed up.

I went pale. Changed the subject. Next day I managed to recover my email—had a phone number linked. Inbox was spammed with gibberish, unreadable characters. No converter helped. Scrolled through pages of that garbage, then finally saw a normal email.

From a forum admin:

I emailed them explaining it was a hack, asked for examples of what got posted. No reply.

Made a burner account and asked around. One guy replied:

That same day my girlfriend was hospitalized.  
She fell down the stairs.  
Broke both legs.  
Doctors said it could’ve been worse—she almost lost them. But still: three fractures.

So yeah. I think I let something dark into the internet. I’m sorry, Anon. I really am.

Yesterday I got an email.  
Sender: me.  
No message body.  
Subject line: GIVE IT BACK.

I think I’ll stay offline for a while.
