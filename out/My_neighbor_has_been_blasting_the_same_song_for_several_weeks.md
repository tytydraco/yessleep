So just as the title says, Ive lived in this little town-house for a few months. Its right by campus so theres always some kind of noise. But our neighbor (the house next to mine) is constantly blasting this deep bass music that shakes the whole street. I can't exactly hear what he's listening to but I can feel it in the floor sometimes. It’s like his whole house is shaking and he just doesnt care. Any advice?

Update 1: So we called the police to file a noise complaint, I saw them pull up, I didn't realize this was the first time I saw the guy. He was this tall skinny dude with an undercut wearing a big fur coat and sunglasses. He had these crazy headphones on that had a bunch of antennas and batteries and shit taped on. I could see a bunch of our neighbors on their porches watching them talk. Lined up for the show, but I was out there too so I couldn’t judge.   
  
I couldn't hear what they were saying but he eventually let the cops into the house. Now, this dude is kinda weird, well not kinda, he duct taped all his windows and leaves broken microwaves in his yard. Obviously, I thought, they were going in to do a wellness check on him, it didn't seem like he was all the way there. So I’ll just call him ‘strange’. After a few minutes the bass started up again. Being outside and feeling it was different then being in my bedroom. It shook my teeth. Maybe he was just showing the officers his sound system? I still don't know. They left a few minutes later without an issue but the goddamn music is still playing so I’m wondering what else I can do to get the noise to stop. Any help?  

Update 2: One of our neighbors decided to talk to him directly. As far as I could tell she was laying into him pretty hard. Growing up in a low class white family from rural michigan, I have never seen the ferocity of a 70-something year old filipino woman with a problem. Karens can take a back seat, abuela can kick ass. I think she spent like twenty something minutes talking to him. He’s already pale but I could see color drain from his face. Eventually he led her inside and I thought ‘Thank the lord the accursed noise has finally stopped’ only for it to start up again a few minutes later. She left the house and walked back across the street. Almost like nothing happened. I’m at my wits end.

Update 3: It was like, 2am last night. I don’t sleep until like four so I was in the kitchen making myself a snack when my girlfriend noticed moving lights outside. The noise was still going in full swing at this point. We peered out the window to see what was going on and there were these two like, teenagers out there. Barely older than thirteen, looking through the basement windows of my neighbors house with flashlights. They had these backpacks on with ropes and water bottles stuck to the sides. Either it was a case of classic ‘we’re going to need everything for this adventure’ or they were going to kidnap the guy. 

I said we should call the police but Lisa wanted to see how it goes. They were just kids after all and the guy seemed nice enough (except the noise) so what the hell. Let them do a B and E. Who cares?  
  
But they never even went into the house. They opened up the basement window, looked around, and bolted into the woods. Honestly I don’t even know what to do about this. The cops were already there, and they weren’t freaked out. Then grandma asskicker went in and walked right back out. But those kids looked terrified. I’m going to talk to him after work tomorrow.

Update 4: So Lisa decided to go talk to him while i was at work. She said he led her inside and explained that it was the water heater that was acting up, that was the cause of the weird low hum. Apparently he’s tried to contact his landlord about a new one but hes giving him the cold shoulder since he’s disabled and his rent comes from the VMA (he’s deaf apparently, just thought all of your “can he not hear it?????” comments needed a bit of closure). He can read lips pretty well but glancing at mouths gave him weird looks so he started wearing sunglasses all the time.

I hope he gets it fixed soon, these noise cancelers are starting to chafe my ears at night lmao.

Update 5: Hi yall! I know its been awhile but I keep getting messages about an update. Nothing too weird has happened, the noise is still going strong but we keep seeing contractors and workmen coming to and from our neighbors house so it must be getting fixed soon. But I wanted to update yall on Lisa. shes has been acting a little strange, nothing too out of the ordinary but she started to do weird little things here and there. Like, as an example, we were going to visit her parents and when I turned on the radio she slowly scrolled through every station before stopping in the middle and letting it go for a few seconds before doing it again. (for all you young people, I still have a car with the old tuner in it, no aux, all 93.3FM, baby) I asked her what she was doing and she looked at me like *I* was the one being weird. She said she was just looking for a specific station, ORPC. I asked what that was and she said she saw an ad for it somewhere. 

I wasn’t going to post this (because what Lisa does is none of your business) but we got some of Seth’s (neighbor’s name) mail by accident, and when I went to drop it off I noticed that one letter was handwritten, it read ORPC on the front with nothing else on it. I looked it up and the ORPC doesn’t exist. I’ve been up and down rabbit holes online and the only mention of them was from 1999. It was in an old forum for helping with night terrors.

Honestly I don’t know what to make of this. I’m going to bed, let me know what you think!

Update 6: Lisa has started wearing her earmuffs around the house because of the noise. I mean its cute but its not that loud anymore, thankfully it seems his water heater has been fixed/replaced.  We still get a bit of a hum but nothing too intense anymore. We saw the woman from across the street bring Seth over some cookies. We’re not sure it was her but she was wearing her big ridiculous fur coat, like the one from Thrift Shop. But hey, it's February. 

Anyway, I’ve been looking all over for this ORPC. Other than that brief mention from over twenty years ago, I couldn’t find a single thing. A few of you reached out with ideas of it being a wellness company, or some kind of pharmaceutical company. This came up with nothing.

But one of you (shout out to Chucky) theorised it might be a bureau in the government. I called every non-emergency line from every department I could find, i’m mostly surprised you can just call the CIA but hey whatever. I found my break this way. 

Oneirology and Radio Propagation Control is a small branch run from under the FCC. I couldn't find a website, but I did manage to get a phone number.

When I called it was a lady that sounded pissed. When I asked about why my neighbor is receiving strange mail, she asked for the address. She’s going to search it up and get back to me in the morning. I tried to ask more about what they do and she just said “I don’t know, I just work here.” Thank you Agent Lanzmann, very helpful.

Update 7: I’m still waiting on the call, but today I woke up alone. Usually Lisa gets up a few hours after me so I went looking for her. She was in the kitchen with her earmuffs on, just, looking at Seth’s house. I didn’t announce myself, just to see what she would do. We stood there for almost an hour. She just kept staring, unmoving in front of the window. I slowly backed away, making sure to not make any noise and went to the living room. When I turned to sit on the couch she was in the doorframe, staring at me the same way, I jumped but she just kept her eyes on me, her mouth was moving slightly, but I couldn't hear her say anything. After a few seconds of eye contact she moved down the hallway out of eyeline. 

I sat there paralyzed for what seemed to be hours. I called off of work and did something I’ve been meaning to do. Talk to Seth and see what the fuck is going on. 

I marched over to his porch before I noticed the cop car in front of the house. One of the back windows was broken and blood streaked down from the glass. It was still dripping.

The door was ajar and I saw inside the house for the first time. It was lined with radios, vcr’s, vhs tapes, dvd’s, and shit I didn't even know. Was I ready to break into a man's house just because my wife was acting strange? No, but being in the same house as her, at least at the moment, was too much. 

She’d been spacing out and looking to the right for the last week, she keeps setting our kitchen radio to random stations whether there was something there or just static, I don’t know what this fucker did to her but I’m going to absolutley break into his house. 

I made my way through the labyrinth calling out his name before I remembered he was deaf. It wasn’t until I made it to the kitchen I realized that the blood worked as a trail leading me to him, hopefully.

At this point, despite being in an analog hell following a blood trail, my head cleared a bit and I realized that maybe I was walking into an active crime scene. But if there was a crime scene, that means there were cops and I could get some help. 

I followed the trail through the house, upstairs, the attic, downstairs, and finally the basement. I didn’t see a single soul and every room was filled with more and more media, more broken microwaves with the copper stripped out, and thousands of extension cords. They followed the blood trail down into the basement. I went in armed with nothing. 

It was dark, the only thing I could see was the little red dots on all the machines. I groped for a lightswitch when the humming started again in full swing. I could feel it shake my ribcage. I grasped at my ears and let out a muted scream. It felt like my blood was vibrating and my eyes were melting. A light blinded me while I was keeled over, someone turned on a construction spotlamp like a theater spotlight. It was aimed right at Seth, he was shirtless, surrounded by huge auditorium speakers cranked to the max. He didn’t have his sunglasses on and I could see the look in his bloodshot eyes. Nauseating euphoria. 

I finally got to my feet when a shadow jumped in front of me, then another one, apparently slamming into each other. I felt a hard crack through the floorboards. As my eyes adjusted I saw one of the cops dead on the ground, a kitchen knife plunged into his neck, he was already bleeding from his hands. It looked like the handcuffs cut into his skin deep enough to sever the vein. Bound like a sacrificial lamb. Standing over him was the other cop, He was wearing a heavy set of fur gloves soaked in blood. His eyes were bloodshot and his mouth kept moving. I couldn't hear anything but I knew that he wasn't saying anything, just like Lisa. He turned his apathetic eyes toward me. Behind him I saw the grandma in her coat, there must have been a dozen people down here with Seth.

Seth turned to me, I heard his whispers carried through the static and sent chills down my vibrating spine: “This is my favorite song.”

I turned to run back into the dark before I felt a sharp pain in my side. Lisa was face to face with me, the garden trowel she got me for my birthday was hilt deep in my side. But I only looked at her face. Empty. I’ve never seen a face so devoid of emotion outside of funerals. The fuzz on her earmuffs stood on end, waving back and forth matching the tempo of the cycling static. I heard it then, in the sound. I heard a hundred voices but I could always hear hers in a crowded room. 

“Lazlo, I’m sorry I don’t know how to get back to you, it's so loud in here.”

I pushed her off and something in me broke. She toppled into a pile of sound equipment as I sprinted for the door. I could feel the stairs shaking as someone was thundering after me but I refused to turn around. If it was Lisa I knew I would’ve stopped and I couldn’t afford to stop. 

The pain in my side erupted the second I got to the top of the stairs but I managed to slam the door shut, shoving another pile of garbage in front of it. The last thing I remember, I was limping to the front door. I must have collapsed at the door since I woke up in the hospital.

There are two agents from ORCP here. Agents Lanzmann and Swymcoski. They explained what they could. Seth Wakeley was a wanted fugitive for several years, hellbent on ending the organization with seemingly no motive. 

I asked about Lisa.

They said that everyone affected is being treated on a site in New Hampshire, visitation will hopefully be possible in a few weeks.

I signed some papers and gave my recollection of events. They recovered the letter labelled ORCP, it came from the brainwashed cop, trying to warn Seth about them getting closer. Officer Mintley was found dead at scene.

Thanks for the help everyone. I really appreciate you helping me through this event. Cherish the family you have, reach out to loved ones and remember to drink water. I will update if anything else happens.

And keep the noise down.
