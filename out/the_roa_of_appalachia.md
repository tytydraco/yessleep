They say the mountains of Appalachia are old—older than bones. When you walk beneath the canopy of those ancient trees, with the wind whispering through the pines and oaks, you feel the weight of that age in your chest. It’s a kind of pressure, like something buried deep beneath the dirt is trying to push its way out. But I don’t think it’s something as simple as tectonic plates shifting or the earth’s history rising to the surface. No, what’s under there is alive. And it’s been here far longer than we ever imagined.



It started with a sound.



At first, we thought it was an earthquake. My family and I live up in a cabin in the thick of the Blue Ridge Mountains, miles away from the nearest town. Most days, the only things you hear are the birds, the wind, and the occasional rustle of deer moving through the underbrush. But one night, a few weeks back, the peace was shattered by a deep, rumbling roar. It was nothing like I’d ever heard before—low, powerful, like the growl of a massive beast that had just woken up. It shook the ground, rattled the windows, and set off every car alarm in the valley. 



The power cut out. Phones were dead. Everything just… stopped. 



At first, people thought it was something explainable. A freak storm, maybe. A landslide deep in the mountains. But I’d grown up hearing stories about Appalachia. There are things here—things you don’t talk about unless you’re ready to face them. The elders in the holler always said the mountains have their own secrets, their own rules. And once you hear something like that roar, there’s no going back. 



For the next few days, the sky stayed overcast, heavy with a gray that didn’t seem natural. The animals—rabbits, deer, even the birds—started acting strange, too. They fled. First the smaller ones, then the larger creatures. I saw entire flocks of crows heading west like they were running from something. And in their absence, the silence was suffocating.



The second night after the roar, we saw the trees move.



My wife, Jenna, and I were sitting on the porch, trying to figure out what was happening. Our two kids, Emma and Jake, were inside, glued to the TV even though it only played static. There was a pressure in the air, like the calm before a tornado, but worse. You could feel something waiting just beyond the horizon.



That’s when I saw it. At first, it looked like the trees themselves were shifting, swaying unnaturally, as if caught in some invisible wind. But the air was still. No gusts, no storms. It wasn’t until I squinted that I realized they weren’t trees. No, what I was looking at was something far taller, something massive pushing through the forest, its outline barely visible against the darkening sky.



I don’t know how long we stared, but I remember gripping Jenna’s hand so tight it must have hurt. We watched as something—something \*huge\*—moved through the woods, just beyond our property line. I swear I caught a glimpse of scales, a flash of something reptilian. But it wasn’t until it let out that same deep, guttural roar that we both stumbled back inside.



“What the hell was that?” Jenna’s voice was shaky, her eyes wide. I had no answer for her. I wanted to say it was a bear, maybe, or some kind of freak animal. But deep down, I knew better. That roar... it wasn’t anything modern. It was primal, ancient.



We didn’t sleep that night. We just sat, eyes wide, ears straining for any hint of that sound returning. But the silence was worse. It stretched on, long and unbroken, as if the world outside our cabin had frozen in place.



By the fourth day, people started disappearing.



We heard about it from the few neighbors we had up here. Old Joe, who lived about two miles down the road, vanished without a trace. His cabin was found empty, his door wide open like he’d left in a hurry. No signs of a struggle, just... gone. Others in the holler reported hearing strange sounds in the woods at night—heavy footsteps, the sound of trees snapping like twigs. But no one saw anything. Or at least, no one survived long enough to tell us if they did.



That’s when the military rolled in.



I’ve never seen anything like it. Helicopters, unmarked trucks, and men in black uniforms swarmed the area, setting up roadblocks and checkpoints. They didn’t give us any answers, just told us to stay indoors, to not ask questions. But you could see the fear in their eyes. Whatever they were here to contain, they had no control over it. 



The sky turned a sickly orange on the sixth night. By then, the roar had become a regular occurrence, echoing through the mountains at random intervals. You could feel it in your bones, a sound so low and powerful it seemed to resonate with the very earth. Jenna and I tried to keep the kids calm, but how do you explain to a nine-year-old that something ancient, something beyond human understanding, is stalking your home?



And then, it came closer.



We were in the living room, candles flickering because the power hadn’t been back on in days. Emma and Jake had finally fallen asleep when the ground trembled. It was subtle at first, like the beginnings of an earthquake, but then it grew stronger. The rumbling. The roar. And this time, it was accompanied by something even worse: the sound of trees falling, crashing to the earth in a domino effect. 



Jenna grabbed my arm. “It’s here.”



I couldn’t speak. I could only listen as the heavy, thudding footsteps grew closer. Closer. The cabin windows rattled in their frames, and the sound of breathing—yes, breathing—filled the air. It was so deep, so heavy, it felt like the mountains themselves were inhaling. 



I made the mistake of looking out the window.



I don’t know what I expected. But nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. Standing at the edge of the clearing, illuminated by the flickering flames of our dying candles, was a creature out of a nightmare. 



It was massive—at least thirty feet tall, covered in thick, jagged scales that glistened in the faint light. Its eyes glowed a sickly yellow, scanning the landscape with a terrifying intelligence. But it wasn’t just its size that froze me in place; it was the realization that what I was looking at wasn’t just a monster. 



It was a dinosaur. 



Not one of the lumbering giants you see in museums. No, this thing was a predator. Its body was built for hunting, for killing. And somehow, it had survived here, deep in the untouched wilderness of Appalachia, hidden from humanity for God knows how long.



I pulled back from the window, my heart hammering in my chest. “Jenna,” I whispered, “we need to get the kids.”



But before I could move, the creature let out a low, rumbling growl, its head swiveling toward our cabin. It knew we were there. 



And it was coming for us.



I’ve heard stories about fight-or-flight instincts kicking in when you’re faced with danger, but what no one tells you is that sometimes, you just freeze. That’s where I was, standing by the window, heart racing, body stiff, watching that thing—\*that dinosaur\*—move closer, with the slow, deliberate steps of a predator. My mind screamed at me to run, to grab Jenna and the kids and get the hell out of there, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. 



Jenna snapped me out of it.



“Mark!” she whispered sharply, her voice cutting through the fog in my brain. “We need to go. \*Now\*.”



She was right. Whatever was out there was no longer just passing through. It had found us, and there was no telling what it would do when it got closer. I turned and bolted for the hallway where Emma and Jake were still sleeping, my heart pounding in my ears, Jenna right behind me.



I shook Jake’s shoulder first, keeping my voice low. “Jake, buddy, wake up.” He stirred, groaning in that half-asleep, irritated way that only an eleven-year-old could manage, but his eyes shot open when he saw the look on my face. 



“Dad, what’s—” he started, but I cut him off. 



“No time to explain. Get your shoes on, grab your sister.”



Jenna was already at Emma’s side, pulling her into her arms. Emma blinked, still groggy, confused. “Mom, what’s happening? Is it a bear?”



Jenna didn’t answer. She didn’t need to. The ground shook again, and the sound of snapping trees came louder, closer, as if something was bulldozing through the forest without a care in the world. Jake’s eyes went wide with fear, and he moved faster than I’d ever seen, pulling on his sneakers and helping Emma into her coat.



I grabbed the shotgun from the corner by the door. It was old, something my father had passed down to me, but it was loaded. I didn’t know if it would even slow that thing down, but I wasn’t about to go outside unarmed.



We moved quickly but quietly, slipping out the back door into the cold night air. The clearing behind the cabin led into the forest, thick with underbrush and towering trees. The moonlight barely penetrated the canopy, casting everything in a muted, eerie glow.



I could hear the creature’s breathing, heavy and slow, the sound of something massive inhaling and exhaling. It was close. Too close. We had to get out of its line of sight before it reached the cabin, or we’d be dead.



We hurried down the narrow path that led deeper into the woods, the kids holding tight to Jenna and me, their breaths coming in sharp, terrified gasps. I tried to focus on the trail ahead, but the sounds behind us were impossible to ignore. The crashing of trees, the earth-shaking thuds of its steps—it was like something out of a nightmare, but this was all too real.



And then it roared again.



The sound hit me like a physical force, making my ears ring and my chest vibrate with the sheer power of it. Emma cried out, covering her ears, and even Jake flinched, stumbling over a root. I yanked him up by his arm, my eyes darting around wildly.



We couldn’t keep running blindly through the woods. It would catch up to us eventually. I needed to think, needed a plan. My mind raced, but there was only one thing I knew for sure—we couldn’t head to town. The roads were blocked, and we’d be too exposed out in the open. We needed to hide. 



“Up there,” I whispered, pointing to a thick cluster of rocks and fallen trees just off the trail. “We’ll hide in there until it passes.”



Jenna didn’t question it. We scrambled toward the rocks, pulling the kids with us. The ground was rough and uneven, but I pushed through the pain of scraped knees and bruised palms. Anything was better than becoming dinner for whatever the hell was out there.



We wedged ourselves into a small crevice between two boulders, hidden beneath a tangle of branches. It wasn’t perfect—if the creature got too close, it would smell us, maybe even see us—but it was all we had. I held the shotgun across my lap, my finger hovering over the trigger, Jenna clutching Emma to her chest as she tried to calm her.



The woods were quiet. Too quiet.



All I could hear was the ragged breathing of my family and the slow thudding of my heart. For a moment, I let myself believe we’d lost it, that maybe, just maybe, it had gone in a different direction. But then, the trees groaned.



Something massive was pushing through the underbrush, snapping branches and felling entire trees like toothpicks. I tightened my grip on the shotgun, my pulse roaring in my ears. 



The moonlight shifted as something blotted out the sky above us. I didn’t dare look up, but I knew what was standing there, mere feet from where we hid. I could feel the weight of its presence, the primal fear that gripped me in its jaws.



Its breath came in slow, deliberate snorts, like it was \*sniffing\* the air. I swallowed, my throat dry. It was hunting us.



The creature let out a low rumble, almost like a growl, and the ground vibrated beneath us. I pressed back against the rock, willing myself to become invisible, to disappear into the shadows. I didn’t know if it could see us, if it even understood what it was looking for. All I knew was that it was \*too close\*.



And then, from behind us, a new sound cut through the silence. At first, I thought it was the wind, but it quickly grew louder, more distinct—a high-pitched, screeching call that echoed through the forest. The dinosaur lifted its massive head, its yellow eyes narrowing as it focused on the direction of the noise. For a moment, I thought it might leave us alone, distracted by whatever was making that sound. But instead, it growled, low and deep, and took a step forward.



I couldn’t see it fully, but I could feel the vibration of its massive foot hitting the ground. It was right on top of us.



Jenna squeezed my arm, her eyes wide with terror. I could see the question in them: \*What do we do?\*



But I didn’t have an answer. We were out of options.



And then, just as I thought we were done for, a flash of movement darted through the trees to our left. Something small, fast, and predatory shot across the clearing, letting out that same high-pitched call. The dinosaur jerked its head in its direction, distracted for just a moment, and in that moment, the smaller creature struck.



It moved so fast I barely registered what was happening. The smaller dinosaur—because that’s what it was, something built for speed and agility—leaped onto the larger one’s side, claws digging into its thick scales. The larger beast let out a furious roar, thrashing wildly as it tried to shake off its attacker.



Without thinking, I grabbed Jenna’s hand, pulling her and the kids back toward the trail. “Now,” I whispered. “While they’re distracted.”



We ran, this time without caution, without hesitation. The sounds of the battle behind us faded as we pushed deeper into the woods, the underbrush slapping against our legs, the cold night air burning in our lungs. We didn’t stop until the trees opened up and we found ourselves standing on the edge of an old, overgrown logging road.



Panting, I turned back to the direction we’d come from. In the distance, I could still hear the roars, the screeches, the sound of something ancient tearing through the forest. 



Appalachia had kept its secret for millions of years. But now, the monsters weren’t hiding anymore.



And they weren’t alone. 



We didn’t stop running until the sound of the battle behind us was swallowed by the distance. My lungs burned, and every step felt heavier than the last, but we kept moving, refusing to let fear slow us down. The trees began to thin, and soon, we found ourselves at the edge of an old, forgotten logging road. It was overgrown, barely recognizable, but I knew this road well—it led deeper into the mountains, to places so remote that no one ventured there anymore. 



For now, that was exactly what we needed.



I checked on Jenna and the kids, all of them panting and wide-eyed, but alive. We were alive, and that was all that mattered in the moment.



“I think we’re okay for now,” I whispered, even though I knew none of us believed it. The adrenaline was still surging, and I could feel that primal part of my brain warning me to keep moving, to stay on high alert. The beasts out there weren’t the only things we had to worry about. The woods had gone quiet again, unnaturally so, and the night pressed in on us with an eerie stillness that felt all wrong.



“Where do we go now?” Jake asked, his voice trembling, but he was holding it together better than I’d expected for an eleven-year-old. I ruffled his hair, trying to offer him some comfort, though I barely had any for myself.



“There’s an old ranger station about five miles from here,” I said. “It’s abandoned, but there might be supplies. Maybe even a working radio.”



Jenna nodded, clutching Emma’s hand tightly. “Let’s go. We can’t stay out here.”



She was right. Whatever those creatures were—dinosaurs, monsters, I didn’t know—they weren’t done. I could feel it in the air. This was just the beginning.



We walked along the road, the moonlight barely filtering through the dense canopy above, casting long shadows that played tricks on the eyes. Every creak of a branch, every rustle of leaves sent a wave of tension through me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched. But by what, I didn’t know. 



As we moved deeper into the mountains, the wind began to pick up, carrying with it a strange, almost metallic scent. It reminded me of blood, though I couldn’t be sure. I kept my grip tight on the shotgun, even though I knew it was next to useless against the kind of things lurking out there. Still, it gave me a sense of control in a situation that felt utterly uncontrollable.



Hours passed, though it felt like days. The kids were exhausted, but they didn’t complain. They just trudged along beside us, their little faces pale and scared. Finally, after what felt like forever, the outline of the ranger station appeared in the distance, half hidden by the overgrowth. 



The building was old and weathered, its wooden frame warped and creaking, but it stood. That was all I cared about. Shelter.



“We’ll rest here for the night,” I said, glancing around the clearing for any signs of danger. The forest was still, but that didn’t mean we were safe. Not by a long shot.



We made our way inside the station, and I barricaded the door as best I could. The place had clearly been abandoned for years, maybe decades. Dust covered every surface, and cobwebs hung in the corners like forgotten memories. There was an old wood stove in the corner, and a pile of rotting firewood beside it. 



“It’s not much,” Jenna said, her voice soft, “but it’s better than being out there.”



I nodded, setting the shotgun down within reach. The kids huddled together on the floor, and I draped an old, moth-eaten blanket over them. They were too tired to ask questions, too drained to be afraid anymore. For now, at least.



As Jenna and I sat by the window, keeping watch over the dark, I finally let out a long, shuddering breath. It felt like we’d been holding our breath for days.



“I don’t understand,” she said quietly, her eyes distant. “How is this possible? How could they have survived out here… for so long?”



I shook my head. “I don’t know. I really don’t. But it’s not just the dinosaurs, Jenna. There’s something else out there. Something… wrong with the land itself.”



She looked at me, confused, and I realized I hadn’t told her everything. Not yet. I didn’t want to scare her more than she already was, but she needed to know.



“Before the military came, before the power went out… I saw something on the news,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “There were reports coming out of places all over the world—places where the earth was... changing. Seismic activity, strange weather patterns, animals disappearing. It wasn’t just here. Something’s happening, something big, and I think it’s waking things up. Things that shouldn’t still be here.”



Jenna stared at me, her eyes wide with fear. “You think… you think this is just the start?”



I nodded slowly. “I don’t know how, or why, but whatever’s happening, it’s bigger than us. And I don’t think we can stop it.”



We sat in silence for a while after that, listening to the wind outside, waiting for the next sound, the next threat. I tried to keep my thoughts focused on the moment—on keeping us safe, on surviving the night—but my mind kept drifting to the bigger question. How much longer did we have before this spread beyond the mountains? How much longer before the world realized what was happening?



A distant roar echoed through the night, far off but unmistakable. Jenna stiffened beside me, her hand gripping mine tightly. It wasn’t close, not yet, but it was a reminder. The monsters weren’t gone. They were still out there, roaming the mountains, hunting.



But for now, we were safe.



I turned to Jenna, forcing a small, tired smile. “We made it through tonight. That’s what matters.”



She smiled back, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Yeah. We did.”



The kids were already asleep, huddled together under the blanket, their faces peaceful for the first time in days. I watched them for a moment, feeling a fierce protectiveness rise in my chest. Whatever happened next, I wasn’t going to let those things take my family. Not without a fight.



As I settled down beside them, the weight of exhaustion finally pulling at me, I pulled out my phone. There was still no signal, no way to call for help, but I opened the notes app anyway. Maybe someone would find this one day. Maybe they’d need to know what happened here.



\*\*October 15\*\*  

We’ve made it to the old ranger station in the mountains. I don’t know how long it’ll be safe here, but for now, we’re okay. There’s something in these woods—dinosaurs, monsters, I don’t know what to call them. They’ve been here all along, hidden deep in Appalachia, and now they’re waking up. I don’t know what caused it.  

But this isn’t over.  

I’ll update this as soon as I can. If anyone reads this—stay away from the mountains.  



I closed the phone, slid it back into my pocket, and leaned my head back against the wall, the shotgun still within reach.



We weren’t out of the woods yet.



But for tonight, we were safe. And tomorrow… well, I’d update the story when I could. If I could.
