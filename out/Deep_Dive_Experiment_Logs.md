 Hello there. I am Greg Robinson. A death row inmate from [Redacted]. Reasons for me being in death row? I was part of a gang robbery but I was the only one charged for shooting a cop. The rest of them got at least 10 - 20 years. I should say lucky them. Because when you are death row you belong to the government. They took me from my cell, gave me these instructions, prepared me, trained me. Sayed if I lived through this I would get off death row and serve the same prison time with my friends of 10 years. I accepted. I mean who wouldn't. They put me on a boat somewhere in the middle of the ocean where I would go in this weird chamber that they said the scientists came up with. They said I'll be in there for a while but I'll have some food and a couple of buckets to do "my business". I'm scared though. I really don't like the ocean. Wish me luck.

 Hello again. I guess they took you in the chamber to huh? I guess to record my findings or whatever I encounter or feel. Inside the chamber is nice. Looks like one of those big propane tanks except suited for a bed and my necessities. Soon as i went in yesterday I immediately felt the tank dropping into the ocean. When that happened the tank moved real roughly as it lost balanced and it scared the shit out of me. Most of what I did yesterday was slept to try to encourage myself. I also have a clock in here and a calender to record the date and time. Something weird about it though is that it feels cozy in here. Today when I got up I looked outside the circle window I have to look through and saw the fish life swimming about. I even saw a shark! I then ate them MRI meals that they give soldiers on base. Spaghetti I really liked. Welp I'm going to bed, see you tomorrow.

 Today I got up and marked down the date. This will be my second day in the endless ocean. The fish and sea life are going about. I can feel like they really know how to adapt to their environment. No matter what changes may come to them. I even saw a school of fish swimming about my chamber. I had a thing of noodles. Well I'll guess I'll get some sleep and see where the journey takes us tomorrow.

 Today marks the 3rd day in the ocean. I can still see the hordes of life outside. I want to be able to swim with them. Maybe when I get out of prison? Most of what I did today was doing the exercises that the scientists made me do beforehand. I think this is actually helping my body get stronger. I'll make this a routine while I am in here. I miss my friends though, they were like brothers to me.

 Today marks the 4th day I am in here. There is only darkness outside now. While I was asleep I must've went into the further depths. I wonder how much cord they have up there to keep making me get lower? I exercised like I planned today. I miss seeing the other life outside. The darkness now makes me feel empty. Didn't even made me want to eat. I'm going to bed.

 Today marks the 5th and final day of my descent into hell. I still feel the same as yesterday though. My head hurts. Didn't even feel like exercising today. I hope they pull me out quick. I'm starting to get hot. I'm going to lay back down.

 What the hell! Shouldn't they have raised me up already! Damn! Damn! I punched the container and felt like I broke my hand. Shit! Wasn't supposed to turn out this way! Then something inside my head made me realize a terrifying thought. What if the wire broke amd I'm just floating down here? I'm stressing myself out too much. Maybe I should just rest my head.

 Today marks the 7th day. I want out. I don't care if they bring me back to death row. I want someone to rescue me and get me the hell out. I spent most hours crying and shaking. Today is also when I finally ran out of rations. If they won't let me out I'm gonna starve to death! Maybe… it's what I deserve anyway. I feel bad now that I've killed that cop. Leaving his wife with no husband and child with no father. I didn't see it back then cause I was selfish. If you are up there I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry.

 Today is the 8th day. I thought that I felt something big brush against the container! I'm scared. I don't want to get swallowed up by some big creature! Please please help me. Mom, momma, I want you by my side right now.

 Today is the 9th day. I think I am in hell. Drifting in the black depths of loneliness. I don't think I can handle it anymore. I'm going to finish myself. Wait, do you hear them? The voices. They are telling me there is a way out! I just have to follow some instructions! Oh god has answered my prayers! If this works I guess you'll be lonely too huh? Don't worry. Maybe we will see each other again? I hope so, see you friend. Goodbye.

 *****************************************

 Hello, this is Scientists Martin Lions. I am a researcher and I work mostly with oceanography. A week ago me and a group of scientists selected 5 death row inmates that will suit the needs for our experiments. Mr. Robinson was one of them with the promise to remove the death row from there sentences. 


 Anyway Robinson and the other 4 were dispatched into different areas and different oceans. Mr. Robinson was dropped off into the Atlantic. The goal of this experiment was to see how the human mental state can handle going down the deep depths of the ocean. 


 The experiment was only supposed to last 5 days but when we were going to pull all of them out our supervisors told us to leave them down there. We protested but they refused. We then compromised to 5 more days. 


 Once those days were up we immediately pulled them up. Something was wrong though. Only 2 of the 5 subjects were still in their containers. Inside the other tanks what we saw were scribbled signs that we didn't understand painted with blood. On the other sides of the tanks were more blood painted messages. "The voices tell us the way, they tell us the message." 


 To the families of the subjects that were missing I'm sorry. We reviewed the hidden cameras and saw them cutting their hands before the cameras went out. All we saw were static. Then the cameras went back on and they weren't there. This is a tragedy to science. I just heard Mr. Robinson's audio and notes. I just feel sadness for what we made them go through. 


 Me and a couple of scientists are going to go through the same experiment. Hopefully we can find out the cause of the 3 inmates disappearances. I want their families to know where they are. I am scared. Wish me luck.
