Last year, my wife Emily and I were eagerly waiting for the closing on our new house. Luckily for us, just as we hoped, we were able to move in at the beginning of December, just in time for Christmas. We worked tirelessly to get into the house as quickly as possible. Once all the boxes were unpacked, it felt like we could finally breathe and enjoy our little corner of the world. One of the first things I did was string lights along the gutters and set up an inflatable snowman on the front lawn. Christmas, I thought, was going to be perfect.  

Inside, the house smelled of pine and cinnamon candles, a combination Emily swore made the house smell “Christmasy”. We’d spent the evening decorating the tree in the living room, stringing up lights and hanging ornaments we’d collected over the years. She handed me a glass angel that had been her grandmother’s, insisting it go near the top, while I snuck one of my childhood Star Wars ornaments right in the middle. Afterward, we sat down to a simple dinner, roast chicken and mashed potatoes, and capped it off with mugs of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream. It was a perfect evening filled with the best cliché Christmas activities. The fire crackled in the stone fireplace as we curled up on the couch under a blanket. Emily picked a classic Christmas movie, one of those old Claymation types she loved, and for a while, everything felt perfect.

It was exactly what we had hoped having our own house would be like.

As the movie played, I thought I heard something faint in the background, just barely quieter than the TV. At first, I ignored it, assuming it was the wind or a neighbor talking outside. But then the sound grew clearer, a soft, melodic hum. I glanced at Emily, and she was already looking at me, her head tilted slightly. “Do you hear that?” she asked, her voice hushed.

I got up and moved toward the window, brushing the curtain aside to peer out into the darkness. For a moment, I couldn’t see much, just the snow-covered yard bathed in the glow of our Christmas lights. But then I spotted them, a group of people gathered on the sidewalk just beyond the edge of our lawn. 

“It looks like… people out there singing,” I said, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

Emily shot up from the couch, hurrying to join me at the window. When she looked out, her face lit up with excitement. “It’s carolers!” she exclaimed, pressing her hands against the cold glass. “I haven’t seen carolers in so long. This is so cool!”

Her enthusiasm made me smile. Emily rushed to open the front door and step out onto the porch to get a better look. She stepped onto the porch, her slippers crunching softly against the light dusting of snow that had fallen earlier. I followed her, crossing my arms in the cold as we both leaned against the railing to watch.

The group stood at the edge of our lawn, singing *We Wish You a Merry Christmas* in perfect harmony. There were six children, their small figures barely visible in the dim glow of the streetlamp. Behind them, a taller figure lingered, standing perfectly still. The adult seemed to be a chaperone, maybe a parent, but they hung back in the shadows and let the children do their thing, just out of reach of the light.

The children’s voices were beautiful, clear and in perfect unison, like a scene from a Christmas movie. I remember thinking that they must have practiced quite a bit to be so good at it. Emily clutched my arm, smiling wide. 

“This is so adorable, can you believe this?” she whispered, practically bouncing on her heels.

I smiled and nodded, though my gaze kept drifting to the adult in the back. They didn’t join in the singing, didn’t move, didn’t even shift in the cold. I gave them a smile and a wave out of acknowledgement, but they didn’t return the gesture. For now, though, I shook the thought away and tried to enjoy the moment. 

The children finished their first round of *We Wish You a Merry Christmas* with bright, cheerful voices. Emily clapped softly, calling out, “Yay, that was great!” The kids didn’t react, not even a glance her way. Instead, they started the song over again, their voices rising into the night with the exact same energy and rhythm as before.

I shifted uncomfortably, glancing at Emily, who didn’t seem to notice anything odd. “Guess that’s their only song,” I said quietly, trying to laugh it off.

As they sang, the children began to step forward, their boots crunching against the snow. It was slow and subtle, almost like they were testing the ground. At first, I thought maybe they just wanted to get closer so we could see the show better. But with each repetition of the song, their movements grew more deliberate, almost like they were advancing.

The adult in the back stayed where they were, unmoving, their silhouette outlined by the faint glow of the streetlamp. I kept glancing at them, hoping to see some sign of encouragement or control, but they remained as still as a statue. If they were leading the group, they certainly weren’t doing it actively.

Emily didn’t seem to notice the subtle shifts. “I think we should grab them some snacks and drinks,” she said, already turning toward the door. “They’ve probably been out here all evening!”

I wanted to agree, but something about the way the children kept singing, repeating the same verses over and over, gave me pause. The cheer of the song was starting to sound hollow, almost mechanical.

The children sang on, their song unwavering as they moved closer to the porch. Emily didn’t seem to notice, busy rummaging through her thoughts aloud about what treats we could offer them. But I couldn’t take my eyes off the group. They were halfway up the lawn now, their small faces glowing faintly under the porch light.

They hit the part about figgy pudding, their voices growing louder and more insistent:

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some…*

It felt less like a request and more like a demand. My stomach twisted uneasily, but I couldn’t pinpoint why. I wanted to just go inside and shut the door on them. I wanted to just get back to the warmth of my home and continue enjoying my evening. But the trained societal instinct in me denied my internal request, not wanting to be rude to a group of children.

Then, on the final line of the verse, they changed the words.

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some, now please let us in*.

The words fit perfectly into the melody, sweet and bright, as though it had always been part of the song.

The moment the words left their lips, they all stopped. Dead silent. No shuffling of boots, no rustle of coats. They just stood there, staring up at us. And then, as one, they smiled.

It wasn’t the kind of smile you’d expect from children after singing carols. It was perfect, in unison, stretching across their pale faces as if painted on. My chest tightened, and for the first time all night, Emily’s excited chatter trailed off. She was staring too, her hand tightening on the doorframe.

“What…what? You want to, come in?” she asked them softly, her voice barely audible.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. All I could do was stare back at those unnaturally still figures, their unblinking eyes locked on us.

Then, they broke the silence, repeating the verse over, this time louder, more hurriedly. 

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some, now please let us in.*

As the silence stretched on, my heart began to race, and I began to sweat, even in the cold. The children didn’t move, didn’t sway or shuffle in the cold. They just stood there, staring at us, their smiles frozen in place.

For the first time, I forced myself to look at them, really look at them, and then I noticed it. Their eyes.

They weren’t the sparkling, bright eyes you’d expect from children singing Christmas carols. No, these eyes were solid black; deep, endless pools that reflected nothing, not even the soft glow of the Christmas lights. It was like staring into a bottomless well.

I took a step back toward the door, my breath catching in my throat. “Emily…” My voice came out shaky, barely louder than a whisper. “Their eyes. Look at their eyes.”

She glanced at me, confused, before turning her gaze back to the children. For a moment, she didn’t react, but then her hand flew to her mouth. She whispered. “What…why are they…?”

The children didn’t flinch, but their smiled began to drop, one by one. As if they knew we’d noticed.

Panic surged through me, and I grabbed Emily by the back of her shirt, yanking her inside before she could protest. She stumbled, her gasp cut off as I slammed the door shut with a loud crack, fumbling with the lock until I heard the reassuring click. My chest heaved as I pressed my back against the door, staring at it like it might burst open at any second.

Before I could even catch my breath, a knock echoed through the wood, soft, almost polite. I froze, my blood running cold. Then, a child’s voice came from the other side.

“Please let us in,” it said, muffled but eerily clear. “It’s so cold out here.”

My stomach twisted and my mind raced. There was no way. I’d just seen them down in the front yard. I knew they hadn’t had time to move that fast.

Emily’s eyes were wide with disbelief, her hand clutching my arm. “How… why…” she started, but I shook my head, silencing her.

“Shhh,” I whispered, the words barely audible as my heart thundered in my chest.

Another knock came, this one firmer. The voice repeated itself, calm and sweet but now with a sound of urgency.

“Please. We’re so cold. Won’t you let us in? Didn’t you like the song?”

The voice at the door was replaced by the faint sound of singing again. That same damn song.

*We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas…*

Their voices, which once sounded beautiful, now sounded like metal against metal. Emily’s breathing hitched as she clutched my arm, her eyes filling with tears. “Why aren’t they leaving?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. My chest felt tight, my heart pounding so loudly I could barely think. I reached for her, trying to reassure her, but she crumpled onto the couch, her hands covering her face as she began to sob quietly. “They’re just… kids… why are they like this? What’s wrong with them?”

The singing outside grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t cheerful anymore, it was mechanical, almost robotic, like a recording played on a loop.

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some…*

“I’m going to go check all the doors,” I said, my voice shaky but firm. I couldn’t just sit there and listen to this madness. Emily looked up at me, her tear-streaked face full of fear. “Don’t leave me alone,” she pleaded.

“I’ll be quick,” I promised, squeezing her shoulder before darting toward the kitchen.

I moved through the house like a man possessed, my bare feet skidding slightly on the hardwood floors as I rushed to check each door and window. The kitchen door was locked. The windows in the dining room were latched. I double-checked the sliding glass door in the living room, rattling it to make sure it wouldn’t budge.

All the while, the singing followed me, relentless.

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some…*

I peeked out of the kitchen window toward the front yard, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. The children were right there, just at the edge of the porch. Their pale faces were tilted upward, gazing at the house with those black, empty eyes. They didn’t blink. They didn’t flinch. They just stood there, their lips moving in perfect unison.

The figure in the back still hadn’t moved. They were like a shadow, a vague shape just beyond the reach of the light, but I could feel them watching, cold and suffocating.

I ran upstairs, taking the steps two at a time, and checked the bedroom windows. Locked. The bathroom? Locked. The guest room? Locked. Still, I felt exposed, like no matter what I did, it wasn’t enough.

*Now bring us some figgy pudding, we all love our figgy pudding*

When I finally made it back into the living room, Emily was curled into herself on the couch, her knees pulled to her chest. Her sobs had turned to quiet, stuttering breaths. “They’re not leaving,” she whispered, her voice hollow.

I crouched beside her, grabbing her hands and holding them tightly. “We’ll be okay,” I said, though the words felt empty. “We’ll just wait it out. They have to leave eventually.”

But deep down, I wasn’t so sure. The knock came again, louder this time, and the singing paused for just a moment.

“Please let us in,” the voice said, now sharper, more insistent.

Emily’s grip tightened on my hands, her nails digging into my skin. I positioned myself between her and the door as the singing resumed, louder and faster now, as though they were growing impatient.

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some…*

Their voices were rising, overlapping now, creating a chaotic, distorted sound that filled the entire house. It was unbearable, like dozens of voices screaming in my ears.

And then, over the noise, I heard something new, a faint scratching sound coming from the back of the house. Something scratching at the back door. 

I sprinted to the back door, my heart hammering so loudly I could barely hear the singing anymore. I checked the doorknob and the deadbolt for the third time now, making triple sure it was locked, my hands shaking as I did so.

But something pulled at me, a dreadful curiosity, a gnawing instinct that I couldn’t ignore. Against my better judgment, I leaned toward the window beside the door, lifting the edge of the curtain just enough to peek outside.

Three more children stood on the porch, staring at the door. They looked almost identical to the ones in the front yard, same pale skin, same black, hollow eyes, same unsettlingly motionless faces. Their heads tilted slightly in unison, as though they sensed I was watching them.

One of them, a small boy, maybe seven or eight, raised his hand and pressed it flat against the glass. His palm left a black, greasy smudge, like the residue of something foul. His lips parted, and though I couldn’t hear him over the singing, I saw the words he mouthed.

“Let us in.”

I let out a pitiful, primal cry, and I stumbled back from the window, nearly tripping over the corner of the kitchen counter.

The singing outside grew louder, and now it wasn’t just coming from the front, it was surrounding the house, voices echoing from every side, filling every corner.

*We won’t go until we get some, we won’t go until we get some…*

Emily’s scream from the living room shattered my trance. I bolted back, finding her standing now, pointing at the windows. Her face was as white as a sheet, and she could barely get the words out. “They’re... they're everywhere,” she stammered, tears streaming down her cheeks.

I turned to look, and my blood ran cold.

The children were pressed against every window now. Their faces were almost flush with the glass, their breath fogging it up as they stared, unblinking, into the house. The shadowy figure loomed in the background, now visible in both the front and back yards. It was closer than before.

The knocking started again, but not just on the front door this time. It was coming from every side of the house, front, back, even the upstairs windows. I could’ve sworn I also heard noises on the roof, like the skittering of little feet.

“Please let us in,” the voice said again, echoing from every direction. It was distorted now, overlapping and reverberating like a broken recording.

Emily sank to the floor, covering her ears. “Stop! Please stop!”

I didn’t know what to do. My mind was spinning, panic clawing at me as I tried to think of a plan, any plan, to make this nightmare end. But the singing, the knocking, the voices, it was relentless, never-ending. It continued like this all night.

Emily had stopped crying hours ago, but only because she was too exhausted to keep going. She sat curled up in the corner of the living room, clutching her knees to her chest, staring blankly at the far wall. Every so often, she’d flinch at a particularly loud knock or scrape, but otherwise, she didn’t move.

I didn’t dare sit down. Exhaustion was clawing at me, a heavy weight begging me to lay down on the couch, but I refused to give in. My legs ached from pacing, from double and triple-checking every lock and window, but it didn’t matter. Adrenaline and fear kept me upright.

The night stretched on endlessly, each minute dragging by like hours. Time felt distorted, warped by the relentless chaos outside and the gnawing anxiety inside. My mind flickered between confusion and terror, the edges of reality blurring as exhaustion sank its teeth in me.

Every time I thought it might be letting up, like the singing was fading or the scratching was less frequent, it would return with renewed vigor, louder than before.

At one point, I caught myself standing in the middle of the kitchen, staring blankly at the window. I didn’t even remember walking in there. My brain felt foggy, my thoughts sluggish and disconnected.

The children’s voices seemed to echo from within my own skull now, looping endlessly. My mind began playing tricks on me, the scratching on the walls began sounded like it was coming from inside the house, though I knew that wasn’t possible. 

I glanced at Emily, who hadn’t moved in what felt like hours. Her lips were moving were moving to the words of the song, but no sound came out.

Finally, the clock on the wall ticked to 6:00 AM. I stared at it, the tiny movement of the second hand feeling like a monumental event after the endless, terrifying night.

The first rays of sunlight began creeping over the horizon, casting weak light through the windows. It was like a spell had been broken. The scratching stopped. The knocks ceased. The children’s maddening voices fell silent, and for the first time in hours, everything was quiet.

I stood frozen in the middle of the room, holding my breath. My ears strained to hear any sound, my body braced for the next inevitable horror. But there was nothing. Just stillness.

Emily lifted her head slowly, her eyes bloodshot and face slightly swollen from crying. "Is it… over?" she whispered, her voice cracked and trembling.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know. I wanted to believe it was over, that the dawn had driven them away. But something deep in my gut told me it wasn’t that simple.

Then, as if on cue, the singing started again. It was louder than before, deafening in its clarity, as if every voice had gathered for one final encore.

The voices were impossibly loud, reverberating through the house. I clamped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. 

Emily screamed, clutching her ears, rocking back and forth on the floor. “Stop! God, just stop!”

I stumbled to the front window. What I saw made my hope plummet and sent tears down my face.

At least a dozen children, maybe more, stood in the yard, their faces turned toward the house. Their mouths moved in unison, their song perfectly synchronized, their vacant eyes staring straight at me.

Finally, they finished their song with one final verse.

*We won’t go until we get some,*

*We won’t go until we get some,*

*We won’t go until we get some,*

*We’ll be back next year!*
