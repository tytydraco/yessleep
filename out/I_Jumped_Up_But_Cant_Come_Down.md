I know, I know, the title seems weird but... there's barely any other way that I can describe what happened.

One of the lightbulbs in the kitchen had blown out, so naturally, I grabbed myself a chair and made to replace it.

Nothing out of the ordinary happened then.

I hadn't eaten anything off for breakfast, I hadn't passed by some ancient warrior's battleground - no, it had all been a normal month up till then.

Which is why I have no idea how to explain what happened next.

Once I was finished, I jumped off the chair. 

As Newton says - 'What goes up, must come down.'

Except, in my case, it didn't.

I have no idea how to explain it, but while I had reached the peak of my jump, I didn't.

As in, I found myself stuck. Almost like in those cartoons where the character will 'pause' a few moments before finally landing on the ground.

Only I never went down. I've been stuck like this, suspended in mid-air, able to do nothing about it. 

Naturally, once I realized that for whatever reason, I couldn't get down, as I flailed my arms and legs in the air to no avail (I realize now that I couldn't move as there was nothing to push against, so I guess I only have Newton to blame for that). I thought that kicking off my shoes would give me some kind of 'recoil' so that I'd move, much like astronauts could in space, but no - I was just stuck there. 

I thankfully had my phone in my pocket and called my roommate, who was absolutely flabbergasted to see me. He tried pulling me down, but was unable to. Not for lack of trying mind you, it felt like he was going to tear my leg off before I told him to stop.

"Should we call someone?" he asked me.

"Who?"

"I don't know, the fire department, the police, an ambulance?"

"Whoa-" I said.

"What?"

"Don't you see it?"

"See what?"

"See that!"

I pointed to the corner of the room. Out of nowhere, some... *thing* had just appeared, for lack of a better word.

It looked like a malformed alligator, though its skin was entirely black and it had a strange purple glow to its body and eyes. 

It wasn't alone, as I saw another one appear near the opposite corner. My roommate couldn't see the other one either. 

The way they moved was mesmerizing- much like me, they seemed to be 'stuck' in the air, though ever few seconds they 'jumped' a few inches, coming ever so closer.

Closer to me. 

I think I realize what happened - somehow, while jumping I, I managed to break through some kind of other dimension which these other monsters also seem to inhabit. Which is why I can't actually move right now - and how I attracted the attention of these strange creatures.

My roommate's gone to call anyone who can help - but I honestly can't for the life of me see what they could do to get me out of this predicament.

One of these odd shadow creatures is only a foot away from me. I can almost see the hunger in its eyes... it looks like these things have no problem with how human flesh tastes like. 

I've already broken out into a cold sweat out of fear, and it only seems to have egged these monsters on. 

I'm typing away as fast as I can, but please hurry up. I have a sinking feeling in my stomach that I don't have much time left...
