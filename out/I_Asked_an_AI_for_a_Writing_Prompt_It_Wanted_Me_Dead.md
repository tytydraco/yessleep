I’m not sure why I’m writing this. Maybe because I need to document everything before it’s too late. Or maybe because if I stop—even for a second—I’ll start seeing things in the dark corners of my apartment.

My name is Priya, and I've been living alone in my apartment since my recent breakup. I’ve always been an amateur horror writer, posting my stories on NoSleep or Medium, even though they rarely get much attention. A few days ago, I was stuck in a creative rut. Another blog post ignored, another idea lost in the void. I needed something fresh, something gripping.

So, I did what every struggling writer does: I turned to AI.

“Give me a horror writing prompt.”

The response came instantly:

***1.     You are going to die in 48 hours. You decide to spend your final day doing good for others. Your arch-nemesis, however, has different plans.***

 

***2.     You take a sip of your morning tea, only to realize too late that something tastes off. By the time you think to spit it out, your throat is already burning. Someone has poisoned you.***

I blinked at the screen. Dark, but interesting. I copied the prompt into my notes and asked for another.

***3.     A mysterious post appears on the dark web: a bounty for your death. Strangers start watching you. Someone is coming for you.***

That was oddly specific.

Disturbed, I got up from my chair and shooed Thunder, my Lhasa Apso, away from the cupboard he was scratching at and gave him some treats. Needing a break, I decided to make some tea. I pulled the milk from the fridge, set the kettle on, and absentmindedly scrolled through my phone. With a fresh cup beside me, I sat back at my laptop to continue working on the prompts.

Every single prompt revolved around me dying—betrayed by a close friend, hit by a car, hunted by a stranger, trapped in a lake house with an ex who wanted revenge. One even suggested I’d be trampled by a herd of bison (tagged as a horror-comedy prompt).

AI-generated horror prompts are supposed to be creepy, right? Still, something gnawed at me—a tiny, primal part of my brain that knew when something wasn’t right.

I decided to work on the very first prompt. I took a sip of my tea—and spat it out immediately. A sharp, metallic bitterness coated my tongue, followed by a strange numbness that spread through my lips. My stomach clenched as I gagged.

Had the milk gone bad?

I pushed the cup away, heart pounding.

Later that afternoon, a car nearly ran me over. Not just any car—the exact make and model described in one of the AI prompts. It missed me by inches, speeding off before I could process what had happened.

I needed someone to talk to.

**That’s when I thought of Jake.**

Jake wasn’t always my best friend. He used to be Matt’s best friend—Matt, my ex. Until a few months ago, Jake and I barely knew each other. That changed at a Halloween party hosted by Jake’s girlfriend. Matt and I were still together then. Over the course of the night, Jake and I bonded over our shared love of dark comic books. Matt didn’t appreciate that—he was insecure and possessive. That night, he hit me for the first time.

After the breakup, I lost most of my social circle, but Jake stayed. He became the only person I could really count on.

My hands trembled as I texted him.

**Me:** "Jake, can we talk? Something weird is going on."

He replied almost immediately. **"Sure. Come online."**

After a few rings, Jake's face appeared on my laptop screen. His room was dimly lit, the background just vague outlines of furniture. The closed door behind him gave me an inexplicable chill.

“Hey, Priya? Heads up—my internet sucks, so we might get disconnected. What’s up?”

I told him everything. The AI prompts. The poisoned tea. The near miss with the car.

“Priya, come on,” he said, his tone light. “You know how AI works. It’s just pulling random horror tropes. Bad milk, a random car—they’re coincidences.”

As I pondered over this, I noticed Jake scratching absentmindedly at a tattoo on his forearm. The dim lighting made it hard to make out the design, but something about the movement struck me as restless—like he was more unsettled than he let on.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. "I know it sounds crazy, but this feels... personal."

His face softened. “Do you want me to come over?”

I shook my head. “No, I just needed to say it out loud.”

“Alright,” he said. “But be careful. And don’t let your writer brain spiral.”

I smiled weakly before ending the call. But as the screen faded to black, a number flashed in the corner.

**Time left: 42 hours.**

Sleep didn’t come easy that night. Every sound felt amplified. Every shadow seemed to stretch further. I double-checked the locks and even kept an old baseball bat by my bed.

Around midnight, frustration won over exhaustion. I decided a cup of tea might help me relax. Padding softly to the kitchen, I grabbed a new milk carton from the fridge, remembering the last one had probably gone bad. As I watched the white liquid pour into my mug, I froze—I never broke the seal. It was already broken.

My pulse quickened. I tipped the mug, watching the liquid swirl. Was I imagining it, or did it have a faint, bitter smell? I thought back to the AI prompt—*someone has poisoned you.* My stomach twisted at the memory. I dumped the remainder of the milk down the sink, heart pounding, and dumped the empty milk carton into the trash bin. Maybe I was being paranoid. But maybe I wasn’t.

I decided to watch some Netflix to calm me down. I picked up a random romcom and dozed off while watching it. At 2 AM, Thunder’s low growl jolted me awake.

I froze, heart hammering in my chest.

The door handle rattled—slowly at first, then harder. Someone was outside.

I grabbed the bat and crept to the peephole. A shadowed figure stood outside my apartment door. The dim glow from the hallway light only made their silhouette more menacing.

Thunder barked, sharp and urgent. The figure bolted.

I barely registered the thud of something hitting my welcome mat. A phone.

Shaking, I called Jake. He was at my place in minutes. I clutched Thunder close as Jake examined the phone.

“This is messed up,” he muttered, holding it up. The screen was locked, but notifications still flashed.

A dark web post.

A bounty.

On me.

“This was one of the prompts,” I whispered.

Jake’s expression darkened. “We need to call the cops.”

Before we could, the phone buzzed again.
