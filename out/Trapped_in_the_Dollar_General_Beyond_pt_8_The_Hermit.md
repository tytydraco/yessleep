We spent some time making plans, but very little was decided on.

The Hermit had be dealt with, that much was clear, but it was the hows that kept eluding us. We could take him alive, but then we’d have to guard him. We could kill him, but none of us were sure we could kill someone. He had to be stopped, but how could we do it? 

“First thing we have to do is find him,” Gale said, “If he can travel then he might be anywhere. We need to track him down and see where he is.”

“If he’s going back, then FF would be a good place to start.” 

“True,” Gale said, “If nothing else, we might find out more about him.”

“What's to know? He’s a crazy old dude.” I said, adding a length of rope to my bag.

If we were going to his lair then there was a good chance we could set a trap for him.

“True, but was he always? I don’t know how long this old guy has lived in the Dollar General Beyonds. He could have come here when they were still called J.L. Turner and Son. Hell, crazy dude could BE Cal Turner for all I know.”

“Who?” I asked, not having a clue what he was talking about. 

“Sorry, I don’t know why I would have expected you to know the stores history. Cal Turner took over after his father died and officially named the store Dollar General after that. Word was that he went missing sometime after opening the first one, just stepped into one of his own stores and was never seen again. His son ran them when I worked there, but I suppose he’d be an old man by now. Cal and Carl, his son, looked a lot alike and it took the company years to admit that the owner was gone. Some people say he just became a recluse but I knew managers who were close to the family and they swore that the rumors were true. Anyway, I doubt the old man is Cal. He’d been older than hell and likely twice as crazy.”

I didn’t like to think about another lost soul trapped here, but it did make me wonder how many others could be prisoners here. I have no clue how long I’ve been here, but I know it hasn’t been very long when compared to Gale, and Gale believed the old man had been here longer than that. If people didn’t age than who was to say that Cal Turner might not be in here somewhere? Who was to say that there might not any number of people traversing the infinite, or not so infinite, Dollar Generals?

If there were, however, then why hadn’t they met any of them?

“Have you ever met anyone else?” I asked before I could think better of it.

“Besides you?” Gale said, smiling a little as he thought about it, “No one other than the hermit and Celene, I guess.”

He got a little speculative then. Thinking about his friends always made him quiet and thoughtful, and I hated that. Gale was a good dude, and I didn’t think he should be inundated with the guilt over people he had no control over. He had done his best, plain and simple, and they had done what people do.

“Hey,” I asked suddenly as I slid a cold coffee drink into my backpack, “If he’s going through the doors then shouldn’t he stop being crazy?”

Gale cocked his head at me, “What do you mean?”

“Well, you said that all injuries and damage to clothes and stuff are fixed when you go through the door again. If he’s rattled from his time here then shouldn’t he be kinda, I dunno, reset or something when he goes through?”

Gale pulled his bottom lip into his mouth, chewing it as he thought the question over. The doors had always healed anything that was wrong with us in the past. Whether it was a wound or ripped clothing it always fixed us, and we were pretty reliant on it for clothes and general fixes. If the crazy hermit was able to travel while remaining in his wrong mind, then maybe the doors didn’t reset you as much as we had thought.

“Hell, Rud, I don’t know. Maybe he’s messed up enough in the head that he thinks that's just how he is. A certain amount of what we do with the doors only happens in our heads. I don’t claim to understand it all. Sometimes it works differently for different people. It works the way it works for you because that's how it works for me and I’m the one who taught you. He may have learned differently so it works differently for him. I guess, maybe, we can ask him when we grab him.”

I nodded, trying to ignore that he had called me Rud again. Rud, or Rudy, had been his son, and the more comfortable he got with me, the more often he slipped up. I didn’t mind, not really. If he thought of me as his son then I was okay with that. 

No, it was Gale who seemed to mind. Even now he had realized what he had said and his face had gotten stormy. I knew he was still looking for Rudy, still looking for all of them, but the chances of finding them seemed to dwindle the longer they stayed gone. Rudy had gone after another of Gale’s original group, but it seemed that no one came back from the ceiling. I was already trapped in Dollar General Beyond, I wasn’t in a huge hurry to get trapped somewhere else. 

“Got everything?” Gale asked, pulling on his pack and taking up his club.

We had never really carried weapons, not like this, but after finding the hermit in other stores but his, we had started taking them with us. We had taken wooden chair legs and hammered nails into them. They weren’t very sturdy, they were mostly spikey particle board, but they would do in a pinch. We had taken some of the hoodies off the rack and sewn cardboard into them. They weren’t great, but they would do too. The cardboard wouldn’t do a lot, but it was the best we could manage. 

“Ready,” I said, making the chunky sweater as comfortable as I could before we set off. 

I wanted to start in FF, but Gale said we should check a few key places first. 

“I have some safe houses that I want to make sure he hasn’t hit yet. It’s nothing impressive, just some food and things that I’ve come across in my travels.”

I made notes as we went and here is where we went for my journal. It's starting to come along, but I know its a drop in the ocean in the long run.

B (Normal Fall Store)
Designation- Low Danger
People- 0
Theme- Fall Decore
B is a perfectly normal Dollar General that's been set for Fall. It had pumpkins and scarecrows and some of the halloween decorations are there but not all. It has some seasonal items, but it seems to be the start of autumn selection and doesn’t contain as much as it would by the end of October.

Gale had apparently been here before and left a Go Bag. He went to the manager's office and opened up the red box that usually held the fire extinguisher. Instead, there was a backpack that Gale took out and unzipped. He looked over the things inside, talking under his breath as made sure it was all still there.

“Okay, I didn’t think he would have come this far, but it was a possibility. Lets go to the next one.”

We did a quick check before heading out, but everything appeared to be in place. The things I had used were gone, but nothing else seemed to be taken or moved. We still weren’t sure that he could take things with him, but as we moved on we were in full data collection mode.

OO (Night Store)
Designation- Moderate Danger
People- 0
Theme- A dark store with lamps
OO is a shadowy place, and one of the few stores without the buzzing overhead lights. It’s lit by tall metal street lamps and the light they make doesn’t go far. It does not appear to have a ceiling. Any attempt to shine a light up there reveals nothing and Gale thinks that its likely its there to simulate the night sky. Some of the shelves are pushed over and I suspect that the Miasma can come and go here freely. We have never encountered him here, but it seems likely we could and we do not linger here.

Gale hit the ground running when we got to OO. None of us liked to be here, but he felt like it might be a good place to hide something because of the environment. The whole store was pitch black and lit by these interspaced lamp posts that cast a yellow glow over the shelves. He reached between two shelves and took out a duffel bag, handing me the light as he went through it on the run. He didn’t like coming here anymore than I did, and when he had established that everything was there, he zipped it and we headed out. There was a sound as we came to the door, something like a moaning wind from the shadowy ceiling, and we were through before we could discover what it was.

EEE (Cave Store)
Designation- Highly Danger
People- 0
Theme- A store inside a cave
EEE is a store inside a cave, as the name entails. The lighting is glowing fungus that baths everything in a mysterious glow. The shelves are carved into the stone and some of the items are made of rock. In the middle of the store is a pool of water that is okay to drink from, but contains a “monster”. Gale says its a big crocodile or something and that it comes out to walk around on occasions. It chased us the last time we were there and it's easily ten feet long. There are bats that hang from the ceiling, though Gale isn’t sure what they eat since there are no bugs here. He’s never seen them move either so no one is sure what they can do. The food here is refrigerated by the cave, that is sixty five at all times, and nothing seems to spoil or go bad.

We came into the cave store looking for the creature who lived here. We had been here a few times, the store had a great selection of mushroom, and last time we had come face to face with the gator who lived here. I hadn’t really believed Gale when he’d told me about it, but it was hard to deny when you were face to face with the monster. He had a long snout like a crocodile and his scales seemed to shift through a series of colors as he came hissing after us. He was slow, thankfully, and we got out before he could catch us, but I suppose that put my rule about “No living things in the DGB” into question.

He was in his pond today, at least we assumed he was, and Gale pushed a rock aside as he took out another backpack that he checked over.

Most of these bags had things like first aid kits, nonperishable foods, and tool kits that could be used to set up traps or snares. Gale had set them up just in case he needed to secure another store or travel to infinite for a while and I was sure that these weren’t the only ones. Gale had been here long enough to set up safe houses in several stores, and the one in DGB 0 was just the first in a long line I was sure. 

“Okay,” Gale sighed, pushing the rock back into place, “He hasn’t found any of these. I can’t think that he has any real skill with travel, but if we haven't come up on him then he must have enough to go back and forth.”

“Are we ready to check FF then?” I asked, still feeling that it should have been our first destination.

“Not yet,” Gale said, “Lets check a few random places. If he’s just traveling willy-nilly then we might find him somewhere near FF.”

I nodded, seeing the logic, and as we set off, we went to GG first. GG was the place I had stopped after my initial encounter with the oldster, and it was a store set up for Mothers Day shopping. The whole place smelled of flowers and I really enjoyed coming here. It was nice, and the whole atmosphere seemed to glow a light pink. GG was fine, but as we moved into HH, we could tell that someone had been there. HH was a normal store, except that all the words were reversed. It was like a weird mirror store, and it looked like someone had ripped open a couple of bags of chips and ate them right off the floor. They were scattered like a rat had been at them, and though we weren’t absolutely sure that it was him at first, we found more of his…leavings down one of the aisles and decided that it was a good enough calling card for our little friend.

We checked a few others and some of them bore similar signs of his visits. 

Food scattered, trash tossed around, and a nice healthy dump left nine times out of ten. 

“Now are we ready to check FF?” I asked, tired of looking at scat and stepping on chips.

“I suppose we should.” Glen said after finding his calling card in another store, “It seems unlikely we’ll just run up on him if he’s moving so sporadically..”

Gale seemed like he didn’t really want to go to the Hermit’s Lair but it was our best bet of finding him at this point. 

We stepped out of the cave and into the dump, the hermit’s store looking as desolate as ever. The floor crackled under our feet as the wrappers and garbage crunched underfoot. He had been just dropping his trash in the same manner that he dropped his waste and the whole store stank with a mingling of rotten food and human crap. I didn’t want to be here either, but we had to go make sure he wasn’t hanging out and waiting for company.

We stayed close, searching every shadowy nook and dirty cranny, but we couldn’t find the old man hiding anywhere.

“Okay, it was a good idea but I guess he’s out. Come on, lets try somewhere else.”

We were leaving the back area, near the automotive section, when my foot struck something and I stumbled. I immediately wished I had been looking where I was going. As I fell face first into a pile of filthy rags, my nose came into contact with the worst smells I had ever experienced. Imagine old sweat, unwashed clothes, dirty bathroom aroma, and a hobo camp on a hot day and you’re close. I came staggering up, trying to get away from it as quickly as I could, but when my hands fell on a plastic holder with what felt like paper in it, I reached back and pulled it out too.

It was a backpack, one shoulder strap ripped from the bag, and inside was a journal.

It was old and cracked, the leather extremely abused by the owners hands and many openings. The paper inside was curled at the corners, and there was a bookmark inside of a happy car with a fish in its mouth. The handwriting inside was neat, a meticulous script that had been written with care, and I doubted that the crazy old man had done it. There was a lump in the middle of it, and I thought it might be a button or a nametag.

“It’s,” but I heard Gale grunt as something came screaming from atop a nearby shelf.

The old hermit had returned and it appeared that we had found something he treasured.

Gale turned to catch him, but he landed on him and knocked the wind out of him. The old man was off and cappering towards me, his teeth bared and his face a mask of crazed rage. He rushed me like a linebacker, knocking me over as his long, dirty fingers closed around my neck. My air was instantly cut off, his nails digging into the back of my neck as he screamed and gibbered in his weird language. I tried to fight back, I tried to push him off, but he was solid for someone so old. Shoving at him was like shoving a boulder and he leaned into me as I was slowly strangled. Black spots started appearing in my vision as his greasy finger choked me to the point of unconsciousness, I wondered if the door would bring me back to life when he inevitably collapsed my wind pipe? Would Gale be allowed to drag me back through it, or would this crazed loner simply bite my throat out and eat me right here?

When his blood splattered my face, I supposed I’d never get to find out.

As his fingers loosened, I could see Gail standing behind him, panting as he released the handle of the weapon. 

The nails were sticking out of the hermit’s skull as he shook and gurgled, and when he slipped to the ground, his blood made dark stains on the blankets that had been his bed.

Gail stepped away, shaking as badly as the old man had been, and when he ran for the door, I followed after him.

When I came through in DGB but he didn’t, I knew something was wrong.

Now I’m left here with just the journal for company, feeling like maybe we’ve crossed a line that neither of us were ready for.

I’ll keep you all posted, but for now, I think I need to go and think about whats happened today.
