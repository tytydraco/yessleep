In the heart of the city, there was an abandoned subway station known only as Elysium Station. It had been closed for over 50 years, its entrance sealed off with rusted gates and warning signs. Urban legends claimed that the station was cursed, a gateway to something far darker than anyone could imagine.

One night, a group of urban explorers—Mia, Jake, and Leo—decided to break into the station. They had heard the stories, but they didn’t believe in curses. Armed with flashlights and cameras, they pried open the gates and descended into the darkness.

The station was eerily preserved, as if time had stopped the day it was abandoned. Faded advertisements lined the walls, and the air was thick with the smell of damp concrete. As they explored, they noticed something strange: the tracks were still intact, and the platform was spotless, as if it had been recently cleaned.

“Do you hear that?” Mia whispered. A low, rhythmic sound echoed through the station—like the distant rumble of a train. But that was impossible; the tracks had been disconnected decades ago.

The sound grew louder, and the ground began to tremble. A blinding light appeared in the tunnel, and a train screeched to a halt at the platform. Its doors slid open, revealing an empty, dimly lit interior.

“This can’t be real,” Jake muttered, but his curiosity got the better of him. He stepped onto the train, followed by Mia and Leo. The doors closed behind them, and the train began to move.

The interior was cold, and the air felt heavy. The lights flickered, and the walls seemed to close in. The group tried to stay calm, but panic set in when they realized the train wasn’t stopping. It sped through endless tunnels, passing stations that didn’t exist.

Then, the whispers began. At first, they were faint, but soon they filled the train, overlapping in a chorus of anguish. The lights went out, plunging them into darkness. When the lights flickered back on, the train was empty—except for a single figure sitting at the far end of the car.

It was a woman in a tattered dress, her face obscured by long, matted hair. She didn’t move, but her presence was suffocating. The train screeched to a halt, and the doors opened onto a platform bathed in an eerie red light.

“Get off,” the woman hissed, her voice echoing in their minds. They stumbled out of the train, only to find themselves in a nightmarish version of the station. The walls were covered in strange symbols, and the air was filled with the sound of screams.

The train doors closed, and it vanished into the darkness. The group tried to run, but the station seemed to stretch on forever. They were trapped, lost in a labyrinth of endless corridors and platforms.

To this day, no one knows what happened to Mia, Jake, and Leo. Some say they’re still down there, wandering the forgotten station, searching for a way out. And if you ever find yourself at Elysium Station, be careful—you might just hear the distant rumble of a train.
