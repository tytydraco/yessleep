For anyone who missed the puppets newest issues:

The building was used to death even before Pi took it over. But the level of violence and chaos occurring was a step beyond anything previously contained in those bloodstained walls. 

I want to apologize to you fine people. I’m not an evil doll, and historically, often, I have been the problem. I know, I know, I’m spitting in the face of truth in advertising, but please, indulge me. 

Who I am, is someone who can provide an outside perspective, both figuratively and literally. And outside perspective is required when Michael is involved. 

But at the moment, my identity isn’t important. I applaud those of you observant enough to have the answer already, but if not, I wouldn’t worry about it. 

What’s important now is the wound covered hand, holding an ichor dripping keycard inches away from a small, black reader. 

Mike is hurting. To be quite frank the man could be accurately described as dying. Nothing crippling at the moment, but the human body can only take so many blows before starting to break in places an improvised tourniquet or battlefield stitching can’t help. 

And make no mistake, our boy Michael is nothing more than human. Sure he’s wrapped in the guise of something evil, something unknowable, but that’s all it is. Obfuscation. 

Michael isn’t powerful, strong, brave, or even all that clever. He’s, interesting, to some, at best. And that’s coming from one of the closest people to him. 

 It isn’t nerves of steel that drive him to unlock the cells. It isn’t even altruism. Truth be told, it was this, or death. 

Michael had run through every bobble in his gifted bag of tricks, and still found himself near death and trapped with 2 of the guards. 

The tortured, mutilated man watches as things he thought were relegated to horror films and urban legends take their first free steps in decades. 

If they knew what released them was nothing more than human, he’d have been an appetizer before the main course. 

But like everyone so inclined, when this legion of creatures tried to sense what the clown was, they came up blank. 

When the choice is revenge on your captors or a struggle with the unknown, no one picks the second option. 

When Michael sees what has became of the warehouse floor, he’s more than scared, his entire perspective is changed. 

So far you lot have seen things from the point of view of those for whom the paranormal  is old hat, or integral to their being. Those of us so blessed have an innate ability to parse the senseless, to deal comfortably with the nature of the supernatural. 

But those sons of Adam, daughters of eve ,the multitude that make up humanity, they’re not so lucky. 

It takes it’s toll on body and mind, like a sick kind of radiation. It makes a person twisted, strange, and in the long term, a corpse. 

Mike gives up on finding a way out, the display of power, Pi’s warping of space and time, is beyond him. 

One could argue fatalism and blind optimism are two sides of the same coin. One understands the future, one ignores it. 

Mike flips that coin as he sees the chaotic scrum of violence. 

And as always for the one time vigilante ( or serial killer, depending on your view of things) that coin lands on it’s edge. 

Blood drips down his abdomen, when he looks to the source he sees beyond flesh and fat. A deep cut missed opening his stomach but lacerated  his chest so deeply he can see a small sliver of his own rib. 

His face is a mask of lunatic glee, but it’s an act. Inside he’s horrified at the thought of his own mortality. 

If Michael was a clever man he’d ask for help from the one friend he has in this corner of reality. Unfortunately, our mutilated would-be hero is stubborn. 

His plan is born of desperation and fear. More the drunken ramble of a schizophrenic than anything approaching tactical acumen. 

He figures if he can’t find his way through the maze, he might as well try and slay the minotaur. 

There have been people, historically who went up against demons and came away the victor. It’s pretty much the point of most religious texts. But Michael, is not that man. He is not blessed, and certainly not pure. 

So our friend wades into the carnage, on his way to slay dragons, while hoping, deep down, he’s tilting at windmills.    

The man looks small compared to the things dealing death around him. The entities trying to slay or ensnare the rioting prisoners of all types. But he begins to feel the ebb and flow of this unnatural disaster. What little cunning and guile he has finds opportunity in carnage. 

At this point, many of you may be asking, “How can one man survive something like this?”. I have your answer. It comes in two parts. 

First, maybe he doesn’t. Maybe at some point Michael takes makes one wrong decision too many and winds up with a blade in his back. There’s no twist where that vulgar jester is capable of writing this kind of prose. 

Second, what you’re ignoring are the millions of determined, able, individuals willing to spit in the face of fate that were turned into pulp by some horror lurking in the shadows. 

You don’t hear their stories, because they have none. 

What Michael does isn’t really combat, it’s theatre. It’s violence by way of professional wrestling. 

Michael’s plan doesn’t survive first contact with the enemy (to coin an old phrase), first contact with the enemy forms it. 

A lanky being, grey skinned and  pierced by rusted barbs of steel sees the man. And lack of aura or no, decides to vent it’s rage in Michael’s direction. 

The clown is blindsided, the masochistic entity grabs him by the ill-fitting suit jacket and tosses him like a ragdoll. 

If you heard it from the horse’s mouth, it’d be a ten thousand word nearly  coulrophillic rant. But let me save you from that. 

Michael isn’t a clown themed killer. He’s a professional clown, who was forced to fight and damned to lose. 

As such, he manages to minimize the impact of the brutal throw. That being said, he makes it look nearly fatal. 

Michael stumbles away into the crowd, the newly freed abomination following close behind. 

In it’s haste it slams into something holding back a determined but doomed group of human rioters. The massive  asymmetrical humanoid howls in rage and backhands the steel skewered supernatural stalker. 

New blood is thin, and the lanky, gibbering entity squirms in pain on the ground, broken bones tearing at bruised organs. 

It doesn’t see Michael break his way from the rapidly devolving melee, nor the two handed blow that caves in the side of it’s face. 

But others do, and that was the point. 

They didn’t see the lucky accident that truly put the pierced paranormal peon down. Just this blood soaked man dispatching something that goes bump in the night with ease. 

Mike isn’t a warrior, he’s a performer. One who can shape a narrative, give some kind of meaning to bloodshed and violence. And this is how he makes his way around the warehouse. 

Sneaking, hiding, and taking credit for work nearly completed. 

But cracks are starting to show, the clown is panicked, he can’t find what he’s looking for, and with the way the warehouse is twisting it’s own dimensions, he knows it may not even exist. 

Lightheaded from blood loss, toes broken on bare feet, Michael collapses near a row of lockers stained with blood and gore. 

No one around to see it but myself, so the man drops the mask. There’s only so long a performer can perform. 

Screams of the dying, howls of rage, gunfire, all of this means nothing to him. 

Tears wash small furrows of grime and blended offal from his face. These aren’t the maniac sobs of someone disconnected from reality. No, fate is far too cruel to break Michael’s mind. It merely bends it to an excruciating degree. 

He thinks back to a time where his biggest worry was if his pilot for a clown show for the new millennium would be picked up ( It wasn’t.). It’s a stupid thought, but it drives home the scale, and horror of his situation. 

He's wracked with shivering sobs of fear, grief and regret. He’d give up if he wasn’t scared of the implications of dying somewhere a demon seemed to be making home. 

But no good deed goes unpunished and there is no rest for the wicked. Mike concentrates, clearing his eyes and thoughts. Forcing himself to put one foot in front of the other.

Michael may not know a thing about the void, or it’s spawn, but architecture was required learning for his, post-entertainment career. And there was enough logic and reason left in the design of the building for the clown to find what he was looking for. 

Much like sewer pipes, most air ducts are far to small for a person to crawl through. But service corridors are a necessity for any industrial building. Paranormal or not, things break. 

It's cramped, dark, and reeking, but luckily for Mike, unoccupied. 

His back and shoulders scream with every bump of the claustrophobic , maze-like series of hallways and ladders. One foot has started to go numb, nerves being twisted and compressed by fractured bones. 

He ignores the architectural impossibilities, and keeps putting one foot in front of the other, hoping the dust covered etched steel maps and markers still hold some weight. 

He doesn’t know if it’s been hours or minutes, but Michael hears something. A soft, erratic scuttling noise. 

He stops, tensed like a coyote, dim emergency lights  giving no clue as to the source of the sound. 

Mike moves low, hunched almost to the point of crawling. He stops randomly, listening. 

He doesn’t like what he hears. 

But the cavern-like maintenance tunnels warp the noise, Michael cannot pinpoint it. 

Tense minutes of moving at a snail’s pace, Mike’s blood loss starts to concern him as much as whatever is in here. 

A blind corner and a drifting mind puts him mere feet from the thing. 

To the uninitiated ( Michael included.) the creature, with it’s vaguely human, almost child-like face, twelve hand-like legs and no body to speak of may seem like the creation of a necromancer, or mad scientist. 

But the 80 pound thing is simply one of the many random, senseless things the universe has decided to spawn at one point or another. Whether it was an employee or prisoner of Pi, no longer matters. The travesty in the warehouse has gone beyond sides, it’s simply about survival. 

Mike makes eye contact, he thinks he sees something there. Some spark of intellect. And takes a chance. 

He steps backward, leaving the thing a clear path. 

“Kind of a shitstorm back that way. “ He whispers. 

Give a man an excuse to kill, and most will. Give him a reason not to, most won’t. 

Both parties share a moment of tension, before the two survivors go their separate ways. 


 Michael continues his death-march, every passing minute making him more sure the maps and markers are meaningless. 

Eventually though, after pushing screaming joints and muscles through a genuine vent, barely big enough to accommodate him, he slowly lowers himself into the hallway before Pi’s office. 

Mike’s blood falls like rain, letting the two guards, men in their 40’s, dressed in  black jeans and blue button up shirts know something is afoot. 

Contortionism and acrobatics are second nature to Mike, despite fractures, and torn muscles, his descent is measured, attention grabbing. 

The deadpan reaction of the two would have tipped off most that they were more than just men. 

In fact they were more status symbol than last line of defense. What was behind the door they guarded needed no defense. 

Ghouls, one of the oldest kinds of void touched. Out of the 200 or so left in the world, two stood watch over Pi’s door. 

There were plenty of more powerful creatures in Pi’s employ, but few so rare. 

Had Michael known this, he’d have understood the futility of throwing two scavenged blades into their chests. And he would have avoided wasting time with the next two blades that buried themselves harmlessly to the hilt in the ghoul’s skulls. 

These are not zombies, shambling creations using human flesh and bone to spread disease. These are those that have been abandoned by death. Bound permanently, to impermanent forms. 

The ghouls remove the knives from each other, grinning with blackened teeth and falling upon Michael. 

It’s a slow, ponderous affair. The clown is wounded, the ghouls move in a  trudging fashion but with purpose. It’s a war of attrition, one that Mike can’t win.   

Though, he doesn’t need to. He has no way of killing the creatures, his cane having no effect beyond it’s mass. But Mike adapts, crushing joints, arm and leg bones, and leaving the two immobile. 

In time, bones will set, but at the moment the ghouls can do no more than drag themselves toward the clown. 

But the effort wasn’t without it’s cost. Michal stands nearly shirtless, makeshift stitches burst, broken bones screaming for relief. With the door so close he wishes he was seeing red, but all he’s seeing is black spots. 

It's beyond him to put on that lunatic mask. Every step is agony, every breath driving fragments of bone into organs. 

Fear stays his hand inches from the doorknob, he thinks of how easy it would be just to sit down, let nature take it’s course. Avoid the worse fate on the other side of the door. 

Spite makes him turn the knob, he see’s Pi, formal suit, hands folded behind his back, watching the carnage. 

“Come in Mike, have a seat. “ Pi says calmly. 

This is Michael’s only chance and he knows it. One shot to bury the cane in the demon’s skull and hope for the best. 

Fear makes his hands sweat, the cane feels slippery. 

“You’ve given me a lot of time to think about what I’d do when I got a 1 on 1 . “ Mike begins, walking toward Pi, he coughs, a thin mist of blood stains the demon’s desk, “ You like to talk a lot about how the used car salesman look is just some proxy, no more than an appendage of your true form. 

Makes it seem kind of pointless to fight you. “

Michael draws closer, heart racing. He banks on Pi’s ego letting him get within striking range. 

“I knew you were a smart one.” Pi replies simply. 

Mike misses the wicked smile on his face. 

“Give it a minute.

Then I started to think, you know why mechanics use tools? No one wants to lose an appendage.” Mike puts all his effort into a two-handed strike.

But it’s a blow that never falls. 

Michael is frozen, held fast in an absolute sense. He begins to hover a few inches off of the floor as Pi turns to face him. 

You can see Pi’s otherworldly nature much more now. Features that aren’t quite human, eyes like black pits full of the universe’s worst secrets. 

“You thought catching me off guard would do it?

Don’t know who put that old-wives tale out there, but I think I owe them a dinner. 

I can warp time and space, you dolt, I can hear your neurons firing. Come on, man. “ Pi taunts, “Neat little speech you had though. Could have used a bit of work toward the end. “

Mike begins to panic. Never before had he felt so helpless, so in over his head. 

“You can’t kill me, you need what’s in my head. “ he pleads, no trace of his devil-may-care tone. 

Pi laughs, the sound echoes through the small room. 

“Dial that back a notch. What’s in your head is very profitable to me if I can get it to come out and play. 

That being said, there comes a point where the bullshit that goes with it, outweighs the profit. 

Now, while I’m getting a real kick out of watching the meat slug it out down there, I’ve got to admit, it’s pretty expensive. 

  So now, I cut my losses, and see who wants to see what they can find poking around in your corpse. “ Pi replies as a pressure begins to weigh on Mike from every angle. 

Bones protest with audible creaking. Blood begins to trickle from the Clown’s ears. 

“If I die he dies. “ Mike asserts, incorrectly, “ Seems like you two knew each other. “

Mike’s ploy gets another burst of derisive laughter. 

“Yeah, but who really gives a fuck about ol’ Demi? Big ego, probably would have been like pulling teeth to get him to sign up for the cause anyway. 

You’ve played your last card Bozo. This is where fucking around where you don’t belong gets you. “ Pi says as the pressure around Mike begins to turn fatal. 

“What if I could get him for you, right now? “ Says a voice from Mike’s body. 

“That’d just piss me off worse. I’ve been running under the assumption he’s buried deep enough you can’t get him.” Pi states, the pressure blinding Mike in one eye. 

“Just making sure.” The voice says from Mike’s form, this time not attempting to hide it’s cadence. 

Pi’s eyes widen as the clown’s feet hit the floor. 

With one step Pi knows who he’s dealing with, the body language, the slight change in facial features. He’s no longer talking with some misguided performer, he’s talking with, your’s truly.

“Michael, my boy, we share this conveyance, keep up on repairs, will you?” I say, and with a trivial brush of my hands, repair the most fatal damage to our body. “And you, jacket and shirt, now. “

At that moment, there is a battle of wills between myself and Pi. 

Looking at it, you wouldn’t notice at first. No objects starting to rattle, no stressed out looks on our face, just two seemingly normal people casually watching each other. 

But eventually the tide begins to turn, Pi begins to show fear, then pleads as the tips of his fingers begin to rot and fall to the ground as black ash. 

He gives up the fight, and struggles to remove and offer his clothing. 

I take it, the slow creeping rot of this part of his form being destroyed keeps traveling up his limbs. 

“ Keep in mind, you haven’t left me much of a choice here. 

There are a lot of ways Michael could die that would leave me as the sole owner of this beat up lemon of a body. But being pulped? I can’t really work with that, can I? “ As I talk, Pi hits the ground, footless shoes falling to either side. 

“I’ll take the loafers as well, actually. 

In fact, I’m going to be taking a lot from you. Michael wants to get home, and I want to…well I won’t bore you with the details. Suffice to say neither of us can do it with our current resources. “ I walk around Pi as I talk, he’s little more than a torso and head. 

“Anything you want, just stop, please.” Pi begs. 

“Good to hear that. 

You’ve stuck your dick in a hornet’s nest Pi, now, I’ll let you keep it, mutilated as it may now be, but I need you to do something for me. 

I need you to be a symbol, I need you to be something that is going to make the children of the void listen to Michael. 

I’m going to implant a memory, of a noble, hard fought battle between the two of you. You patched him up out of fear, he brought you down with gumption and fortitude. 

Your job is to be a living reminder of this. Something that will avoid him questioning the absurdity of coming up against a demon and winning because of a fancy truncheon. 

If you’re thinking of betraying me, just remember, I may not always be here, but I’m always watching , Pi.” I say.

Mike doesn’t miss a beat, he’s panting, sweating, and looking every bit the part of someone who just fought a demon. 

The limbless demon in front of him, seemingly helpless erases strange feelings Mike may have had about the situation. 

I don’t like to give Michael much credit, but his plan was more than simply to throw himself at Pi. That was simply the most difficult aspect. 

He roughly tapes an old steel microphone to the demon’s head, muttering threats and curses. It’s connected to the warehouse’s PA system.

He picks up the limbless evil and opens the other door to the office, walking out on an iron catwalk. 

Michael throws the body onto the rough iron platform, the weight causing a concerning vibrating noise. 

For a moment Mike takes in the scene below. The absolute senselessness of it, the waste of life, of power. This pisses him off, he thinks of how much good everything down there could do, how many problems they could solve. 

The demon wails as Mike begins to strike him with the cane. As fake as it is, the horrific scream, amplified by the PA catches the attention of the crowd. 

Dozens of confused faces, man, creature, and other look toward Michael. The mutilated form at his feet speaking more than he could. 

Mike rips the microphone from Pi’s face, theatrically tapping it, sending a blot of squealing static through the PA. 

“Some people say that just because you killed Jesse James, doesn’t make you Jesse James. 

Anyone with that opinion here today?” The clown challenges. 

Some mumbling from the crowd but no one speaks. 

“Good. 

Anyone that wants to get out, by all means, leave. Whatever you are. 

But I think, everyone here is here for a reason. 

There are big things coming down the pipe. Things that make this stub that’s been making everyone’s life hell look like a schoolyard bully. “ Mike begins, kicking Pi for good measure, “ Seems like everyone has been giving you bits and pieces of the story. 

It’s because most don’t know, and the rest, they’re looking to make some kind of gains with it. “ 

Mike walks down the rusted catwalk to the floor as he talks. Internally, every muscle is screaming at him to run out the door. 

“I’ll give you the truth, but the problem is, it’s useless without some way to put it to use. 

That’s going to require bodies, it’s going to require things, and most importantly, reputation. 

We’re going to make a name for ourselves, and once we have a voice, we’re using it. “ Mike opens his offer standing in the middle of a blood soaked crowd that, minutes before were at each other’s throats. 

Believing you understand Michael is a dangerous thing. While the man is most certainly cognizant, his mind has been twisted to the point of lunacy. 

What makes this so dangerous is that he has that lunatic zeal. That charisma that can sway hearts and minds. 

So for the next 2 hours Michael tells the motley crew of half dead humans and entities everything he knows about the nature of reality. They hang on his every word.  

He talks of a universe segmented into 9 corners, creatures from the places in between capable of devouring gods, the void itself being damaged. All kinds of horror and wonder.

Some information is true. Some is believed falsehoods, and yet more are crafted lies, designed to give his information more weight. But by the end, by the time his throat bleeds from volume instead of trauma, those left, believe. 

And here is where I’d like to try and explain something. 

I’ve been reading along just as much as you have (For those wondering, anyone I don’t want seeing this, is most certainly not seeing it. ), and I understand something. 

Right now, you are feeling the same kind of thing the directionless crowd is. You see what Michael is doing, and you see it as some kind of fix to your little puppet friend’s problem. 

Let me offer a differing perspective, hypocritical as it may be. 

What you’ve observed is a passionate lunatic with nearly no information gaining control of a very dangerous and disproportionately powerful group. Take it from someone who’s been around a long time, this is seldom a good thing. I’ve seen witch trials, the crusades, and the satanic panic, and they all started the same way. 

There comes a point where intent no longer matters. And you know what they say about the road to hell. 

Your’s Truly

Demi
