I had never been much of a sentimental person, but tonight, the weight of everything—the mistakes, the regrets—felt unbearable. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a pale amber glow over the field, I sat on the old deck I’d built years ago. It was supposed to be my escape, my quiet place to reflect or get away from it all. Now, it felt more like a tombstone, marking the slow decay of my life.

I rubbed my knee with a grimace, the ache a constant reminder of everything that had gone wrong. It was more than just physical pain—it was a daily reminder of my biggest regret. The car accident that took Sarah from me had also stolen my sense of purpose. The farm, once alive and thriving, had withered in the wake of her death and so had I. The crops were failing, the house was falling apart, and the bills were stacking up.

I took a long gulp from the glass in my hand, the alcohol burning my throat. I’d lost count of how many drinks I’d had tonight. Probably five, maybe six. It was hard to keep track anymore. I used to think it numbed the pain, but tonight it was only sharpening it, making me more aware of how far I’d fallen. I sat there, staring at the fields, knowing they would soon belong to someone else. Just like everything else. My whole life was falling apart, and I was too drunk to care.

Sarah had been my anchor. She’d kept me grounded, kept the farm running. Without her, I had nothing. The house was empty now, except for the ghosts of memories I couldn’t shake. Her laughter. The way she’d scold me for drinking too much. The way she’d always remind me to take care of things. Now, everything was in ruins, and all I had left was this deck, this bottle of whiskey, and the ache in my knee.

I glanced out across the field to where the scarecrow stood, a grotesque figure standing in the twilight. It had been there for years, an old straw-man dressed in tattered clothes. Once, it had served a purpose—to protect the crops from birds. But now, it was just a hollow, decaying figure, like everything else.

It had become a strange sort of companion over the years. Sometimes, after too many drinks, I’d find myself talking to it, ranting about the things I couldn’t say to anyone else. I’d tell it my regrets, my fears, and I’d imagine that it understood. But tonight, there was something different about it. It seemed… closer, somehow.

“Still standing guard, huh?” I muttered, my voice thick with the burn of alcohol and bitterness. “Like you’ve got a damn thing to protect anymore.”

I chuckled, but the sound felt wrong, hollow. The scarecrow’s gaze seemed more intense, more focused than usual. For a moment, I almost thought it moved. I blinked, wiping the fog from my mind, and looked again. It was still there, unmoving, just as it had been for years. But now, something about it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

My knee flared up again, sending a bolt of pain shooting through my leg. It was like clockwork. Every evening, at exactly 5:45 PM, the pain would hit me, fierce and unrelenting. At first, I’d pass out from the intensity of it. But now, I was used to it. I braced myself, knowing it was coming.

I closed my eyes, squeezing the arms of my seat like I was strapped into some kind of electric chair. The pain hit, just as it always did. It was like fire shooting up my leg, tearing through me. But this time, something else came with it—a flash of her face. Sarah. Her eyes, wide with betrayal, her mouth moving in a question I couldn’t escape: *“Why did you do it, Darcey?”.*

I tried to scream, to ask for forgiveness, but the words caught in my throat. I thought about the accident and the fact that I was driving drunk. The world spun, and for a moment, I was back in the car, watching as everything around me shattered, her body flung from the wreckage. I could still hear the screech of metal, the thud of the crash. And then, not silence, but the sound of the radio that kept blasting funky town like that one video on the internet (if you know, you know).

When the pain finally faded, I opened my eyes. I was laying on the ground, staring up at the scarecrow. And it stood there, staring down at me like a judgmental sentinel, its hollow eyes staring straight through me. I tried to push myself to my feet, but my legs were weak, trembling from the pain.

I glared at the scarecrow, barely able to stand. “What the hell are you still doing here?” I spat. “There’s nothing left to protect. Go away.”

But the scarecrow said nothing, as it never did. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off tonight. That it was different, watching me with a kind of twisted intent.

I stumbled away, heading back toward the deck where my bottle of whiskey awaited. The pain in my knee pulsed again, and I leaned on the railing, breathing heavily, where I picked up the bottle and took another drink, hoping it would drown out the thoughts creeping in.

There was a strange sensation in the air now. A heaviness. It felt like the entire field was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I turned to walk back to the house, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw it. The scarecrow was… moving. No, it couldn’t be. I whipped around, my heart racing. But when I turned, it was still there—standing motionless in the field, just as it always had.

I laughed nervously. As my grandma used to say, “You can’t see ghosts because you’re looking too damn hard.” And maybe she was right. Maybe I had been staring too hard at the scarecrow, convincing myself that it was moving. But even as I stood there, shaking my head, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That something—or someone—was watching me.

I took another swig from the bottle, hoping it would numb me. But the dread in my chest only grew heavier. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face again—Sarah, staring at me with that expression of disgust. I could hear her voice, asking why, over and over. And every time, the pain in my knee flared, reminding me of what I had lost.

As I stumbled back to the house, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t over. That the ghosts of my past—Sarah, the farm, the life I had destroyed—weren’t finished with me yet. They were still waiting, still watching, and no matter how much whiskey I drank, I couldn’t escape them.
