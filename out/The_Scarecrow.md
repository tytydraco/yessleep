When I was a kid, we lived in a remote, forgotten corner of the countryside. The kind of place people drive through without ever realizing it's inhabited. Just a gas station and a few rundown shops, swallowed by endless fields. My parents chose this place for reasons I never understood; they worked themselves into early graves, toiling in our cornfields that stretched out forever, disappearing into the horizon. 

As a child, there was something almost magical about the isolation, but as I grew older, that magic curdled into resentment. My sisters and I had to drive an hour west just to get to school, and the day we all left home for good was a liberation. But even more than the isolation, what drove me away was my father’s obsession with scarecrows. He planted them everywhere—every inch of our miles-long fields was dotted with them. I never understood how he managed it, but I swear, there wasn’t a patch of ground without one of those grotesque figures.

They were unlike any scarecrows I'd ever seen. Even now, as an adult, I get chills remembering them. They had an eerie realism to them, a grotesque hyper-detail that made your skin crawl. Their faces were twisted into expressions that seemed almost human—eyes that bulged unnervingly, lips contorted in silent screams. And their bodies... They didn’t stand on poles like normal scarecrows. They were crucified. Their heads hung low, arms spread too wide, legs crossed unnaturally. From their midsections, hay spilled out like entrails, and their long, matted hair dripped black as if soaked in oil. My father always claimed it was just mops he'd dipped in paint, but even as a kid, that explanation never sat right with me.

I was in my second year at the University of Michigan when I got the call from my mother. My father was dead. The news hit me like a punch to the gut, cold fear trickling down my spine. I listened to my mother’s voice crackle through the phone, the words barely registering. But in that moment, all I could think about were those scarecrows. I imagined my father strung up like one of them, crucified in his own field. I shook the image from my mind, chalking it up to grief, to the shock of losing him.

My mother pleaded with us to come home for the funeral. Reluctantly, we agreed. But the day before my flight, my sister called me. Her voice was hushed, trembling, as if speaking too loudly might awaken something. She needed to tell me something—something she’d kept buried for years. I asked if she'd spoken to our other sister, but she said that when she tried, she was shut down, told never to mention it again. With a shaky breath, she began to tell me her secret, and as she spoke, goosebumps prickled my skin.

Back in high school, she’d been looking for a place to throw a party, trying to impress some boy. She remembered an old, abandoned barn our father used when he still raised cattle, a few miles out from our house. One night, she drove out there, thinking everyone at home was asleep. She slipped through the side door, and what she saw inside has haunted her ever since.

She found our father on his knees before an impossibly tall man. The figure's face was shrouded, its hands engulfing our father’s face, fingers long and bony, stretching around his skull like a grotesque cage. She thought—though she couldn’t be sure—that the thing’s head was a swollen, oversized pumpkin, distorted and bulging in ways that shouldn’t be possible. They were chanting something, a low, guttural murmur in a language she didn’t recognize. Before she could process what she was seeing, she heard rustling all around her. Panic seized her, and she bolted for the car, driving away as fast as she could. As she fled, she caught glimpses of tall figures lurking at the edges of the road, and every mile she drove, the scarecrows seemed to turn to follow her.

When she got home, she hid under her covers until morning. She told our other sister about it once, but was met with ridicule and told never to speak of it again. She buried it, until now. The phone call from our mother had unearthed it all, and she was terrified that the scarecrows, or whatever they represented, had something to do with our father’s death. Her voice cracked into a manic laugh as she told me, saying how ridiculous she sounded, but I could hear the fear behind her words. She begged me to convince our mother to come to us instead, to avoid going back to that house. 

Despite how insane it all sounded, I believed her. There was always something wrong with those scarecrows, something unnatural. I called our other sister, telling her everything, urging her to convince our mother to leave that place and never look back. But she lashed out at me, calling us both paranoid. She threatened to cut us out of her life if we didn’t come home for the funeral. 

I was scared, but I didn’t want to lose my sister over it. I began to wonder if maybe we were just being paranoid. Our sister did have a history with psychedelics, after all; maybe it was just some hallucination. I tried to convince myself it was all in our heads, a trick of the mind. But deep down, I knew better.

The night before my flight, I had a nightmare. I found myself in the middle of our cornfield, the stalks towering above me, hemming me in. The sky was a vivid, unnatural blue, too perfect to be real. A trail of red powder stretched before me, leading me on for what felt like hours. Eventually, I reached a clearing, a circle of dead stalks. In the center stood a single stake, a lone scarecrow tied to it. But as I got closer, I realized it wasn’t a scarecrow at all—it was a man, dressed in the ragged clothes of one. I felt a force behind me, unseen hands pushing me toward the figure. As I approached, dread coiled in my gut, and I saw the scarecrow’s face. It was my own.

Suddenly, I felt long, spindly fingers wrap around my shoulders, and I jolted awake, drenched in sweat. I glanced at the clock—late. I scrambled out the door, catching an Uber to the airport just in time. The flight home was a blur of anxiety and unease.

By the time I reached our house, night had fully settled in. I sat in the car, staring at the darkened windows, my heart pounding as I tried to gather the courage to go inside. The house loomed before me, shadows creeping up its walls, giving it an almost sinister presence. 

When I finally stepped through the front door, the heavy silence enveloped me like a shroud. Everyone was inside—my sisters and my mother—but there was something terribly off. My mother looked different. She was gaunt, her skin stretched tight over her bones, and her hair was thin and falling out in clumps. Dark circles hollowed her eyes, which darted nervously, as if seeing things the rest of us couldn’t. 

I asked her what had happened, but she just gave me a strange look, a mix of confusion and annoyance. "I just need some rest," she murmured, her voice distant, like she was speaking through a fog. My sisters exchanged uneasy glances. This wasn’t our mother. She’d always been a strong, sharp woman, but now she seemed like a hollow shell of herself.

Trying to piece together what was going on, I hesitantly asked about our father. I expected to hear he was at the morgue, but her answer sent a chill down my spine. "He's tucked away somewhere safe," she said with a flat, emotionless tone. The words hung in the air like a bad smell. My sisters and I stared at each other, alarmed. Something was very wrong.

Our mother, seeming almost irritated by our concern, abruptly decided she was tired and wanted to go to bed. She shuffled off to her room without another word. My oldest sister tried to downplay it, suggesting that maybe she was just in shock. She excused herself to her old bedroom, leaving me and my other sister alone at the kitchen table, surrounded by the oppressive silence of the house.

I put on a pot of coffee, knowing neither of us would be able to sleep that night. We tried to distract ourselves, talking about funny memories from our childhood. She told me about the time she broke into an animal shelter to “rescue” a dog that was already lined up for a home, and I recounted the embarrassing story of how I got into my frat. Somehow, as the night wore on, we ended up finding one of Dad’s old liquor cabinets and spiking our coffee with whiskey. We played childish pranks on each other, laughing more than we had in years, but beneath it all, there was a tension, a fear we couldn’t shake.

Eventually, the conversation drifted back to that night she saw. Hesitantly, I asked if she remembered taking any drugs—maybe shrooms or something? She shook her head, her eyes haunted. “I was sober,” she said quietly, her voice trembling. “I hadn’t touched anything in months.” She didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and I didn’t push. We ended up falling asleep on the couch around midnight, the unease settling over us like a blanket.

I woke up suddenly with a pounding headache. The clock read five in the morning, but it was still pitch dark outside. Winter in this part of the country meant the sun wouldn’t rise for another hour, and sometimes it felt like it never came up at all. I stumbled to the bathroom, my footsteps echoing in the silent house. As I stood there, I felt a sudden chill, a cold so sharp it cut through the whiskey fog in my head. I spun around, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was nothing—just shadows.

Shaking off the eerie feeling, I walked back to the living room, but my sister was gone. I assumed she must’ve gone to her old bedroom to sleep more comfortably, so I decided to do the same. But when I entered my room, I noticed the window was wide open. The freezing night air rushed in, biting at my skin.

As I moved to close it, something outside caught my eye, and my blood ran cold. There, near the edge of the cornfield, I saw my sister standing, her figure illuminated by the dim moonlight. She was staring into the dark rows of corn as if contemplating stepping inside. I whispered her name, hoping to catch her attention without waking anyone else, but she didn’t respond. I grabbed a pen from my desk and tossed it toward her, missing completely, but the slight noise made her turn her head, just a fraction. I saw her face, blank and distant, her eyes locked on something unseen.

A sickening fear gripped me, rooting me in place. My legs felt heavy, paralyzed by a dread I couldn’t fully understand. I knew I had to help her, but I couldn’t move. I forced myself to turn away and crept to our other sister’s room, whispering her name. No response. I called out a little louder, but still, she didn’t stir. This was strange—she was always such a light sleeper. 

I reached out to shake her awake, and as I touched her shoulder, she rolled over. I recoiled in horror. Her face... her face was horrifyingly disfigured, shriveled and sunken like a dried-out husk. Her eyes were hollow pits, her mouth agape in a silent scream. I stumbled backward, my own scream clawing up my throat. What was this? What had happened to her?

I started pinching myself, praying to wake up from this nightmare, but nothing changed. Panic surged through me as I remembered my mother. I ran to her room, every instinct in my body screaming at me to stop, to turn back. But I pushed on. 

When I burst into her room, I saw her standing by the window, staring out into the darkness, her posture unnaturally stiff. She didn’t turn around, didn’t acknowledge me at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I took a step closer, my voice barely a whisper. "Mom?" 

She didn’t move, just kept staring out into the night. And then, in a voice that wasn’t hers, a voice that was cold and empty, she spoke. "They're waiting for us.”

Chills ran down my spine, and I could barely force out a few words. I asked her, “Who?” but she didn’t turn around. She just kept staring out into the night, unmoving, her body stiff and unnatural. That was when I knew I had to get out of there. Whatever was left of my family was gone, replaced by something unrecognizable, something inhuman. I was alone now, and I had to escape before whatever had taken them got to me, too.

I bolted from the house, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t dare look back as I sprinted to my rental car, fumbling with the keys in my panic. As soon as I got the door open, I jumped in, started the engine, and sped off into the darkness, the house disappearing in my rearview mirror.

A month has passed since that night, but the horror still clings to me like a shadow. I thought I had escaped, but last week, the local authorities came to see me. They told me my mother and my sister were both dead. I tried to tell them everything I knew, about the scarecrows, the barn, the man with the pumpkin head, but they looked at me like I was crazy. Of course, they didn’t believe me. They suspected it was me who had hurt them, but they had no evidence to prove it. When I asked about my other sister, they said there was no trace of her, as if she had simply vanished off the face of the earth. They said the search could take months, maybe years, but they were doing everything they could.

But I know better. I know where she is. She’s in that cornfield, trapped in whatever darkness took my mother. I can still see her standing there, on the edge of the rows, looking lost, looking empty. It haunts me, knowing that she’s out there, and whatever possessed my mother has her now, too. I don’t know if I will ever see her again, but I know that whatever was out there that night is still out there, waiting, watching. And as long as I’m alive, I’ll never be free of it.

The only escape is death. Maybe if I end my own life, I can break free from this nightmare. Maybe I’d be giving in to whatever it wants, but at least I won’t have to be here to see it anymore. At least I won’t have to live with the fear. I’m so tired of being afraid. Goodbye.
