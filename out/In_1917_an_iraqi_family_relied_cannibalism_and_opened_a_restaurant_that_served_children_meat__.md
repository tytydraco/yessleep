abod and Khajawa were a poor Iraqi couple from Mosul ( A state in iraq ) When Mosul faced a severe famine, they first ate cats the husband would hunt them down and the wife cooks it and they eat it. After that they couldn't find more cats so they relied on dogs, and after a while there were no more dogs.

The wife discussed with her husband to try human meat which the husband agreed, they knew a old lady across the street and invited her for dinner, once she came she was killed by the husband and he gave the wife the body so she can cook it. However, they did not like its taste due to the high fat content of its meat and they threw up all the time.

The wife then asked the husband to try and kidnap kids to eat their meat, the husband brought a kid and the wife cooked it and ate the human head which she very liked. 

The couple then decided to open restaurant that serves children meat, without anyone knowing they opened it and the prices were cheap, people were eating everyday because it tasted good and the prices weren't high. 

That continued for a couple months until a coincidence happened and they were exposed, police went to their home and saw a big hole filled with human bones and nearly a 100 skull, they took the couple to court, and the wife collapsed and confessed to the judge the crimes she and her husband had committed.

And here is the trial which was posted by a turkish magazine in that time : 

The judge : How did u come up with this work?

The wife : We were hungry and endured hunger to an unbearable extent during the siege, so we finally agreed to eat cats, and that is what happened, and we continued to hunt them and eat them until they ran out, so we started to eat dogs and they ran out too, and their meat was tastier and more delicious than the meat of cats, so we tried eating human flesh.

The judge : with whom did u start first ?

We strangled an old woman and cooked her in a large pot, but we spent the whole night vomiting because her meat was so fatty. Then we slaughtered a young boy and found his meat to be very delicious and good.

The judge: How did u catch the boys?

Through our son, he would bring one every day with the excuse of playing with him, so we would strangle him, eat him, and bury his bones in a deep hole we had dug inside our house.

The judge : how many children did u eat ?

The wife : i don't remember but they can be counted by counting the skulls in the hole.


The court sentenced abod and his wife to death by hanging. On the morning of the execution, the couple rode two donkeys and were led to Bab al-Tob Square, where two gallows were set up for them. The crowds of people waiting to hang the murderous spat on them, cursed them, and beat them. Abod responded by cursing the people in returb, cursing the government, which he considered responsible for what had happened. People gathered in the square to witness their hanging. It is said that a woman bit off one of the wife’s toes until she ripped it from her feet and cried out, “They have eaten three of my children.”
