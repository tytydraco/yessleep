Three major transformations have taken place in the process of my metamorphosis. 

The first is when I was created.

The second is when I was killed.

And the third is when I was resurrected.

In the park near where I was raised stands a tree that never wears leaves. Its bark is bone and its face a melancholic totem. When I was alive I used to press my ear against the lips and listen to voices. It sounded like inside was a long, hollow tunnel with sounds echoing up from below. 

When I say that I was created, but I don’t use the term correctly. Nothing is ever created, only recycled. We grow, we blossom, we whither. In the end we become food for the plants from which we feed. We give seeds back to the earth.

Seeds grow up in search of a way out. But they don’t realize they’re seeds, they think they are the plant. And as they grow they don’t know that their journey will end in bloom, they think that it will end in darkness. That the only thing there is of the world are worms and dirt. 

They only realize the truth when they bud out and open their faces to the suns. Like a newborn taking its first breath of air with lungs. In the end they give seeds back, imbued with a new potential of their own. This is how I was given to the world. Another seed dying from the moment of my birth.

My father fainted that day. Not from joy, but because he was convinced that I wasn’t his son. His eyes were brown, my mother’s eyes were brown. The eyes of their parents and their parents’ parents have all been brown. 

The eyes I was given were not of a color that I, or anybody around me know. Sometimes they appeared more blue, more green, more gray, or yellow. Some people said that when they caught the light of the sun at just the right moment they could see a crystalline wheel of different shades orbiting each other. Whenever anyone took a photograph two demonic flames burned into the image of me where they were supposed to be. 

Only three people have said that my eyes were purple. The first was a born again nun from the Blue Forest. They say she used to pray to the trees before she was converted. She came to see me on behalf of the Church when I was nine. I still remember her face. I had never found such a lack of certainty in an adult before. I felt fear for the first time in this life. “Those eyes!”, she said “Those big purple eyes!”. 

She incanted the words over and over again, until my father dragged her away and threw her from our house. After he had warded her from the door he left to get some air. The next day she renounced her position and returned to the Blue Forest. 

Later on my mother would only remember this as an expression of adoration. I never bothered correcting her. Never bothered telling her that above all there was grief in those words and nothing adoring at all. I’m sure that she and all of us in the room felt it at least for the moment. Including my father. 

He’s still out getting air and that used to make her very lonely. Most days she let me skip school, or picked me up early. I slept in the warmth of her arms. No windows opened, no curtains. No new sheets, just old piles of clothes and the warm shower’s steam. 

She was inside the bathroom with the door locked longer and longer. Her skin got dry and started to peel. She was coming out with yellow bruises and open cuts. Sometimes she liked to press on them as hard as she could. 

She masked it all in makeup. I thought she looked different and I always tried to tell her how pretty she was without it on. She smiled at me like you smile at a child who tells you about seeing a fairy in a stranger’s garden. 

Gaps in my knowledge were catching up and school only got harder. Every year my teachers wanted more. They kept on trying to get me to stay for full weeks, but in the end there was only so much they could do. 

When my grades came back my mother swore that she would stop picking me up from now on. I always knew it wouldn’t be long before the barrenness of the house overcame her conviction. 

But that never stopped her from trying to discipline me. First it was a slap and maybe a few punches if I talked back. Then that wasn’t all soon enough. My back formed an arch, it took as much as a sharp gust of wind to get me to flinch in fear. 

But I was growing, breaking from my seed’s shell and reaching for a path out of the soil. I don’t know if either of us understood how much taller I had become. Until the day I lifted my shoulders.

She was still setting a table of three for dinner. The head was always empty with a full plate that she refused to throw away. 

That night I just started crying. My tears began to sear and I shrieked at her until my voice broke. I sat in his chair. 

First I told myself, then I told her. “He’s gone and he’s never coming back”. I took a bite from his food and suddenly it felt as though I was free. About to begin life again. I raised my back up.

But on her face I saw how my words wounded her heart. 

“It was your purple eyes that forced him away”. She said. 

Since I came back some of the most bothersome questions that I find myself constantly pursued by are ‘How is it that you rose to life?’, ‘How do you get to live forever?’ And by that people really mean: ‘How can I come to life?’, ‘How can I live forever?’ So in this account I’ve decided to finally give my answer to the question. Because it is very possible and the way to do it is more simple than you all may think. 

All you have to do to never die is keep yourself away from anything that might bring you Death. By that I don’t mean to say that you should avoid anything that might kill you. Despite our common misconception, how people die is not actually what Death is. They are the ways that he shows himself, but they are not him. 

Death is the owner of that hand that draws you out from the ground to the sun. But you will never have to face the sun if you don’t follow that hand. Death can only draw you out if you grow. So then all you have to do is just never grow. 

Growth is nurtured by the guidance of lessons. Lessons are learned in the act of Living. The only real way to prevent Death is to stop Living. 

She buried me under the tree that spoke to me. She must have known me better than I thought to remember that this used to be my favorite place. What I have trouble understanding is how she couldn’t live with the guilt but never told a soul what she did, or where I was before she left herself bleeding out in the bathtub. And I won’t ever know. All I have now are old newspapers and new gossip about ghosts that kidnapped a young man and killed his mother.

You will notice that there are two phases of my life I won’t describe. Before I was born and after I was killed. Even if I was able to explain it in terms that you could understand, I would be doing something very wrong. There are some things that you are just not supposed to remember until you return to them. 

So I still can’t be sure why my presence in this world has not torn it apart yet. I rose up out from beneath the tree, choking on the air in my lungs. 

I wandered around the park for a while, trying to remember myself. Bits and pieces came back with a sting across my stomach. My body hasn’t aged since I returned and I don’t think that the wound ever will either. 

Everybody watched me horrified and clenching their noses. Eventually there was an old man. He walked me to my mother’s funeral and sat down beside me in the church after it was over. 

He put his hand on my chest and said “Your heart’s not beating”. Then he stared at me like you stare at an old photograph of a loved one long dead. 

We stayed there for a while and he seemed like he was waiting. Then he seemed like he realized that whoever he was waiting for wasn’t going to show up. He said “I should have never wished away your purple eyes”. Then he ran away again. I knelt back down in front of the Fountain of Christ’s Blood. And I stared back with empty eyes. Eyes blacker than the night sky.
