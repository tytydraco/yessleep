This summer I went on a road trip to visit my uncle for a couple days. His name is Jason and my name is Jaron. We are known for having the same soundalike of our names which is what we have always joked about and bonded over.

Anyways, he lives out on a nice farmstead with lots of land. I wouldn’t call it in the middle of nowhere, but it’s definitely not the city, that’s for sure. 

The house has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, so a modern sized house. Just so you have a little more understanding and visualisation of this property.

It all started off with him asking me which room I wanted to stay in and I didn’t care so I said “How about the middle one over there.” I pointed and it was something about the way he responded to what I had said. 

He just kinda had a blank look on his face like something bad is in that room and he is hiding something. It was just a very weird response and it definitely weirded me out, not really creepy though, it’s a feeling that is hard to explain.

But it was about a 10 second stare of ultimate horror in his eyes like he has seen a ghost until he responded by saying, “Ok, middle one is fine, let me just make sure that everything is set and ready to go for you in that room, just wait right here and I will be right back kiddo.” 

“Ok, sounds good” I responded. As I was waiting there in his house patiently, my attention shifted as I heard the ticking of a clock on his wall. The clock was in the shape of a rooster and the hands of the clock were pistols. I found this really cool since I never have seen a clock like that before. 

I hear shuffling from the middle room and am starting to grow with impatience, so I just simply say, “Is everything ok in there, unc?” The shuffling noise suddenly stops and I hear a growling noise in response. I know that he doesn’t have any dogs or pets to make such a noise, so by hearing this I am obviously weirded out, but again not creeped out because I am thinking this is some joke or prank or whatever he is pulling on me.

So laughing in return I just wait longer not really caring how long he takes, just tired and wanting to lay down after the little road trip. 

That’s when it hit me, the other rooms are opened right now and I can lay down in them. I walk over to the one upstairs of the house and creep into the room. The door creaked very loudly and it startled me for a second.

Walking into the room I notice that the floor has these weird stains on them. They are dark in their color, so I just thought it was mud or something from my uncle hunting or working outside, in the country it gets pretty dirty, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was just simply mud.

But obviously not wanting to sleep in a room that has stains on the ground, I head downstairs and get jump scared by unc standing behind the staircase. He says, “have fun up there.” Which I respond with, “I just went to the bathroom, that’s all.” Being weirded out by him saying, “having fun” my train of thought gets taken away by uncle saying, “come on kid, let’s go for a ride, I know a spot, it will be fun!”

“Ok” I respond in an amused tone. Not really was looking for it since it’s just the usual hunting up by the woods that we do as a tradition. But this time, this time… was different. 

Unc drove us by this pond. This weird and surreal looking pond. He sees me with this weirded out expression on my face and says, “what’s wrong?” I say in response, “nothing is wrong I am fin…” but my response is cut short by my uncles image.

His eyes are bloodshot red and his teeth are rotten. Blood is dripping down his nose and his smile is something straight out of a horror movie. “You are scaring me Jason! Please stop.” 

“It’s ok, you have always been my favourite nephew after all.” After he says this he starts crying hysterically and hands me a piece of paper that he kept stored in his right pocket, a newspaper. The date published on this newspaper is July 17, 2018. 

“10 year old girl found dead in pond after being reported missing for over a century” reads the newspaper headline. I am shocked by this and ask him why he has this and if this is the pond. 

“YES! IT IS THE FUCKING POND! DO YOU NOT REALIZE WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!” He screams at me continuining to cry hysterically.

He pulls out a pistol from the glove compartment on my side and aims it at his head. “DRIVE THIS FUCKING CAR INTO THE POND OR I WILL FUCKING KILL MYSELF!” He says while laughing like a fucking lunatic.

“Who the hell are you?! You sick bastard!” I say with a shaky voice. I am both on the verge of tears but also built up with rage.

I do the unthinkable and drive the car into the pond. While in the water sinking, unc hands me Polaroid pictures and what I see is absolutely spine chilling.

Guts, bodies, eyes gouged out, and the worst one of all… my own mother’s body, cut up and served on a plate. THIS SICK BASTARD ATE MY FUCKING MOTHER AND HIS OWN SISTER! She was murdered when I was only 8 years old and they never caught who did it. I guess now I fucking know who did! My OWN FUCKING UNCLE!!!

In a pit of rage I take the pistol he just had pointed to his head and shoot him point blank at his dead. His brains spill out in a gruesome scene. I escape the sinking car by breaking open the windshield and swim to the top only to find his brains are floating right beside me. 

Suddenly, I feel a strong sensation pull me down below the water. I can’t out swim it and it pulls me down so far where everything starts getting black. I am drowning and can hear my own voice gurgling with death. 

Then it was just silence and complete pitch blackness.

But then I wake up in my bed. It is 1 in the afternoon and I had slept in. “Oh honey you must of had a nightmare” my mom’s voice says. “But mom, what about the gun, what about the room, what about the pond, what about you! YOU SHOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW!” 

“Oh honey! What are you talking about!” I am shaking and crying at this point and mother reaches out and gives me a hug to console me. While hugging me warm and comforting, she creeps up to my ear and whispers something in my ear. 

“Uncle wants to visit you this summer.”
