I need to tell you all about the events that took place in this house that killed my husband. Everything was normal for a few days, until I started seeing things, entities running all over our house. One night I heard it speak to me as I was laying by my husband.

"*Run. Run. Run. Run.*" They whispered all around me and I couldn't move or scream. I cried, hoping my husband would see me, I look through the corner of my eye but husband wasn't there, I look forward and there he was, In clothes, with a broken jaw, missing eyes, pale, blueish skin. It was drooling, and it's fingers were black, this was not my husband.

"*Run. Run. Run. Run.*" It immediately began to charge and I was finally able to get up and scream, my husband jumps up, screaming, wondering what happened. I could barely speak and he had to comfort me the remaining night, ever since then I refused to sleep in the house, I slept in our car. My husband decided to take a trip for dinner and we would go back home.

But when it was home time I drove around the same area for hours, purposely, avoiding but never leaving. This was our home. I had a nasty feeling about tonight, as if I would not see my husband again.

"I want to go home Angel, I'm tired." Jake says exhaustingly. I can't go back, that house is dangerous. It's a built form of a siren.

"It's dangerous in there, you don't understand." I mumbled incoherently.

"The only thing dangerous here is the person driving who has had little to no sleep! Stop the car I'm going inside."

I look at my eyes in the rearview mirror, sunken, bags that look purple, almost like bruises, my skin pale. I didn't want him to go. I can't let my husband die in that house, I stop the car and weakly tug on his shirt, forcing him to face me.

"Please," I begged quietly, "please don't go Jake, I don't want you to be next please." I continued to beg but he looked at me with pity and disgust, forcing my hands off of him and he gets out of the car.

"You need a god damn doctor Angel, I'm sick of this shit." He says slamming the doors behind him. I just watched as he walks in, I cried silently knowing I would be losing the love of my life forever. The door shuts behind him, I step out, running towards the door, banging on it.

"Jake! Jake come out please, I'm sorry!" no answer, "We can go to a hotel! Get a new house, just come out please!" But he didn't listen, didn't make a sound. I banged on the door begging, praying, crying. Slowly the door opened by itself, it was dark, no light shown except for what the full moon provided, "Jake?" I called in a quiet shaky voice.

"I told you," He said distant, ominously, "The house... is fine... Angel come with me." But that wasn't my Jake, my eyes slowly adjust, seeing a figure, that looked like jake. It was staring at me, but the shadows consumed it's face, preventing me from seeing what it looked like. It was drooling, and it's fingers were black, "It's warm in here, come on." It didn't sound like him. I knew exactly what this thing was.

"You're not Jake," I cried silently taking a few steps back slowly, away from the door, "You're not Jake!" I yelled, falling backwards as this thing, stood at the door way, with a broken jaw, missing eyes, pale and blueish skin.

"Angel come on." He became more aggressive, "Get in the house you fucking bitch." My eyes grew wide, "You're acting psychotic, get in the damn house!" And then it made a wailing noise, so loud, I could still hear it, while covering my ears. I screamed and ran to my car, driving far away, still hearing the wailing, still seeing Jakes distorted face and body.

Jakes dead. The house... killed Jake.

Anyone who is out there, please, if you see this crooked, old house, please, do not take it. Do not move in, do not step inside. I am begging you strangers, Don't do this, save yourself.
