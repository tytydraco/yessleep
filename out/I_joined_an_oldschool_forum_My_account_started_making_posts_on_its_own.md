Not to sound old, but the internet used to be a lot smaller. Now, you can find pretty much the nichest communities you could think of and still have several thousand people in each group. But back then, you were lucky if you found a handful of others who were into the same things as you. That's what started my search for another website to chat and meet others. Reddit, TikTok, Discord- none of them have that same sort of old-school charm that those forums did.

In my search, most of them were either inactive, shut down, or riddled with porn ads and spam bots. Just as hope for the perfect forum was starting to dwindle, I found one. It was buried three pages deep in a forum thread titled "Social media sites that feel like 2008 again", and that's where I saw it. A simple link with the name "EchPost". Clicking on the link, I was brought to a site reminiscent of Myspace and 2000s-era Xanga sites. The background was a faded grey wallpaper, with the rest of the page having a white background. It had a banner at the top advertising itself as "the internet's most private forum" and a place to sign up with your email.

It had all of the basic features of a forum, such as making posts, private messaging, a profile page, and so on. Best yet? Posts were being made every few minutes. Miraculously, the forum was still active and had an impressive number of people, all with usernames and profiles of their own. After creating my account in a painfully slow process (I guess that's the price to pay for nostalgia), I started exploring the website, seeing who was on and what kinds of things people talked about. I was glad to find that there wasn't much toxicity and that people were genuinely just looking to chat.

The first few days of using EchoPost were fun. I had real, meaningful discussions with people, and because there weren't enough users to drown out my voice, I was able to be heard in the community. It was a great place to be, and everyone seemed to agree.

Then, I got a comment notification.

It was midnight, and I was just heading to sleep before I decided to take one last look at EchoPost. I wasn't used to getting comments, as I barely posted at all, and reading the contents of the message, I was confused.

jellyboy: damn, sounds scary.

My eyebrows furrowed in confusion. What was scary? I tried recalling any of my past posts, but none talked about anything that could be considered creepy. As I went to the post in question, though, my blood froze.

jhn\_matthews: I think I just heard something outside my window. It might've been an animal or something. It keeps skittering on the roof. My house is pretty old, and the wood creaks a lot. I'm just hoping it's an opossum or something.

Posted: 12:03 AM, April 3rd.

Making sure I wasn't losing my mind, I checked my date. 11:58 PM, April 2nd. I ran my fingers through my hair, bringing my phone closer and further as if it was a problem with my sight. I refreshed, closed my phone, and opened it again. But no matter how hard I tried to deny the truth, the words didn't change.

The post was dated for the next day. A day I had yet to live.

I turned off my phone and closed my eyes, willing myself to sleep. I couldn't afford to worry about things like that, especially not when I had a test coming up the next day.

Something outside my window skittered.

My eyes shot open. I sat up and listened, trying to catch any other sounds. Sure enough, I heard something scratching on my roof. I opened my phone to confirm what I already knew.

12:03 AM.

I stayed awake the entire night, cycling between restlessly tossing in bed and refreshing EchoPost like it might suddenly make sense. I wasn't sure what I expected to find or what would suddenly explain everything that had happened thus far, but I held on for hope. Nothing came of the sound, and after approaching the window and slamming on the glass, I saw a small moving shadow scurry away, belonging to a small animal.

That wasn't what I was worried about, of course, but... I had to focus on school. I couldn't let myself be distracted by things like this, no matter how much I wanted to. My mind flooded with rationalizations filled with holes and explanations riddled with inconsistencies. I was just seeing things. Someone hacked my account and posted it themselves. I posted it and just forgot. My time was off.

That made the following day easier to digest.

Another notification. This time, right before my test. I argued with myself over checking it, knowing that it would probably send my mind spiraling and ruin my test. But I had to check. Just to make sure.

jhn\_matthews: Did shit on the test. Didn't help that I couldn't sleep last night.

Posted: 1:30 PM, April 3rd.

Again, the time was wrong, nearly 2 hours off this time, and I was certain I didn't write this. Naturally, when the test started, I could barely concentrate. My eyes kept darting to the clock, my thoughts were preoccupied by the posts, and the material itself hurt to think about. I handed in the paper, knowing failure was imminent. I don't know why I didn't uninstall the app right there, but I was curious. Scared, but curious. If the posts really were being made from the future, then I should have been able to see things before they happened. Maybe I could use it to my advantage, I thought.

The following days, the posts kept going. Many of the things it predicted were mundane and useless, like the time I woke up or what I ate for breakfast, which, in hindsight, would have been fine. I tried testing it, like when a post stated I burnt food in the microwave. Instead, I opted to go out for dinner... Only for the meal I ordered to come out burnt, regardless, and for the post to be immediately edited to fit what I had done instead.

Hell, even when I forgot to bring my phone with me to class, I came back to several posts detailing all of the thoughts and actions I had had while away. No matter what I did, it was recorded in the post before I even did it. At that point, it seemed more like a journal than a prediction. I couldn't use it to prepare for anything because it changed and adapted to what I did. Truth be told, the fear and paranoia faded, leaving only frustration. There was no point in having this app, not for its social aspects (I was too distracted by the posts anyway), and definitely not for its so-called “psychic” abilities.

My thumb hovered over the "uninstall" button, having had enough of the stress that was being caused by the constant notifications and the inability to change anything. My finger inched toward the screen—then a notification popped up.

jhn\_matthews: "I think something is following me."

Posted: 2:37 PM.

As I looked at the time, it changed from 2:36 to 2:37. I froze, but the sound of footsteps continued for just a few seconds behind me before stopping. I whipped around, seeing no one. But the footsteps had sounded so close, so distinct. When I entered the app again, I was bombarded with notifications.

jhn\_matthews: "I'm running now. I feel like I'm being chased. I swear to fucking god if someone is following me I'm calling the cops."

jhn\_matthews: "There's nowhere to fucking go. I hear it following me, and it's catching up."

jhn\_matthews: "I'm back home, and I know I locked all the doors, but I can hear it moving in my hallway."

jhn\_matthews: "I barricaded the door, but it's still trying to get in."

jhn\_matthews: "I'm starting to see the wood splinter. I can hear its breathing."

jhn\_matthews: "Something's coming through."

jhn\_matthews: "It got me."

Posted: 7:42 PM.

I read the last post over and over, trying to process it. This one was set several hours in the future. I was still outside. I could still avoid it. I didn't need to go home. Maybe that's what would save me.

But then I was reminded of the burnt food, and I realized that the same would happen here. No matter where I went, no matter what I tried to do, the posts would update. I would die. The best thing I could do would be to at least go down fighting. I rushed home, arming myself with a kitchen knife. I didn't need to check the posts to know that it updated to reflect this. And as soon as I got home, the doors locked themselves, trapping me inside the house.

I've been holding out for hours now.

It's 7:00 PM when I'm writing this. I've barricaded myself in my room and armed myself with a knife. The footsteps are getting closer, but I don't think it's noticed me yet. No, that only happens at 7:23. My mind is running a hundred miles an hour, trying to think of anything I could possibly do to delay or stop this. And I know that no matter what I try, I’m going to die at 7:42. Nothing changes that. The knife in my left hand feels slippery in my clammy hands, and as I look down, its handle glistens in sweat.

The worst part about all of this?

Every time I check that final post, I'm haunted by 5 thumbs down reactions at the bottom of it. I'm about to fucking die and I'm being downvoted for it.
