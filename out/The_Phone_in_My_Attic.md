I guess you could say I haven’t really slept the past few nights. Not properly. Not restfully.

I work long shifts at a grocery store during the day, mostly on the register, and sometimes stocking shelves when we’re short. In the evenings I help out as a teaching assistant. After that, I usually just lie in bed and scroll Reddit until I’m too tired to keep my eyes open.

But lately, something else has been happening. Something that’s been interrupting what little sleep I was managing to get.

For the past four nights, at exactly 3:00 AM, this alarm goes off. It lasts for about ten seconds, but it cuts in and out in this weird on-off pattern. And every time, it sounds like it’s coming from somewhere above me.

At first I figured it had to be something explainable. A pipe. A neighbor. Maybe just my brain glitching from being so tired. But the sound felt real. It had weight to it. Like it didn’t belong in my house.

I kept ignoring it, telling myself it would stop, or that maybe it was just something I’d imagined in that weird space between waking and dreaming.

But last night, I finally decided to check.

I’ve never actually been in the attic since moving here. It’s just one of those things you forget about once you settle in. I assumed it was small, maybe just insulation and cobwebs.

When 3:00 AM came, the sound started again. That same chopped-up alarm, echoing from above. I pulled a chair over, yanked down the attic hatch, and climbed up.

There was no lightbulb up there, so I used the flashlight on my phone. The space was dusty, cramped, full of that old, dry smell like unopened books and forgotten furniture.

And then I saw it.

Sitting right in the middle of the attic floor was a phone.

It looked old. Really old. One of those heavy rotary kinds with the curled cord and faded olive green plastic. The kind of phone you’d see in a World War II movie.

And it was ringing.

Without thinking, I picked it up.

At first, there was just silence. Then I heard breathing. Shaky, strained, like someone gasping through a wet cloth. After a few seconds, a voice started counting.

“9… 8… 7… 6…”

The voice was rough and uneven. Like each number took all the energy they had to speak. It was slow, too. Each second felt like it dragged out longer than the last.

“5… 4… 3…”

I slammed the receiver back down and climbed down the ladder in a panic. My hands were shaking. My legs barely worked. I didn’t want to hear what came next.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I just sat there, staring at the ceiling. The next day, I didn’t go to work. I didn’t tutor. I didn’t even go on Reddit to unwind. I just waited.

I needed to know if it would happen again.

But when 3:00 AM rolled around, nothing happened. No sound. No alarm.

Still, I had to check. I had to make sure I hadn’t imagined the whole thing.

I went back up into the attic.

The phone was still there. Exactly where it had been the night before. Same color, same spot, same thick layer of dust underneath it.

But now I noticed something else.

There was no cord. No power source. No phone jack. No plug.

It wasn’t connected to anything.

I just stood there staring at it for a long time, like if I waited long enough, it might start ringing again.

It didn’t.

Eventually I came back down. Tried to sleep. Couldn’t.

But when I walked into my bedroom this morning, I noticed something I know wasn’t there before.

Sitting neatly on my nightstand… was the receiver.

Just the receiver. The rest of the phone still upstairs.

And next to it, scratched into the wood, were the numbers: “2… 1”

I haven’t touched it. I haven’t moved. I just keep staring at it from across the room like it might blink or whisper or ring again.

My cat keeps staring at the receiver. Which is weird because I don’t have a cat. Not anymore.

I don’t know what happens when it reaches zero. I don’t know if it’s a ghost, or if something’s messing with me, or if I’ve finally lost my mind from sleep deprivation. I don’t know if I should call a priest, a therapist, or just leave the house and never come back.

If anyone out there has any idea what this might be or what I should do next… please tell me.

Because tonight is day five. And I think it’s going to hit zero.
