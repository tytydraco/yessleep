The cop that pulled me over was a complete dickhead.

I couldn't figure out what he'd pulled me over for, so I was sitting in the car and waiting for him to walk up and knock on my window. Hell, I was even debating the whole "crack the window a little slit to pass the license through and say nothing" routine I'd seen on YouTube.

I didn't get the chance.

"SHOW ME YOUR HANDS AND GET OUT OF YOUR CAR!" A voice amplified by a bullhorn shouted from behind me.

I jumped in my seat, and couldn't decide whether to obey or not. Was this dude being for real?

"SHOW ME YOUR HANDS AND GET OUT OF YOUR CAR!" The cop repeated, bringing to mind the image of a red-faced bloated man who didn't want to bother getting his fat ass out of his car.

With the rearview mirror, I tried to confirm my mental image, but it was too dark out to see. The sun had just set moments ago.

Another police car rolled up behind the first, lights shining in every direction. Great, make it a party.

I sighed when I realized I was going to have to comply, no matter how stupid it was.

"GET. OUT. NOW." The cop screeched, his speaker producing feedback. That made me pause. Dude sounded... panicked. The hell?

I breathed to calm myself, then slowly moved to the door handle and gently pushed. I guided the door open hesitantly. I actually started to get scared that I'd get shot in the arm if this idiot panicked any harder.

Once the door was fully open, I put both hands out so they were visible and put a foot down on the pavement.

"NICE AND SLOW," the asshole behind the bullhorn commanded. I resisted an urge to flip the bird.

When both feet were planted on the pavement, I stood painstakingly slowly. So slow that my thighs burned with the effort, but I did *not* want to risk getting shot.

"PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD, FACE ME, AND WALK TOWARD MY CAR," the voice instructed. I could see the other officers getting out of the second car and posing behind their open car doors, guns drawn but not aimed. Yet.

What the *fuck* was happening?

I tucked my hands behind my head and took one gradual step toward the spotlight that was directed right in my eyes.

"KEEP COMING," the bullhorn screeched with feedback.

I absently noticed the traffic slowing down as it passed me. The rubberneckers reducing their speed, probably hoping they'd get to see me shot so they could go home and tell their family about the "incident" on the highway.

When I got to the front of the car, the cops in the second car shut their door and approached, guns pointed down but still at the ready.

"KEEP YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD AND GET ON YOUR KNEES," the bullhorn instructed, now so loud it took everything in me not to flinch and cover my ears.

"Stop with the--" I started to complain, but saw the expressions of the approaching officers. My voice, already weak, trailed off.

I got down on one knee, then the other.

Once I was in position, the two officers rushed at me. One guy tucked his gun away and produced handcuffs, while the other kept his distance, gun still at the ready.

The officer was rough with the cuffs. Slapped them on my wrist and I yelped when the metal hit bone.

"Get down. On your stomach," the officer demanded loudly, pushing me from behind. I had no choice but to fall and catch my chin on the pavement. I couldn't catch myself with the cuffs restricting me.

I lifted my head, trying to see what was going on. I heard the two officers behind me talking. I heard two soft beeps.

"Good?"

"Yeah, I'm good."

"You fucking piece of shit," the officer whispered, then punched me in the side. My breath left my body and I tried to suck in air. None came. My lungs spasmed, trying to draw in air.

"You're fucking disgusting, and if I could, I'd shoot you dead right here, in the street. I'd leave your body to rot on the side of the road. You hear me? You're nothing. You're going to get the death penalty, and I'll smile when you die."

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't respond. Couldn't ask what in the *fuck* this moron was going on about. Couldn't declare that this was a mistake. They had the wrong guy. My brain raced, trying to find some reasonable explanation.

Maybe the first officer had mistyped my license plate? Put in a 1 instead of an l. And they think I'm some kind of wanted murderer.

That has to be it.

So, I clung to that theory. This would all be over soon. They'd have to formally apologize. The body cam footage would go viral. I'd be exonerated.

Suddenly, four more beeps appeared. That's when I realized what the sound was.

The body cams. They'd turned them off, attacked me, then turned them back on.

*Shit.*

"Stand up, please."

My spine turned to ice. The tone had changed completely. He was going to pretend he hadn't touched me. Hadn't just whispered in my ear that he was excited for me to die.

A routine traffic stop suddenly had me wondering what was going to happen next. If my life had already ended, I just didn't know it yet.

The officer helped me to my feet, though I was still struggling to breathe properly. He guided me over to the back door of the first police car and had me lean my stomach against the window.

He patted me down, pulling my phone and wallet out of my pants, along with a water-logged receipt I didn't realize was in my back pocket and had gone through the wash god-knows how many times. He announced each find out loud and laid them on the roof of the car. The second officer had put away his gun and was watching from behind.

The officer who had used the bullhorn to get me out of my car remained in his seat, talking on his radio and clicking away at his laptop.

I had a smug confirmation that he was obese as fuck, like I'd imagined.

When the officer had finished going over my body, even removing my shoes and checking inside, he came over and leaned against the car, tilting his head into my line of sight.

"Sir, do you consent to a search of your vehicle?"

I was still experiencing whiplash from his change of tone and character, and it took me a few seconds to respond. My voice was unsteady due to the wind being knocked out of me.

"No, I do not consent to any searches."

"Well, we have a warrant to search your vehicle anyway, so we don't need your permission. Are we going to find anything incriminating in there?"

I had the sense to keep my mouth shut.

"Is it your vehicle?"

I kept my mouth shut.

The officer sighed, as if *I* were the one being belligerent.

"Okay, Officer Rodrick in the car here will provide you with a copy of the warrant. We're going to start our search now."

With that, he produced some gloves from a pocket, rolled them onto his hands, walked to my car, yanked open the back driver's side door, and started digging through my wrappers and junk mail.

"What's your name?" Officer Rodrick, the obese fuck in the driver's seat, rolled down his window to ask.

"You have my ID," I stated, defiant. The adrenaline was making me bold, which the quiet part of my brain was telling me might not be such a smart move.

"What's your name?" He repeated. His scream of panic he'd given away over the bullhorn was now replaced with polite firmness.

They were all playing an act for the cameras.

While Officer Rodrick tried to pry information out of me, the second officer retrieved evidence bags from one of the cars and bagged my wallet and the receipt. Before bagging my phone, however, he pressed the power button to show the home screen, probably looking for anything incriminating.

Then he leaned over and held the phone in front of my face.

FaceID unlocked the phone.

"YOU CAN'T DO THAT," I shouted, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!"

The officer gave me a slight shove so I rested back up against the side of the car again.

"We have a warrant," he replied, calm and disinterested in my complaints.

I had no doubt that he would prefer to slam my head against the car instead if the cameras were off.

One officer tore through my car, literally cutting seat cushions with a box-cutter. Another scrolled through my phone, placing it right in front of the body camera to film its contents. And Officer Fatty Rodrick kept trying to get me to answer questions.

Eventually, the officer with my phone left the screen unlocked and bagged it with the rest of the evidence and then joined his partner searching my car. I prayed my phone would auto-lock.

It went on for over an hour.

I wanted to sit, but didn't dare even ask. I was shaking from fear. Traffic next to us had built up. Everyone wanted to see the show.

Finally, the search had finished. Parts of my vehicle were strewn across the side of the road. Instead of putting things back where they belonged, however, the cops simply tossed pieces of shredded fabric and papers into the back seat.

I saw the two conferring in whispers. Probably had disabled their cameras.

Which gave me hope.

They hadn't found *anything.* Nothing to justify this charade. Nothing to justify beating me and whispering that I should be dead.

They were *fucked.* I could see it in their shifty glances around and lowered voices.

Suddenly, Officer Fatty Rodrick got on the radio. He had rolled his window back up, so I couldn't hear what he was saying. I saw the other officers touch their radios and talk too. They were including Fatty in their conference. And maybe someone else back at HQ.

They glanced at me, then at the car.

Then they looked at each other.

In almost a mad dash, they went to the driver's seat and popped the hood of the car. Lifting it up, they used flashlights to cover every inch of the engine. I couldn't see where specifically they were looking, but I heard their exclamations when they found what they were looking for.

The officer who had threatened me leaned around the hood to make eye contact with me. He grinned like a maniac.

Together, they took photos inside the engine block, talking with someone on the radio. They even appeared to be FaceTiming with someone or some kind of video call.

Finally, after 20 minutes of rummaging around in my engine, they removed a small black box with wires protruding from it.

Proudly, Officer Murder stormed my way and held the box practically under my nose.

"We got you, you sick fuck," he hissed.

I noticed the lack of a green light on his body cam.

"You're going to prison for the rest of your life until we get the death penalty back where it belongs," he threatened again.

Then he winked and turned on his camera. Two chimes sounded, indicating that the camera was on.

"You are under arrest for wire fraud, soliciting for criminal behavior, criminal conspiracy, unauthorized computer access with criminal intent, money laundering, identity theft, and drug trafficking," Officer Murder gleefully proclaimed, opening the back door of Officer Fatty's vehicle and shoving me inside.

He read me my rights, but I could see from his eyes that he didn't believe a fucking word of what he was saying.

In his mind, I had no rights.

&nbsp;

It was just like a movie.

They made me fill out a form with my information, took my fingerprints, took my photo, and booked me into their holding jail.

I was tossed in a cold, small room with a wooden chair and wooden table with a metal loop in the middle. They cuffed me to the loop. It was unnecessary, considering I'd never tried to escape. But they didn't seem to care about what was necessary and unnecessary.

Officer Murder and his partner left me there for 30 minutes before returning. They set out steaming cups of coffee, and I took one.

If I was going to get out of this, I needed my brain alert and functioning. It was 2 in the morning by this point.

"Where were you going tonight?" Officer Murder asked.

"I refuse to answer any questions with my lawyer present," I stonewalled. Luckily, that one is like the movies.

They kept asking questions, I kept demanding a lawyer. I deflected every question, I kept my face emotionless, and I kept insisting.

Lawyer. Lawyer. **Lawyer.**

After asking questions for an hour, they left.

In a few minutes, they came back.

"Well, we can't get a public defender out tonight. It's too late. So we'll have to put you in a holding cell until morning. That's the best we can do if you won't answer questions. But if you can just answer some basic questions, this might be a complete mix-up and we can let you get home tonight."

I didn't fall for the bait. I *knew* it was a lie. He wasn't a very good liar.

"I want. A. Lawyer." I enunciated. "And a phone call."

"Phones are locked up for the night, you can have your call in the morning."

They unhooked me from the table and took me to a holding cell. I was given a pillow and blanket and some chicken nuggets and a scoop of mashed potatoes. They were cold. I ate them anyway and tried hard to sleep.

I was woken up at barely 7am by a new officer. Luckily, the other two's shifts had ended. I had a bit of hope at the thought.

I was led into another room, this one less cold and bigger, dedicated to lawyer visits. Already seated was a disheveled public defender. He looked more exhausted than I felt.

He stood and shook my hand politely introducing himself as my public defender.

"What's going on?" I blurted, regretting it immediately. He didn't seem to mind.

"You've been arrested for a number of charges." He listed off the official names for what I'd been told the night before. "You were pulled over, as I understand it, because your vehicle had an outstanding search warrant."

"How can a car have a search warrant?" I asked.

"The car was presumed stolen, even though it's registered in your name. Kind of a mix-up there, which will work in our favor."

I nodded. Finally, something helpful.

"They went through my phone," I said. "And tore my car apart. Are they going to pay to fix it? And they removed something from the engine for some reason."

I paused. "And they turned off their cameras and punched me and threatened me." My voice was becoming frantic.

The lawyer stopped and adjusted his glasses, eyeing me. I made a note to calm my tone. I needed him to believe me.

"Sorry, I'm a bit tired and scattered," I apologized.

"Walk me through everything that happened last night," He replied, pen at the ready to take notes.

When I had finished describing the events, the lawyer didn't seem surprised. I assume he's seen a lot worse than my comparatively tame story.

"There are a number of issues here I can raise to help your case," he said, calm and collected. "There's one issue with what they found in your engine. I'm not sure I understand what they're saying, but we have a meeting at 10 this morning to go over charges and some administrative things. I wanted to come early and meet with you before my other meetings."

I sighed, realizing that I was just one number in a queue of thousands for this system. What happened to me was neither unique nor extremely provoking, especially for a public defender.

"This shit happens every day, doesn't it," I muttered.

It was my lawyer's turn to sigh. "We're going to get you out of this, okay? Like I said, there are a number of issues here that could get your charged dropped. Let me do my job. Your job now is to keep quiet, and insist on a lawyer for every question."

"I'm already doing that," I smiled. He didn't.

"They will try to push all your buttons to get you agitated. They want you to lose your cool and say something that helps their case. Don't give them *anything.*"

He sounded like... like we were behind enemy lines or something.

I nodded. His tone was having an effect. This was not over yet, and it wouldn't be easy to make it go away either.

The cops had a vested interest in making their version of events stick. Permanently.

A digital recorder and camera were set up for the meeting at 10. It was the same interrogation room I'd been in the night before. I was led in by a new officer, with my lawyer right behind me. Two policemen were already waiting in the small room. Once I was dropped off, the officer that brought me in left.

I almost protested when they chained me to the table again.

"Is that necessary?" my lawyer asked, noticing my expression.

The two men across the table sighed and shook their heads. The officer removed the chains, and even the handcuffs, and then left the room.

Then I got to listen in complete astonishment as the two men introduced themselves. They were FBI. My stomach sunk lower and lower the more they talked. I can't even write some of the things they said. My lawyer says they'll arrest me if I publish them.

But the basics? I can describe those.

They were from a darkweb marketplace task force. They were hunting a network of servers that were hosting darkweb marketplaces, including murder-for-hire, drug sales, fake IDs, and even human trafficking. While looking for the servers to seize them, they were having difficulty tracking down where they were. The servers were constantly being moved, they said, every time they tried a raid.

That's when they figured out what was actually going on.

They set the black box on the table, the one that had been removed from my engine. It was wrapped in an evidence bag. The two of them took turns asking, in different ways, if I knew what it was and if I had installed it into my car.

I looked to my lawyer before every answer. And every answer was a strict "no".

I didn't know what it was. I didn't install it in my car. I didn't know when it *could* have been installed. I bought the car 3 years ago from a used car dealership. I got my oil changed at a shop near my house. There was no major repair work done recently. I had no idea what they were getting at.

Forensics would have to dig at the box, since mine was only the third one they'd seized. I was literally at the tip of an investigation which had only just begun seizing these boxes from cars across the region.

I'm told I'll be arrested if I say how they correlated the box with *my* car.

They told me that the box hooks to the car battery and contains a little computer and a fucking radio antenna so it can talk to cell phone towers and satellites (I think) and serve these illegal websites! And they do that so there's no "static location" where the computers could be seized from. That's why the warrant was so unorthodox, where the warrant was for the car itself rather than the owner.

They *know* that it's not the car owners at fault here. They've already questioned two other people and gotten the same story. Except when they put out the warrant and described what they were looking for, some moron forgot to add the disclaimer: "the car owner is not the actual criminal, they're an unknowing patsy!"

In another case, I'm told, the box tied into the car's built-in internet data box, so the content was being served by the car *itself.* Which means that person didn't have a box removed from the engine. No, the entire *car* was seized, and they couldn't give it back. The car's entire electrical system *was evidence!*

When the FBI was satisfied that I wasn't one of the people they were actually hunting for, they said they'd pass the recommendation along to the local police to drop all charges.

Did you read that right?

They would *recommend* that the charges get dropped. Not demand, not force, *recommend.*

It's been two months, and I'm still dealing with these fucking cops who want to hold the case open as long as possible to harass me because no one was smart enough to tell the cops that *I am a victim, not a criminal.*

It's fucking infuriating.

I have to pass this through my lawyer to review before I send this out, because they could come arrest me for talking about what they were doing. I had to sign a non-disclosure form to even get their weak-ass "recommendation" to drop any charges.

God knows where the other charges for wire fraud and unauthorized computer access came from.

I'm tired, and I'm angry, but most of all I'm terrified. I'm scared that this whole system can just toss me around like this, like I don't matter, like my life is disposable.

And there's nothing I can do, nowhere I can go, that would let me escape from this system. Some moron can just decide on a whim to tell cops that I'm hosting a fucking *drug marketplace* from my *car* and the cops will happily beat the shit out of me without any evidence!

I'm... God this is fucking terrifying.

I don't know what to do anymore. Everything has lost meaning if it can be taken away from me based on a lie.

I don't know how to get any comfort or peace or security back in my life.

I'm scared that one day I'm going to end up just like anyone else on the news. Shot for no reason, and then nothing happens.

This system is fucking insane[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonprince/)
