March 17, 2020. 

It was exactly this day when I lost my dog. Now I know what you're thinking.. People lose their animals all the time to natural causes. It's all just a part of our "precious" lives. Although, this story is a little different as their was nothing natural about what happend to Cloud. 

The thing is.. I can actually still feel him near me, seeking me, I hear him. His paws drag as his nails scrape by followed by the sound of a disoriented whimper. Every time it happens, my heart sinks within my chest and I only get reminded of that horrendous night. It's been three years since my dog vanished, I can still hear him breathing over me...

Have you ever wondered to yourself if something really happened to you? Even though it seems bizarre, you're still convinced it really was real. After 3 years, this trauma still seems to haunt me even though I have no proof to share its existence. The only thing I have are these horrific memories and emotions. The best I can do is just try to move on, and to help with that I feel I must share this experience here on reddit.

I used to watch quite a bit of creepy story videos back when I worked night security and I figured my experience would be a good addition to this. Maybe, I could find something within myself to help me move on. Either way, I think that's enough prolouge. This is what happened on March, 17 2020. I share this horrendous dark secret that I've been holding away from the public for three years.. Let's begin.

The night of March, 17. I took my beautiful white husky, Cloud on a walk within the mountains of Virginia. Now, I know taking a stroll within the mountains at night in Virginia seem like a very bad idea. But for us it was a normality as we already lived pretty far up the mountains and we always would follow a certain trail that's been around our house since it's been made. I was always prepared if something would happen as well, I came packed with small little snacks, water, matches, a first aid, tourniquet, bear oc and a lot more.

Not to mention I work for the sheriffs office as a deputy while also working as a reservist within the national guard. So, let's just say I was always prepared just in case the worse would happen. We wouldn't be walking for more than a hour anyway, we always take a certain path that loops back to our house.. At least that's what should have happened. We were walking for about 18 to 25 minutes, I don't remember the exact time.

It was just then when my reality started to shake. Out of nowhere I heard the scream of what I thought could be a young woman. The scream startled me and within seconds my hand was within my thick warm wool jacket. My fingers clutched my G22 tightly, my instincts were kicking in and my blood was pumping. My dog was barking and pulling desperately, although my body was already tensed up and I was not gonna go chasing after him in the woods at night.

The screams didn't stop, they were continuous and repetitive. The more I think back, it didn't even sound human. Not even like an animal, no fox could make this sound.. It was disoriented, and the screams didn't even seem to have a echo throughout the woods. Just constant screams on repeat, the same volume, tone, but evrytime it got even more disturbing. 

I finally managed to catch my conscience and pull out my phone. The first thing I tried to do was call 911, but of course I was in the mountains and had no service at all. As a cop, I should be the first person to help someone in trouble. Although, something didn't feel right. My common sense knows way better and my gut was telling me to grab my dog and get the hell out of there.

The second I had that thought, the screaming stopped. Almost as if.. Whatever was screaming knew it wasn't going to work.
Even though those horrific sounds stopped, the silence made it even worse. It was almost if all the worlds sounds just vanished. I could definitely hear, it wasn't fuzzy. Everything just stopped.

"Something is seriously wrong here." I whispered to myself while turning around to continue my speed walk back... Suddenly it hit. The world just slipped into some unknown anomaly and I happened to be the unlucky soul traveling within it. It felt like I fell about 15 feet. My stomach dropped and everything was black. I thought I might have stepped in some type of hunting trap but I was most unfortunately "wrong."

I remember a distinct smell. Something that felt familiar, maybe a scent that was lost sometime in my childhood. I can't describe it really, but it felt almost nostalgic. My mind finally took action and my eyes peaked open. My eyes widened as I tried to process what I saw. I somehow managed to find myself within some type of interior playground. There was play equipment all over. It felt like I was in some type of fun house. Perplexed by this, I managed to forget the horrible things that happened beforehand, even if it was just for a few seconds.

I checked over myself to look for cuts or any damages. While checking I was shocked to see all my gear was gone. My bag, food, water, my gun... My chest suddenly felt heavier then anything I've ever felt. Almost like I myself became a statue.. Cloud, my dog was gone. I desperately called out his name and received nothing in return. Silence filled the playground as I sat there taken back by everything. 
I looked above me to see if I could see where I fell but there was only ceiling. There was nothing broken, no signs of me falling. Absolutely zero.

At this point, things just seem like complete  fantasy. Beyond that actually.. I'm not even sure if I will continue but even so.. The story does NOT end here, this is only the start of these horrendous events that continue to haunt me to this day.
