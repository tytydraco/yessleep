I don’t know if anyone will believe me. Maybe I don’t care. Maybe this is more for her than for this thread.

But I swear to the Lord above, all I ever did for her was love her.

Can anyone give me ideas on how to get her back? What to say to her when I see her? We have two kids together, and I have a restraining order in my name. I just… I really can’t do this anymore.

I can’t think without thoughts of Shayla spreading through my mind like wildfire. I can’t sleep without my heart trying to rip its way out of my ribcage. It’s torture.

Not to mention, my fingers are shredded—peeled back like cheese strings—and I can’t help but tear them further, just to see how far the skin will go before it bleeds.

I lie here in bed, twitching, haunted by the echoes of her. And all of this... over a couple arguments and a couple misunderstandings??

I guess you all would need a little bit of background to get the full scope of the situation. This all started when we went to Burning Man. Now, it was amazing. The place was unlike anything I’d ever seen before. The Nevada desert stretched out in every direction, flat and barren, but alive with energy. Tens of thousands of people, dressed in every imaginable costume, roamed the desert under the scorching sun. Everywhere you looked, there were strange, otherworldly art installations, massive, colorful sculptures that seemed to defy gravity and logic, each one more surreal than the last. Some twisted and contorted like they were alive, while others stood still, silent and imposing, as if watching over the chaos of the crowd.  And the drugs, LSD, Spice, you name it—I had it all. The world around me felt warped, shifting in strange colors, and every beat of music seemed to pulse through my chest. But that’s when I saw him. He was tall, 6'2", with white hair, pale as snow, an albino with sharp features that would have been seen as handsome, if it wasn’t for something unsettling in his smile. It was too wide, too confident, like he knew something I didn’t.

He was talking to her—my Shayla.

There was something off about him, though. Maybe it was the way he looked at her, or the way his laugh seemed too sharp in the middle of all the noise. It didn’t feel right. Not at all.

Instantly, I felt sober, the haze of the drugs lifting as my heart rate spiked. Without thinking, I walked straight over to her. But when I reached her, the man was walking away, blending into the crowd. He shot me one last, unsettling smile before disappearing into the sea of people, like he knew something I didn’t.

I stood there, my breath heavy, trying to steady myself. "Shayla," I said, my voice tight. "Who was that guy? The tall one, with the white hair and the weird smile?" 

She looked at me, her expression confused at first, then softening as she searched my face. "What are you talking about?" she asked, voice steady. "I haven’t talked to anyone."

I shook my head, frustration bubbling up. "I saw you. You were with him. Don’t lie to me."

She blinked, her brow furrowing slightly, but she remained calm. "I wasn’t with anyone," she said, her voice even but carrying a hint of concern. "I’m just here with you."

I felt my pulse quicken. "I saw you, Shayla. You were talking to him. Right there, just a few minutes ago, it’s not a big deal, I was just wondering who he was."

Her eyes shifted, now a little more confused than before, but she stayed calm. "There’s no one here, baby. Maybe you’re seeing things, but I wasn’t talking to anyone."

I shook my head, the words coming out quicker now, desperate. "I’m not seeing things. I swear I saw you with him. The guy with the creepy smile. Why are you acting like I’m crazy?"

She took a deep breath, her expression softening as she stepped closer to me. "You’re not crazy," she said gently, her voice still level. "I just don’t know what you’re talking about. I wasn’t with anyone."

But the more she denied it, the more my frustration built. "I don’t understand. I saw you, Shayla. Why won’t you just admit it?"

Her tone shifted, frustration starting to edge in. "I’m not lying to you," she said, her voice now rising slightly. "Why would I lie about something like that?"

I didn’t say anything after that. What could I say? The words just sat on the edge of my tongue, bitter and heavy, but none of them came out.

We spent the rest of the night together in silence—awkward, strained silence. Not touching, not looking at each other. Just two people, side by side, suddenly feeling like strangers.

We walked back to the car in silence, the dust clinging to our clothes, the air between us heavy and cold. The joy of earlier in the day was gone, replaced by a tension so thick I could barely breathe through it.

As we neared the parking area, I glanced up—and there he was.

The same man.

Tall. White. That same smug, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he knew every terrible thought running through my head.

He waved.

Not at me.

At Shayla.

And she smiled.

Not a nervous smile. Not one of those awkward, polite ones you throw at a stranger.

No—this was familiar. Warm. Like she knew him.

My chest tightened.

She didn’t say a word. Just got into the car like nothing happened.

And I sat there, behind the wheel, my hands shaking. Trying to figure out what the hell I had just seen.

And that’s when she changed.

After that night, it was like something in her shifted—quiet at first. Subtle. We started fighting over tiny things. Stupid, meaningless things. Where she wanted to go out. What we were having for dinner. Whether she really needed to be gone that long at the grocery store.

She said I was being paranoid. Controlling.

But I wasn’t. I was just... aware. I noticed things. Like how she kept locking her phone. How she laughed a little too hard at messages I never saw. How she always seemed distracted, even when we were together.

I’d catch her staring off sometimes, just gone, like her mind was somewhere else. With someone else.

And every time I tried to bring it up, it would explode into another argument. She’d say I was accusing her. That I didn’t trust her. That I was making things up.

But I know what I saw. I know what I felt.

It wasn’t just me.

There was something wrong with her.

It was in the way she looked at me—like I was a stranger. Like I was the one slipping away.

I wasn’t crazy. I was trying to protect what we had. Our family. Our kids. The life we built brick by brick. And she was letting it rot, letting it fall apart.

No—she wasn’t just changing.

She was being changed.

And I know exactly when it started.

It was him. That man. That thing with the too-perfect teeth and that scummy smile. That tall, freakish albino bastard who waved at her like he owned her.

He did something to her. Got into her head. Twisted her against me.

All of this... all of it... it started with him. So I did the most reasonable thing possible, I confronted her. 

I didn’t want to do it like that. I really didn’t. But you have to understand—this wasn’t just about a hunch or some jealousy. It was the way she started looking at me, like I was a stranger in my own home. Like I was dangerous.

And all because I cared.

I waited until the kids were in their room, headphones on, TV blasting. I sat her down and asked her, calm as I could: "Who is he, Shayla?"

She blinked at me. Blinked, like I’d asked what time dinner was. "What are you talking about now?"

"You know exactly what I’m talking about. The man from Burning Man. The one you smiled at. The one who’s been in your head ever since."

She blinked slowly, like she was trying to process whether I was serious. “You’re still on about that? That was months ago.”

“You smiled at him,” I said. “Don’t act like it was nothing. I saw it. You don’t smile at strangers like that.”

She put her glass down carefully. “Okay, you need to calm down.”

“Don’t tell me to calm down,” I snapped. “I’m not crazy, Shayla. Just tell me the truth. Is he on your phone? Is that why you lock it now?”

“Oh my God,” she muttered, already standing. “You’re doing this again.”

“I saw you with him,” I said. “You’re not gonna gaslight me.”

“Gaslight? Are you serious right now?” Her voice was rising now, her hands shaking slightly. “There is no man. You’ve invented this fantasy and now you’re tearing everything apart over it!”

“Then unlock your phone,” I said, stepping closer. “Let me see.”

“Jacob, I already showed you,” she said, her voice tightening.

“Shaya, just give it to me”

She clutched it to her chest. “No. You don’t get to demand things like that. That’s not trust. That’s control.”

I held out my hand. “Shayla. Please.”

“No.”

So I grabbed it.

She tried to pull it back, but I was faster. I fumbled with it—locked. Of course it was. When she reached for it again, I threw it—hard—against the counter. The screen cracked open like an egg, pieces raining to the floor.

She stared at the broken phone, and then up at me, horror in her eyes.

“You psycho,” she whispered. “What is wrong with you?”

“I’m trying to save our marriage,” I said through gritted teeth. “I’m trying to save you.”

“You’re scaring me,” she said, stepping back. “You’re scaring me and you’re scaring the kids.”

That stung more than I thought it would. “The kids? I’m doing this for the kids! I’m not the one sneaking around, smiling at strange men!”

She shook her head, her voice trembling. “You think you saw someone once and now you're obsessed. You won’t let it go. This isn’t about him anymore—this is about you, Jacob.”

I took another step forward. “So you are admitting he’s real, I fucking knew it!”

Shayla’s eyes widened. “Jacob—stop.”

“No…, no, NO, not again. You think I’m stupid? You think I didn’t see the way you smiled at him? The way you always smile when you think I’m not looking?”

Her lips parted like she wanted to speak, but I cut her off.

“You’re just like the rest of them, huh?” I hissed, my voice trembling. “A dirty whore hiding behind fake tears and moral high ground.”

“Jacob, stop it!” she said, her voice breaking. “Listen to yourself!”

“No—no more listening!” I shouted, jabbing a finger toward her. “I gave you everything! I worked myself to the bone for this family, and you repay me by fucking that freak behind my back?!”

Jacob you need the calm down the kids can hear you

“The kids? The kids?!” I laughed, wild and sharp. “You think you’re a good parent now? Would a good mom cheat on her loyal husband? You're just a whore.

She was backing away now, slow, careful, like I was some kind of animal.

"Don't you walk away!" I snapped, stalking closer.

"You're scaring me," she said, and her voice cracked. "You're scaring me and you're scaring the kids."

You’re treating me like I’m some kind of monster, come back here before I come and get you.

She didn’t respond. Just turned, fast, and bolted down the hallway. I chased after her—stopped just short as I heard the click of the kids' door locking behind her.

“Shayla!” I shouted, banging on the door. “You’re hiding from your husband?!”

Silence.

So I turned around—and I let it all out. Every bit of it.

I tore the hallway photos off the walls. Kicked in the laundry basket. Ripped open drawers. Shattered plates, shattered the TV, shattered everything we had left.

And all the while, I kept telling myself this was justified. That I was standing up for the truth. That she had changed—he had changed her. That bastard with the smile and the eyes like polished glass.

The last thing I remember before the police came was the sound of the front door crashing open—and then, behind the cracked door to the kids' room, Johnny and Fatima’s little faces peeking through.

No screams. Just wide eyes.

And yeah, I know how this sounds.

But you weren’t there.

You didn’t see what he did to her. What he did to us.

I’m not the monster here.

He is.

It's been 10 years now. Johnny and Fatima are all grown up—they’re both in high school now. I just want to see them. I just want to see her, to see Shayla, even if it’s just once. They’re all that kept me going when I was locked up, all that gave me a reason to keep pushing through the days in that place. But now, they won’t even want to see me. 

That's why I went back. I went back to the house I built, the family I built. The one thing that still felt like mine, even after all this time. But I had to be smart about it—if Shayla even caught a whiff of me, she’d call the cops in an instant. So, I had to wait for the right moment.

I broke in when the house was empty, still careful not to make a sound, hiding in the master bedroom, waiting for her to come back. My heart pounded as I lay there, alone in the dark, surrounded by the remnants of our life. It was the house we dreamed of, the place where we laughed, argued, and grew together. But now? Now, it felt like a stranger’s home.

The walls were silent, but every creak of the floorboards, every flicker of light from the street outside, made me jump. I couldn’t stop thinking about her, about the kids. Would they remember me? Would they even care to see me?

But none of that mattered right now. What mattered was seeing Shayla again

And that's when it happened. I heard a noise from downstairs, something that made my heart skip a beat. Without thinking, I ducked into the closet, pressing myself against the cool, wooden walls. I peered through the slats, trying to steady my breathing, my heart hammering in my chest.

And then, there he was.

The albino man. The same one I’d seen that night at Burning Man. He stood tall in the doorway, his pale skin almost glowing under the dim light. His hair was white as snow, long and slightly unkempt, matching his almost ethereal look. His eyes, an unsettling shade of pale blue, fixed on mine through the crack in the closet door. He smiled—a slow, knowing smile, like he was in on a secret I wasn’t privy to. The smile sent a shiver up my spine.

And then, he spoke.

"The hardest thing about love is not the falling, but the staying—and learning how to talk when silence feels easier."

His voice was soft, almost like he was speaking directly to my soul. There was something about it, something that made my skin crawl and my mind race.

Before I could make sense of what he had said, he turned, his smile never fading, and walked calmly out of the room. The sound of the door closing behind him was like a final, distant echo in my mind.

But then, the main door creaked open, and I heard the unmistakable voices—three familiar voices, the ones I’d been yearning to hear for years.

So here I am now, asking—what should I do?

She’s here. I can feel her in the walls. I can smell her perfume laced into the sheets, and can almost hear her laugh echoing down the hallway like a ghost that doesn’t know it’s dead.

But it’s not her laugh anymore. It’s changed. Just like she did. Just like he made her.

It hurts. God, it hurts. Hurts to know she’s here… with that thing.

And part of me—most of me—wants her to feel this pain. To finally understand what it’s like to be forgotten, thrown away, replaced. To lose yourself to someone else’s shadow.

Please, just tell me what to do.

My fingers won’t stop twitching. My skin itches like something’s trying to crawl out from underneath it. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can barely breathe without thinking of her face, of the way she used to look at me—before it all curdled. Before that smile twisted her into someone else.

I’m so tired.

But I know I have to stay awake.

Because any second now… she might find me.

Or I might find her.

And I don’t know which one terrifies me more.
