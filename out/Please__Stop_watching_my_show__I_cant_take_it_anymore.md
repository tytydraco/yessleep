“Once again ladies and Gentlemen ,  that’s all from me , have a wonderful day and I do hope you will join me again tomorrow”

 

“And cut”

As another show drew to a close, my smile faltered, and the lights dimmed. I created a show that I now loathe. It’s all falling apart around me, crumbling into an unrecognisable pile of slop that I’m embarrassed to put my name to. ‘Waking up the nation with Charles’ was my pride and joy, but it’s all gone terribly wrong. How is it still spiralling into something I don’t recognise anymore? This is a last-ditch Hail Mary to try and get it all to stop. Please stop watching, and maybe they’ll take me off air, and all of this can stop. You may think I’m exaggerating, but I can do no more than spill my heart out and hope someone listens.

 

  I wish I was in the same blissful ignorance  I felt when the first seem began to come away. It was a short while ago when I was hosting a segment with a well-known local chef , we liked to do bring verity in our shows so tried to mix up the segments every morning with baking , gardening , actors that sort of thing . We were talking about our recently baked scones which I had ruined by adding salt instead of sugar into the mixture which got a chuckle from our producers and seemed to go down well with audience when I suddenly felt – wrong. The chefs voice began to muffle and my eyesight blurred to a point that everything around me seemed like low quality oil painting created by a three year old , smudges of colour crudely mashed together to try and imitate objects. I felt beads of sweat drop down my head as they settled in the creases of my strained and forced smile. Then darkness , quiet , nothingness. It was a feeling of momentary peace I had not felt in quite some time but when I came round I did not see the studio or anywhere I recognised straight off the bat , a world that was upside down with Trees that looked as though they were raining from the sky and the floor was an endless road of stars as far as I could make out , a pain shooting through my chest , then darkness once more. When I came around a bright light shone into my eyes that at first blinded me but it was quickly taken away by a paramedic holding a small torch.

“Hey there Charles , had us worried for a second there” I wasn’t to sure if it was the paramedic who said it or a voice in my head but I jolted upright and tried to get to my feet before stumbling again and deciding to sit crossed legs on the floor with my head in my hands. 

Through glazed and blurry eyes I could see a door way on stage right , inside stood a figure dressed all in a brownish suit ,  looked like he had stumbled in from the set next door shooting some Zombie drama for the BBC.

I pointed a finger out and shouted “Who the fuck is that ? Get him off my set right now , get him off now !” the figure did not move but just tilted its head slightly as if it were confused.

“He must of hit his head on the way down , seems concussed , I think it’d be wise to keep him in over night.”
 I don’t remember much else from that night , The time I actually spent in hospital flew by , I was in a private room with a view of the gardens behind the hospital. A moonlit pond rippled gently as the breeze passed through served as a peaceful view for my stay. My stay however was less tranquil. I remained in a state of confusion for most of it hearing laughter and the mundane mild chatter of voices that felt like it was in the room with me. Either there was a staff room nearby or the morphine was doing its job. I closed my eyes tightly only to open them and be blinded by big bright lights. studio lights ?

“ Ladies and Gentlemen , you all know him from the hit breakfast show please welcome our guest star , Charles !”

A voice came from behind me , I realised that this was my set with my audience but , they were booing me ? Why , what had I done ? I tried to move to wave or do something but I realised I was still in the hospital bed , strapped down tightly by chains. The boos became an unrelenting tsunami at which point I realised I couldn’t speak, I was not gagged or incapacitated but it was as though someone had stolen my voice completely.

“Whoa Whoa Whoa ladies and Gentlemen *slight awkward chuckle* lets settle down , so Charles – “ I could do little more than move my eyes to see my desk I would sit at and a figure sat behind it. It wore a tattered old dark brown suit jacket that looked like it had been crudely attempted to be fixed but I could see little more than a sleeve and part of his chest. “-how does it feel to be the one who destroyed a life just to rule it all”

I couldn’t respond , I was confused by his words , the seemed disjointed and spoken by three voices overlapped crudely in post.

“What , cat got your tongue ?” this elicited a maniacal laugh from the audience that started and stopped with pin point accuracy sounding like someone was just playing a recording.

“Come on Charles , this is your own doing after all , you were lighthouse in a sea of darkness and you had to turn out the lights” the voice began to distort and become more twisted as It carried on rambling ,I cant lie I was frightened , feel completely vulnerable to whatever the hell was going on felt like hell.

A buzzer blared off in the corner behind me  sounding like a car horn that had been imitated by a child.

“AHA you know what that means Ladies and Gentlemen , It’s almost time for the end of the show” A chorus of aww rattled and screeched through my brain as it droned on , I shut my eyes tightly only try and drown out the lights and sounds of the studio which luckily seemed to work . Peace and quiet once more accompanied the darkness which was such a comfort after the harsh lights and sounds of the studio. The same voice echoed so delicately compared to the voice that interrogated me moments ag , it almost seemed recognisable” .

“See what I saw , feel what I felt”

Once more I was back in that place , the world around me was upside down and the pain ripped through my chest , but something was different this time. I could vaguely see a boarder of broken glass around my vision with one of my hands on a steering wheel ,  was I in a car ?

Before I had anymore time to think I snapped back into reality as I found myself lying not in a bed,  but the cold hard floor beside the bed. I struggled to my feet and luckily felt a bit better than I had done. I sat on the side of the bed to rack my brains over whatever the hell was going on inside my mind. I felt sore and everything seemed to ache in a way I could swear my bones were rattling. My stomach twisted into a Knot whilst my chest tightened , I don’t know what was going on but I didn’t feel myself. I rang the nurses bell to tell them my experiences , which I was palmed off until discharge telling me that It was just some generalised anxiety. They ran a few tests to make sure but all of them cam back indicating I was in good health so they discharged me that afternoon. The director , Arla , suggested I should take the rest of the week off which I was reluctant to do but she reassured me she had learnt a lot from me and would be happy to step in for a bit. I don’t trust many people , but Arla I thought the world of. She had seen me at my best and worse , even when we both started here it was like two childhood friends rekindling a friendship , so I agreed to let her take the reins while I was off.

I wanted to watch her first show in the morning so made sure I didn’t lie in so I could catch it. I had my slippers on with my feet up , a cup of tea in one hand and a plate of biscuits on the table ready to watch. The show started and she had the same grace and effortless humour that seemed to slip away from me over the years but watching her reminded me so much of myself. I’d not normally atmit this let alone to her face but I was bloody proud of her. The smile , the chemistry was all there it was evident that she learnt it all from a pro yet somehow made it better with an air of elegance and beauty of which I was not as gifted in those departments. She had begun a segment with a local Gardener who had brought in the UK’s largest marrow , I don’t think the audience were too interested yet Arla tried her best to joke and laugh with the gardener who took their Marrow growing a touch too serious. But out of the corner of the screen I saw that figure , the extra from the set next door stood there again staring. I thought it must have been a fan of the show so I called the secondary producer , Clive , to send him packing.

I dialled Clive up directly and was met with a :

“What Charles , we are literally live as we speak , this better be urgent”

“Yes it is , that bastard from the other day is standing off stage right you can see him on screens , tell him to bugger off”

Silence

“*Sigh* Okay Charles , your still concussed I think buddy , go have a lie down for a minute”

“No , No Clive he’ right there he’s got his back to us now he-“

“Charles seriously , chill out and go lie down mate , you really shouldn’t be thinking about work right now so I’ll pretend this phone call didn’t happen”

The phone tone rung in my ear as I watched the figure just , stand there. I couldn’t look at it anymore so I switched channel. Grand designs , perfect , watching someone try and renovate a 19th century house would numb myself long enough to … wait , there he was again ? In the upstairs window looking down on the presenters as they went from talking about the house and what type of scaffolding they were going to put up to them chattering about the death and misery this house saw . I switched again hoping for a different outcome. An old repeat of the Great British Bake off ? Perfect , but this time something was odd from the start. This time all the presenters and contestants had their backs to the cameras as they switched between the two angles , there was no dialogue just static with occasional screeches and horns going off trying but failing to break through the static. One contestant however was recognisable , partially atleast . I could now see he wore a suit , the same dirty dark brown one that man wore the other night. With every camera switch he would change positions with other contestants to get closer and closer to the camera till he was front and centre , back turned to the camera still as it began to fizzle before turning black. Static would fizzle on and off the screen turning the room around me into a sickly parade of dancing whites , blues and purples interfering with the dark screen.

“See what I saw , Feel what I felt” in white text flashed up on the screen intertwined with the static , at first it almost looked like a trick of the eye but after a couple of minutes the text faded and gave way to a birds eye of a road. It pierced through the thick trees leaving a distinctive black mark down the middle streaked with a vibrant white. A car came into view winding darting all over the road whilst the camera came closer and closer to the roof of the vehicle till it blurred into a first person POV of the driver. A lorry would come barrelling around the corner and the car would slam on the horn , smash through the barricade with an ear splitting screech , and soar through the air for a brief moment until it cam plummeting to the ground with a thunderous SMASH. 

On impact the windscreen would shatter into my tv screen bursting it open plunging the room into darkness whilst I felt tiny flecks of glass rush past my skin and slicing into me as it whizzed past . I held my hands up to my face and felt a warm liquid begin to pool over my fingers. I stood up quick as I could to grab a flannel or something but as I stood up I felt a sharp pain rush through my chest again and slumped back down. I was frozen in panic as I believed I was about to bleed out there and then as I felt it begin to soak into my shirt and drip down my chest , this could be it. From the TV came a blue glow , subtle and fait to begin with but as it grew brighter the sight became unbearable , stinging my eyes as it became more harsh. A Horrendous noise followed that mate my teeth rattle , like someone playing a drum under the water as fast as they possible could. I clasped my ears over my ears and shouted in anguish , fear , terror , pure and raw dread and…

“  Once again ladies and Gentlemen ,  that’s all from me , have a wonderful day and I you will join me again tomorrow” Arla directed to the screen with a warm and genuine smile.

Everything was as it was before.

The Tv was fixed , light gently trickled in through the blinds leaving behind a warm glow of sunshine that glistened off the glass fittings of the house. My hands scrambled all over my face finding no evidence of blood or glass that had become lodged whilst my shirt and chest also remained unstained. My head fell into my hands brushing them back to feel through my greasy hair sighing in disbelief and bewilderment. That afternoon I threw out all my painkillers the hospital had given me believing this was , or at least part of the reason all of this was happening.

A week passed and to be honest very little happened , I stayed away from the TV , read some books , had some walks and felt a lot better of myself, happier , more content , believing fully well the morphine had had an adverse effect on me. I came back to work feeling fresh as a daisy and ready to get back to it. Suit pressed and steamed , a layer of teeth whitener and a little sip of Irish courage to get back out there.

A knocking came from my dressing room door , followed by a voice whispered yet sincere “Hey Charles , so glad to have you back , it was fun for a short time bust Christ those guests ! It’s like either talking to a dog with ADHD or a brick wall so I’ll be glad to pass the reins back to you. We are on in 15”

“Ahhh Arla great to hear from you Hun , no worries at all I’m just freshening up and Ill be out in a mo!”  I heard Arlas footsteps clack down the hall as she went to get ready for the show . I swivelled back to my mirror and instantly turned to stone. In the mirror was the figure stood clothe fibres away from my back , I could only see from the neck down but I knew it was him by the distinct suit he wore. The stench of death hung in the room as I could feel the presence behind me begin to gear up to say or do something. I wanted to turn round and confront my demon but I couldn’t , I just sat there as if medusa had cursed me.

“You saw what I did and felt what I did , but it will never be enough Charles”

My lips quivered trying to formulate some sort of sentence “W..who… who the fuck are you?

“*chuckling through gurgled breath* you have no clue do you ?”

I shook my head from side to side slow as I could.

The figure began to whistle , much like a child trying to whistle for the first time only occasionally hitting that perfect balance to make the sound. At first I had no idea what the tune was , but then as the tune faded and the singing started , it clicked , the pieces came together and I had to try and hold back a torrent of vomit that was beginning to build.

“Start your day with a laugh and a chat , the breakfast show with Charles and Matt” on the last syllable of the jingle he brought his head down into view. Despite his grey complexion , sunken eyes ,  and toothless grin it was unmistakeably Matt , my old Co-host.

I gulped as I could feel him staring a hole into my soul expecting me to say something.

“Matt , er , long time no see pal , whats … whats happened to you ?”

“I died didn’t I Charles” The words sat heavy in my soul and still ring in my ears now.

“You know that though don’t you , you blocked my family when they tried to contact you about the funeral , a family who treated you like a son , a family who loved you , GONE , from your life atleast”

“I…I…I” I stuttered , worst of all I knew all of this was true , it all came rushing back and it was true.

“This is all your doing though isn’t it Charles , what happened to me , this is on you”

I was battling through tears and struggled breath “How the hell is this my fault , I didn’t kill you !”

“No , but you caused it didn’t you … stabbed me in the back and left me for dead on a sinking ship of a show while you sat here in your cushy dressing room living on the luxury of life , YOU let me drown there Charles!”

“Im , I … Im so sorry”

“Sorry isn’t going to fix this now , I didn’t find your apologies at the bottom of a bottle or behind a wheel so I certainly don’t want them now”

I broke down completely , sobbing into my jacket as I turned to look at him for the first time properly.

“Wh.. what do you want from me Matt Huh ? I cant undo it so what the fuck do you want ?”

“The thing that you made my family feel , irrelevance”

“I don’t get it , what do you mean , I - ?

“I want you to become as Irrelevant as you made my family feel , you don’t deserve the fame or fortune , you’re a selfish arsehole and you deserve nothing. So , every show up on that stage , Ill be watching , every segment Ill be there till the fans all lose hope and give up on you too and see you for the snivelling coward you really are”

“And if I don’t do the shows , if I just retire and go home , then what Huh ?”

“What’s the fun in that Charles ? I want the nation to see you suffer , and crash out , if you try and go home to dwell and take the easy way I’ll just make your life hell there too. There’s only one way to stop this Charles , fade into irrelevance too , chop chop , your on in 5 “     

I ran out as fast as my legs would take me , but no matter how fast I ran , this was not something I could run away from. The responses of todays show were poor with comments saying I was losing my passion , calling me washed up , sending a torrent of hate. Matt sat and watched the whole show with that horrific grin on his face through the entire show not breaking his gaze , clapping and shouting throughout. Yet some people are so stuck in there way of watching and tuning in they refuse to break their routine so for now I’m stuck in this hell .So please , I write this as a plea and a cry for help , for the love of god stop watching my show , I don’t deserve the attention anymore , I just want to fade into obscurity. 
Please.
