“I’ve got something of a gift for making people talk,” I told the shackled man on the other side of the interrogation room table. “That’s why they brought me in.” I jerked my thumb toward a pair of uniformed beat cops flanking the door behind me.

The broken ventilation fan puttered along in the ducts overhead, barely stirring the stale air in. The suspect massaged his bruised knuckles, occasionally looking over my shoulder to the camera recording our interaction.

All of this was just background noise to me. Not once did I look away from him. If I did, the whole painstaking process would have to start over.

“I’m not telling you shit.” Flecks of his spittle landed on my face. Disgusting. But I couldn’t move, not even to flinch. The trance was already taking hold: his head had stopped moving, and a glazed, milky look fell over his dark brown eyes. “Your little trick won’t—” was all he managed before his pupils fractured, transforming from their natural circular state into a shattered sunburst pattern. A single tear rolled out from the corner of each eye.

“I suppose you’re right mister O’Brian. You’re a tough nut to crack.” I leaned forward. “But are you sure there’s nothing you feel like telling me?” I scooted in my chair without breaking eye contact. “Maybe about Penelope Baker?”

His muscles convulsed, rattling his manacles against the metal table. The process always looked agonizing. I’d almost feel bad, if it weren’t for the fact that— 

“I killed her!” The words erupted out of his mouth like water from a geyser, as if they’d been bursting to be spoken. “Beat her with my bare hands. Dumped the body behind the corner store where, her ex deals.”

“That enough?” I asked. 

“Yeah, that should do just fine,” a voice said from an intercom speaker.

I was halfway to my feet when the man leapt after me, grabbing onto the lapels of my jacket.

“No!” He pleaded like a little kid begging for another piece of candy. “No, you can’t go yet. There’s so much more I need to tell you.”

One of the officers grabbed the suspect and shoved him back into the chair.

“Please!” He called after me as I slipped out of the interrogation room.

A detective waited for me in the dingy precinct hallway, fat white envelope held outstretched in his hand. “Thanks for your help, Mikey.”

I snatched it from him, thumbed through the wad of wrinkled hundreds. “This isn’t what we agreed on.”

“Come on, Mikey. It took you all of ten minutes.”

“Took you ten weeks just to come up with a suspect for me to talk to,” I snapped back. “If you could’ve closed this one without me, you would’ve.” I snapped my fingers and held out my palm. “Pay up. And I’ll take an extra twenty for calling me Mikey.”

The detective dug out his wallet and shoved another few bills into my hand. Bastard probably tired pocketing it for himself. 

“Pleasure as always, Michael.” He emphasized my name with venom in his voice.

“Whatever you say. Call me next time you can’t hack it.” I tucked the envelope in my pocket, straightened my jacket, and headed for the door without another word.

Most gigs went this way. When police get a perp with strong circumstantial evidence, but nothing forensic, they pay me a couple grand to sit in the room until their suspect sings. Their lawyers would probably have a field day on appeal, assuming they could actually convince a judge what I was doing is supernatural.

Even if they did, I’ve got a strict policy against refunds.

I hopped into the beat up Tacoma that’s been getting me between gigs across the country, and set off for my next stop on my never-ending road trip. The directions I’d gotten from my prospective client led me to a silver-sided dinner off a winding two-lane highway.

By the time I pulled into the gravel lot, the sun was already low on the horizon. Shafts of orange light filtered through the trees. 

I stepped out of the car and inhaled the strong scent of pine needles wafting out of the dark forest. The neon “open” sign was out, but I could just make out the silhouette of a patron lounging at his table. 

I poked my head inside.

“Ah, Michael!” The man waved me over to his retro red booth. “I ordered you a coffee—figured you’ve had a long day on the road.”

“Thanks.” I held out my hand. “And you are?” 

He shook it with a firm, calloused grip. “Thomas Bright.”

I lowered myself onto the vinyl upholstery with a huff. “Well, detective Bright—”

“Ah, actually, just Mister. Thomas will do, even,” he said, cutting me off. “Private Investigator, not a cop.”

I inwardly groaned. This whole trip would wind up being a waste of time. “Oh, well, I’m not sure how much help I’ll be. I’m not a psychic or anything. I just handle interrogations.”

“No, I understand you just fine. That’s precisely what I need help with. See, my client is a rich feller. Thinks his wife is cheating. If he can prove it, there’s an infidelity clause in the prenup.”

Now I understood why he offered such a high price in his initial email.

“I was hoping I could get the two of you in the same place, and maybe she’d just blurt it out. But I’m not sure how this… gift of yours works.”

“Gift,” I snorted. “That’s putting it nicely.”

“What would you call it?”

“Look man, there’s a reason I work gigs up and down the interstate, and it’s not a love for driving,” I said. “When I stay someplace too long, I have this affect on people. They start seeking me out. Like they can smell it.”

I raised the coffee cup to my lips, smelled the aroma, and paused. Still too hot.

“Anything longer than a couple days, people start coming up to me on the street, spilling their guts. Starts mundane, like shoplifting or a tryst. After a while, it gets… darker.”

I stared down at the hot liquid in the mug, black as asphalt. “There’s a lot I wish I could forget.”

“Sorry, I guess I’m still confused. You’ve helped detectives from here to Spokane. You don’t wait in all those towns for months.” It wasn’t a question.

“No.” I hesitated. “There’s another way I do it. Based off of eye contact,” I told the table. “That’s why I’m not looking at you, now. Anything longer than a couple seconds and you might shout your social security number or something.”

I watched coils of steam curl off my coffee. Still too hot.

“Sounds like you could help me, then,” Thomas said.”

“As long as you have a natural way to get me sitting across from her. No breaking the law, you know?”

“Yeah, course. I’ve already got things in motion. She drops by this diner more often than not-that’s why I picked it.”

This wasn’t the worst plan I’d heard from a PI. “Then what, I just strike up a conversation long enough to get her talking?”

“Pretty much. Hey—something wrong?” He gestured to the drink before me. “You prefer tea? I can holler for the waitress, but I think she went out back for a smoke.”

“‘S alright. Just a touch hot.” 

“Creamer?” He pushed a pitcher across the table.

“Ah, sure.” I risked a second glance at his face. Green eyes, a square jaw, with tangerine-color hair poking out beneath his cap. The color looked wrong, somehow. Unnatural.

I splashed in enough cool half-and-half to color the coffee blond, then took a sip. In that moment, I was acutely aware of how tired I’d become from my long day on the road. “Thanks. So we’re just waiting to see if she drops by?”

“That’s the plan.” Thomas leaned back in the booth. You know, I think you and I have actually been involved in the same case before.”

“Really?” I let my coffee cup clatter against the table. “Where at?”

“Back in Western New York. Nasty few murders. You remember? I expect you get so many cases you might forget.”

He was half right. I didn’t do any of the investigative work, or so much as see a scrap of evidence. I rolled in at the 11th hour to provoke the confession. But I did remember that case. All the bourbon in Kentucky couldn’t make me forget what that man said he did to those little girls. Of course, I couldn’t say all that. I just took another swig of coffee and said: “Yeah. I remember. Brutal stuff, that one. You work up there, too?”

“Yeah, you could say that,” he said slowly. “You know, you sorta stole my thunder there. So much time and effort—I didn’t even get credit.”

I held up a hand. “Nothing personal. Just collecting cash. Didn’t mean to stand in the way of your collar.” My stomach growled. Where the hell was that waitress?

“No, you’re not hearing me.” He leaned across the table, close enough that I could feel the heat of his breath. “What I did to those brats, right under their parents noses, outsmarted every cop in a hundred miles—” He slammed his fist on the table, “—and some strip-mall tax accountant gets to claim my title: Butcher of the Plains.”

I looked up at him again. His pupils were still round. The words tumbling out of his mouth weren’t motivated by me. “The hell are you on about? That guy confessed. He’s doing life in prison for it.”

“I know! And I was so angry,” Thomas said. “I started following your work, back and forth across the country. I needed to understand why he would take credit. Even became a real PI in the process.” He laughed. “See, the more cases I saw you close, the more I understand your gift. And it is a gift, just not in your hands.”

“Wh-what?” I stammered. The word felt heavy in my mouth. I stood up, and realized why he’d been so interested in me drinking my coffee. My legs were full of lead, yet seemed scarcely able to support my weight. I stumbled against the counter, catching myself with hands that refused to grip anything. Thomas sat and watched with a degree of detached curiosity.

The front door wasn’t far. But where would I go? No, there had to be someone else in the dinner who could help. I shuffled to the bat wing doors leading to the kitchen, and collapsed against them. They swung open, sending me careening into the room and onto the floor. My head slammed against the cool linoleum. Bright white spots speckled my vision. With my last ounce of strength, I rolled onto my side. A scream caught in my throat; the waitress lay beside me—whether dead or unconscious, I couldn’t tell.

The vinyl seating creaked. A moment later, the kitchen door groaned as it opened.

“Took me a few years, but I think I understand you better than you understand yourself,” Thomas said. He was standing over me now. “See, when you overstay your welcome in a town, people aren’t seeking you out to share their own secrets, they’re sharing each other’s.

Liquid sloshed in a bottle.

“Your presence, your aura—whatever you want to call it—it creates this weird, shared subconscious soup with everyone’s thoughts floating around in it, just begging to be shared, until you’ve got Susie blurting out Sally’s darkest desires.”

But what about the: “In-inter—“ I mumbled.

“Interrogations?” He finished my question before pressing a damp rag over my nose and mouth. It reeked like the inside of a cleaning supply closet, burning my sinuses and throat with every breath I took.

“Figure you’re just forcing the person sitting in front of you to channel this, this…” he fumbled for the word, “secret soup. You’ve left a string of false confessions from San Diego to Syracuse.”

But that was impossible. Those were bad people. I was just helping police.

“I imagine it’s hard to hear cops have just been using you to get bullshit, coerced confessions. That hundreds of innocent people are rotting in prison so you could what, make some easy cash? What a waste of your potential.”

I tried to wriggle away, to hold my breath, but Thomas just applied more pressure. “Don’t you worry.” He was inches from my ear, now. “I’ll put your talent to good use.”

My thoughts felt fuzzy and light. The sensation of my cheek against the floor numbed as I slipped into unconsciousness.

\*\*\*

I awoke upright, in a room lit by a naked light bulb, hanging from a joist. Looking at it made my throbbing head scream in pain. I tried to turn away, but found something rigid on either side of my head, holding me in place. 

Think, Michael.

The place reeked of fertilizer. Unmarked cardboard boxes stood piled up to the ceiling. Was this some kind of basement? Maybe a storage shed? Of course, it didn’t really matter where I was being kept if I couldn’t move. I tried my arms, only to find them bound to the chair. My ankles felt similarly fixed to its legs.

In wiggling my feet, I discovered my left shoe had come off at some point, presumably when Thomas dragged me off to wherever this place was. I rubbed my bare foot back and forth on the ground and felt dusty concrete.

I tested the range of motion my hands had, and got my first piece of good news: the copious amount of duct tape my captor used to bind my arms to the chair, was fixed fairly high up, just below the elbow. This left me with a relatively generous range of motion.

I tucked my elbows into my sides, then flared them out as far as they would go. The tape crackled. I repeated the process, in a grotesque imitation of the chicken dance. Each time, I could reach the tiniest bit farther. With enough time, escape might be possible.

As soon as the thought popped into my head, a door somewhere above me creaked open, and slammed shut. Heavy footfalls clomped down a flight of stairs directly behind me. I held still.

“I know you’re awake.” Thomas tore a long piece of duct tape from a roll. Fingers reached around my head, prying my left eye open. Thomas pressed my upper lid against my eyebrow, and patted a piece of tape over it. “There’s one.” He repeated the process with the right eye. “And there’s two.”

My eyes watered and burned. Each instinctive blink response tugged against the abrasive tape. “What the hell are you doing?” I demanded.

Thomas laughed from somewhere else in the room.

“When you first got that fella to confess, I was furious. Back then I was shortsighted and reckless. Wanted people to know what I was doing for them. They had to understand why those kids had to die.” He grunted. Something heavy scraped across the floor. “In the beginning I wanted to kill you,” he spat, his tone flaring into a sudden burst of rage. He calmed himself. “But, but after following you, watching you, I understood my calling a little better. The work—that’s what’s important. Not the credit.”

Another heave, and another high-pitched scraping noise. What was he moving?

“You’ve kept police off my back. Let me practice in peace. Hone my technique. Master the craft,” Thomas said. “What I’m planning is big. Someone’s got to take the fall. And it can’t be me.” He grunted again, pushing an antique dresser into view. Mounted atop it was a tarnished mirror.

He shoved again, pushing the dresser directly in front of me, and bringing my reflection into view. Satisfied, he brushed off his hands and disappeared again.

I watched him in the reflection, rummaging through one of the cardboard boxes behind me. “There it is,” he muttered.

He held up an audio recording device, flipped it on, and set it down on the edge of the dresser before me.

“I watched so many people confess to any old thing, just because they made eye contact with you for too long.” He leaned over my shoulder. “Got to wondering: what would happen if you had a little staring contest with yourself?”

Realization dawned on me as I stared at myself, unable to look away from my reflection. “Please,” I managed.

“Shh, won’t be long now.” He clapped me on the shoulder.

A strange feeling started to rise in my gut. You know the sensation you get when someone does something so cringe-inducing, you feel embarrassed on their behalf? It was like that, but, with guilt. Guilt for a secret so heinous, I too was culpable by mere adjacency. 

The feeling intensified. Invisible hands grabbed fistfuls of my intestines, and started to twist.

Thoughts flitted through my brain that weren’t mine. I saw people, families, and children, and felt white hot rage. There was a barn, a utility shed with work benches, chemicals, and instructions printed out from dark web chat rooms. Someone needed to confess, it didn’t seem to matter who. The thoughts just needed to be espoused and acknowledged.

In the mirror, I watched my pupils shatter into familiar sunburst shapes. My eyes burned. But the weight of the secret hurt even more.

“Is there anything you want to get off your chest, Michael?”

“Y-yes,” I stammered.
