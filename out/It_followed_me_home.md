I (27m) had gone to my local tavern for a few beers with my friends. Long story short, we were all wasted by the end of the night. That’s when I noticed it. In the corner of the room there was a light out. I didn’t think much of it when I first got there, but as the night went on I noticed myself glancing at that corner more and more. I’d say it was around midnight when I glanced at it and got the feeling that something was watching me from there. My stomach dropped and I suddenly kinda felt like throwing up, then again I was on my 7th beer already. After I had run to the bathroom and slammed the stall door shut, I heard the bathroom door open again. I for some reason thought it was one of my friends pranking me or something and not some random dude at the bar, but then again I didn’t hear them walking after the door closed. 

I’d say it was a solid 20 seconds until I asked the person something along the lines of “Dude, are you going or not?” Another 5 seconds. Then there was a weird scuttling noise I heard coming from the door. I, naturally, being drunk and hearing a strange noise, freaked out and yelled. Turns out it actually was one of my friends, who had gone in to scare me. By the time I walked out of the bathroom, I was super tired, so it was then I decided to leave. I glanced at the broken light again, but it looked like someone had fixed it while I was in the bathroom.

 I was way too drunk to drive home, so like an idiot I walked. Now, I’m already a really paranoid person, and alcohol generally heightens that by a lot. So much for liquid courage, I guess. But anyways, walking home wasted out of my mind at 12:30 A.M probably wasn’t the best idea for my mind. I live about 2 blocks away from the bar, not terribly far but still a decent walk. I was about a quarter way home when I noticed it. It looked like the street lights behind me were going dark right after I passed them. It was also right about then when I noticed the guy walking behind me. The dead street lights made it too dark to make out any of the details on this guy, so I was already kinda freaking out. I started walking faster, and was trying to not look over my shoulder. I gave myself one small glance, and noticed that he was gone. I gave a small relieved sigh, and slowed down again. The street lights looked to be back on, and I almost thought that I had imagined the whole thing. Almost.

 Needless to say I got home safely, and was ready to be done with the day. I went to bed at around 1:20. I woke up at around 3:45, needing to go to the bathroom. When I got there I tried to turn the light on, it was out too. I went in the dark, hoping my aim was decent. I hope it was. But anyways I went back to my room. One problem. The door was locked. The type of lock on my door isn’t a deadbolt, so you can close the door when it’s locked but not open it. I didn’t remember locking it on my way out, cause why would I lock it? At this point, my hangover was just starting out, so I decided I would just go downstairs and make a cup of coffee or something. I didn’t make it to the kitchen. I noticed my front door was open. 

But that door I did remember locking. I inspected it, and noticed the lock was busted, someone broke in. I heard a scuttling noise upstairs. The same one my friend had made in the bathroom a few hours ago. I grabbed the baseball bat I keep near my door and went upstairs. I searched the bathroom, guest bedroom and my bedroom, didn’t find anything. At this point I thought I was going crazy. That’s when I heard the crash coming from my living room. I bolted downstairs to search, and that’s when I saw it. 

 My “friend” was standing there. Now that I think about it, I don’t even think it gave me a name. His head just kinda fell apart, not without a lot of gore, but I’ll spare you the details. Something squirmed it’s way out of the gaping hole that was his throat. It looked like a massive jet black millipede, climbing from the neck of the person I met at that bar around 6 hours ago. It started crawling straight at me, so I hit it with the bat, not without me screaming a lot of course. I collapsed on the couch and dropped the bat after making sure it was dead. I put my hands over my eyes and just kinda massaged my face a bit. That’s when I looked back at the bug. It had turned back into my friend. I ran to the front door. It was shut and locked. I ran upstairs to test the bathroom light. It was working. 

I went back down to him. I searched his pockets for his wallet to check his ID. It said his name was Jeremy Jacobson, 31. I decided to go back to bed and hope that it was a dream. And yes, my bedroom door wasn’t locked either. The next morning I woke up and went back downstairs. My friend was still there. I checked my phone. One of my other friends had sent me a text, “Dude, heard you took Jeremy home yesterday. How’d it go?” I looked back at Jeremy’s body. It was real. I immediately called 911 to get the body and come get me. When they got here they found me and Jeremy's body. I explained what had happened to them. This happened 5 minutes ago. The police haven’t gotten here yet, and I have no idea what to do.
