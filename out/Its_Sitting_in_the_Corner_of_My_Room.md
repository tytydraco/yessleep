I don’t know how long I’ve been awake, watching the dark.

Maybe you’ve done this before—woken up in the middle of the night and just *listened*. At first it’s nothing but the hum of your own breath, maybe the tick of a clock or the settling of wood. But if you stay awake long enough, you start to hear other things. Little things. Things you can’t quite place.

That’s how it started for me.

I live alone, in a small upstairs apartment in a house that’s nearly a century old. Hardwood floors, thin plaster walls, and a draft that rattles the windows whenever the wind picks up. It creaks and pops like old bones, but the landlord was nice and the rent was cheap.

The first night I remember something felt wrong was in late October. I’d left my bedroom window cracked open, and in the middle of the night, I woke to the sound of my closet door creaking. Just a little groan of wood on its hinges.

Half asleep, I mumbled something to myself, rolled over, and yanked the blanket tighter. But the sound didn’t stop. It didn’t swing wide open, either. It just… *rocked.* Like someone inside was gently nudging it, over and over.

When I finally sat up, the room was dark except for the soft orange glow from the streetlamp outside. My closet door was open maybe two inches. Just a sliver. I don’t remember leaving it like that, but I convinced myself I must have.

I got up, shut it, and went back to sleep.

The next morning, though, a strange detail bothered me. As I was getting dressed, I pushed my closet door shut and noticed the latch didn’t catch. The little metal hook was slightly bent, like it had been forced.

I told myself I’d fix it later.

This happened again and again for the next couple nights, I'd lay down to go to bed, and in the middle of the night the closet door would just start rocking back and forth. I finally had enough and put a chair in front of it and went back to bed.

But the next night, it happened again. I woke at 2:47 a.m.—the numbers seared into my brain from the glowing red alarm clock—and the closet was open. Not wide. Just a few inches, like before. but the chair had been moved to the other corner of my room.

This time, I didn’t get up. I lay there frozen, staring into that slice of blackness between the door and the frame. My heart was hammering so hard I swore I could hear it echo in my skull.

And then… I heard it.

A breath. Long. Low. Drawn out.

Coming from the dark inside.

I yanked the covers over my head like a terrified child and stayed that way until the morning sun bled through the curtains.

Over the next week, it became routine. Always between 2:40 and 3:00 a.m., I’d wake to find the closet cracked open. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Once, it was nearly halfway open, and I swear I saw something shift inside—like fabric moving, though there were no clothes hanging where I saw the motion.

I started avoiding my room after dark. I’d fall asleep on the couch with the TV playing old sitcoms and wake up with a stiff neck and the sun already rising. But eventually, exhaustion won, and I found myself back in that bed, staring at the closet night after night.

That’s when the dreams started.

At first, they were vague—just the feeling of being watched. I’d dream of lying in bed, staring at the closet, only to wake and find I was already doing that in real life. One dream bled into the next until I wasn’t sure where sleep ended and waking began.

And then one night, I dreamt I was standing inside the closet. The air was damp, cold, and thick with the smell of mold and dust. I couldn’t see the walls—just blackness stretching forever—but I *knew* I wasn’t alone. Something was crouched in the dark with me, breathing. Waiting.

I woke gasping, my sheets damp with sweat. My closet door was open all the way.

I tried to rationalize it. Old hinges. Drafts. Sleep paralysis. My brain playing tricks.

But then, things started happening outside the closet.

One morning, I woke to find long scratches in the wood of my nightstand. Three parallel grooves, deep enough to catch my fingernail. Another time, the picture frame on my dresser was facedown, the glass cracked. I live alone. I don’t *move in my sleep*.

The worst was two nights ago. I woke at 2:53 a.m. to the sound of wood *splintering*. My lamp flickered, dimmed, and then popped, plunging the room into total dark. And in that suffocating silence, I heard the unmistakable sound of **bare feet slapping across the floor.**

Not inside the closet. Not in the hall. **In my room.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. And then, right by my bed, inches from my face, I heard it.

Whispering.

Not words I could understand. Just a hushed, wet, rasping whisper, like syllables chewed and spat out. My skin went ice-cold, my muscles locked, and for the first time in my life, I prayed out loud.

And it stopped.

Yesterday, I went for a walk to clear my head and noticed the bulb in the street lamp out-front of my house as shattered.  I called my landlord. He swore no one had keys but him. I begged him to check the walls, the closet, the floorboards—anything. He humored me, probably just to shut me up, and looked. Nothing. No signs of animals. No signs of entry.

Last night, I set up my phone to record while I slept. I angled it toward the closet, hit record, and forced myself to lie down. I didn’t want to look, but I had to know.

This morning, when I checked the video, I nearly dropped my phone.

At 2:47 a.m., the closet door creaked open. Slowly. Like wood protesting against being touched by something that wasn’t supposed to exist in this world. For a moment, nothing—just the kind of black that swallows everything whole, darker than shadow, darker than night.

Then it came crawling out.

Its arms were the first thing I saw—too long, too thin, bending in angles that screamed broken but moved with a sick, spider-like grace. The joints didn’t line up like bones should. They bent backward and sideways, popping with every movement. Its skin wasn’t even skin—it looked stretched, translucent, like wet paper clinging to bone. Blue-black veins pulsed underneath, as though the thing’s blood didn’t want to stay inside its body.

The smell hit me next. Metallic, cloying, sweet and rotten—like pennies mixed with spoiled meat left in the sun. With every drag of its body across the floor, that smell grew stronger, filling the room until I thought I’d choke on it.

It unfolded itself slowly, piece by piece, like a marionette being pulled upright by invisible strings. Its torso was too long, ribs pushing against thin flesh, each sharp enough to cut through. One side of its chest rose and fell as though it was trying to breathe, but the other side… stayed still, sunken, collapsed.

Its head dangled low, chin pressed against its sternum, a mat of greasy, black strands hanging like seaweed. Then, with a snap so loud it echoed on the recording, the head jerked upward.

That face…

If a face is what it was.

The eyes were pits of wet darkness, glossy like oil and rimmed in torn flesh, as though they’d been dug into the skull instead of born there. They glistened, not reflecting light but *absorbing it*, pulling it in until nothing remained. And then it blinked—sideways, like a reptile.

The nose was nothing but two torn slits, raw and wet, whistling as it sucked in air. But the mouth… oh God, the mouth…

It stretched impossibly wide, splitting upward into the cheeks with each second it opened, flesh tearing, dribbling with thick black blood that hissed when it hit the floorboards. The teeth weren’t teeth at all—they were shards, jagged and uneven, jutting out in multiple rows, each glistening red like they’d been chewed down to nerves. As it smiled, I could hear them grinding together, the sound like broken glass scraping on stone.

And the worst part—the tongue. Long. Too long. It lolled out between the teeth, split at the tip like a serpent’s, dripping with blood that wasn’t its own. It dragged across the wood, leaving behind a slick, dark trail that shimmered in the faint light.

It stood there, cocking its head at an angle so sharp the neck stretched thin and split, spilling more black blood down its chest. It didn’t flinch. It didn’t falter. It just stared at me sleeping.

At 2:53, it stopped watching me. Slowly, deliberately, it turned toward the camera.

And smiled.

The flesh around its lips tore further as it stretched the grin wider and wider, until the corners split up to the ears. Blood welled and poured down its jaw, thick drops spattering onto the floor. Something twitched inside its throat—something moving, writhing, as though another mouth was trying to push its way out.

Then the screen went black.

I shot awake to the blaring of my alarm clock. Heart racing, lungs burning like I’d been holding my breath. My hand fumbled for the snooze button, and I froze.

The glowing red numbers burned into my eyes: **2:53 AM.**

The alarm kept screaming.

My skin prickled, my mouth went dry. I turned, slow as stone cracking, and there it was.

The thing.

Crouched in the far corner of my room, bent low, arms folded like a grotesque insect preparing to leap. Its head tilted at that impossible angle, those bottomless black eyes locked onto mine. That grin was still there, teeth glistening wet in the dark, blood still dripping steady onto my floorboards.

And then it whispered.

Not loud. Not in words I could understand. Just a hiss of sound, wet and broken, rattling out from a throat that shouldn’t make noise at all. The kind of whisper you don’t just hear—you *feel* it, hot against your ear, crawling under your skin, seeping into your bones.

The alarm was still going off. The numbers still frozen.

**2:53 AM.**

And the whispering hasn’t stopped.
