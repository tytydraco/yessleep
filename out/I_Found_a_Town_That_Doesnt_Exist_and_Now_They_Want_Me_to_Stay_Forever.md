I never meant to find Black Hollow. It wasn’t on any map, and the GPS had glitched out miles back, leaving me stranded on a winding forest road. The rain had been pouring for hours, and my car’s headlights barely cut through the thick fog that clung to the trees like a shroud. I was lost, tired, and desperate for shelter when I saw the sign—a rusted, crooked thing that read: *“Welcome to Black Hollow. Population: 47.”*

The town was… wrong. The streets were empty, the houses dark, and the air smelled faintly of rot, like something had died and been left to fester. The only light came from a single flickering streetlamp, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. I parked my car and stepped out, my shoes squelching in the mud. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, but the silence was deafening.

That’s when I saw them.

Figures began to emerge from the shadows, their movements slow and deliberate. They were dressed in tattered, old-fashioned clothes, their faces pale and gaunt. Their eyes… their eyes were the worst. Hollow, empty, like they’d been scooped out and replaced with nothing but darkness. They didn’t speak, just stared at me with those awful, empty eyes.

“I’m sorry,” I stammered, backing toward my car. “I didn’t mean to intrude. I’ll leave.”

One of them stepped forward, a tall man with a long, ragged coat. His voice was a low, guttural rasp. “You can’t leave. Not now. You’ve seen us.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I turned and ran, my heart pounding in my chest. But the streets seemed to twist and shift, the houses closing in around me. No matter which way I turned, I always ended up back at the same spot, beneath that flickering streetlamp. The figures were closer now, their hollow eyes fixed on me.

“You belong here,” the tall man said, his voice echoing in the empty streets. “You’ve always belonged here.”

I woke up in a small, dimly lit room. The walls were bare, the floor cold and damp. A single candle burned on a rickety table, casting flickering shadows across the room. My head throbbed, and my mouth tasted like copper. I tried to stand, but my legs were weak, and I collapsed back onto the floor.

That’s when I noticed the symbols carved into the walls—strange, twisting shapes that seemed to move in the candlelight. They made my head spin, and I had to look away. The door creaked open, and the tall man stepped inside. He was holding something—a small, black book with a symbol etched into the cover.

“You’ve been chosen,” he said, his voice low and reverent. “The Hollow has chosen you.”

“What are you talking about?” I demanded, my voice shaking. “Let me go!”

He ignored me, opening the book and beginning to read. The words were in a language I didn’t understand, but they made my skin crawl. The symbols on the walls seemed to pulse in time with his chanting, and the air grew thick and heavy. I could feel something—something ancient and malevolent—pressing down on me, suffocating me.

“Stop!” I screamed, covering my ears. “Please, stop!”

But he didn’t stop. The chanting grew louder, more frantic, and the room began to spin. The candle flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. I felt hands—cold, bony hands—gripping me, pulling me down. I struggled, but they were too strong. I could feel myself being dragged into the floor, into the earth itself.

And then, silence.

I woke up in my car, the rain still pouring outside. The town was gone, the forest stretching out in every direction. My hands were shaking, and my clothes were damp with sweat. I told myself it had been a nightmare, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion and stress.

But then I saw it—a small, black book lying on the passenger seat. The symbol on the cover was the same as the one carved into the walls of that room. I opened it, and the pages were filled with the same strange, twisting symbols. And at the very end, written in shaky handwriting, were the words:

*“You can’t leave. You belong to the Hollow now.”*

I tried to throw the book away, but it always finds its way back to me. I’ve tried to tell myself it’s just a coincidence, that I’m imagining things. But I can feel them watching me, even now. Their hollow eyes, their cold hands. They’re waiting for me to return.

And the worst part? I think I want to.
