I’m new to this whole reddit thing, but a member of my little group said I should post some of these logs. They might seem unbelievable, but who knows, maybe someone will believe us. We want to expose this anonymous Organisation for their reckless endangerment of human life with their observations.  


This first document that I have written out for you was the first audio log we ever found, and we think that perhaps it is best to go in order of our discovery of the documents. This mentions a creature called a “Wendigo” and it’s lifecycle. It’s a malevolent spirit or something, it smells horrible, and constantly craves human flesh. The Document is written below.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1: We have finally gotten funding from the government to capture and research the creatures that inspired the Native American legends. We’ve already tracked down this creature called a “Not-Deer,” and Edward has a theory that the Not-Deer and Wendigos may have a similarity, so we are planning on putting it under observation.

Day 4: We finally caught it. The damn thing was eating the corpse of a deer when it was found, but it must have heard the recovery team because the thing bolted, and from the what the footage looks like it is fucking fast. I didn't think something that looked so malnourished could be so quick. We’ve got it stored in this massive containment cell designed to look like a tiny fraction of a forest, because if Edward’s theory is correct it may need the space, but we also got every square inch under some kind of observation.

Day 9: The Not-Deer has an absurd appetite, it’s a wonder it can eat so much considering its size. We didn’t know how much it would eat so we just took three Bull Moose carcasses and put them in its containment chamber and left it for a couple of hours. We came back and the carcasses were nowhere to be found, just skeletons and a shit ton of blood and small scraps of flesh.

Day 10: Something strange is happening to the creature. Our thermal cameras are picking up the Not-Deer’s body temperature as 10° Fahrenheit, which should be impossible due to it being a warm blooded animal, and is still technically alive. Edward might have been right, as Wendigos were said to have a heart of ice. The room itself has been cooling down too, albeit very slowly. We should probably up our security though, assuming we do have a future Wendigo on our hands.

Day 17: We’ve been debating the origins of the Not-Deer, and one of the most popular theories going around the compound is a zombie-esque theory. John came up with the idea that a Not-Deer is created by a deer that survives a Wendigo bite, but this has also brings up the Chicken or the Egg problem, but Edward also pointed out that the Natives believed Wendigos could form from being possessed by a malevolent and hungry spirit, which could solve said problem.

Day 19: I think I need to see a fucking therapist. I was observing the Not-Deer on the cameras when the skin and muscle of the damn thing's head just fell off. It’s eyes turned black as night and the skin literally just fucking fell of the head like old rags. After the skin fell off, the creature STARTED FUCKING EATING IT! I have no idea how the hell it ate its own skin since it had no muscle or tendons on its head whatsoever.

Day 32: We greatly reduced the size of the meals we’ve been giving the creature, down to one normal deer carcass. It seems like since we were giving it so much food we had greatly accelerated its growth rate. It’s begun walking on its hind legs and its body is starting to deform to a humanoid shape. We’re planning on installing a robotic arm to feed the beast, since it might start craving human flesh soon, not to mention the ungodly stench coming from its room. 

Day 40: Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! That fucking monster is smart. Some guy named Bill has a wife that works on the same site as us and it mimicked her, and now Bill’s fucking dead. That idiot knew what it could do and he still went into the monster’s room, and now I have to watch him get torn to fleshly ribbons over and over so I can file a loss of personnel form. It’s calling out to us to let it out in Bill’s voice. I'm starting to think we should kill the creature before it becomes out of control.

Fuck protocol, I’m not doing this stupid Day shit anymore… It’s in the vents. I can hear it crawling around. The facility is on lockdown, no one in or out. We didn’t think it would be able to get in the vents so we didn’t bother installing any kind of defense system in them. It’s already killed almost everyone, and I watched it tear through the Security team’s body armor as if it were wet paper. Not only that, but there are a couple of survivors that fell victim to that psychic magic shit the Wendigo has, and now they go around killing and cannibalizing the bodies. I can hear my mother’s voice calling to me in the vents. I think I’m the last one alive.

I blocked the vent, but it found the door. It’s trying to tear through the door, and I think it's going to get through. Fuck the Organisation, I want to go home. I miss my dogs, I miss my chair, and I miss my books. I don’t want to do this anymore. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don’t know how I’d write it out, but at the end of the audio log there was a sound of screeching metal, a scream, then fleshy sounds. There were a couple of bones near the original location of the audio log, so we can assume they belonged to the poor lad.

I am preparing the next Document for your reading. It’s about the “Dark Watchers” of the California mountains. If it helps make any of you readers believe even more, I can add some stories of my group’s expeditions. 

Until Next Time…
