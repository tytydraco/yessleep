Before anyone ask me about it i'll clarify that it's been nearly 6-8 years ago when life really wasn't going well for me but that's another story. At the time i earned what i could by robbing stuff and delivered to gangs in exchange for money,it wasn't the best way to earn a living but i just didn't want a job for whatever reason i had back then,you know,young adult life but let's move for what matters.

As i got the money after an risky robbery,i was heading for the place that i used to call "home'" which was more of a place to sleep and eat,when my crappy old phone ringed and i got a call from one of the gangs i stealed things for,they told me about an nearby school  which supposedly had an hidden safe full of cash within the principal's office,they ordered me to find a way in and steal the money,if i managed to i would recieve half the amount as reward.

Thinking that it could be a huge chance to actually earn something i wasted no time in grabbing my mask and some very basic tools and asked about the location. After reaching the place i analysed the surroundings and found my way inside by the campus and started looking for the office as i carefully walked around the vaguely lit hallways,staying in the shadows to make sure i wouldn't be noticed. After a long time searching i saw some signs on the wall which guided to upper classrooms and to my luck the principal's office.

From there it was just more walk until i noticed a security guard coming out of the corner with a flashlight,i immediately hid and crawled out of the flashlight's range,those minutes felt like hours until i was fully sure it was safe to go as the guard's footsteps faded away onto the echoing halls,with a small club i managed to knock the guard out to make sure he wouldn't spot me if he passed by again. From there on i managed to find the principal's office and started to look for the supposed money safe but there was nothing,no safe,no hidden money,just loads of paperwork,feeling the loss i decided to head back when i noticed another flashlight and quickly hid behind the desk.

I thought to myself:
"HOW?!JUST HOW?!WAS SOMETHING WRONGLY PLANNED?!"

I was pretty sure there was only one security guard at the building which is the one i knocked out,but then i paid attention to the sounds and the footsteps sounded heavier and tense,curiosity got the best of me so i peeked a little from the side of the desk and caught a glimpse of an tall humanoid being,i couldn't see much besides it's height before i quickly hid again from fear.

That's when i heard the security guard's voice:

"This is no place to be at this time,leave the premises now."

They sounded somewhat rusty and muffled but i thought it was because i was covered by the desk and the room that is until i heard the guard's voice again:

"Who-WHAT ARE YOU?!?!WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!ANSWER ME-"

And then there was what sounded like a giant slice and then silence,i finally gathered courage to look outside,whatever the tall thing was,it was gone and only an fatal wounded security guard remained with a huge slash in his chest,laying at the floor as he kept bleeding,i approached to help,maybe bring him outside and call for 911 but he just told me wjth his last breaths:

"Young man...just...leave,agh,you st-til have a chance to survive...leave this life of risk behind and...enjoy the best."
"What about you?i you're still breathing,i'm sure i can take you to help-"
"No...i won't be able to survive any longer...i-i don't know what that is...but it will come for you...please...don't become it's next victim..."

And as he finished that sentence he fell dead on my arms,not even minding that i was a robber,and i really know he was telling me the best option i had,so i got my things and grabbed his baton in case i had to fight back even if it meant death. As i walked to the way i entered i went extra silent and tried not to make a single noise,from time to time i'd hear it's footsteps or his light around the corner so i'd hide.

As i finally found the way i got in i noticed lights flickering behind me,i knew jt was best not to but again curiosity got to me so i turned my head over my shoulder and saw it,it was indeed humanoid but jt was much taller,it almost reached the ceiling,it only had one arm but instead of an actual arm it had a rusty metal blade and on it's head it was just shining with light from a source i couldn't identify, and it spoke:

"This is no place to be at this time,leave the premises now."

Scared as it very slowly made it's way toward me,i closed my eyes to not be blinded and threw the baton at the monster's head and only heard it screeching,i turned to the way out and wasted no time in getting out as i heard it roar in anger,i thought for a moment that it almost latched onto my leg but i got out fast enough and found two police cruisers waiting outside,someone saw me break in and called the cops and they were waiting.

I surrendered as it would be best,i got interrogated regarding the guard's death but they couldn't link what i told them about the creature,they did check the footage and only saw the moment the bright light covered the camera's view and then the dying guard on the floor. After that i was sentenced but all those years in prison was filled with nightmares and trauma from the incident,i got myself clean and managed to restart my life,but i still think that the thing is still residing at that building,waiting for a new guard to be hired or for someone unluck enough to get in.
