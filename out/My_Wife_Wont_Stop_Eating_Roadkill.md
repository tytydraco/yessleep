I put my phone down and looked to my left, my wife wasn’t in bed. She was always there when I woke up.

Then I saw her, huddled up in the corner of the room, crouched over with her back to me.

“Babe, what are you doing?” I asked with a chuckle.

*Crunch.*

“Are you eating something?” I asked, confused.

She didn’t respond. She just stayed in the corner.

I got up out of bed and walked over. I grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back slightly so I could see what she was eating.

“What are you eat—”

She turned her head toward me, twisting her neck violently.

Her eyes were dilated and bloodshot. Eyes that glowed faintly, not with light, but as if reflecting a fire that isn’t there.

There was blood all over her grinning mouth and full cheeks, dripping down her chin, neck, and chest. Her long arms and legs were covered in dirt like she’d dig herself out of a grave. 

She stank of rotting flesh. The air around her curdled with a stink like raw meat left in the sun, sour and sweet at once, clinging to the back of my throat until my stomach lurched.

She held in her blood-soaked hands the carcass of a decomposing raccoon. When I say rotting, I mean fully decomposing. It must have been dead for days.

“Wendi? What are you doing?!” I screamed, falling backward onto the floor.

She stared at me like a wolf preying on a lamb. She looked angry, startled, and hungry.

She shook her head manically, blinking hard and fast. She dropped the raccoon and began to cry.

“Jack… I… I don’t know what’s happening to me,” she whimpered, sobbing uncontrollably.

I could tell this wasn’t my wife. Her voice sounded off. She must be going through a psychotic episode, no person would do this. I had to get her help medical help. 

I rushed to my phone and called 911. I asked for an ambulance immediately.

When this first happened, I thought it had to be a mental breakdown. I had my wife voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward for 72 hours.

I had married my high school sweetheart after graduation. We bought a house with help from our parents, I got a job in construction, and she got a job as a receptionist at a vet’s. We were living the American dream.

Well, like with all dreams I suppose eventually you have to wake up. One week ago, I woke up to my wife doing that.

I woke up that morning and looked at my phone. It was 5:15 a.m. I had woken up earlier than usual. My parents had texted a picture of their new dog to the family group chat. 

There was also an Amber Alert. My neighbor, a single mother, had reported her kid missing. The dad was a real deadbeat and the prime suspect.

After I got a taxi back from the hospital, I decided to clean everything up straight away. I came home home to see crows gathered on our rooftop.

 I scrubbed the blood out of the carpet with white vinegar and put what was left of the raccoon in a trash bag. I put it in the trash can outside. 

I didn’t know how else you were supposed to dispose of half-eaten roadkill.

*Where had she even found it?*

I worked early shifts, starting at 7 a.m. and finishing around 4. My wife worked 9 to 5 at the vet’s, two or three days a week. She’d often change those days around. We didn’t mind. I made enough money, and she liked being home.

I kept thinking about where she’d found that raccoon. Had she really wandered the side of the road and picked it up?

Then I remembered the crawl space. I hadn’t been down there. *Ever.* I was the claustrophobic type.

I opened the hatch and shined my flashlight down onto the dirt. There were small drops of blood. The raccoon must have died down there, and she found it. But why would she have been looking in the crawl space?

I climbed down, and the smell hit me. That same stench of rotting fruit. It was that same sweet-sour stench again, like fruit gone to liquor and meat gone to maggots, a smell that felt alive and crawling.

It was so strong I heaved and puked onto the dirt. I aimed the flashlight deeper into the darkness and saw something that’s been haunting me ever since.

There was a mountain—not a pile, not a few—a mountain of rodents and animals in the corner of the crawl space. They were all dead. Some still fresh, others nothing but bone.

It wasn’t just raccoons. It was everything. Pigeons, foxes, rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, cats, dogs, even a deer. Some I couldn’t even recognize anymore.

Some were almost whole. Some looked stripped clean. But a few looked like the raccoon from earlier…half-eaten.

I passed out. Only briefly. When I came to, I had a pounding headache and a dry mouth. My body was shaking. I vomited again. I had to get out. I crawled out as fast as I could and ran into the backyard, where I threw up a few more times.

*How had she collected all of that?*

*Why was she doing this? There’s being unwell, and then there’s whatever that was.*

I went to my parents’ house and stayed in my old room. I told them everything. They were horrified but tried to stay calm.

The next day, my dad came with me to the house to clean the crawl space. It was the worst thing either of us had ever done, but we got through it.

One of the carcasses didn’t look like the others. It looked like it had been sucked on for days. The bones were almost clean.

For a second, I thought it looked…like a baby…but I told myself that was impossible. The bones were too broken and scattered to tell. 

They released Wendi 72 hours later. The psychiatrist called it a “brief psychotic episode triggered by stress.”

I didn’t argue. I wanted to believe it.

When she came home, she seemed like herself again. Warm, quiet, a little tired. She apologized for everything and said she didn’t remember any of it. I told her it wasn’t her fault. That’s what you do when you love someone. 

You pretend everything’s okay.

For the next couple days, it was.

She cooked, cleaned, went back to work. We ate dinner together.

My mom and dads dog had ran away, they were devastated. My neighbors kids still hadn’t shown up.

She stopped going to work. She said she had a fight with her boss and that she would just get another job.

She stopped seeing her doctor for her outpatient treatment plan. She said she was fine and that it’s time we moved past the whole thing.

Then the little things started to change.

She stopped buying meat from the store. Said it was too expensive.
She stopped using the oven and started cooking late at night, when I was asleep.

Sometimes, when I came downstairs for water, she’d be sitting at the table in the dark…just sitting there, breathing slow and heavy like she’d been running.

Then the smell came back. That same sweet, rotten-fruit stench.

It clung to her clothes, her hair, her breath.

When I asked about it, she said maybe it was the drains.

But drains don’t leave muddy paw prints by the back door.

Last night, I woke up to a noise outside…something dragging across the grass. I looked out the window and saw Wendi, barefoot, walking down the driveway in her nightgown. She was holding a trash bag.

I followed her quietly, half terrified, half furious. She crossed the road and disappeared behind the tree line. Her silhouette looked so gaunt. When I caught up, she was crouched over something.

I’ll never forget the sound. The tearing. The chewing.

I shouted her name, and she looked up at me. Her mouth was red, her teeth slick, her eyes wide like a child caught doing something wrong.

“It’s fresh,” she whispered. “I didn’t want it to go to waste.”

I saw what was in front of her.

It wasn’t an animal.

I couldn’t believe it.

She started crying…but no tears ran from her eyes now. This time her eyes and painfully wide grin stayed the same. 

“J—Jack…I was just hungry…that’s all baby.”
