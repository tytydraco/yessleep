The dream was in my city, where on the outskirts of it , a fair was going on.

Me and my gf are in the same city ,10-15 kilo-metres apart, we would meet rarely and our communication is always through calls and texts.

one day she went to that fair where she wanted to go with her, and I couldn't go for some reasons. The very next day she calls me to say she had a great time there.  
she said she rode a bike there, some race was going on and people pay to race against each other, which my gf did and went on to enjoy at some big ferris wheel fair, which was her dream to be at, she had felt peace for first time in her life.

And for the first time we had no conflicts or fights, we just had peaceful conversations, she was really happy about that ferris wheel thing.

All of these she said me on call and we talked as usual for next few days.  
Until one day came where my parents told me to go with them to that fair.

I told my gf that I was going to the fair, she said its really fun there and we talked for half an hour and she warned me to not go to the bike ride as it was really dangerous, and I said I wouldn't, but in my heart I was really wanting to enjoy the bike ride.

**Before cutting the call,** we talked about how we would marry and have our future together,

and that she wanted a scooter and she would roam around with me when it rains and we would get our shit together and build our own house and have crazy adventures.

When she was saying all these she seemed pretty emotional and so was I , cuz it was all we could dream for and she said me that she will be by my side forever, which made me tear up a bit and I said her we will be together forever.

**Upon reaching the fair**, the first thing that I did was go to that bike ride and when I reached there , The ride was closed since someone died while racing. I was pretty tensed and it was closed for a week till now and I got scared , I called my gf she didnt pick up, she texted me she was busy in house chores.  
Then when I reached to see the accident spot , I saw my gf's scarf which I gave to her on our 2nd date which her mother really liked. I was soo scared , I asked the people there about who met with the accident they told me it was a 28 yr old woman and the details they said pretty much resembled my gf.

I was drop dead upon hearing those things, I was calling my gf she wasn't picking up , her phone was dead. Then when I came up close to a bangles shop there was this poster where my gf's picture was there and that it said she died in the bike accident.

I got hallucinations where I saw a random woman saying me things which my gf would say to me in my darkest days-- **"With you, I've found my home and my forever."**
