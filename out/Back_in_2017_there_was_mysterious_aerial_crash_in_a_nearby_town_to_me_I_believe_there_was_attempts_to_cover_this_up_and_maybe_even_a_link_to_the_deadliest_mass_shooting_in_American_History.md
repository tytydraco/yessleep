This happened a long time ago so some details may be fuzzy. I realize how insane my title sounds but it’s not hyperbole. I have Wanted to tell this story for a long time but I got so involved with it and was so paranoid at the time that I wanted to forget all about it. And for a while I did, but then I found these pictures again and all the questions came back.

On October 1st 2017, in a town called Tellico Plains, TN, there was a plane crash in the forest.

Something you should know about Tellico is that it’s a very small town. I mean VERY small. A gas station a Hardee’s and a Piggly Wiggly is about all you can find down there. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows everything about everyone. All that to say that there’s no reason to go down there except for the natural forest. There is 1 road the goes up the mountain alongside the river. If you drive far enough you can go to the waterfalls or a lake atop of the mountain so it’s a fairly popular camping/swimming spot.

The crash happened and no one knew about it. Which is really weird because in small towns the smallest news travel fast and something like this would definitely get heads turning. Specially cause all the surrounding towns are basically the same. A whole lot of nothing.

So me and a friend decided to make the drive up there a few days to go to the waterfalls during the fall. And here is where everything starts to get a little weird. Shortly after we turn into the one road that goes up the mountain we are greeted by 2 men in suits telling us the road is closed. There was one of those barricades that said “road closed” which is pretty normal but the suits? That struck me as odd. It’s usually the guys in the neon vests waving everyone away but I’ve never seen suits? I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And the feeling was amplified because when we asked they would not tell us why the road was closed.

So I got home and started looking online for any info and I couldn’t find anything. Nothing at all regarding what may be causing the road closure and the reason why is probably because of what happened the next day.

On October 2nd 2017, in Las Vegas NV, at a music festival, the deadliest shooting in American history took place.

Before moving forward, I can’t emphasize enough how much I am not trying to make light of that situation. What happened that day was horrible and I wouldn’t even joke about it. I’m pointing out that this happened because the news were covering this 24/7 for a long time. And I think that is why I couldn’t find anyone talking about what was going in this small town.

So eventually I did find an article (and if you look it up now there are several more. I don’t know why and can’t explain why I couldn’t find any then. I will link to one of them at the end of this post) but once again I was left with more questions. The article stated that there was a jet containing explosives that crashed in the forest. The jet was being piloted by a student accompanied by an instructor. This didn’t make sense to me. Why would a flying student be piloting a jet with explosives? To my knowledge there isn’t any kind of army bases nearby. And if it was all just An accident what’s up with the suits? Why wouldn’t they tell us?

I could not get it out of my head. Something wasn’t adding up. I was talking to someone I knew who lived there and even they hadn’t heard about it. It was driving me crazy. So I decided to drive down there again at night. But what I found only left me with more questions than answers. The road was still blocked but there was no one there. I did see a notice stapled to a post (pictured below) so I grabbed it hoping it could help me figure out what was going on.

The notice has a statement about public safety and a map of the affected area. The affected area seems pretty big and it almost looks like it’s spreading? Like it has a trail towards the bottom. I kept going down there waiting for the road to open to no avail. I kept searching the web, talking to locals and nothing. Why was no one talking about this?

I still had so many questions. Who were the suites? Why the secrecy? Why a student flyer flying with explosives? And now I can’t find any articles mentioning the explosives which makes the whole thing weirder. What was aboard that jet? Why would there be such a big closure and affected area if there were no explosives? Did the Las Vegas shooting have anything to do with it? Did something so big happen that a shooting of that scale was orchestrated to cover it up? I know how far fetched that sounds but if you know anything about that shooting a lot of things didn’t add up which led people to believe it was a “false flag”. That’s a whole other story that you can look into if you haven’t. I have no proof that those 2 events are connected but the timing of it all was very coincidental. I tried to find anything that tied the two and I’m 99% convinced I started being followed. I would see this all blacked out sedan follow me on my way to work and then park outside my job site there for a while then leave. I would also see an att van park across the street from my work next to a light post several weeks in a row. No one would ever come out and do anything. It would sit there for most of the day then leave before I did.

I know how stupid that sounds but I truly couldn’t shake the feeling off. Was I getting too close to something? Was I just being extremely paranoid? Maybe. I don’t have a history of mental health issues and I don’t do any drugs as I’m sure some of you will be wondering. Regardless it was affecting my day to day life so I couldn’t do it anymore. I needed to get away from it and so I did. I’m sure I was the last person wondering about it at this point so no one ever said anything about it again and to this day I feel like we don’t have all the answers.
