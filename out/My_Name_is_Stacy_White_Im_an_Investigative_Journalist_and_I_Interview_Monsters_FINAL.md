For our final interview I walked in and began setting up my equipment without any pleasantries. I knew Molly would talk and there was no reason I should pretend any warm regards. I could feel her eyes tracking me as I moved, “We can continue where you left off.” I told her bluntly.

“You’ve changed, Stacy White.” She commented, but continued without further prompting. “The weeks that followed the ‘incident’ were the most difficult. There were a few livestock that managed to escape entirely and their appearance in the nearby towns caused some complications. It seemed as though every second day law enforcement arrived on our doorstep demanding entry to search the premises.

It had been scheduled that Master's parents would visit the Dunkel Estate in the summer to inspect the year's graduated pets. However, that was no longer possible and it was decided that we would travel to our sister castle to showcase them instead. Nathaniel struggled to control Eric, for every command he gave the orphan resisted. Simple tasks became difficult and this did not go unnoticed by my master.

‘You seem weary little brother.’ He mused as they worked together on paperwork one afternoon.

‘I’m perfectly fine.’ Nathaniel muttered without looking up from his writing though it was plain to see that he was fatigued.  His ashy hair was slightly less kept than normal and faint circles were evident under his eyes.

‘Is your pet still giving you problems?’ Master asked, amused.

‘No. He is perfectly under control.’

‘I see, and where is he at this moment?’

Nathaniel paused for a moment as his eyes glowed faintly, ‘He is fine. My shadow is with him, he is training with Calla and Markos is watching over him.’ He answered finally.

‘Molly, go check that all is well.’ Master ordered in response and I gave a polite bow before moving to do as I was asked.

‘That’s not necessary brother, I will be there soon..’ I heard Nathaniel protest as I left. I arrived at the courtyard to see he was sparring with Calla, his shadow was unnaturally doubled and he trained viciously. He no longer withheld the use of his leg and seemed to be trying in earnest to kill the girl. Their swords clashed together with some considerable force as they struggled.

She was a small thing, no more than 5’2”, with ice blonde hair and dull brown eyes. Below her left eye she had a silver crescent which signified her contract to Markos, though I’m not sure what the terms were.

Eventually, Eric missed a strike and the girl took her chance to trip him, aiming her sword at his heart as she announced, ‘You lose. You shouldn’t use your left hand, it makes you weaker. Surely your right hand can still hold a sword.’ She chastised.

‘The point of training is to improve on weaknesses.’ He growled in response.

‘Are you still upset with me?’ She asked though her tone held no emotion.

‘You shot me. *Twice*.’

‘I was under orders, don’t take it so personally.’

‘You didn’t even try to resist.’

‘It was only your leg.'

‘That’s quite enough for today, we still have work to do. Calla, *say farewell*.’ Markos interrupted up though his voice was still soft.

‘Farewell Eric Linnaeus.’ She followed the instruction docilely, 'We leave tomorrow morning for the Leúchtend Estate. I expect I will see you there within a few days?’

‘I don’t know. I don’t talk to him if I can avoid it.’ He muttered. Truthfully his contempt was astounding given the repercussions of it.

Markos had been summoned to the Leúchtend on a separate matter. He was needed for his medical skills, and I suspected that their elder sister Lucinde may have been pregnant with her third child. However as they left Eric remained where he was. I assumed he may have been given some order which stated he may not move without supervision for he seemed irritated to have to wait.

‘I know you’re there Molly.’ He informed me coldly.

‘I’m making no effort to hide.’ I answered simply.

‘How can you serve them so willingly?’ He asked me now and I wasn’t prepared for the question.

‘Why do you fight them so much? Had they ever hurt you before you rebelled?’ I countered.

‘Because I want my freedom, and they’re monsters. They eat people. When they’re done with you and I, they will send us to the slaughterhouse to be butchered just as they do with every other human. Don’t you understand that?’

‘All things must eat.’ I responded unbothered, ‘You care too much for the nature of it. What does it matter what happens to people you never truly knew? Their prey is the young, the feeble and the elderly. They do not suffer, the process is quick and rarely do they take healthy adults. You’re fortunate Nathaniel allowed you to live, Master proposed many times that you should be put down.’

‘You’re a brainwashed puppet.’ He said spitefully.

‘Now Eric, that’s unkind language to use.’ Nathaniel spoke as he entered the area, then commanded ‘*You may move, come to me*.’

‘I don’t care if it’s unkind, it’s true.’ Eric stated as he turned to go to Nathaniel and his second shadow returned to its owner.

‘How was your training? *Answer*.’ Nathaniel tried to converse with him as they walked.

‘Fine.’ He answered minimally, then seemed to have an idea for he ceased walking and stood perfectly still in place.

It took a moment for Nathaniel to notice he had stopped, ‘What are you doing?’ He asked suspiciously.

‘You didn’t say I had to follow you.’ He smiled savagely.

‘Don’t play games with me, we’ll be late for dinner. *Keep walking*.’ Nathaniel ordered annoyed as he understood. 

Eric’s smile turned to a scowl as he obediently continued walking. However, when we reached the turn that led towards the hall, he did not stop. Instead he continued walking straight down the hallway. A look of frustration crossed Nathaniel’s face as he made a new order, ‘*Stop walking, come back this way and walk with us to the dining hall*.’ He specified, then added quickly, ‘*And then come into the hall, and sit in your place without any further rigmarole*.’

‘You told me to keep walking. I was simply obeying your command.’ Eric said clearly amused at his master's dismay.

‘*Stop*. Must you always be so difficult?’ He demanded now, stepping in front of him and placing his fingertips on Eric’s chest to stop his stride, ‘This isn’t what I want Eric. I have told you that many times. If you behave I can allow you more freedom. There’s no need to be unreasonable.’

The orphan knocked his hand away with the back of his wrist, ‘Don’t touch me. This is already unreasonable. You tortured me and you’ve taken away my free will.’ he stated with malice.

‘I saved your life! My brother would have you punished in far worse ways if I did not.’

‘Do you expect me to thank you?’ Eric asked bitterly, ‘It wasn’t him that hurt me, it was you! You had a choice and you made it. If you don’t like it, kill me.’

At this Nathaniel was obviously annoyed, ‘You’re impossible.’ He said resentfully and I wondered then how long this had been going on for as Nathaniel seemed rather fed up.

In the days to follow we began our journey to the Leúchtend Estate.The castle is located on the cliffs beside the ocean, it is surrounded by a small township and is fortified by an outer defensive wall. It is far larger than the Dunkel Institute and made from shining white marble. On the few days where the sunshines one can be forgiven for being blinded by its glistening surface.

Our transport arrived in a convoy and before long we were escorted into the meeting hall. Banners embroidered with sigils lined the walls and guards stood in place beside each pillar. The very air seemed to be electrified with an authoritative energy. Underfoot a red and golden rug with a Turkish design ran the length of the hall up to the steps before the throne. Punishment racks were kept close at hand as the twins father made use of them regularly for any one who displeased him in any way. 

Master rarely spoke of his parents and I can only remember one time where he did. It was late at night on the day after their parents had visited the Dunkel Estate and I was very young. In the beginning pets are not granted their own rooms. Instead, we all sleep in a créche of sorts… It is difficult to explain. It’s a room where there is soft bedding over the floor, it is warm and we fall asleep wherever we choose. Though most of us choose to sleep close to one another instinctively.

Master entered this room and navigated through to find me. He took a hold of my arm and pulled me from where I lay among the others. It was the coldness of his hand and the motion of being carried that disturbed me, though I was not yet entirely awake so I was confused at first. His hair was unkempt and his clothing was ruffled as if he had been in an altercation of some kind. He smelt like ethanol mixed with butterscotch, and he stumbled as he carried me. When we made it to his room he dumped me on the bed and crawled onto it with me, he didn’t undress as I expected he might. Instead he simply pulled me close to him and held me in an uncomfortably tight cuddle.

Because I was not yet well trained I struggled to break free of his grip. I felt panic rise in me as he held me more firmly for my effort and I thought he might crush me, then he seemed to relax and loosen his hold. ‘Please stay..’ He whispered gently. It was… Not a command and that gave me pause. I realized then that.. He was crying.. I had never seen one cry before, nor have I seen one cry since.” Molly paused for a moment as if thinking and I felt uneasy.

I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of what she was telling me, but I felt distinctly guilty for the times I had sought out my cats for comfort and held them against their will as Molly continued. “He wept for a long time, though it seemed to give him comfort to pat my hair and I didn’t know what else to do so I remained still. When at last he calmed down he spoke.

‘Nathaniel is hurt..  It’s my fault… He lied to Father for me and he was punished. Mother did nothing to stop it. How can I run anyone’s lives when I cannot even protect my brother or stand up to my Father?’ He murmured softly, though I wasn’t sure if he was speaking to me or to himself.

He fell asleep holding me and was no longer there when I awoke in the morning. I found out later that during the visit their father had beaten Nathaniel so badly that he had remained unconscious in the infirmary for two full days. Though I never found out the reason or what he had lied about. I suspect Master never intended me to remember that night for he never mentioned it again.

I believe this is the reason that both Master and Nathaniel were so tense when approaching their father. They walked directly ahead of us and guarded their emotions carefully.  They each wore a variation of Victorian era formal attire, dark double breasted button down coats with golden trim cuffs and shoulder accents. Decorative chains looped from shoulder to shoulder across their chests and brocade patterns tapered in at the waist. On their hips they carried their finest swords and they each wore a unique broach on their upper coat pocket.

Nathaniel had his hair combed, while Master had his braided neatly down the length of his back. Of course we were also dressed similarly. Eric was entirely in black with minor golden accents matching Nathaniel. The sleeve of his jacket hung empty on the right side and his hand was hidden in a glove that reached to his elbow under the coat. His hair had been combed carefully over his eye and he, like the rest of us, wore no expression at all. All of us wore our own weapons at appropriate places, except for Eric whom Master refused to allow a weapon on principle.

‘Eric, you will be meeting my father.. and you will be expected to kneel. *Do so without a fuss. You will not attack or fight anyone here. You will do as you are told*.’ Nathaniel spoke quietly with his pet giving him instruction. ‘*Do not speak out of turn, do not aggravate my father and do not tell him of what you did. Lie if you have to.* Do you understand me? *Respond*.’

‘You’re giving me instructions that leave me helpless.’ Eric answered vexed which did nothing to reassure anyone.

‘I will protect you, but you need to do as I say. I can’t have you starting fights here.

Eric snorted, ‘When have you ever protected me?’ He retorted flatly which seemed to irritate Nathaniel though he said nothing more.

‘He best be under control brother.’ Master warned in a low tone.

‘He is controlled and you must not tell Father of what he did either. Don’t interfere in whatever is to come.’ Nathaniel asked firmly in a low tone.

‘Again you ask for more favors.’ Master sighed though made no promises.

When at last we reached the throne Master and Nathaniel knelt respectfully and the rest of us followed suit. Their father, Lazarus Klein, sat before them and stood when they bowed down. His eyes were the same luminous green as his son’s while his hair was an ashen gray and he appeared to be more than double their age.

Beside him their mother, Péronne Klein, reached out to hold onto her husband's arm. Her eyes were a soft lavender and her hair strawberry blonde, she bore little resemblance if any to her children. ‘Stand.’ Lazarus instructed without care and the twins stood as directed. 

‘ ‘Father. Mother.’ ‘ Master and Nathaniel spoke in synchronization to greet their parents.

‘Enough with the pleasantries. Bring the graduates.’ Lazarus demanded.

‘Yes Father.’ Master agreed, gesturing with his hand that the new humans should come forward. The five girls stepped forward and knelt in order. Calla, Loree, Gemma, Tessa, and Emmie. Each was carefully controlled as Lazarus looked them over. He stopped at Calla and his eyes moved to Markos, ‘I can certainly tell who this one belongs to.’ He commented, drawing the sword from his belt and taking her long hair in his hand.

‘Aesthetics are important.’ Markos replied with a nervous smile.

‘Her hair is too long. Allow me to fix that.’ Lazarus mused, slicing through it and leaving it cut off shorter only on one side. The girl didn’t resist or move, showing no reaction to it at all, and though Markos seemed annoyed he said nothing as the man moved on to the next. 

‘There were 5 this year? More than expected.’

‘Yes, we are getting better at choosing them.’ Master answered casually.

‘Which one of them was responsible for the numbers Nathaniel showed me? I should like to personally thank her for her service.’ He mused.

At this the brothers seemed to hesitate before Nathaniel spoke up, ‘Those numbers were not generated from a graduate. Eric, *step forward and kneel*.’ He commanded and the boy moved as expected.

‘Oh? A man?’ Lazarus responded surprised, ‘Explain.’ 

‘His name is Eric. He is the one who was able to collect so many livestock. His numbers are beyond anything we could have ever expected. However, he was not among the graduates.’ Nathaniel explained.

‘That’s very pleasing. However, why?’ He asked now, stopping in front of Eric and tilting his chin up with the tip of the sword.

Nathaniel looked anxious then as Eric glared up at Lazarus, ‘He was an experimental project.. He didn’t undergo the entirety of the training the girls did. However his performance was enhanced. He is what I had hoped to present to you in the summer.’ 

‘He is pretty at least. It’s a shame about the eye.’ He commented, lifting the hair away from Eric’s hidden eye with the edge of the blade.

‘Indeed.’ Nathaniel agreed, casting a sideways glance at his brother pointedly, ‘However, there were some minor disciplinary issues.’ He explained. 

‘Good, I see you used a firm hand with him then.’ Lazarus seemed to approve then ordered, ‘Remove them from the room. We have other matters to discuss now.’ In response the graduates were escorted out, Eric among them as he was expected to remain with Markos for the time he was separated from Nathaniel, and the other Nobels were permitted to leave. 

‘Will you be able to train more like him?’ Their father asked.

‘I believe so. Yes.’ He responded confidently.

‘You should learn from your brother ……. . He has surprised me with many accomplishments in the last decade. What have you achieved?’ He asked, turning his attention to my Master. ‘I’ve heard a great many, disturbing things. Care to elaborate? I left the Dunkel castle in your care. Why is it no longer operational?’ He demanded.

‘My deepest apologies-‘ Master began to respond when his brother interrupted him. 

‘Forgive me father. It is not …….. ’s fault.’ Nathaniel knelt again, ‘I began a new project, I underestimated the risks and I ignored my brother’s warnings.’ He apologized.

The man’s eyes narrowed, ‘Is this true?’ He asked suspicious.

‘Yes Father. I was the one who made the mistake.’ He reiterated.

‘And your brother was the one who failed to stop you.’ Lazarus accused.

‘No. He is the only reason the Institute still stands at all. The blame is mine alone.’ Nathaniel corrected him.

‘Very well-‘ he began only to be interrupted.

‘Father, if I may.’ Master spoke up quickly, ‘Although the project resulted in destruction, it is a good opportunity to rebuild. The townspeople were becoming restless with all the disappearances. If we allow them to believe the castle is abandoned it will alleviate the suspicions-…’ 

‘Silence. Consider yourself fortunate that I don’t punish you for your blundering incompetence. What kind of household lead are you when you cannot even control your younger brother? Pathetic. The collapse of that castle is nothing to be taken lightly, your brother will learn to take more caution and you will learn to hold your tongue.’

‘Yes Father..’ He said kneeling beside Nathaniel to show remorse for speaking out of turn. 

‘Some days I wonder if I had any son’s at all. You’re more useless than daughters, at least Lucinde can spread her legs.’ Lazarus scoffed, ‘Nonetheless, I am in a particularly good mood so you will be spared the punishment for today. Now stand. Nathaniel you are dismissed. ……… I have private matters to discuss with you, come.’ 

The brothers glanced at one another incredulously before Master followed after his father and Nathaniel came to stand by my side. 

‘You would be wise to come with me.’ He suggested, ‘My Brother would fret less knowing you are safe.’

‘I should go with him.’ I countered calmly.

‘No, our father is not kind to humans. He wouldn’t like for you to be in harm's way.’

I knew he was correct, yet it made me nervous to leave Master. I found myself concerned about what Lazarus might do to him, their father would take any excuse to be cruel.

‘He will be fine.’ Nathaniel spoke to me as if he read my thoughts when I didn’t answer him.

‘How can you be certain?’ I asked, trying not to sound worried.

‘Because I know my brother and I understand my father. He is in no danger.’ He assured though moved to leave without waiting for me as I delayed a moment longer in my decision. I hurried to catch up to him and we made our way to Markos’s room. As we arrived I was surprised to see he was waiting with medical supplies.

‘How did I know it would be you?’ He mused, opening the door to allow us in. It was apparent that he had been expecting one of the brothers to return injured.

‘You placed a bet on it didn’t you?’ Nathaniel asked flatly. 

‘Of course. Even when we were children you protected your brother from any punishment you could. Gregers will be disappointed he lost.’ Markos said cheerfully.

‘Actually, I am unharmed. As is my brother, you both lose.’

‘Are you certain?’ Markos asked skeptically.

‘Quite, Father was feeling benevolent today. Sorry to disappoint.’  He muttered ruefully. 

‘Ahh, and I was so sure. You two are nothing more than little boys pretending to be men and you behave predictably. Though I suppose it can’t be helped that Lazarus is unpredictable.’

Nathaniel scowled at him, ‘Where is Eric?’ He asked to change the subject.

‘He is safe with Calla. They have been talking for some time now.’ Markos mused, gesturing to the window where the pair could be seen resting in the private courtyard adjoining the room. Calla was sitting neatly on a bench and Eric was laying back on the grass with an arm over his eyes against the sun, though we couldn’t hear what they were discussing.

‘He seems at peace.’

‘Yes, considering how he tries to kill her each time they spar.’

‘I’m sure that’s not his intention.’

‘Indeed, his intention is to kill you.

Nathaniel smiled bitterly, ‘I’m sure it is.’

‘Does that bother you?’ Markos asked curiously.

‘I don’t know..’

‘Well, does it bother you that he hates you?’ 

At this Nathaniel seemed to think for a moment, ‘..Perhaps.’ he admitted, ‘He fights me at every opportunity. He is malicious in his compliance and wilful with his disobedience. If I don’t word my commands with extremely specific intent he finds a way to follow the instruction with the worst possible outcome. It’s exhausting having to think so much all the time and he is exhausting himself resisting so hard.’

Markos seemed to hesitate a moment before asking, ‘How old is your pet now?’

‘He's, he’s 20 in human years.’

‘I see.. Forgive me, what do you intend to do with him now? Surely you can see that your brother is correct.. he has no purpose..’

‘He has a purpose.’ Nathaniel muttered, ‘It’s to make my life infinitely more difficult.’ 

‘…You cannot breed him, he will not collect more livestock and he will not submit to be subservient. He’s useless.’ He continued taking a calculated risk in speaking his mind.

‘Watch your tongue.’ He was cautioned. 

‘Do you care for him?.’ He asked, catching Nathaniel by surprise. 

‘Do you not care for Calla?’ He retorted instead of answering. 

Markos paused thoughtfully, ‘Of course, she is mon Petite Poupée. However I understand her purpose. When I am ready she will bear my heir’s and serve as their carer. When her usefulness has expired, she will be sent to the slaughterhouse. Her meat will by then be old and of low value, but it will still hold worth. You.. Seem to treat your pet more as one of us.’

‘Did my brother put you up to this? You have no right to ask these kinds of questions.’ Nathaniel stated firmly.

‘We are concerned for you. The risks you’re taking, and your actions.. Your Brother says you no longer choose to eat humayne.'

‘Enough.’ He stated finally, ‘We will speak of this no more.’

‘As you wish.’ Markos agreed graciously as Calla and Eric returned from outside.

The girl moved to her owner right away, sweetly kissing his cheek before asking, ‘You called for me?’

‘Yes, *would you prepare for dinner*?’ He instructed her and she moved without any argument. 

Eric however, made no attempt to approach Nathaniel. He cast a glance to the medical supplies Markos had prepared and asked blandly, ‘You’re injured?’

‘No.’ Nathaniel responded.

‘That’s a shame.’

Nathaniel chose to ignore the remark, telling him instead, ‘You did well in the great hall today… Thank you for not misbehaving.’

‘I was under your order, *master*.’ Eric responded cynically as he leant on his cane to give a condescending bow which made Nathaniel visibly uncomfortable. 

‘Never do that again.’

‘Is that an order?’

‘I’m considering making it one yes.’

\*\*\*

We remained at the Leúchtend castle for several weeks. In that time Master and Nathaniel attended countless meetings with their father to discuss business matters while we remained with Markos and were subjected to his constant complaining. It seemed he had many grievances about Calla’s hair being cut short and I continued my roll baby sitting Eric.

The news came just days before we were intended to leave that Lazarus had announced that there would be a farewell ceremony hosted in honor of his sons. It would be a gala and we were all expected to attend, though neither my master or his brother were enthusiastic about the affair. It seemed that grand parties often turned into week-long ordeals and they didn’t want to stay any longer than they already had. Additionally, at these gatherings it was traditional for a feast to be held in which the main courses were served quite rare and fresh, sacrificed on the spot in most cases.

On the night of the ball Markos spent his time carrying on about Calla’s dress and Nathaniel spoke with Eric trying to coax him into behaving. Master came to stand beside me then, he seemed nervous. ‘Molly, I rescind my order. You are no longer to follow Eric. Something will happen tonight. *You are not to act. Use your gift, allow it to happen then come to find me*. If you do not, your life will be in danger. Do you understand?’ He kept his voice low as he spoke.

‘Of course Master. If that is your request I will obey.’ I assured without hesitation though I didn’t know what he meant.

When it was time for us to leave. On our way a messenger stopped us, he requested that Nathaniel and Markos go with him, as they had been summoned. I saw Nathaniel look to his brother questioningly.

‘I will watch over them brother.’ Master assured and the pair reluctantly moved to do as they were bid.

They had not been gone long before Master whispered in my ear, ‘Remember what I said.’ He instructed before leaving us alone in the hall.

Despite appearing to pay no mind to Master whatsoever Eric was quick to notice when he left, ‘Where is he going.’ He demanded.

‘Wherever he chooses. It is not our concern.’ I responded calmly.

‘They haven’t left us alone for weeks, and now we are suddenly unsupervised. Something isn’t right.’ He insisted.

‘That is not our concern. We know our destination. We don’t need guidance.’ I assured him, though I knew he was correct and it was soon after that we were approached by armed guards. They stepped into our path blocking the way.

‘Forgive us, we are in your path.’ Calla said softly, giving a polite curtsy as she had been trained to do while Eric seemed annoyed.

‘You are to come with us.’ One of the men spoke and I knew then that it was time to activate my gift as I stepped back quietly.

‘According to who?’ Eric asked spitefully, earning himself a swift backhand for his insolence. I’m sure he saw it coming with that eye of his, however orders he had been given prevented him from avoiding it. The hit fell on him hard, splitting his lip and very nearly knocking him over with the force

‘Meat doesn’t ask questions.’ The guard responded.

Eric sneered, spitting blood at the guard’s shoes, ‘Calla. You should go. You aren’t under any orders..’ He began however the order came too swiftly for her to move.

‘*You will come with us now*.’ It was the second guard who gave the command.

‘As you wish.’ I heard Calla respond dully. She was under no protective contract as I and Eric were, however I wondered then which magic would win out in the boy. Would his contract to obey only Nathaniel allow him to disobey this order? Or would the command he had been given earlier to do as he was told hold sway over him?

In the end I think it was a combination of the both. I doubted the instruction worked as a command on him, however I don’t think that kind of magic was needed. The guard only had to ask and the orders Nathaniel had given would take effect to compel him to obey. The resistance in his being was obvious and I wondered how many times he cursed Nathaniel for such restrictive orders as they both complied to follow after the guards.

I waited until they turned a bend in the hall, then I hurried to find Master.

Aristocrats filled the ballroom and I entered with them, entirely unnoticed. They were a variety of monsters, some breeds I was familiar with while others I could not tell from a human. All were dressed in eccentric clothing and the few human pets that were kept were no exception. Magic made the air shimmer, energetic music filled the atmosphere and buffet tables lined the walls.

An audience was gathered around the entertainment at the other end of the room, though I couldn’t see what was on stage past them. Ordinarily it would have been difficult to find Master in such a crowd, however under the orders given I was compelled to move toward his presence and as I reached him I gently took a hold of his hand.

I realized then that he looked distraught. In his other hand he held tight to an almost empty glass of alcohol and he was purposefully facing away from the stage. ‘I have made a mistake Molly.’ He whispered weakly. ‘Father promised if I did as he asked.. And I was fool enough to believe him.’

Master made little sense in what he was saying, however as the sound of a whip cracking over flesh permeated through the air over the music he flinched. Before downing the contents of the glass in one hit. Confused, I turned then to see where the sound had originated. Through the gaps between monsters I could just see the stage. On it Lazarus was walking back and forth. He was speaking and though I couldn’t hear him well, I thought he was talking about betrayal.

He was wearing a thick glove on one hand and in it he held the Iron Whip. It was an item I had never before seen personally, though I had heard of it. The whip is a cat o’nine tail with a leather handle and iron fragments braided into the tassels. Iron burns their kind just as a flame burns us and is impervious to magic, so their father would wear a glove to prevent himself being injured by it while he punished others.

To the side of the stage I noticed Péronne, she looked anxious as her husband raised the whip again. Before him, stretched over a wooden punishment rack from the throne room was Nathaniel, and it looked as though he had been being tortured for some time. His coat was shredded and blood soaked. His wrists were bruised from the restraints and his expression was hostile.

‘Please stay hidden.’ Master murmured to me recalling my attention.

‘Forgive me, for I would suggest to you that you should leave.. There is no need to watch..’ I offered softly.

He didn’t have the opportunity to answer me for the music cut out so that Lazarus could speak to the crowd. He left Nathaniel where he was, simply paying no more mind to his son as he spoke. ‘Now that this ugliness is taken care of, it is time for some joy! I invite you all to partake in the sacrifices.’ He announced, gesturing off stage for the livestock to be brought forth.

The humans walked onto the stage under orders. Some waved or gestured fondly to the crowd below, I noticed Calla made a heart with her fingertips and blew a kiss. Eric followed not far behind her, I wondered if he had given up resisting for he seemed calm as they were all ordered to kneel. They began the killings from the left side of the line and Eric was near the center.

The first sacrifice was made, and the body thrown into the roaring crowd. They tore it apart like savage animals caught in a frenzy. A fine mist of blood sprayed from limbs being torn and I felt heavier drops land on my cheek. I wondered if that would disrupt my gift. The following girl was thrown in still alive, tears streamed down her face though the ordered smile she had never dropped.

At the Dunkel Institute the slaughter was.. Humane. Quick. This was violent in a way I hadn’t witnessed before and I felt my heart begin to race in fear. I was worried what they would do to me if I was revealed as I noticed others with pets taking their leave of the event. When I dared look back to the stage I saw Nathaniel had noticed Eric, his expression was somewhere between horror and devastation as each death came closer to his pet.

‘Eric! Please! Can you hear me!?’ He shouted above the commotion, his voice strained with panic in a way I had never heard from the calm twin before.

A long moment passed and I was beginning to think he couldn’t hear his master over the noise. Then he looked up, his expression was icey with hatred, ‘Yes.’ He hissed. I’m not entirely sure that I heard the word so much as I read it on his lips and I can’t say whether or not Nathaniel heard it either or simply understood from the response.

‘*I release you of the commands restraining you*!’

Eric’s eyes widened in surprise and I watched as his gaze shifted from Nathaniel to the person beside him. He was only one away from being butchered and as the guard reached for him he reacted instantaneously. Energy ignited up the length of his right arm, burning away the glove that hid it and his right eye dilated. It was one smooth motion as he sliced through the guard then moved on to the next.

He caught the first few entirely off guard, they couldn’t make sense of what was happening. Perhaps they didn’t understand how he was able to break the glamour, or why he wouldn’t comply with the new commands they yelled at him. The atmosphere changed as understanding dawned on the creatures around. They were facing a human weapon that they had no control over.

‘Master, Eric is-‘ I began to tell him what was happening when I realized he already knew. Around us the audience was beginning to flee, tumbling over one another to get away from the stage and the demon that hunted them. The boy was relentless. He had gained a sword from one of his victims and he now cut through anyone too slow to escape or too dumb to face him with both the sword and his arm. He must have been holding back during training.

Master moved immediately to go to his brother, and I followed close behind. We reached Nathaniel and when Master released him he collapsed heavily, ‘Brother, please hurry.’ Master urged him trying to help him up though Nathaniel brushed him off.

‘Don’t touch me. You betrayed me to Father!’ He snarled as he slowly stood again on his own.

‘I’m sorry I didn’t-‘ Master began but Nathaniel stopped him.

‘You expect me to believe that he fooled you again?! You’re weak and you always will be. Go drink yourself to death for all I care.’

I knew the words must have hurt for Master flinched and Nathaniel took his sword from him as he moved past.

‘*Stand down*.’ Nathaniel ordered as he proceeded toward his father and Eric did as he was told, standing perfectly still.

‘What did you do?’ Lazarus sneered, surprised to see him approach.

‘I made a weapon better than anything you’ll ever make, surrender and I might consider allowing you to live.’ He responded coldly. 

‘You expect me to take orders from you?’ His father responded with malice.

‘No.’ Nathaniel responded calmly, his own energy flaring up to radiate from him as he attacked his father. The battle between them was swift. It seemed Lazarus wasted more magic for show than he kept for practical use and Nathaniel easily overwhelmed it. When he realized he would lose Lazarus did begrudgingly surrender. 

‘You wouldn’t kill your own father would you?’ He asked pitifully. 

‘If I were you, I wouldn’t be telling me what I would, or would not do.’ Nathaniel warned. 

‘What is it that you want then?’

’You will never send for me. You will never look for me. When I leave today, I no longer exist. Am I clear?’

‘..I would like nothing more than for you not to exist.’ His father agreed hostilely.

‘Good. Eric-’ Nathaniel began but stopped as he was cut off.

‘Release Calla from her commands. Then I will do whatever you say. You don’t have to use orders.’ Eric spoke quickly.

Nathaniel watched him a moment, calculating, before speaking calmly, ‘Calla, you are released of all commands given.'

The girl seemed relieved, taking a deep breath in, ‘Thank you..’ She whispered, it looked like she might cry.

‘Don’t thank me, get up, we’re not safe. We have to leave.’ Eric said firmly.

‘I can’t, Markos. She murmured.

‘Calla!’ He snapped frustrated, ‘He’s not something you should care for! None of them are! We need to go!’

‘I’m contracted Eric!’ She shouted back in response and he finally seemed to understand. ‘I cannot leave him. But we will meet again one day, I promise. Now go, they’ll be after you, not me.’

Eric still seemed conflicted before he finally agreed, ‘Stay safe, we’ll meet again.'

He turned to go with Nathaniel then and they made their way quickly from the building, ‘Follow them.. I want to know…’ My master ordered softly. I didn’t entirely know what he wanted, but I understood that I was to follow. Though keeping up with them was a challenge.

I caught up with them a couple hours later. They were deep in the forest away from the castle and they were fighting. Though they both seemed exhausted. Eric was breathing heavily and neither seemed to have any magic left to use as he backed Nathanial up to a large tree, holding a sword to his throat.

‘I don’t want to fight you Eric!’ Nathaniel exclaimed breathlessly, making no move to defend himself.

‘That’s too bad because I want to kill you.’ He responded venomously.

‘And you can’t lie to me, so you must mean it.. But you still haven’t done it yet.. Why is that?’ Nathaniel asked softly, closing his eyes as he allowed himself to slowly sink to the ground.

Eric didn’t seem to have an answer for him, though he looked relieved when Nathaniel gave up and moved to sit heavily beside him. They stayed like that for a long time, not saying anything to one another as they rested.

‘My family is going to come after you.’ Nathaniel murmured finally.

‘I don’t care. Let them.’

Nathaniel chuckled softly, coughing blood with the effort. ‘You’re fearless.’

‘No. I fear being controlled.’ He corrected quietly.

‘I know.. Can I ask you something?’

‘I can’t see what difference anything you could ask will make now.’

‘Do you hate me because of what I am? or is it that you hate yourself because even knowing, it doesn’t matter to you?’

At this Eric seemed irritated, ‘What kind of a question is that?’

‘One I want an answer to.’

‘You’re insufferable.’ He muttered before slowly breathing out, ‘..I hate us both. I hate you for tricking me.. and I hate myself for not caring about the rest.. I knew it sounded too good to be true.. But I wanted to believe you.. ‘

’So you allowed yourself to believe it? Why?’

‘Because I love this world. Your world. I like being a part of it. Before I was nothing, no matter how hard I tried I could never do the things everyone else could and I want to be better than them.’ He admitted quietly though it appeared to cause him pain, ‘I hate myself for feeling like that.’

‘It’s okay to want things. Something that makes you special, or power. It’s very human, you don't need to feel ashamed.’ Nathaniel assured him softly.

‘All the things I want are terrible.’ Eric whispered.

‘That’s okay too, you don’t have to be a good person.’

‘But I want to be...’

’So go be then.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘I’m going to try as well. I have to go find my brother, I was cruel to him and I have to let you go. You’re free to leave, I won’t stop you.’

Eric turned to look at him now confused, ‘You’re breaking the contract?’

‘Calm down, I’m not that benevolent. Your contract will remain in place. But you are free to leave whenever you so choose.’

’Soon then. I can’t move yet.’ He murmured.

‘Take your time.'

‘Nathaniel, thank you.’

Nathaniel sighed, ‘Never thank me again either.‘

‘Is that another order?’ Eric teased.

‘I’m considering it.’ Nathaniel smiled weakly.

Eric left some hours later, stumbling off toward the south and Nathaniel made no move to stop him. As such I wasn’t expecting it when he spoke again, ‘I know you’re there Molly. So you have a choice to make, your life or a contract.’ He told me.” Molly stopped there abruptly.

“Did you make a contract with him?” I asked now.

“Yes.”

“What was it?”

“As I said. I cannot say. However, it is one I found a loophole in.” She smiled broadly now and I felt uneasy.

“What do you mean?” I rephrased.

“Goodbye, Stacy. White.” She said simply, then she began to disappear before my eyes. I pressed the panic button in a hurry but it was too late, as the guards came in Molly was gone and I was alone.
