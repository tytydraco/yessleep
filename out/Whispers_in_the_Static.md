When I decided to start [my own late-night radio show](https://tygonysus.carrd.co/), I never expected that I'd be broadcasting to an audience that wasn't quite... human. But here I am, alone in my makeshift studio, the glow of the old radio dials casting eerie shadows across the walls, while something—or someone—listens from the dark.

I've always been a night owl, & the idea of hosting a midnight radio show from my apartment seemed perfect. I set everything up myself—a few microphones, a mixing board, & a laptop to manage the streams. My show wasn’t meant to be anything fancy, just a place where I could share music, strange stories, & the occasional chat with whoever was out there listening at 12 AM.

The first few nights were quiet, with only a handful of listeners tuning in. I'd play some obscure tracks, tell a few spooky stories I’d found online, & sometimes I'd just sit back & let the silence stretch, letting the tension build naturally. It was during one of these moments of silence that I first heard it—the faintest whisper coming through the static.

At first, I thought it was a glitch. Maybe some interference from a nearby station or a loose wire. But the whispers persisted, growing clearer with each passing night.

One night, about a week into the show, I decided to investigate. I stayed silent for longer than usual, just listening. That’s when I heard it—a voice, soft & distant, almost pleading. It was so faint that I had to crank up the volume just to make out the words. “Help me…”

My heart skipped a beat. It was unmistakable. Someone, or something, was trying to communicate through the static. I tried to respond, but all I got in return was more static & the occasional disjointed word—“lost,” “trapped,” “please.”

I couldn’t shake the feeling that the voice was coming from somewhere close, maybe even inside my own apartment. But every time I checked, the place was empty, just me & my equipment.

Things started to get weirder after that. The whispers grew louder, more desperate, & I started noticing things around the apartment. The temperature would drop suddenly, my breath misting in the air as though I’d stepped outside on a cold summer’s night. Objects would move on their own—a cup sliding across the table, a door creaking open, or the curtains swaying when there was no breeze.

One night, as I was wrapping up the show, I caught something out of the corner of my eye—a shadow, darting across the room. I turned quickly, but there was nothing there. Just my reflection staring back at me from the darkened window.

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d hear the whispering, growing louder, closer.

A few nights later, I decided to confront whatever was happening. I went live as usual, but this time I didn’t play any music. Instead, I addressed the entity directly. “I know you’re there,” I said, my voice trembling. “What do you want from me?”

For a long moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, slowly, the whispers began again, more clearly than ever before. “Help… me… find… peace…”

The voice was different this time—softer, sadder. It was as though whoever—or whatever—it was, had finally found a way to communicate with me.

I didn’t know what to do. How do you help a ghost find peace? I asked the voice what it needed, but all I got in return was static, louder & more chaotic than ever before. It felt like the walls were closing in, the room growing darker & colder.

& then, just as suddenly as it had started, the static stopped. The room was quiet, the temperature back to normal. But the presence—it hadn’t gone away. I could feel it, hovering just out of sight, waiting.

I haven’t heard the whispers since that night, but the feeling of being watched hasn’t left. Every time I go live, I feel it—something lurking in the static, listening, waiting. I don’t know what it wants, & I’m not sure I want to find out.

But I keep broadcasting. I can’t stop now. I feel like if I do, whatever is out there, whatever has attached itself to me, will finally make its move.

So, if you’re listening to this right now, just know—there’s something in the static. & it’s listening to you, too.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. The shadows are getting closer, the whispers louder. If one day, you tune in & all you hear is static—know that it finally got me. & whatever happens, don’t let the static take you too.

Everything I’ve told you is true. I’m not sure how much longer I have, but as long as I’m here, I’ll keep broadcasting. Because the moment I stop... well, I guess we’ll find out together.

Stay tuned.
