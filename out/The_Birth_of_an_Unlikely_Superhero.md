I stood in front of the kebab shop, said goodbye to Gab and Gilbert. "See you later, guys" I muttered, already feeling the crampy misery settling deep within my guts. Shouldn't have eaten that crap, shouldn't have gone for the doner. I should have known better.

My car was parked a couple of hundred meters away. But in my state, every step felt like an ordeal, my legs leaden, as if concrete slabs had been bolted to them.

Anyway, it was all too much. The greasiness of the kebab lingered, a foul aura that clung to my skin. Walking back, twilight painted the street in dirty shadows. The shops passed by. Chinese, Indian, Afghan... All these places for food you know is bad for you but you can't help yourself.

Suddenly a window reflection caught me off guard. A grotesque vision staring back: belly swollen under that shirt, a monstrous orb of grease and regret . My eyes bugged out of my head as if in the glass I saw my own endtimes. All I could do was clench those flabby ass cheeks harder, desperate for any kind of containment.

It wasn't just bloating, there were noises coming from within, like an engine revving up. A low rumble gathering pace deep in me. It felt like my gut was about to explode.

Just then those filthy degenerates appeared, four of them. Their eyes glinting with sadistic glee, a predatory hunger. They stood blocking my path. I froze, trembling as much from fear as from the pressure inside. The biggest of them, their leader I suppose, sneered and brandished a knife. The other three were armed with bats and some sort of weapon. It was a gun.

"Look at the flab," he spat with contempt. "What you doing wandering about? Think you own this street, do you?"

The threats ramped up quick. "We'll teach you a lesson," one of the bat-wielding weasels snarled. "Beat you to hell and back. Hand over your wallet, now!"

My legs were shaking and my heart hammering. And the pressure... Christ almighty, the pressure in my gut intensified. Control was slipping. I couldn't hold it anymore.

They kept sneering, shouting, closing the distance. The leader took a step forward, his eyes boring into me with a malice you could taste, smell even. Instinct kicked in. No thinking about it. Just reacted. Back turned to them, braced myself.

As I spun, something unexpected happened. Everything churning within me: the greasy kebab, years of questionable food choices, all detonated in a single, catastrophic release. I'd never felt anything like it before. It burst forth from down below. Not a mere gassy explosion, no, this was more like a small thermonuclear detonation. Windows cracked or blew out in an arc of shattering glass.

And I could see it! A swirling mass of gas, greenish and phosphorescent, expanding outwards like an alien bloom. And the smell... God, the smell. I'm used to my own output, but this was another level. Sulphur and decay.

I spun around expecting angry faces and more violence. But instead, it a scene from Dante's Inferno. Cars on both sides of the street erupting into flame. Limbs and torsos scattered across the asphalt. And even those bits were disintegrating right before my eyes. They seemed to be dissolving in the green glow, releasing fumes that mixed with the acrid smell of burning rubber and molten metal.

I looked at my hands and legs, I was miraculously intact, but my trousers were split open, a gaping maw exposing my backside in this apocalyptic scene.

Panic started rising in me again making its way up my throat. I didn't understand what the hell had just happened, but I knew one thing: get out of here. I started sprinting, dodging the molten debris, the charred remains of those horrific fragments that used to be people.

Reaching the car, I heard the distant wail of sirens. With trembling hands I gripped the steering wheel and started driving, beads of sweat rolling down my brow. My mind was racing. What if the coppers catch up to me? And what if another "malfunction" was ready to tear out from down below again? What would happen? Then my thoughts went to my wardrobe, I had nothing suitable: no pair of trousers could contain the sheer horror of it.
