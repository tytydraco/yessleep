Hello everyone, I’m currently writing this from a friend's house where I’m currently staying. 

Mostly because of recent events that are my own fault. 

My own house or anywhere in its vicinity doesn't even feel safe anymore. 

Bad things have been happening and I know staying quiet would probably more likely be the safer thing to do right now. 

I still need to explain what’s happening and maybe actually save a couple of people from what I’m experiencing.

I suppose this all started about a year ago when I joined reddit. 

I know it probably wouldn't be anyone's first choice of somewhere to post stuff.

But the community for me sort of felt a bit more real than anything on places like instagram.

Plus I also thought the art I make could reach a wider audience here.

And for a while things were going ok.

I posted maybe once every three months and I got a decent amount of support. 

I was 17 at the time so the support I kind of got up here made me feel good. 

However as you know this place isn’t really known for kindness. 

I showed my face once on r/teenagers and I got a ton of comments saying how awful I looked.

You know that kind of thing. 

Kinda felt down for a couple of days.

Then I got a chat invite from a user named u/**************. 

With them saying “hey everyone is kinda being mean to you but honestly I think you're cute”. 

Now some of you may call me lucky for getting a chat like that but honestly now I wish I had just ignored it.

I accepted the chat invite and started talking, look I was 17 I didn't know any better ok? 

We chatted for a bit and I thought we had quite a bit in common.

We both liked the same kind of music and she claimed that she did art.

She actually shared to me that her “name” was Presley and that she was 17 as well. 

Then she sent a picture of what she apparently looked like. 

It looked to be a teenage girl with blue eyes and black hair.

I honestly thought that she was honestly really pretty. 

I did at the time have a feeling that this seemed too good to be true because why did a supposed girl like that like me of all people?

I kept chatting with her and honestly had a good time talking to her.

It was good to have someone in my life because beside my friend that I’m staying with now I really never have many people to talk to. 

We chatted a bunch more, even when I was in school. 

To say this person was clingy was a bit of an understatement.

If I didn't respond in a minimum of 30 minutes she would start spam-messaging me.

Looking back now I should’ve just thought that was creepy but at the time I was liking her so I thought it was just a cute “thing” she did.

In fact she kinda really took over most of my freetime, I was chatting with her 24/7. 

I didn’t think anything of it at the time cause I thought that was just how relationships kind worked even though we really weren’t in one. 

I even missed my little cousin's birthday just to chat with her.

 I know I sound really selfish and it was partly because I was and partly because I didn't want “Presley” to start spamming me so much.

 I really regret what I did with all that.

Things stayed like that for a bit, through September to November. 

I honestly was really fascinated with the idea of being with her even though I never had actually seen her in real life. 

It had honestly gotten a bit unhealthy, I even skipped doing things like brushing my teeth or eating just to talk with her. 

Throughout those three months I’ve learned quite a bit about her.

One thing was how apparently she loved the idea of murdering someone and then killing herself to be with them forever. 

The first time I heard all of that I kinda felt something besides love for her, fear.

I was scared if she was thinking about doing this to me which I think was the first time I was unsure about trying to maybe get with her in the future you know?

From there things got weirder. 

She told me way more than I know like how she liked a movie called “slow torture puke chamber”. 

I never heard of such a movie and honestly I really did’nt want to know more. 

I also mentioned she did art and she showed me some of hers and to say the least I couldn't imagine any sane mind coming up with what she makes. 

One she showed me looks to be a rabbit skull. 

A real rabbit skull with an inverted pentagram on the head of the skull with a really dark red ink. 

More dark red than anything I’ve ever seen.

This was shortly after her telling me about her wanting to murder someone for love so this really freaked me out.

Safe to say I wasn't talking as I was about a month earlier, I mean how could I? 

She clearly wasn’t sane and I was afraid for my own being.

Hell I don’t even know why I didn't just stop sooner. Maybe it was because I was so love starved at the time or something else. 

Maybe I could’ve thought I could “fix her”. 

However I think she noticed I wasn’t as talkative as I was and she really kept trying to keep me to talk. 

She even threatened to do stuff to herself if I didn't. 

look I had no idea what to do at the time.  

Realistically what could a 17 year old like me do in a situation like that?

To say I felt trapped was an understatement, I felt as if I was the only thing keeping “presley” from doing something really awful. 

My parents certainly noticed it and they tried to get me to tell them what was wrong but I just told them I was just stressed with school. 

I really didn't want them to find out who I’ve gotten involved with. 

They probably wouldn't trust me ever again. 

But then there was this one day, the day I finally decided to end this. 

It was a rainy evening on Tuesday November 16th. 

I was chatting with her as always to try and keep her from doing things. 

But then she said in chat “Heyyy you wanna see something I’ve made =]” I said yes to keep her happy. 

She then sent a picture of something that will never leave my mind. 

It looked to be a giant leathery pale light brown looking tapestry with the words “I LOVE YOU” written all over it.

Now this already had me freaked out.  

But then she said “I made it just for you, my friend makes a good canvas don’t you think??? =]]]”. 

Then looking closer at the thing after she said that I realized that it wasn't actually leather. 

It looked pink in some places and had a bit of a ridged look to it. 

It was human skin. 

In my eyes that was the last straw. 

I quickly went over to settings while she was saying stuff like “please respond, PLEASE RESPOND PLEASE RESPOND”. 

Then one click later, I blocked her. 

I couldn’t take this anymore so I made the brash decision.

For the next few moments I laid on the floor having a small panic attack. 

Was I the witness to a murder?, what if she comes for me?

It's safe to say I didn't sleep well that night, or the next. 

I just felt like I was a criminal for not telling the police or something like that. 

But after a few weeks I supposed things had gotten better. 

I was great not always messaging someone. I even made some new friends which was nice. 

Heck I even forgot about “presley” for a bit. However I was reminded of her after one thing.

So not long after all that I decided to make an Instagram account so I could maybe post my art somewhere now sense I suppose staying off reddit would be the smarter choice.

However, looking through the “suggestions” bar, where you can find people to follow. 

I found a particular profile called @************ which had the profile picture of someone I thought very familiar.

Looking at the profile I realized, the profile picture was the photo that “presley” had sent me. 

Looking more into the profile which was just a bunch of selfies and stuff like that I wondered “Was I catfished?”. 

I thought that probably wouldn't be really surprising with reddit. 

Now I was truly wondering, was Presley even a girl?

Those thoughts shook me to my core, how could I have fallen for that? 

Something so obviously a trap. 

But at the time I really didn't feel like I needed to worry anymore. 

I thought that blocking her would’ve gotten her out of my life forever. 

Or at least that's what I thought.

As I said things appeared to be normal for a while after everything, it was nice actually. 

Even my parents said I was acting a lot better than I was a few months ago. 

My grades in school actually got better because now I actually had the time to study. 

So maybe they’ll believe me now at school stressing me out.

 For a dude who had just gone through a bunch of shit I thought I was doing good.

Then one day on December 18th I got a message from an unknown number. 

“Heeeyyyyy =]” I recognized that smiley face, how? How did she find my number? 

I never gave it to her. 

“I remember what you Did to mE, AbanDoned me, well that's not the forever I’m planning” she texted.

 I tried not to text back but the speech bubble popped up signifying she was typing something.

 “JAson I still Love you  and I want yOu to be miNE FOREVER” she said. 

Now I really am terrified because I never revealed my name to her once.

“How do you know my real name?” I typed foolishly. 

“Oh lets jUst say I know a Lot about youuuu” she typed but it was what was next that shook me to my very core. She sent three pictures. 

They were all of me. 

One was me walking to school. 

Another was me walking back to my house and opening the front door. 

And the last one was the worst I swear, it was a picture taken outside my bedroom window looking into my room. 

From the photo I could see it had only been a few minutes ago.

Because in the photo I was looking at my phone looking right at the photos.

Almost instinctively I looked straight at my window where the last photo was taken. 

There I saw what appeared to be someone moving quickly out of the way with their phone in hand. 

I screamed, I just screamed.

It woke my parents up which led to them rushing into my room asking what was wrong. 

In fact I screamed so loud I think I woke up our neighbors. 

I told them both everything, about her, about the way she acted towards me, and the tapestry.

I told them about the text messages from the unknown number and the photos. 

My dad actually got a shotgun from his safe inside his room and went outside looking for anyone. 

He didn’t find anyone so maybe my scream scared whoever “presley” was away. 

After he checked they called the police and told them everything over the phone.

Sure enough two cop cars came to our house. 

Two officers came inside and came to ask us questions while I think the other two went and searched the place for anyone. 

The officers who were named Gavins and Ross asked us the usual questions. 

Like did I have any information about “presley”. 

I told them not much beyond how that might’ve not been their real name. 

They also asked me if I had noticed anyone following me and I said I didn’t.

After a few more questions they asked me to try and describe who was at my window. 

I told Them I only saw a short man in a black hoodie and gloves.

After all the questions were said and answered although with probably nothing helpful. 

They said they would make this a case. 

Although they did say they probably couldn't do a lot because there was so little information about this person. 

But they suggest trying to find somewhere else to stay for a bit until more info could be gathered about this person who had been stalking me.

So since then me and my parents have been staying at a family friend's house. 

Specifically my friend Evan’s but that's not important.

I guess I feel safer here and maybe things will blow over pretty soon. 

Maybe they'll catch whoever “Presley” is and I’ll be good. 

However, just now I noticed some strange noises, it’s someone pounding on the front door. 

Pounding on it like they are trying to break it down. 

On the other side I’m hearing what sounds to be a middle aged man screaming.

 “JASON, OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!, OPEN IT!”.

 It's getting louder, I think he’s gonna get in.

Look if anyone is reading this please send help, please.
