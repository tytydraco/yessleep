Have you ever falsely presumed you were home alone? The realization startles you as you hear the faucet turn off in the bathroom or footsteps down the hallway. That’s how it began for me... mistakenly thinking the rest of my family had gone out. At least that’s what I told myself had happened at first. 

I remember my forehead was resting on my desk when I heard the slam of the front door. I watched through the blinds as our red van drove off. My eyelids felt heavy as I struggled not to relapse into unconsciousness. I only noticed then, that the sun had already set. My bedroom was lit only by the pale blue of my monitor. 

*They said something about going out,* I remembered—helping move my cousins to their new apartment. The clock read 9:00 pm. *Home alone*, I thought. Rising from my desk, I went down the hall and headed upstairs to the kitchen. *Need to get some nicotine.* 

I paused as I passed through the living room. Something cold had leaked through my thin socks.  I flicked on the light, illuminating wet footsteps trailing out of the bathroom. *Jenna…* I cursed, wiping my foot off on the carpet. My sister was usually the culprit. 

I opened the backdoor and stepped out into the night. It was dim, but not dark enough for stars yet. It was cloudy anyway, the sky a muddy grey and black. Slipping out my vape, I inhaled, releasing a puff that drifted towards the neighbors’ yard. There had been a dream during the time I was passed out at my desk, or rather, a nightmare. They’ve been recurring, every night for at least the past month. My days have become exhausting from the lack of sleep. 

I wander through a neighborhood which looks like my own…. As the dream progresses an amber glow ignites behind each window, one after another. The street becomes lit in fire until I remember, *I need to stop her this time,* then the world goes black as night. Only then I feel her stare piercing into my back. I turn around, and I feel her again behind me. Again, and again, never catching a real look at her besides a glimpse of her bronze colored hair. It always ends with a gentle laugh as burning pain rips through me. Sometimes in my neck, other times through my heart as I collapse. 

Even if it’s just a dream, the fear of the inevitable is enough to keep me frantic to escape her. I clench my shirt over my heart, instinctively where the burning had pierced me. *Each time before I wake it feels as if a little part of me is drained away.* 

I exhaled as the wind changed course, driving the cloud of vapor back against my face. I stared ahead, out at the neighborhood beyond the back hedge. *It really did feel real.* I even remembered seeing the old calico prowling between the fences before I woke. 

A soft voice in the house behind me. I tensed, arching my back, still gripping the deck railing. *It’s nothing,* I told myself, *just a whistle in the evening air. Or it could have just been a groan of the house settling… it was old after all.* 

I went back inside, being sure to lock the door behind me. My heart nearly jumped out of my chest as I heard footsteps come around the corner. *It’s Jenna,* I told myself as I reached for a glass, it must have just been mom who went out. I did my best to act normal; in other words, I ignored her presence completely. I filled a cup of water at the sink, then returned to my room without even looking at her. 

I placed my glass on the desk as I returned to my computer. I had been catching up on some class readings, analyzing statistics for media studies. Right then it all looked like a jumble of numbers and meaningless names. *Definitely not ready for the exam in two weeks.* Just as I was easing back in my office chair, my phone started buzzing. It was a call from my mum. 

“Hey mom,” I answered, once again resting my forehead against the surface of my desk. 

“Hi Anthony, how’s the studying going?” 

I winced silently. “Going alright. Just lots to remember.” 

“Have you tried making flashcards?” she asked. “It helped Jenna on her last biology test.” 

My eyes shot wide open as I heard my sister groan on the other end, “That was awful…” she whined, “I’m pretty sure Mr. Mcroon hated me.” 

“Was that Jenna?” I asked, “she’s with you?” 

“Yeah,” said my mom, “we’re getting ice cream on the way home. See you soon.” 

“Okay…” Someone rummaged through the kitchen upstairs. From the sounds of it, they’d found the cutlery drawer. My beating heart had become a scorpion rattling inside my rib cage. I rose, frantically looking for something…  anything to defend myself. Best I could find was a small blue pocket knife. *I need to stop her this time,* I told myself, *I don’t want to die again.* It was strange, I didn’t remember the dreams ever starting in the house before. 

Having a wall behind me was reassuring. *If she isn’t able to sneak up behind me I can defend myself*, I thought. Crouching slightly, I fixed my eyes on my bedroom door. My fingers felt sweaty clenching the tiny pocket knife. The lock on my door clicked, as if someone had opened it with a pin. My mouth felt dry as I swallowed. 

The hinges creaked as my door swung inwards. The hallway seemed darker than usual, even with the lights out. Her vague outline was grey. At least this time I could see some of her, a pair of pale eyes stared at me. A glint of pearly white teeth. 

“What are you waiting for?” My voice seemed quieter than I meant it to be. “I know how this ends. So let’s get it over with.” 

I watched her crouch low like a spider. *By the vent?* She pulled the cover off, then pushed an arm inside. It sunk deep, all the way to her shoulder. Her head twisted to the side, maintaining eye contact. For a moment the girl and I were silent, apart from my beating heart which pounded in my ears. I was scared to blink, staring at her wide eyes.  

There was a sudden pain in the bottom of my foot. I yelped, darting away from the vent. I could see the flash of the silver knife, poking out where I’d been standing. I felt a gush of air as another blade was flung like a whip from the doorway. It stuck in the wall by the window. I turned back just in time to see Jenna’s face, leering towards me on an unnaturally long neck as she tackled me. 

Her arms were like serpents, coiling around my arms. The pocket knife was dull and useless as she overwhelmed me. I screamed, pushing her away as I felt her wet upper jaw land against my cheek. I threw the snarling child back before she could bite down on my face. It took a few kicks before she fell off of me. She scrambled to recover her knives, during which time I ran into the hallway. I arched my foot, feeling the blood trickle between my toes. 

Stumbling into the kitchen, the cupboards had been overturned. Drawers lay on the floor, their contents scattered. I went for the cabinet by the fridge; there, I knew my mom kept the turkey knife. I had something real to defend myself now, and that was some relief. 

I peeked out around the corner. There she was standing. Right at the entranceway, and barefoot on the mat. *I can take her off guard,* I thought, *end the cycle.* Holding the knife ahead, I turned around the corner, wide eyed and trembling. 

I made eye contact with my mom as she stepped through the front door. She entered to the sight of me holding the turkey knife—pointing the blade at my sister. Naturally, Jenna screamed.  “Anthony??! What the hell’s going on in here?” 

I needed to write all these details down while they’re still fresh in my mind. My name is Anthony Lackton. I’m 20 years old and live at home with my parents and little sister. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or if I’m just seeing things. I did my best to explain what happened to my mom, tell her the events that led me to nearly attacking my sister. That I had been convinced there was an intruder in the house. 

This evening has all felt like a dream—and that’s made me feel even worse. I’m worried that I’m not living in reality right now. How do I know this isn’t the world of my dreams? Maybe it’s just taking me longer to know for sure this time.
