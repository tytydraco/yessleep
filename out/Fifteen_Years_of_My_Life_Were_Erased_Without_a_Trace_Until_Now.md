I lost contact with my husband on the 30th of April 1986.

We were supposed to fly out for a vacation in Europe. While both of us were living in Brookmoor at the time, I was visiting Eric's mother before our trip, leaving him to tie up some loose ends at home. We agreed to meet up at the airport on the 3rd of May for our flight. Thing is... Eric never showed up.

First, I tried calling him time and time again, to no avail. The line was disconnected. I didn't think of calling the neighbours. I figure now, I should've tried calling and maybe, just maybe, I could've gotten a hold of someone.

Instead, there I stood at the airport, ticket in hand, luggage beside me, trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my chest. With trembling fingers, I walked to the ticket counter, fully intending to cancel the trip and ask about a refund. But the attendant, upon seeing my name on the ticket, blinked and said: "Your husband left a message for you."

The letter was short, warm, and oddly casual. He said there had been issues with the phone lines in Brookmoor and that he couldn't risk leaving, while the service company was fiddling with the junction box right outside our home. He was worried the house might catch fire. He wrote that he couldn't wait to be hiking through Italy with me. That the quiet and the olives and the wine were just waiting for us. But for now, he begged me to go ahead without him. Our two-week room reservation would fall through if I didn't check in. Since it had been done through a spotty travel agency, nonstop customer service was unfortunately out of the question, and I wasn't able to call in to let them know we would be arriving a bit later than agreed upon. He ended the letter saying he'd catch up with me soon. That he loved me more than anything. He said the airport was the only place he could be sure to reach me.

While rather unusual, I had no doubts about my husband's message. I didn't question it, but I now think I accepted it too fast. I was certain that my husband wrote it.

I left his flight ticket behind the counter and boarded the plane alone. Alone. I waited in Europe. Waited and waited. But he never came. Days passed. Then weeks. Nothing. No messages. No calls. Nothing.

I was furious. I thought, son of a bitch left me on my own in Europe to what, tend to our house? Sure. Fuck him, I thought. You think you know someone and then they pull this shit. Unheard of.

But the nightmare wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

Since I married into the U.S., I had a green card. Or so I thought. For some reason, it had been revoked. The consulate wouldn't say why. I tried applying for a Returning Resident Visa, but it was denied. Again. And again. The U.S. Embassy was no help. After years, a decade, of back-and-forth with the embassy in Bratislava (I'd gone back to live with my family, jobless, broken), they finally gave me an answer.

The information I have given them was doctored, as in, fake. No bank accounts registered in my or my husband's name. No house. No properties. While documentation existed of me being wed to an Eric Morgan, no proof of me ever entering the United States existed.

The Embassy asked around. No one at my old job remembered me. And when they got into contact with Eric's alleged mother, she claimed she never had a son. My and my husband's existence, erased from American soil.

My family was aware of Eric, but only because I had photos in my wallet to prove it I swore they met him at the wedding. But they said they never attended one.

And then came the most disturbing revelation of all.

There was no town called Brookmoor in South Carolina. Not on any record. Not in any archive. Not on any map.

What did they mean by that? Brookmoor was my home. My gran-gran's house. A small, unassuming town, full of character and quiet ghosts. I remembered its crooked streets, its faded church, its customs. It existed. I lived there. Loved there.

*Didn't I?*

The embassy kept insisting: "*You must be confusing it with somewhere else.*"

I showed them pictures. Of the house. Of the church. They dismissed it all. Claimed it could've been anywhere. They looked at me like I was broken. Delusional.

My family tried to be supportive. But even they started to express doubt. They insisted that no one in our family had ever owned property in South Carolina. Not my gran-gran. Not anyone.

This sent me into a pit of despair. My identity in shambles. Why would it disappear if it ever existed? Was I ever married? What are these memories I have, if not real?

I went into therapy for a couple of years, trying to unlearn my own memories of love, success, marriage. I was, rather quickly, diagnosed with having Persistent Complex Confabulation, that I had produced elaborate, detailed, and enduring false memories without any intent to deceive. Likely due to a brain injury or some undiagnosable neurocognitive disorder I had developed.

MRIs. Brain scans. Neurological tests. All normal. I was sure something was wrong with me. Still, I was prescribed Risperidone to potentially treat my ailment. So, I went on living my life as if 15 years of it had never happened. Numb, dead on the inside.

What happened if not that, what I so clearly remember?

A few years ago, I decided to move to the U.S., this time on a work visa, that was approved, now that my information checked out with U.S. customs. I rented a small apartment in Hardeeville, South Carolina.

The first time in years, I again felt a sense of familiarity. In the allegedly fake memories I have, I remember going with Eric to the annual Catfish Festival that would take place every September in Hardeeville. After years of therapy, I took a plunge into my fabricated past. I went for a drive.

*How would I know about the Catfish Festival, having never been to Hardeeville?*

I also remembered the small Argent Lumber train close to city hall. I couldn't believe my eyes when it was actually there. A memory of visiting the decommissioned train on our 7th anniversary. Since the train holds the Number 7, I felt it was really cute and thoughtful of Eric to bring me there. Even though it was just a rusty old train, it oozed with sentimentality.

For a second, I felt like the memory became real, then suddenly snapped out of it, telling myself, this is not real, do not give in. I told myself I made such progress, dismissing these false memories of a life I never had. *But... what if?*

I had to know. One last trip. One last drive. Following only the fragments of my supposed false memory, I left Hardeeville, drove deep into the woods. Acting on instinct and alleged fake memory alone.

Everything I remembered as being on the road, was there, albeit with a new coat of paint. As far as my dingy memory is concerned, the last time I was here was around 36 years ago, so of course everything would be freshened up and modernized. I recalled the street names, the turns, the placement of the stop signs, I really did feel like I'd taken this road hundreds of times. My muscle memory guided me. My hands gripped the wheel tighter with each bend, as if the familiarity alone might will the town back into existence. But then it stopped. Abrupt. Cruel.

When it came to an actual road of any kind leading to Brookmoor, there was none. Where I remembered an exit, there were forests and trees. Where there had been a sign pointing to Brookmoor, it had been as if nothing had ever been there. Where I knew you had to take a sharp right turn, the ground was overgrown.

I was laughing hysterically. For a second there, just a second, I thought I may have been right about my memories and everyone who ever told me otherwise had just forgotten, erased it from their memory. It was laughably unreal. This broke me.

One thing was everyone telling me it didn't exist. But me actually seeing it with my own eyes, that 15 years of my life were fabricated and all that's left is just a 15-year void?? There was a bus stop, railing, trees, everything but a road leading to the town I once knew. The forest swallowing everything.

I stopped my car. Got out, staring into the thick wall of pine and vine. My stomach churned with nausea and dread.

*Was this the final proof? That I was insane? That my mind had spun an entire town out of nothing?*

No. I couldn't accept that.

I marched into the woods. Thinking, I'd make a road of my own. The trees were densely clumped together. Through pure hysteria and adrenaline, I kept on pushing through, tree branches scratching at my face, burrowing into my arms, my eyes tearing up. I kept on hacking through the dense forest like a madwoman, shouting and sobbing and clawing at brambles that dug into my palms. I lost my footing twice, slid down a muddy slope, tore a gash in my leg, I didn't care. I just kept on moving, stumbling forward with sticks in my hair and blood soaking into my jeans.

*Maybe it is still here somewhere.* I thought.

I screamed for Eric, screamed for the town, screamed for anyone, anything. My voice cracked, got drowned in the overwhelming sea of green.

At some point, despite their monstrous presence, the trees were letting a warm breeze brush against their foliage. Letting it whistle through the few gaps between the branches and leaves, they so graciously offered. I felt the breeze enveloping my wounds, tasting my exposed flesh, slowly crafting a silk cover between me and the outside world, seeping into my gaping wounds. I could feel it blowing under my skin, taking ownership of me bit by bit. A sensation, I can't say I've ever felt before. Every step forward felt like I was walking against something primal, as if going against the will of the gods. As if the forest itself was resisting me, telling me to turn back. And lo and behold after twenty minutes, half hour, maybe longer, time had no meaning there, going into one direction, I crawled out right next to the bus stop, back where I started. I was so absorbed by emotion and the suffocating whispers of the breeze, I must've turned back around at some point. Broken down, robbed of my will to go on, I fell to my knees.

Where are you?! Why did I have to leave my memories... Why couldn't I have lived with my fabrications for a bit longer? I screamed.

Deep within me I was expecting some kind of answer, but there was only quiet and the whistling of the wind.

This was a wakeup call for me. My memories were just delusions. I went back to Hardeeville. It took me some time, but I accepted my situation. Took my meds. Letting the numbness return. Living a carefree life. I've decided to not make it people's problem anymore. I convinced myself I was in the wrong.

Or so I thought...

*Why have I decided to share my story now?*

A few days ago, things changed.

It was a quiet night. Just me, a glass of wine, and some YouTube true crime content. My guilty pleasure.

While scrolling through what to watch, there it was. I almost skipped it.

My breath caught in my throat. The color drained from my face. It's as if seeing an old friend, someone you buried deep down in your subconcious, but now after all those years they are here, standing in front of you, staring deep into your soul. Staring at me, a thumbnail, the logo of Channel 72, Brookmoor's local TV station.

What I was feeling was visceral. I got a hot flash in my head, it felt like a raging fire was trying to escape the confines of my skull. I started feeling lightheaded, my heart beating, like a war drum. Deafening.

*How is this real? How could this be? How can this exist?*

I thought it was all only in my memories, in my delusions, but suddenly it's here, so very real, searing into my brain.

The pine tree standing proud with the call sign WBRM-CA. It seems to be a recording from an old Channel 72 broadcast, but it's been tampered with, warped, overrecorded. The ominously called youtube channel, ***there is no home***, appeared out of nowhere.

I felt a sense of vindication.

It seems someone has somehow found some evidence of the town's existence. Seems like it goes beyond what I remember, but I remember the names of the people from the list in what is called ***tape2.forecast***

My neighbours, townsfolk, friends...

Once figments of my imagination, now real, tangible. My mind is still racing about what this all means.

I am sharing this in hope that one of you would perhaps remember. Maybe there's something that could lead me to Eric, or at least assure me of his and the town's existence.

Because if a broadcast, belonging to the supposedly non-existing town, has been preserved, who knows how much else has been captured on these tapes, that would, for once and for all, confirm the existence of Brookmoor and what happened to the town I so clearly remember.

I'm finally sure that I'm not alone in my memories.  
I have, finally after years, again the feeling that there is a home for me to come back to.
