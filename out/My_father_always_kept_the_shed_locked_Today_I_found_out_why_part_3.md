The Undergraves were as close to literal Hell as I could imagine. In fact, we only survived because of a twist of fate and a sad, lonely mutant.


There were creatures everywhere, and most of them were horrible things to behold. More of the strange pig-men with long knives had come out of the surrounding rooms. They always had human bodies hung up and butchered, drying meat stretched out on hooks all around the room. Hell, if Gil and I had no problem with cannibalism, we could eat for years in this place. 


I had shot at least a dozen of the pig-men, trying to conserve my ammo by using only a single headshot where possible, and Gil had decapitated probably a dozen more. Some of them we just ran away from, especially if there were large groups. But it felt like we were going further into the fire rather than escaping from it. 


There were windows now, endless windows along the sides of the rooms, and they showed a world in flames. I saw people with missing limbs huddled around barrel fires in bombed-out cities, husks of tanks scattered across the street and bodies hanging from the lampposts. I began to see where the meat to feed all these creatures was coming from. Gil and I found a room with a pyramid of clothes, shoes and glasses that stretched to the top of the room.


“Brother,” Gil said, “this place makes me sick.” I sighed, sitting down on a pile of clothes and opening some beef jerky and a candy bar. I checked my ammo supplies, and realized I was down to my last magazine.


“I can’t wait to get out of this fucking place,” I said. “The smell of so many dead bodies must have seeped into my clothes by now.” Then I heard a soft rustling from behind me. I turned my body, pulling up the gun and pointing it. A strange man stood there with his hands up.


He reminded me of pictures I had seen of the Elephantman. Tumors and scarred, rounded growths stuck out all over his head. His forehead sloped radically to the left, and one of his eyes was slanted, the folds of skin around it hanging loosely above and beneath it. He had on an old military uniform, one I assumed he scrounged from some dead body. My finger tightened on the trigger for a moment, then I relaxed. He had no visible weapons.


“Please…” he said. “Can I get a chocolate bar?” I laughed, breaking the tension and handing him an Eisenheart. It was, apparently, a brand he knew and loved, for he ripped it open and ate it, smiling and bowing. I gave him a soda too. His face brightened like a child’s. “Thank you, thank you! Nice men, very nice.”


“What’s your name, friend?” Gil said slowly, still holding his bowie knife tightly. I still had my finger on the trigger as well, but I had a feeling we wouldn’t need weapons for this guy.


“Frankie,” he said. His smile was so wide now that it showed all three of his remaining teeth. “I’m a friend?”


“Sure,” I said. “Why not? Frankie, my name is Luke, and this is Gil. We’re good guys. We’re… not from here. In fact, we are trying to get out. Do you know how to get out of here?” Frankie paused for a long moment, as if that many sentences at once had overloaded his brain’s processing power. His face took on a slack, vacant look. Then he brightened and nodded.


“You can go to Rusty Township right out there,” he said excitedly, pointing out the window to where a woman’s body was being picked apart by angry, squawking birds. I shook my head, smiling.


“While that seems like a real nice place,” I said, “I’m actually looking for another where. We came down here on the circular stone stairs. Some… uh, real nice people told us that those stairs could be found over here in the Undergraves, if you follow that strange hallway covered in muscle and skin straight.” Those “real nice people” had also been cheering and clapping as they shoved one another in an iron maiden and let the blood soak into the floors, I remembered. Frankie laughed, a genuine, happy sound that felt strange in this place.


“No, friend,” he said, wiping a tear from his eye, “if you go straight into the Undergraves, you come to the Pit of the Skull. There’s thousands of angry demons in there. They’d eat you.” He continued laughing. “I think your other friends played a joke on you.” I swore, my face darkening. Gil looked like he was about to be sick.


“Never trust a woman with scurvy blossoms on her face,” Gil muttered. “I should have known.”


“So we would have died if we followed their directions?” I asked. Frankie nodded. I wanted to go back to where I had seen them and use the last of my magazine on those sick weirdos, but I tried to focus on my breathing and calm down.


“Jesus man, it’s a good thing we found you,” Gil said, reaching into his pocket with his unmutilated hand. “You want another chocolate bar?”

From what we learned from Frankie, who tended to stare off into space and drift off topic but seemed otherwise all there, the people who sacrificed each other to the iron maiden or, as they called it, the steel mistress, were all refugees from Rusty Township. They were also apparently cannibal cult members. Once they had drained the blood from whoever picked the burnt match or played Tic Tac Toe the worst or whatever other insane way they chose, they would throw the mutilated body into the opening of the Undergraves. The demons would come out after the drums and drag the body away to eat it. And the cult members also tended to send wayward travelers, like ourselves, down into the Undergraves to get killed and eaten by demons. Apparently they thought these precautions kept them safe from the majority of the horrors of the Undergraves, and hell, they had survived this long, so maybe they were right.


The urge to go back and murder the whole lot of them came strongly to me. I could see Gil felt the same way. But getting home was far more important.


Frankie had lived here for years, foraging from the occasional vending machines and stealing supplies from the cult members and demons. I assumed this means he ate human meat for a lot of his calories, but I wasn’t going to point it out. It just didn’t seem polite at this point. He seemed like a hard guy to upset though. After all the things he had seen, it was hard to imagine him turning out otherwise.


But it also meant he knew the halls and intersections like the back of his hand. When I explained to him the staircase we had come through, his eyes lit up.


“I know it,” he said, “but it is nowhere near the Undergraves. It changes, but it is always found at either the beginning of the Endless Hall…”


“That’s where we came in, I think,” Gil said. “It seemed endless enough.”


“Or it hides between the meeting place of Veriden and Rusty Township.”


“So we were right next to it?” I asked angrily. Now I *really* wanted to kill those lunatic cult members. Frankie nodded, drawing back slightly, his eyes widening at my anger.


“Well, let’s go,” Gil said, looking more tired than I had ever seen him, holding the bloody, bandaged remains of his hand against his chest and wincing. “I’m tired as hell, but I’d like to get out of here before those nutjobs find us and throw us in an iron maiden, or maybe some pig monster slices me up and makes jerky from my muscles.” Frankie shook his head violently.


“No, no, no,” Frankie said, “if you go back the way you came, you will die. The drums stopped.”


“What are the drums?” I asked. He shrugged.


“They come from the ceilings and walls,” he said, describing a small, black box that sounded like a speaker. “Maybe they were originally set up before the collapse of Rusty Township. I know not, friend.”


“I don’t give a flying fuck about the drums,” Gil said. “What happens if we just walk back the way we came?”


“The cleaner comes after the drums,” Frankie said in a whisper. “The cleaner is mean. He is a tall, metal man, as tall as the ceilings, and he is strong. I’ve seen him snap the pig-men in half.”


“So is there another way around the main hall?” I asked. Frankie took a long moment to think, then he nodded.


“It’s dangerous too,” he said. “The tunnel underneath leads back, but it has strange things.” This was all he would say about it. 


“OK, Frankie, lead the way,” Gil said, throwing the deformed man a bag of beef jerky and a soda. We were getting very low on food and drinks by this point, but as I saw it, it wouldn’t matter. Either we would get out, and we would have plenty of food and drinks back home, or we wouldn’t, and we wouldn’t need food and drinks if that was the case. An old riddle popped into my head as I considered this. *What is greater than God, worse than the devil, the dead eat it always, but if the living eat it, then they die? Nothing.*


Frankie got up quickly, eating the entire bag of beef jerky in a single swallow, which I didn’t even know was possible until I saw him do it. His cheeks were stuffed like a chipmunk, and he chewed slowly and thoughtfully with his few remaining teeth, savoring the taste of the meat.


Then he went back behind a pile of clothes, felt around on the floor, and with a cry of triumph, pulled out a weapon. It was just a baseball bat with rusty, bent nails sticking out of it like the broken quills of a porcupine, but it was better than nothing.


“Let’s go, friends,” Frankie said. “I would do anything to help my new friends. You should go home, where you belong. We all need a home…” He trailed off sadly. I looked around at where he lived, and my heart broke for him.


He stuck his huge head out the door, looking up and down the main hallway of the Undergraves. Slick, muscular growths covered the walls, the ceiling and the floor. The red stuff seemed to contract and expand, as if it were undergoing peristalsis.


With a look back, he nodded and went forward. We followed along, placing all of our trust in this strange being who called us his friends.


\***


The hatchway to the tunnel was in an auxiliary room a few hundred feet down the hall. I walked in front next to Frankie, seeing as I had a gun and needed to be able to shoot in an instant without worrying about them being in my way. The hatchway was rusted and ancient-looking. It had a wheel that had to be turned to open it, and it took the strength of all three of us to get it moving. It squealed loudly, flakes of rust splintering off it. I cursed under my breath, hoping that it wouldn’t draw attention. As soon as it was open, we went down the ladder, one by one, underneath the main hall.


The tunnel was cramped and dark. Red emergency lights placed every hundred feet or so gave us some illumination, but not much. Everything had a bloody glow to it. And there were auxiliary shafts running off the main one, some with no lights at all. But in the darkness, I could have sworn I saw movement, as if a slightly less black silhouette were moving towards us through the darkness.


We got through as fast as we could. Another ladder led up, and we took it. But that strange sensation of being followed by dark shapes hadn’t left me.


The ladder opened into a room I didn’t recognize at first. The hatchway panel opened up into a place filled with detritus, broken furniture and mold spread out all over the floor. But when we got into the main hallway, I felt like cheering. Further down, I saw the sign for the intersection of Rusty Township and Veriden. And crossing in front of it, I saw the cult members who had tried to give us directions to the ninth circle of Hell, or whatever that place truly was.


“Stop right fucking there!” I screamed, raising the gun. The dark-haired woman with the scurvy blossoms on her face jumped so high, I thought she might fall over. The other cult members turned and looked at me, surprised and afraid. “Didn’t expect to see me again, did you? Thought I would get killed by demons and maybe you could take my body and eat it? Or just give it as a sacrifice to those abominations?”


“Sir, I am sorry,” the woman said, “but we must get out of here. The machine…”


“Stay right there, or I will blow your goddamn head off,” I said, walking forwards quickly and shoving the gun in her face. “Your brains will be dripping off the wall. You’re not going anywhere.”


And then I heard it. A mechanical whine started down the hallway, coming closer.


“The cleaner,” Frankie whispered in a tone that reminded me of the scared voice of a child. “Oh God, the cleaner…”


I kept the gun raised, but prodded the woman forwards towards the intersection of the three hallways, looking down towards the Rusty Township side, where the noises were coming from. What I saw sent my heart racing.


It was a robot, at least ten feet tall. Its silvery skin shone in the flickering fluorescent lights. It had two eyes that shone white LED light, a slit of a mouth, and long arms and legs that looked like they had been made of steel beams.


“Freeze,” it said in an emotionless voice. “Please show identification.” The cult members screamed and started to scatter like cockroaches. The robot instantly responded upon seeing them move, taking one of its long arms and running forward, whipping it across the hall in a blur. I heard bones crack and saw bodies break as they were pushed into the walls and, in one case, out of the window. I heard shrieking for a few seconds as the hapless man fell to his death.


“You’ve killed us all,” the dark-haired woman told me accusingly. She tried to run away from me as I backpedaled away from the insane robot, but it grabbed her, twisting off her neck with a loud crack. Blood poured out of her head as the robot threw it across the ground, rolling it like a bowling ball.


“You are in violation of executive order number 82,” the robot said. “Show identification, or lethal force will be used.” It was running at me now, and I saw it approaching as if in slow motion. I knew I was dead.


And then Frankie came running out, swinging his baseball bat as hard as he could into the robot’s back. The nails stuck into the metal. I saw his large muscles bulging as he tried to pull it out. But before he could, the robot turned and hit him with a balled-up metal hand. Frankie’s skull collapsed inwards as he fell, crumpling into a heap in the corner.


“No!” I screamed, running forwards. I looked at the bright eyes of the robot, and suddenly, an idea came to me. It was the only one I had.


I started emptying the magazine into the robot’s face, and within seconds, its white eyes had burst. My ears were ringing from so many gunshots in such a small space. Sparks and wires shot out, and the robot began to wail. The smell of gunpowder and burning metal filled the area.


“Visual centers offline,” it said, “visual centers offline. This is a catastrophic error. Contact Victoriat Arms Corporation and report the location and type of this error. A large reward is offered. Please call 1-600-333…” I stopped listening. The robot had begun to move randomly, swinging its arms and legs in wide circles as its alarm blared. I saw it crush a few more cult members to death. It smashed into the walls, breaking the sheetrock and leaving huge dents and holes everywhere.


I ran over to Frankie. He was still alive, though he was fading rapidly. His eyes were shutting.


“Did I help my friends?” he said slowly, sadly. I nodded, a single tear falling from my eye.


“You saved us,” I said. “I’m so sorry…” He nodded, then closed his eyes and let out a long breath.


“The stairs… are down the Veriden hall. Before the train to Naraka,” he said. “Go home, friend. Go home.” Blood pooled around his broken head as his lips began to turn blue and his breath stopped.


Gil pulled me up, whispering in my ear.


“I think we’re being followed,” he said. “We need to go now.” And so we did. We began running down the hallway. I looked back, seeing the bodies of the dead cult members and the kamikaze writhings of the robot as he smashed into random rooms and went further down the hallway towards Rusty Township.


But there was something there, something dark and humanoid. I squinted, but it faded into the shadows.


“There!” Gil yelled, pointing to a door I recognized. It was a chipped blue door with a daisy painted on the front. My euphoria and elation was so high at seeing it that I grabbed Gil and hugged him.


“Frankie did it,” I said. “He got us here…” And then we heard the shriek from behind us. I turned to look, but it was all dark shadows now behind us. The flickering lights had died.


We flung open the door, running through it. It opened on the same circular stone steps that we had used to get down here. They were still slick, still endless, and still had no railing, but my adrenaline was so high that I just started sprinting. My fear of heights had nothing on my fears of what was down here with us.


But whatever it was following us, it was getting closer. I could hear it gaining, hear it shrieking. I checked my gun as I ran, and was not surprised to see I had no ammo left. All we had was that damned bowie knife.


I was exhausted, but we kept running, on the verge of passing out. Eventually the temperature started to go up, and the air felt less oppressive and thick. I could see the entrance to the shed a few more revolutions up around the circular stones. Using the last of our energy, we sprinted to the end of the stairs.


We ran out into the shed, clearing the last of the slick, stone steps. The door was locked, just like when we left it. There seemed to be new gouges in the plate metal shielding the interior of the shed, deep claw marks and lines running every which way, but especially over the shielding for the door. Gil fumbled in his pockets for the key.


“Hurry up,” I said through gritted teeth. “It’s coming.”


“I can’t…” Gil said, reaching into every pocket. He kept coming up empty-handed. He had lost the key, and now we were going to die. I slammed a new magazine into the pistol, ready to fight to the death. 


Then he reached into the little pocket built into the main pocket of his right front jeans, and I heard a tiny jingle. He brought up the leather strap with the shed key on it. With shaking hands, he shoved it in the lock and began turning.


I heard deep thudding footsteps only feet behind us now, and a demonic voice began to shriek. My ears rang in a high-pitched squealing, but I kept my hand on the now useless gun, looking back and forth from the door to the last step. Just as Gil pushed open the door, I saw it.


It had empty, black sockets where its eyes should have been. Its skin looked like the tight, desiccated skin of a mummy, and it seemed to tremble and writhe as its body moved. Its mouth opened nearly to the center of its chest, just a huge, black void that sent out deafening screams constantly, seemingly without needing to breathe.


We slammed the door shut. I put all my body weight against it as Gil put the key into the lock and began to turn. There was a tremendous shaking as the abomination slammed into the door, and then Gil clicked the lock into place and pulled the key out. I slid to the floor, my heart beating so fast that I couldn’t feel the individual beats anymore.


After resting a while, we went back into the house. Gil flipped on the TV, where we saw “Breaking News” flashing across the screen on our local channel.


“The death of an entire family in Lancester County today continues to remain unsolved. Authorities state the neighbor found the bodies of Larry Matheson, age 46, his wife Linda Matheson, age 41, and their children, Jonathan Matheson, age 11, Jordan Matheson, age 7, and Abigail Matheson, age 3. Authorities state that the amount of violence at the scene was ‘unbelievable’, and that the victims were physically mutilated both before and after death.


“In addition, authorities told our reporters that the heads of the children were removed, and that they still found no sign of them. Police believe the killer or killers likely took the heads with them.


“Anyone with any leads is asked to call…” I shut off the TV. Gil looked up at me. The shrieking in the shed started up again, and I heard scratching and clawing coming from behind the house.


“Something got out,” I said. “Something got out of the shed.”
