I woke up to the smell of coffee and something faintly sweet. For a moment, I thought it was a phantom scent conjured by memory. It had been ages since I last woke to the smell of hazelnut creamer, her favorite. I lay still, eyes closed, trying to chase the sleep-fog from my head. Maybe I’d left a window open and it was coming from a neighbor’s kitchen.

Then I heard humming. A low, lilting hum following a tune I almost recognized. My heart stumbled. It was exactly how she hummed when she cooked in the mornings. I felt like I was being yanked from one reality to another.

It couldn’t be. Becca had been gone for eighteen months. Gone as in divorced—ripped out of my life. We hadn’t spoken in a year. The last I saw of her was on the courthouse steps after signing the papers: her eyes red and lips trembling, my chest so tight I could barely breathe. She drove off, and I told myself I’d never look back.

So hearing her humming in my kitchen on a Monday morning was enough to make me question if I was still dreaming. I stayed frozen under the sheets, listening. The coffee aroma was real. So were the faint clinks of dishware. And that melody—God, it was the old Ella Fitzgerald song she used to play. She was in my kitchen.

I slid out of bed as quietly as possible. A cold dread coiled under my ribs. If someone was in my house, I needed to be careful. If she was in my house… I had no idea what to do. Call the police on my ex-wife for breaking in? The thought made me hesitate. Maybe I should call out to her. Or maybe this was some kind of elaborate dream, manufactured by equal parts loneliness and guilt.

I crept down the hallway. The closer I got to the kitchen, the more undeniable it became. The humming grew clearer. The coffeemaker gurgled. I even heard the faint scrape of a spatula on a pan—something sizzling. My mind was doing somersaults.

I peeked around the doorway, half expecting a stranger or a hallucination. Instead, I saw her.

Becca stood at my stove, her back to me, humming quietly as she pushed something around in a frying pan. She was wearing one of my old t-shirts—faded navy blue with our college emblem on it—as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Her dark hair was pulled up in a messy bun, and she looked so much like the last morning we shared under the same roof that I felt a physical ache in my chest.

I must have made some involuntary noise—a sharp intake of breath or a shuffle of my feet—because she turned. When she saw me standing there, her face lit up with a smile, warm and guileless.

“Oh, hey sleepyhead!” she said, just like she used to. “I was going to surprise you with breakfast in bed, but I guess I took too long.” She laughed softly, as if nothing about this was strange, as if she belonged here.

I gripped the doorframe. My knuckles were bloodless and white. This was wrong. This was so profoundly wrong that I couldn’t even find words.

“B—Becca?” I managed to choke out. Her name felt foreign in my mouth after so long. I realized I hadn’t spoken it aloud in over a year.

She tilted her head, that concerned little wrinkle forming between her eyebrows. “Who else?”

She stepped forward, off the kitchen mat, and I reflexively took a step back. Her smile faltered, confusion creeping into her brown eyes.

“Are you okay, hon?” she asked. She reached out as if to feel my forehead for a fever. I jerked away before she could touch me. The movement was instinctive, something between fear and disbelief.

Her hand hovered in the space between us before she slowly let it drop. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” she said with a half-chuckle, clearly trying to lighten the mood. Her smile returned, but it looked more unsure now.

I couldn’t reply. My tongue felt glued to the roof of my mouth. A ghost—that’s exactly what she was, in a sense. A ghost of my past life manifesting in my kitchen on a perfectly ordinary morning.

My heart hammered as adrenaline started to flood my system. This had to be a prank or some kind of breakdown. Maybe I was hallucinating, or I’d finally lost it from the solitude. I had heard of people losing time or seeing dead loved ones—only, Becca wasn’t dead. She was just supposed to be gone.

“Do you… want some coffee?” she asked gently. She held out a mug toward me, as if coaxing a wild animal. I noticed then that she’d set the small kitchen table. Two places. A plate with toast and scrambled eggs at one seat—my usual breakfast, down to the two pieces of wheat toast and the pat of butter on the side.

I swallowed and forced myself to speak. “What are you doing here?” I said. The question came out hoarse and too low, almost a whisper.

Becca blinked. “Um… making you breakfast?” she said like it was obvious. There was a cautious note in her voice now. The look on her face—that mix of love and concern—I knew it intimately. It was the look she used to give me when I’d come home from an awful day at work, when I was clearly upset but wouldn’t talk about it. The memory of those times hit me unexpectedly, bringing a pang of longing and confusion.

“No,” I said, shaking my head firmly. “I mean—why are you here? In my house?”

She slowly lowered the mug of coffee to the counter. Her eyes flickered over me, then around the kitchen, as if checking whether everything was normal. “I live here. Why wouldn’t I be here?”

My legs went weak. I had to brace myself against the doorframe for support. The world tilted a fraction. “No you don’t,” I whispered. But even as I said it, doubt gnawed at me. The scene in front of me contradicted everything I thought I knew.

She took a tentative step closer. Her slippered feet—the same worn terry-cloth slippers I remember packing into a donation box after she left—scuffed softly on the tile. “Sweetie, did you have a nightmare? You look so pale.”

I stared at her, struggling to form a rational thought. If this was a delusion, it was astoundingly detailed. The freckles on the bridge of her nose, the tiny burn scar on her forearm from when she once splattered oil cooking—they were all there. The familiar indentation from her wedding ring… My eyes shot to her left hand.

She was wearing her wedding ring.

My world stopped. The silver band with its tiny inset diamonds winked at me as if mocking my shock. I felt my stomach lurch. This ring—she had taken it off the day we decided to divorce, and I hadn’t seen it since. I remembered watching her twist it off her finger in the kitchen of this very house, tears streaming down her face, before she placed it carefully on the counter between us. I’d left it there for weeks after she was gone, not daring to touch it, like it was radioactive. Eventually, it vanished—I assumed she came back for it at some point, or maybe I had stuffed it in a drawer in a moment of weakness.

But here it was, snug on her finger. And as I lifted my own trembling hand to look—I felt a cold metal circlet against my skin. I was wearing my ring as well.

I yanked the band off in a panic. My hands shook as I held it up. It was unmistakable—engraved on the inside with our wedding date. I felt the room sway.

“How—?” I stammered, not really directing the question at her, but she answered anyway.

“How what, honey?” she asked softly.

“How is this happening?” I nearly shouted. “We—we’re divorced.” The word felt taboo to speak out loud, like an offense. It hung in the air, ugly and out of place.

Becca’s face drained of color. Her eyes widened, and for a moment I saw true fear in them. “What are you talking about?” she asked, voice hushed and careful, as if humoring a madman.

My heart sank. She truly looked like she had no idea what I meant. Either this was a cruel joke and she was a masterful actress, or something was horribly wrong with either me or reality itself.

I stepped back into the doorway, putting more distance between us. “We’re not married,” I said, enunciating each word. “Not anymore. We signed the papers last year. You moved out. We haven’t spoken since.”

As I spoke, a strange confidence filled me. These were the facts, the truth I remembered. Saying them out loud anchored me, gave me a script of sanity to hold onto. I expected at any second that her face would break into a guilty smile and some friend with a camera would pop out and yell gotcha! Because otherwise…

But no such reveal came. Instead, Becca’s expression twisted—hurt and confusion bleeding into anger. “This isn’t funny,” she said. I saw tears glint in her eyes, and her voice wavered despite the anger. “Why are you talking to me like this?”

I opened my mouth, but she barreled on, voice rising. “That’s a horrible thing to say, [Your Name].” She almost never used my full name—hearing it now was like a slap. “How could you… even joke about that?”

“I’m not joking,” I said. My throat burned. She had to understand; I needed her to understand. “We did divorce. Last year. Don’t you remember?” My voice was pleading now.

Her eyes glistened, bewildered and hurt. “You promised you’d never put me through that again,” she said unsteadily. “Why are you doing this? What did I do wrong?”

My heart cracked. She sounded exactly like she did the day I actually left—haunted, pleading. I realized she truly had no idea what I was talking about. Either the world’s cruelest prank was unfolding, or I was losing my mind.

“You didn’t do anything,” I croaked. “I… I don’t understand what’s happening.”

She wiped her eyes, trying to steady herself. “Maybe we should call someone—your mom, or a doctor…”

Mom. My mother had been my rock through the divorce. If anyone could confirm my version of reality, it was her.

“I’ll call Mom,” I said, grabbing my phone off the counter with trembling hands.

Becca hovered anxiously as I dialed. After a couple rings, my mother picked up. “Hi sweetheart! Everything okay? You don’t usually call this early.”

“Mom,” I said, voice shaking, “when… when did Becca and I split up?”

A confused silence. “Split up? What are you talking about, dear?”

My chest tightened. “Mom, we got divorced. Last year. You were there for me… Don’t you remember?”

I heard my mother’s breathing hitch. “Sweetie, that never happened. You and Becca are together. Why would you think otherwise?”

I nearly dropped the phone. A cold sweat broke out over me. I hung up without saying more, my mind reeling. Even my own mother didn’t remember the divorce.

“This can’t be real,” I whispered.

I stared around the kitchen, my vision swimming. Objects that had vanished after she left were suddenly back in place. The bright yellow sugar bowl from our last vacation sat by the coffee pot. And on the wall by the pantry hung framed photographs—ones I’d hidden away after the separation.

My breath caught. There we were at the beach on our third anniversary, both sunburned and grinning. Next to it, a portrait from our wedding day—her in lace and me beaming with youthful hope. Photo after photo of us, happy and together, now decorated the kitchen as if the divorce had never happened.

My knees buckled and I sank to the floor, overwhelmed. This was impossible—yet it was all around me, surrounding me with evidence that the life I remembered had been replaced.

Becca was at my side in an instant. She knelt and wrapped her arms around me. I stiffened, then broke down sobbing into her shoulder.

“I’m so scared,” I choked out. “I don’t understand any of this.”

She held me tight, voice soft and soothing. “It’s okay. We’ll figure it out,” she whispered, stroking my back. Her touch was warm and real. I clung to her, afraid to let go, afraid she’d disappear if I did.

It took a while for me to calm down. Finally, I pulled back and wiped my face. One thought thudded in my skull: maybe there was physical proof I could find—something that hadn’t changed.

I went to the study and opened the wall safe where we kept important documents. My hands shook as I rifled through the files. Our marriage certificate was there, the house deed, insurance papers—everything in order. But the divorce decree, the paperwork that had formally ended our marriage in my memory, was nowhere to be found. It simply didn’t exist.

My stomach churned. The world was telling me in every way that we had never split up. Reality itself had rewritten our history.

Becca stood by quietly, arms crossed lightly as if bracing for something. She watched me comb through the last folder and slam the safe shut, defeated.

“Nothing,” I croaked.

“What exactly were you expecting to find?” she asked gently.

I hesitated, then decided on a half-truth. “I thought maybe I’d find something to prove these other memories I have. But… nothing’s there.”

She moved closer and put a hand on my arm. Her concerned stare made my throat tight. “Sweetheart, maybe we should go to the hospital. You might have had some kind of… I don’t know, an episode. This sounds like serious memory loss or confusion. I’m really worried.”

She was right—what else could we do? But I couldn’t shake a deep sense of dread that doing so would seal some fate. Still, I had no explanation and I was scared.

I nodded reluctantly. “Okay. Let’s go, but… can you drive? I’m feeling a bit out of it.”

“Of course,” she said immediately, relieved that I was cooperating.

At her urging, I let her take me to the hospital that afternoon. I went through hours of exams—neurological tests, scans, consultations. Everything came back normal. The doctors were perplexed; one gently suggested I might be experiencing a stress-induced dissociative episode. In other words, my mind had conjured a false memory of a divorce that never happened.

We returned home with no real answers. I was relieved my brain seemed healthy, but that only deepened the mystery. If nothing was wrong with me physically, then something fundamentally unexplainable had happened to my life. The psychiatrist on call gently asked if I could have imagined the whole divorce. I had no answer that didn’t make me sound insane.

That night, sleep came in uneasy fits. I dreamed I was chasing my divorce papers through a maze of corridors, and every time I turned a corner I’d find Becca instead, looking at me with disappointment. In another dream, I was at that park by the pond, like in the photograph I’d never taken, and she was telling me something important, but I couldn’t hear a word. All I heard was a rushing sound, like the wind or blood in my ears.

I woke up sometime deep in the night to the sound of someone crying. For a disoriented second, I thought it was part of another dream. But as I blinked in the darkness, I realized the bed was empty beside me.

The bathroom door was open a crack, light spilling out. The muffled sobbing was coming from there.

I got up, heart quickening, and approached. Through the gap I saw her: sitting on the tiled floor in her pajamas, back against the tub, face buried in her hands as her shoulders shook with silent sobs.

“Becca…” I whispered, pushing the door open gently.

She startled, hastily wiping her face. “I-I’m sorry,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “I didn’t want to wake you.”

I lowered myself to the floor next to her. Seeing her cry broke something in me. “What’s wrong?” I asked softly.

She let out a shaky breath, trying to compose herself and failing. “I’m just… I’m scared, [Your Name]. I don’t know what’s happening to you. You really don’t remember our last year together? Any of it?”

I looked down at my hands. Even now, confronted directly, I couldn’t lie to her. “I remember being apart,” I said quietly. “I remember… us ending.”

She choked back a sob. I continued, voice trembling, spilling in a hushed tone the way things had gone in my mind—how we drifted, how fights escalated, the decision to separate. As I spoke, she listened, tears rolling down her cheeks. I told her about signing the papers, that final moment I saw her as my wife and then not.

By the time I finished, my eyes were wet too. It felt like eulogizing a lost loved one.

“That never happened for me,” she whispered. “Yes, we had problems… we even separated for a week, but you came back. We worked through it. I thought we were stronger now. But today you woke up and it’s like you forgot all that. Like you replaced our hard-earned happy ending with—and it was just gone.” Her voice trembled on the edge of breaking again.

I closed my eyes. Happy ending. In my world, I had robbed us of that. Hearing that in her reality I didn’t leave, that we fought for each other and made it… it gutted me. It was like hearing about someone else living my life better than I did.

She sniffled. “I keep thinking—what if you wake up tomorrow and don’t know me at all? Or what if… what if this other memory of yours is real somehow and I’m the one who’s… I don’t know, imagining things.” Her hands twisted nervously in her lap. “I feel like I’m losing my mind too.”

Instinctively, I reached out and took her hand. “I won’t let that happen,” I said, voice raw. “I’m scared too. But I know who you are. I promise, I won’t forget that. No matter what I remember or don’t.”

It was a confusing statement, but she squeezed my hand, maybe understanding what I meant in her own way.

We ended up sitting there on the bathroom floor for a long while, holding hands in silence, collecting ourselves.

Eventually, we returned to bed. This time, when she scooted closer and rested her head against my chest, I didn’t flinch or pull away. I put my arm around her, drawing her in. Her warmth, her heartbeat against my side—I focused on these real, physical sensations. Whatever else was real or unreal, this was tangible: she was here, and so was I.

In the days that followed, life took on a tentative rhythm. I was afraid to be alone, and she was afraid to leave me, so we spent most of our time together. I took a leave from work (explaining I was sick). She did the same.

At her urging, I went to see her friend who was a neurologist for further evaluation. More tests, more waiting. Every scan said I was fine. My brain was perfectly healthy. Which in a twisted way was terrifying—if nothing was physically wrong, then how could I trust what was in my head?

But as those days passed, a strange thing happened. I started to remember little flashes of the “life” I supposedly had with her this past year. Or maybe “remember” isn’t the right word—more like I experienced moments of familiarity that I hadn’t before.

For instance, on the third day, I was making coffee (I insisted on taking over the morning routine to give her a break). I suddenly recalled an image of us dancing in the living room after painting the walls green. It came out of nowhere, but it was vivid: we were covered in paint smudges, a splotch of sage in her hair, laughing as some cheesy 80s song played. That never happened in my reality, but as I stood there, I remembered it like it had.

Another time, she was chopping vegetables for dinner, and I had a flash of us cooking together at the stove, bumping hips playfully. A happy, domestic snippet of life I had never lived—yet now it felt like a memory.

It scared me deeply. It felt like my mind was betraying me, giving ground to whatever shift had occurred.

At first, I didn’t tell her these incidents. But I think she could tell when it happened—she’d see me drift off with a strange look on my face. Finally, when she asked, I admitted it. Expecting her to freak out, I was surprised when she expressed cautious optimism.

“Maybe it means you’re getting better,” she said. “Your memories of us… our real memories… are coming back.” The idea clearly comforted her.

But it sent ice through my veins. Because to me, it felt like I was losing my real memories, replaced by ones from someone else’s life—a life where I hadn’t been the one in control.

I started keeping a journal in secret, scribbling down details of the “divorce timeline” whenever I could, afraid they’d slip away. Dates, conversations I recalled, even petty details like what I had for dinner by myself on certain nights. It was an anchor to the identity I knew.

About a week after that fateful morning, I woke up late. We had gone to see a movie the night before (a movie I’d already seen alone in my timeline, but she insisted I must have forgotten seeing it with her—I hadn’t argued). For once, I had slept deeply, no nightmares.

I reached across the bed—she wasn’t there. I heard her downstairs, talking to someone? No, talking to herself, it sounded like, or maybe on the phone?

Curious, I got up and quietly crept halfway down the stairs. She was in the living room, in her robe, pacing. I realized she was on a call.

“…I’m telling you, he’s different,” she was saying, voice hushed but intense. “He’s trying, but I can see it in his eyes. Sometimes he looks at me like I’m a ghost, or like he’s the ghost. It breaks my heart… I don’t know how to help him…”

I winced. She must have been talking to her sister or a close friend. I hadn’t considered how awful this must be for her, living with a husband who woke up one day convinced they’d split up.

There was a pause; she was listening to whoever was on the other end. Then she spoke again, words that made my stomach drop: “No… no, I haven’t told him. How do I even bring that up? He was so adamant that things were different. I’m scared what it might do if I show him… Yes, I know, but—okay, okay.”

She took a deep breath, rubbing her forehead. “I’ll try. Maybe not today, but soon. Love you too. Bye.”

I retreated silently back up before she could catch me eavesdropping. Slipping back into the bedroom, my mind raced. What was she hiding from me? Something she could “show” me? At first I feared it was divorce-related—like maybe she’d found evidence I was right but was afraid to show it—but the way she spoke, it sounded like the opposite, like proof of the life I forgot that might shock me.

That day, I decided to rip off the bandaid myself. I needed to confront this head-on.

I asked her to sit with me in the living room. Sunlight filtered through the curtains onto the familiar furniture that I still second-guessed as real. We sat close, her hands clasped between mine.

“I want you to tell me about our last year,” I said gently. “The one I don’t remember. I need to hear it.”

She looked at me cautiously. “Are you sure?”

I nodded. “I think… I think part of me might remember bits, but I need to know the whole picture. Maybe it’ll jog something. And even if it doesn’t, I want to know. I want to know us.”

Her eyes softened. So she began to tell our story as she knew it:

How, around a year ago, we had teetered on the brink of separation—the same big fight I remembered, but in her version I came back the next day apologizing. We gave our marriage another chance. It wasn’t easy; we spent months in counseling, unpacking all the hurts that had once driven us apart. We both changed, she said—she learned to give me space when I needed it, I learned to open up instead of shutting her out. Slowly, trust rebuilt. We fell back in love with each other in a way, discovering new appreciation for the little things.

She recalled quiet Friday nights cooking together, tentative laughter replacing tension. She spoke of a weekend trip to the coast where we talked for hours on the beach, laying ghosts to rest. By the time autumn came, we were solid again—renewed. Last Christmas I’d surprised her with a new ring, a symbol of recommitment. And just a couple months ago, we had decided to try for a baby, hopeful and excited for the first time in ages.

I felt a jolt at that. In the life I remembered, the idea of having a child had been a painful sticking point between us—one we never got past. Yet in her version, even that had transformed into a source of hope for our future.

Her voice hitched as she described all this, as if afraid the spell would break. I sat there absorbing a year of memories I didn’t share, a life where I had done everything right instead of everything wrong. It sounded beautiful. It also sounded unreal to me, like she was talking about a stranger—some better version of myself who deserved her.

By the time she finished, both of us were in tears. I realized how miraculous this second chance was—no matter how impossible. I drew her into my arms. “I’m so sorry,” I whispered. “For all of this. I love you, Becca. I won’t ever leave you again.”

She buried her face in my chest, sobbing with relief. I felt her arms tighten around me. That night, we fell asleep clinging to each other, both afraid to let go.

The weeks that followed were almost peaceful. I stopped hunting for discrepancies in our life and tried to live fully in this reality. The more I leaned into it, the more natural it felt. Those awful memories of living without her began to fade like a bad dream. In their place, new memories—real ones we were creating together—took root. I cherished every mundane moment: grocery shopping together, watching TV with her dozing on my shoulder, even squabbling over what color to paint the guest room. It all felt like a gift I had almost lost.

I started to believe the nightmare was truly over.

But of course, that’s not where it ends.

It was exactly a month after that morning that something happened. By then, I was convinced that the “other life” was fading. I hardly checked my secret journal anymore; I found it easier to just not think about it.

That night, I was taking out the trash. It was late, stars out, the neighborhood quiet. I rolled the bin to the curb when a car slowly turned onto our street. Its headlights washed over me. A jolt of recognition froze me in place.

It was her car. Her car. Not Becca’s—no, the other her… It’s hard to explain in words, but I felt who it was before I could see. The car idled in front of my driveway, and through the windshield, illuminated by the dashboard lights, I saw a face that made my blood run cold.

It was Becca. Or rather, a version of her. She sat in the driver’s seat, eyes red and hollow, makeup smeared from crying, hair a mess. She looked exactly as she did the day we parted at the courthouse—the last time I had seen her in my original timeline.

Our eyes met through the glass. She wore a look of such profound sorrow that it physically hurt to witness. I realized I had seen that look before too, in glimpses, in nightmares.

She mouthed something, lips trembling. It looked like my name.

I stepped forward, heart in my throat. “Becca?” I whispered, as if she could hear it.

She reached a hand toward me—but it pressed against the inside of the windshield, as though there were something between us beyond just glass. Her mouth moved again: “Why did you leave me?”

I heard it. Or maybe I felt it echo in my mind. Her voice, her real voice. The one from the world where I had broken her heart.

My head spun. I looked back at the house where inside, my wife—my wife who never experienced that pain—was cheerfully setting the table for a late dessert, oblivious to what was outside.

I turned back, tears spilling down my face. The car was gone. As if it had never been. Just the quiet street and distant hum of a neighbor’s AC unit.

I stood there shaking, not from fear but from a deep well of guilt and confusion. That was her. The other her, from the life I left. She was still out there, maybe not in this reality, but somewhere, full of grief I caused. And I—whatever version of me I was now—had been allowed to escape that and find happiness in a cheat of cosmic logic.

I stumbled inside, trembling. My wife—this reality’s Becca—saw my face and rushed to me. “Hey, hey, what’s wrong?” she asked, alarmed.

What could I say? I couldn’t speak. I just clung to her as if she’d vanish. She held me tight, whispering soothing words, not understanding as I quietly broke down.

I never told her what I saw. How could I? It would sound like a delusion, a relapse. Perhaps it was. Perhaps I hallucinated the embodiment of my guilt for the life I left behind.

But I think back to that sentence: She never changed — I did. Now I truly understand. The Becca I divorced and the Becca in my arms were one and the same at their core—loving, devoted, and undeserving of the pain I gave them. It was me who had wavered, who changed course. One version of me left and destroyed a life; another stayed and rebuilt one. And by some impossible grace, the quitter-me was erased, and I was given his place.

The version of me that left her no longer exists in this reality. I am what remains—a man who knows the agony of losing her and will do anything to never feel that again.

Late at night, when she’s asleep beside me, I sometimes wander the house and feel like a trespasser. Like I stole this life from my other self (or maybe from the other her). The photo by the bed of us in front of the painted wall—I don’t remember the day it was taken, yet there I am smiling in it. Who was that man if not me? Where did he go?

Sometimes I feel him, the other me, around the edges, haunting the halls with regret. Or maybe that’s just my own guilt wearing a familiar face.

Every day, I wake up afraid that this fragile peace might break. That I’ll open my eyes to that empty house again, the ring gone from my finger, all these new memories dissolved like mist. That perhaps I’ll find that car idling outside again and this time it will take me back with it.

I hold her close at night, probably tighter than I used to. She doesn’t complain. I tell her I love her daily now, something I apparently struggled to do before. I’ve become the man who didn’t leave, and I play the role so well that even I believe it most of the time.

If this is a second chance, I intend to earn it.

Yet in the dark, as I listen to her breathing, I sometimes apologize under my breath to the other Becca, the one out there in some fractured timeline, whose life I ruined. I like to think in that moment, the man who belonged there—the one I replaced—he’s whispering apologies to my Becca for the same sins, across whatever barrier divides us.

Maybe that’s the price of this miracle: to always remember what I did, in a world that pretends it never happened. A quiet kind of horror underlining every tender moment.

In a way, I envy the man I became here—a better husband, a kinder soul. But I also know that he only exists because the worst parts of me were burned away by regret and then scrubbed from reality.

She never changed. I did. Or maybe some force changed me. Either way, the man who walked out on her has been erased, and I remain in his place. Most days, I can almost forget he ever existed.

But in the stillness of midnight, when I watch her sleeping safely in my arms, I whisper an apology to the darkness—for that version of me, and for the woman I saw in the car. I tell them I’m sorry. I tell them it’s not wasted, this chance I’ve been given. I promise them that their story, that heartbreak, was not for nothing.

And as I lie there, I feel both the weight of my guilt and the weight of her head on my shoulder. I exist in between, caught in the quiet horror of knowing how easily I could lose all this again.

I hold my wife close, and I keep my eyes shut tight against the darkness, hoping that the ghosts of my other life have finally settled. Because I’m here now. I’m her husband again, and I will be until my very last day. I’ll never become that ghost again—no matter what reality I’m in.
