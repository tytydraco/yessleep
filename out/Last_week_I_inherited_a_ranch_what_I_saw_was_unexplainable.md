Ghosts, specters, the paranormal. All words I’d laugh at if brought up in conversation. At least...I would’ve a week ago. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ll start by telling you who I am and how I came to inherit Thistle Weed Ranch.

My name’s Richie. I never knew my real family, and that’s what led me down this rabbit hole. You see, for as long as I can remember, I’ve lived with my adoptive parents. They were always good to me—great, in fact—but, as I’m sure anyone with adoptive parents will tell you, there’s always that hole. That need to know who your biological parents were, if they loved you, and why they gave you up.

My adoptive parents understood that. They supported me when I said I wanted to find them.
It took months of searching, digging for any information about my mother, but I found nothing. 
Eventually, though, I uncovered the truth about my father was a man named Christopher Anderson. The bad news? He was dead. In fact, all of my father’s side of the family was dead. Five months ago, a massacre wiped them out.
The police don’t know what happened. No evidence, no witnesses, no smoking gun, nothing. Just a quiet Louisiana cattle farm in the marshes, left with blood-soaked earth and a dozen bodies.

Hearing this hit me hard. I’d spent so much time chasing this idea of family, only for the universe to give me the old middle finger and leave me with nothing but unanswered questions. Then came the twist, I was contacted by a solicitor. Apparently, as the only surviving relativeand my fathers next of kin, I’d inherited the family ranch.

My adoptive parents weren’t thrilled about me moving across the Atlantic to rural Louisiana, but they knew how much this meant to me. And with the ranch as a stable business opportunity, it seemed like the right move.

A week ago, I found myself standing on the dirt road leading to Thistle Weed Ranch. The heat hit me first it washumid and sticky, nothing like rainy old England. The ranch stretched out before me: cattle fields, a decaying old house, and, to my surprise, a full-fledged saloon straight out of a Western.

It felt surreal. I’d grown up watching cowboy movies with my adoptive dad, and now I was staring at what looked like a relic of that era. I couldn’t imagine why anyone would build a saloon on a farm, but I guessed it was for travelers passing through, I mean, being just by the side of the road i perfumed it was the equivalent to our service stations y'know, a way for cowboys to recharge and have a drink and a clean up while on the road.

I settled into the manor house, unpacked my bags, and decided to check out the saloon. It was a little run-down, but the structure was solid. I wanted to take some pictures, but as I stepped inside, I froze.
Someone was sitting at the 
I had no weapon, no idea who or what this could be. But I forced myself to walk closer, my footsteps crunching against the dusty wooden floor.

“Uh...sir? This is private land. What are you doing here?” ( ill take the time here to say that for any of my updates, I'll try to do it as close to what happened as possible so hands down, I was not brave in this situation)
The figure didn’t move at first. He just sat there, fiddling with an empty glass. He looked young—maybe late teens—dressed in old farming gear, like something out of one of those old grey photographs.  He was wearing like a denim shirt and had this bright red bandanna tied around his neck, as well as this he had a large brimmed hat that was coal black, but now I'm guessing it wasn't always like that. 

Then he turned around.
His face was blackened, coated in soot and charred flesh. Not like a burn victim, though. This looked fresh—like someone who’d walked straight out of a fire that should’ve killed him. His eyes burned, too not with anger, but with something colder, darker, and far more unsettling.
I stumbled back, nearly tripping over myself as my breath hitched. The glass he’d been twirling slid across the counter and launched itself at me.
 It shattered against my hand, cutting deep.
The pain was sharp and immediate, velvet blood spilling onto the floor. I bolted, heart pounding as I scrambled out of the saloon. Behind me, the sound of heavy boots echoed across the floorboards, but when I glanced back, the figure was gone.

That was six days ago

Since then, I’ve encountered more...entities. Some seem malicious. Others? I’m not sure yet. There’s even one who might be a normal human, though I wouldn’t bet on it.
I don’t know if anyone will believe me or even care about what’s happening here. But I had to write this down. For myself. For whoever might find it. For the ghosts that won’t let me leave.
Maybe it’ll all make sense someday. Until then, I’ll leave it at this
