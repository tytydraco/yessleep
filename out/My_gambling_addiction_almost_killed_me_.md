Not the first time my vices have gotten me into a bad situation. If we’re being honest, it’s probably not the last either. I have a lot of bad habits that get me in trouble more often than not, but my worst is definitely gambling. I can’t help it, I just get in the zone. When I feel like I’m in the zone, I just can’t stop winning, I get the fever, then as soon as I’m on top of the world, everything crashes down and I lose it all again. You would think I’ve learned my lesson by now but it’s the thrill of the chase, I guess. 

It started out innocently enough, with bets on high school football games and stuff like that on the local level (don’t fucking judge me). Then it just wasn’t enough. I needed to keep going, even when I lost it all time after time. First, the car was repoed, then my home when my mortgage was too far gone. Even when I finally made enough money to pay off the entire fucking balance, I just kept thinking “I can make more”. Guess that explains the problem with billionaires, some people are never satisfied, even after eight figures.

Now though? My debt is out of control. I’m talking over a million, more than any human could hope to pay back in a lifetime, even with a miracle. The people I owed weren’t super accommodating either, sending people to watch me at all hours of the day, letting me know to count the hours and dollars because they sure as hell were.

Didn’t even have a damn chance when they finally decided I had gone long enough without paying. I was fucking paranoid at this point, checking out my blinds, keeping all the lights off at my shitty little motel I was staying in week to week. I even had the people at the motel keeping an eye out for me, giving them a call to make sure nobody was waiting around the other side of the lobby where I couldn’t see. Thinking back, the poor clerk sounded really nervous when I made the last call, likely being threatened by the jackasses that came for me to tell me the coast was clear.

I was barely three feet out the door when someone grabbed me, throwing a bag over my head like we were in a damn mafia movie. Before I knew what was happening, I was shoved in the back of a car and driven for probably three hours. Honestly, I lost track of time. As much as I babbled and tried to plea with the fuckers who had me, they wouldn’t say a word except “shut the fuck up”.

When they finally pulled me out of the car, taking me into a hot, dank building that smelled of mildew, they still hadn’t taken the bag off yet. All I was told was to stand in one spot and hold my hand out. That freaked me the fuck out, thinking they were going to do like some old-timey shit where they cut off my hand for stealing their money or something. 

After a moment I could hear other people too, some sniffling, a couple outright sobbing but muffled by their own bags over their faces. There was no common thread between any of the voices, but all were begging to be let go. A voice crackled to life over an old speaker above, coming in sharp and loud, hurting my ears.

”Hello, everybody! It’s so nice that you could all join us today, especially since you’ve been making efforts to avoid us for so long.” Whoever it was, they’re way too damn cheerful about what they’re about to do. “Now, all of you owe some of us a LOT of money. So much that you’ll never pay it back, even if you got to our level. We don’t like it when people fall behind on their bills, so we’ll help you out a little. Bags off.”

A snap came over the speaker and suddenly bright fluorescents were blinding me. It was like a migraine hitting, the huge lights above us making everything else fade, too bright to focus. As my eyes finally adjusted, I could see four other people gathered around me, each with their own little personal guard now holding the bag. We were arranged in a circle, all aligning with a point of the pentagram drawn on the floor in front of us.

“We’re going to lock you in here overnight and watch what happens. If you survive, your debts are cleared. If you die, well, we’re doing our own little gambling on that…” The voice said again, glee ringing behind it. Things were coming into focus a little more, my pupils finally finding the right dilation to handle all the harsh light. The pentagram we were standing upon was more clear, not drawn onto the smooth pavement below but etched in, deep, fine lines interconnecting through the circle. Rusty red stains were abundant over the entire circle, and I felt like puking when I realized what it probably was. “Gentlemen, proceed.”

Each of our guards stepped forward, raising ancient-looking daggers and grabbing our left hands. I drew in a sharp breath feeling the blade slice across my skin, making a diagonal slice over my forearm that started oozing blood immediately. A woman nearby screamed, the man on my right began cursing at the guard holding him, while the other two were in the same shocked silence I was. I still hadn’t come around to exactly what was happening, much less that I was being sliced open over a damned pentagram in the middle of a warehouse. It felt like I woke up in a low-budget horror movie, like a nightmare or one of those crazy interactive haunted houses. My breath started to catch as the blood and pain made everything become suddenly real. The panic attack was setting in.

”We consecrate this domain to you, our great lord, and everything you have given us.” The voice cackled over the speaker again. Now that I was unmasked I could see the old crates and pallets set up in the warehouse corners. Everything else was barren, just plain white walls, smooth concrete, and steel beams holding up the roof. Large fluorescent bars were hanging from the rafters above, making the reflections off the smooth concrete sway as something moved them. “For you, we bring this meal, a pittance for the bounty you have given us. Please, enjoy as you see fit.”

The speakers crackled out again. After each of us had spilled a satisfactory amount of blood, the guards each put their blades on the floor, pulling a roll of gauze from their suit pockets. They field-dressed our wounds, leaving the daggers where they lay in front of each of us before filing out the only door. I could hear chains being drawn over the door as it was sealed from the outside. There was no getting out, for any of us.

”Now, each of you has a dagger to defend yourself or improve your odds. If you look to either side of the building, there’s a window to see the current time. Survive until daylight and you’ll be free to go! Good luck!” The voice trailed off with a laugh, leaving each of us to sit in silence, all dealing with our own personal panic attacks.

”Who the fuck are y’all?” The man to my right, the same one who had been swearing, was now looking at all of us in turn. “Why the hell are we here? Who the fuck is doing this?!”

He was losing it, obviously already on edge before any of this went down. Even worse, it looked like he was having some wicked withdrawals from some sort of drug. Veins were popping on his bald head, eyes bloodshot, and face almost just as red. As he picked up the dagger in front of him, brandishing it at all of us, we fell back in fear. I managed to grab the dagger in front of me before sliding back, desperately pushing myself across the smooth floor to get away.

“What? Did Tony put you all up to this? He trying to scare me because I haven’t paid him yet?” He was waving the knife around like a madman, threatening all of us one by one. As the rest of us backed away, he stepped into the pentagram, moving towards us, still waving the knife. It was only moments after he stepped on it, though I’m still not sure of what I saw, and he was gone.

As he was walking toward us over the pentagram, a massive amount of blood started bubbling out of the etchings. It came up slow at first, just seeping through the fine lines, covering the floor around. As it filled the entire pentagram, scarlet lines glowing in the bright lights, every angle made by an intersecting line on the pentagram suddenly shot forward, right into the center where he was standing. Dozens of liquid strands, no thicker than a fishing wire pierced through him, extending right through and crossing as they impaled him. 

He dropped his knife, words catching in his throat now as his lungs were punctured. Some of the filaments were through his neck, and one I saw come right out of his left eye. For only a moment he was paralyzed there, before hands began reaching from the circle below, clawing at his legs. He couldn’t make a sound as they dragged him down into the pooling blood, through solid concrete, hands coming up in waves to grab and push him under. 

Only moments passed and he was gone, along with all the overflowing blood that never went outside the circle. There was no trace he had ever been there, save the knife still lying on the ground, covered in scarlet blood.

”Oh my god.” A woman, wiry frame and dark bags under her eyes, whispered under her breath. Murmurs arose from everyone, all of us wondering what we had just seen. Through the window, we could see the last rays of light beginning to leave the sky, the last sunset any of us may ever see.

”We need to get out of here.” Another woman stepped forward. Tall, dark hair, and piercing gray eyes. She ran for the door, slamming into it hard enough to knock the breath out of her. Despite the force, chains rattling on the other side made no sign of giving. 

“We ain’t going anywhere.” A man who was looked like a starving rat said from nearby. He was definitely in the same boat as the guy who just died, going through major withdrawals from something. “They won’t let any of us go.”

”Then we’ll make them!” Gray Eyes said again. She was still beating at the door, though I’m sure she knew it was pointless.”You hear me, you bastards! You better let us out of here!”

A scream ripped through the air, full of dread, anger, and sorrow like I’d never heard. I was looking at the three others, none of whom were making the sound. It maintained for almost thirty seconds, all of us freezing in response. My blood was running cold, every hair standing on end. It finally stopped, cut off suddenly like they had been forcefully quieted.

”What the fuck was that?” Ratman asked, nervously looking at us. Nobody said anything, all realizing that we only had limited time. “God… god I’m going to die…”

”So, anyone want to try killing someone again?” Gray Eyes asked, looking at each of us in turn. “We need to get out.”

”I don’t know how you plan on doing that.” Ratman replied with a snort. “That door is chained. Unless you have some bolt cutters.”

“What about the windows?” I said, pointing up to the now dark squares near the ceiling. Night had fallen, leaving the bright lights of the warehouse to reflect off the windows, shrouding anything that may be outside. “Maybe one of these knives could break it?”

”Worth a try.” Bags replied. She looked like she would fall asleep at any moment, but her eyes were still wide with fear, darting around everywhere.

”It’s useless.” Ratman said, staring at me. “They’ll kill you even if you get out.”

”Well, better than whatever that was.” I replied, heading over to the crates in one corner. “Someone help me stack these?”

The wooden crates must have been old, but when I got closer I could notice dark red stains on the rugged wood. There was a rotten smell around them, like meat left out in the hot sun for too long. 

“Good god that stinks.” Gray Eyes was next to me now, covering her nose. “Hope it’s not what I think.”

”It is.” Ratman chimed in, walking over from where he was previously cowering on the floor.

”Okay who the hell are you? You seem to have an answer to everything here, so spill the fucking beans for the rest of us.” Bags was looking toward Ratman now, gripping the knife at her side. 

“Those guys that brought us in here were some former associates.” He said, grumbling.

Bags clocked him right there. Don’t even think he knew what was happening until he was already on the ground. 

“Knew I recognized you, you piece of shit!” She said, spitting on him. 

“Woah, hey, let’s calm down a little,” I said, putting my hands up, standing between them and looking at Bags. “What’s the deal here?”

”He’s the bastard that killed my husband.” She said, still gripping the knife in her other hand.

”I’ve killed a few people, but he ain’t one of ‘em.” Ratman was grumbling again. “Not my fault he was a fuckin’ tweaker.”

”It’s your fault there was fucking fentanyl in it! You killed him! He was sober for ten years and you pieces of shit KILLED HIM!” Bags was shouting more, now waving the knife. I knew there wasn’t going to be any stopping her, so stepped back. Gray Eyes stood beside me, the stench of the boxes forgotten as we watched the situation unfold. 

“Don’t kill him.” Gray Eyes shouted, trying to get Bags’ attention. The woman was still raving though, waving the knife more erratically than before, “Not yet. We need answers.”

”I don’t have any.” Ratman spat back. “I only put people in crates. I never saw this shit before.”

”So what the hell was that?” I asked, pointing over to the pentagram. 

“Beats the hell out of me. Like I said, I only put people in crates.” He said, shrugging again.

”Why?” Gray Eyes was staring through his goddamn soul at this point, glaring in his direction.

Ratman was cowering again, curled up on the floor with his hands up towards Bags, no longer ranting but still holding the knife toward him, point out and gripped in both hands.

”I just did my job, okay?” He spat back, fear in his voice. “I got my orders on who to off, and I did my fucking job.”

”Jeremy Primm.” Gray Eyes said, glare intensifying. “One year. One year since I’ve seen my brother. Was he one of them?”

”Probably, shit. I don’t remember every dumb motherfucker I’ve put i-.” Ratman was cut off by Gray Eyes, who was now pulling him up from the ground with one hand while stabbing with her knife in the other.

”You. FUCKING. BASTARD!!!!!” She was shouting. Suddenly she stopped, halting the knife before she brought it down again. Instead, she got up, Ratman still breathing raggedly on the ground, and started dragging him.

”Please… no… I’m sorry…” He was barely able to get the words out, probably had one of his lungs punctured when she was going at it. It didn’t matter though. She threw him right onto the pentagram, rage making her even stronger somehow. “Please… don’t kill me… I don’t wanna die.”

”I don’t give a fuck.” She said, walking away from the etchings on the floor. They began to glow once more, just like when the first guy was taken. Ratman was crying in the center as another noise began, this one a low rumble. It grew steadily, becoming a roar in seconds. A massive, beastly, mouth burst from the pentagram, sharp teeth and huge jaws devouring him in one bite, severing a leg in the process. The circle went dark again, leaving only the severed leg to bleed on the floor. Gray Eyes looked at me next as she returned. “You part of this too?”

All I could do was raise my hands and shake my head, still in shock from what I had just seen, “Just a dude with a gambling problem.”

Gray Eyes fell to the ground, sobbing. Bags moved over to her, in much the same state but still trying to offer comfort. It only took her a minute, but Gray Eyes pulled herself together, coming off the floor and walking toward the crates again. 

“I’m getting the hell out of here. We’re getting the cops and these fuckers are going to get dragged to the goddamn death penalty if I have to do it myself.” She said, pulling one crate out from the edge of the pile, before they started stacking up. It scraped across the cement, making an awful sound, but she kept pulling until she could get behind it, shoving it bit by bit toward the window. ”You gonna help?”

”Guess so.” I said, going toward the pile myself. The crate I pulled was heavy, and when I pushed it I could feel something almost sloshing around, making the awful smell come in stronger waves. All I could do was try not to throw up as I kept shoving it further toward Gray Eyes’ crate, now positioned under the window. As I got further, she squatted on the other side of the crate, giving me a count of three before both of us heaved it up, sliding it fully on top of the other one. From the looks of it, we would need about three more, at least. “Think that’ll work?”

“We’ll make it work.” Gray Eyes answered. Bags was now moving a crate of her own, and both of us helped to lift and stack it. “There are pallets too. They’ll be easier.

As they continued moving boxes I started collecting pallets, bringing them closer so we could start making steps to get up. Even after what seemed like ages we had barely made progress, needing to take breaks as all of us were wheezing in exhaustion. We realized pretty quickly we would need to make a stair pattern to get to the top, and pulling that off took a ton of work. I finally asked to tap for a break, both women nodding in agreement. My smoker lungs couldn’t take this shit.

KNOCK

KNOCK

KNOCK

Three knocks, each in a quick succession rang out, making all of us freeze. It sounded like someone jumping on the metal roof, making thunderous booms that I could feel resonate through. Then they came faster, always in quick bursts of three, but now from almost every direction. The walls, the ceiling, the chains rattling as the doors were hit. I couldn’t tell if it was knocking to get in or out, but I knew I would rather be out of here.

All at once the knocking stopped, just as quickly as it began. The lights flickered, going out for a moment before flaring back on, making the migraine feel worse. We sat to take a breather after that, getting our bearings back together.

Eventually, we got to it again, though we only got one trip in when everything went to hell. 

The window was maybe close enough to reach it with another pallet. Bags and Gray Eyes were both pulling another crate each toward the stack, finally, it looked like we may have a chance to get the hell out of there. As Bags moved hers closer, putting it right next to the already high steps, a hand reached from the crate, coming right through the solid wood, to grab her. 

“Help! Please!” She was screaming while the mottled, rotting hand was trying to pull her closer, bringing her into the putrid box. It had her by the left arm, yanking hard to get her closer. Another hand reached out to help it, clutching at the same arm. I ran up, desperately trying to pull the knife I had stuck into my belt loop. I stabbed the grabbing hands, desperately trying to hack them off of her. They pulled her closer, but she tried bracing her arm against the box to keep from going in. It was a mistake, they pulled her in closer, more hands coming to bring her in faster. She went straight through the solid wood, her screams becoming muffled as she was pulled inside. I could hear the screams turn to wrenching as the putrescent contents of the box overwhelmed her. She disappeared into the crate completely, hands receding alongside her. Gray Eyes and I both looked at each other, Bags’ shrieks were intercut with desperate gasps for air, muffled through the box's wood. “Oh god please!”

”Use your knife!” Gray Eyes shouted at me, pulling hers out and positioning it in the crack between planks on top. I got beside her, doing the same and pressing down with both blades. It took a minute, Bags screaming the entire time. Her retching sounds were disgusting, and the smell coming from inside was quickly creeping out as we got the lid loosened. Eventually, it finally gave way, Gray Eyes grabbing one side while I grabbed the other to lift it off. Bags’ screaming became louder as it came up. The sight that met us made me turn to the side, puking any contents still left in my stomach.

Bags was in the bottom of the crate, surrounded by rotten human… goo is the best way to describe it. She was rapidly decomposing into the goo herself, decay working its way up her body as she was absorbed into the putrid muck. Screams faded to silence as her lungs liquefied, sliding into the human stew.

Both of us fell back, scurrying as far away from the crate as we could. The knocking started again, rapid, staccato booms from every direction. The banging was echoed by the crate top snapping back shut on its own, sitting like it was never moved. The knocking slowed, centering from every direction as it moved toward the chained doors. The force of it increased tenfold with every knock that joined the pounding rhythm, eventually bursting the doors open from the outside, chains whipping through the air and embedding in the wall across the warehouse.

”What the hell did that?” Gray Eyes asked, looking from me to the door, quickly back and forth. Her piercing eyes were suddenly clouds of fear, something crawling  through the doorway that was now open to the darkness outside. It didn’t come in from the outside though, all of it materializing in the threshhold as it made its way out. Arms, mottled and gray with rot, made their way through. A legion of skulls, all stemming from the same torso, bunched around each other in various states of decay. All looked like they had died in different ways, from some with burns to others with eyes scooped out and gunshot wounds visible on their heads. It finally dragged the remainder of its body through, scrawny legs scraping the ground behind it as it began moving slowly towards us.

”Ooohhhhh fuck.” I said, feeling nauseous again as a new wave of smells hit me. The rotting bodies mixed with the smell of burning flesh and smoke, made me gag even more. 

“Run it around and get out the door.” Gray Eyes said, holding an arm over her nose and studying the abomination in front of us. Every mouth on the damned thing was screaming now, even the ones that barely had mouths from injuries. I could see one gurgling, lower half of the skull totally missing, covered in blood from what looked like a shotgun wound. As it screamed blood came flying out, spraying the floor ahead of it with sizzling drops of blood. “Don’t get hit by that, either. Jesus Christ.”

We both ran, going down to the furthest end of the warehouse from the putrid mass as we could. It kept crawling towards us, picking up speed as it went. When we finally got it clear of the doors, both of us swept a wide arc, each going around a different side to hopefully try and confuse it, even if only briefly. I was able to reach the door first, hitting the threshhold and bursting through, Gray Eyes right behind me. As she tried to leap out, the thing suddenly heaved itself forward, grabbing her with one long, rotten arm and holding her by the leg, dragging her away from the freedom in the dark night.

”Help!” She screamed as I desperately grabbed at her, trying to pull her back toward the doorway. The abomination was digging fingernails into her leg now, drawing blood that seeped into its own skin instead of flowing down. It invigorated the monster, grabbing her other leg and fully pulling her back, making me hit the doorway and get knocked back on my ass on the concrete outside. 

I got up before I realized there were no screams. Rushing through the door I saw why- there was nothing in there. It’s like I ran into a totally different building, lights off, dark rust on the rafters, and the window we were trying to climb through shattered into jagged edges. Gray Eyes was gone, no sign any of us were ever here in the layers of dust on the floor.

Even in my shock at everything, I wasn’t going to stick around this fucking hell house. I got my ass out of dodge, though I was lost for a lot of the time until I found a major road. Lost count of how many cars passed by me until one finally stopped and took pity, right around the time dawn was beginning to brighten the horizon. I didn’t even ask them for a ride, just to dial the police and tell them where we were. Think that spooked them a little, because they locked the doors and rolled the window up while they did it.

Cops got there later. I gave them the name of the guy that I owed the debts to, telling them about the five of us being kidnapped and held there. I didn’t mention what killed them, just that they had been murdered by the guards that brought us there. Police wouldn’t have taken me seriously if I mentioned all of that anyway.

The only good thing to come out of this is that I’ve effectively quit gambling altogether. I’ve taken up drinking a little since all I can see when I’m sober is that fucking abomination. I hope Gray Eyes didn’t suffer, because I can still hear her screams when I close my eyes. The smell of death hasn’t left my nose, no matter how much bleach I take to my house. Hell, no matter what I use it doesn’t leave. I can’t eat most of the time. I can barely sleep. But at least I’m not gambling, I [guess](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/HiqOvFqP8g).
