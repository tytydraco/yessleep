I remember that the game was out around the same time as Tattletail, and I think that's important.

Five Nights at Freddy's may ultimately be the grandfather of mascot horror, but Tattletail proved that its success wasn't one-off, that there was a formula that could be replicated, and more importantly, could be replicated *well*. It came out when FNAF and its sequels were practically the only mascot horror content there was, and it scratched an itch that a lot of people, myself included, were feeling. Tattletail is a game that is very near and dear to my heart. The sound design is probably my favorite part of it, from the music to the ambiance to the winding up sound effect that plays when you interact with things. It's a great game that isn't nearly talked about nearly enough anymore, but the underappreciated genius of "o*range you forgetting someone*" is not why I'm currently writing this.

The thing is, I have vivid memories of another mascot horror game that was out alongside Tattletail, and it was called Showtime at the Dawn Stadium. In fact, I can remember a lot about it. I can remember that the developers were called Snapdragon Studios or something along those lines. I remember at least two chapters being released, and that more were being produced.

And now, all these years later, I can't find it again.

I don't know how it's possible, but it's completely gone. There are no search results for it; googling "Showtime at the Dawn Stadium" gets you the Wikipedia page for The After Hours tour and searching for it on YouTube just gets you a 401 page. I can't find a download for the game anywhere, even though I knew it had to be on Steam at some point. And probably the scariest part of it all: no one else remembers Showtime at the Dawn Stadium.

Everyone I've asked either thinks I'm making it up or that I'm talking about Showdown Bandit, and while the games are kind of similar, being in 3rd person and starring puppets, I *know* they're different. Showtime at the Dawn Stadium came out years before Showdown Bandit was even announced. They just don't know what I mean. And it's not like it flew under the radar or anything, it was *popular*. There was tons of content for it out there. A lot of big gaming YouTubers played it, some of them amassing millions of views per video. There was a robust fan community surrounding it. There were a couple of fan songs made for it, for example there was one by Random Encounters that I remember listening to a couple times. For Christ's sake, there were even a few Game Theory episodes on the game.

It doesn't make sense that it's all gone. It doesn't make sense that no one else remembers it.

So, here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to go over everything I can remember about the game and its fandom, and hopefully, *hopefully*, someone else out there will have remembered Showtime at the Dawn Stadium too.

**The Game**

Showtime at the Dawn Stadium was kind of weird. I remember the game fondly, but even through my rose-colored contacts I can admit that.

Here's the best synopsis I can give you: Showtime Dawn wakes up in this dilapidated workshop space, all alone. She gets up and immediately resolves to find her friends. Eventually, Dawn manages to get out into the main "stadium" area where they apparently did live puppet shows. She comes across a monster version of another character, Claude the Cloud, who chases her down a hole and into some tunnels. She goes a little insane for a minute but then she gets better and keeps going. Eventually she gets out of the hole and defeats Claude by setting him on fire with some mini fireworks, and is then confronted by a mystery character who turns out to be her male counterpart: Showtime Dusk. They work together for a little bit before they're chased by a monster version of Dusk. They manage to trap the monster behind some glass and try to interrogate it. That's all I can remember.

The game was very confusing to play. The main area, the stadium, was huge and overgrown with all sorts of plants, and as far as I can remember, you had the run of the place. There were set pathways, but some of them were really hard to find. You never quite knew where you were going in the stadium, or even where you *could* go. Then, in the tunnel system, it was a veritable maze of dirt and metal walls, and it was really easy to get lost while you were trying to escape.

Another problem was the mascot's designs. They were all creepy. I know it's a horror game and that's kind of the point, but even the normal puppet versions of the mascots were really creepy, to an unrealistic degree. Showtime Dawn herself was especially creepy. She had giant swirly black eyes and a huge, unnatural, fixed smile that looked like it had been ripped right off of the Chesire Cat and pasted onto her face. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, except that the game was in third person and so you had to look at her constantly. I think that threw some people off because they acted weird about it.

And then, there were the puzzles. The puzzles were all manners of complicated and frustrating. I'll describe one for you, near the beginning of the game, the one that lets you out of the tutorial workshop area. The door needs a big shiny key to open, and by then you've obtained a plastic keyring, your main tool throughout the game. So, how do you find the key? Well, the key is in a hidden safe according to a lore note you might find. But there's no combination. How do you get the combination? Well, you solve a large-scale version of Tower of Hanoi that's randomly there of course! That inexplicably causes a nearby printer to print a triangle that you had to use the Pythagorean theorem on to get the actual combination.  It was a different triangle every time, by the way. The game practically begged you to follow a guide.

But still, even with the mazes and the frustrating puzzles, the game was still pretty fun. Exploring the overgrown stadium was interesting and a little bit tense, especially when you got lost. The environment was really unique, and when paired with the horror aspects, it could induce a primal sort of fear in you. The chase scenes were also really scary. The monster design was obviously inspired by Lovecraftian horror, felted tentacles and plastic eyes everywhere. It kind of felt like you were being driven insane too.

And Showtime Dawn, as creepy as her design was, was a surprisingly compelling protagonist. She was just as unfamiliar with the stadium as the player was, and her life and sanity were on the line, but she was determined to keep trucking forward no matter what. It was kind of admirable. And sometimes she would say things as you explored that fleshed out the story or were just entertaining. One in particular that I can remember is "*Is the workshop like my house or is the whole stadium like my house? Or am I like a freeloader? I think I'm like a freeloader. Oh no.*" I don't know, I found that kind of funny.

Overall, I liked the game. In hindsight it was flawed, but it was also genuinely good game. No wonder people took notice of it.

**The Players**

A lot of the bigger gaming YouTubers of the time played Showtime at the Dawn Stadium. The main series I can remember watching was by Markiplier, so I'll talk about that.

I watched his Let's Play a couple of times back in the day. It was about two videos long, as again there were only a few chapters out. It was a fun series that I revisited multiple times. It took him a while to figure out some of the puzzles, but that was understandable, and it was honestly kind of funny to see the guy come to completely wrong conclusions and get lost. He also had this one-sided banter going with Dawn that was fun to listen to. Then he was so spooked by Claude that he seemed to be in a state of shock for a while. He kept repeating "Dawn...Dawn...Dawn..." quietly to himself and hitting walls in game. I don't blame him because Claude was seriously terrifying. He had beef with Showtime Dusk for some reason and insulted him a lot, and he absolutely loved the interrogation scene. That's really all.

Overall, nice series and nothing much else to say. I think pretty much everyone had the same reaction to it.

**The Lore**

The game theory episodes dedicated to the game were pretty par for the course: a pretty accurate description of the game's plot, a summary of the game's lore, and a bit of left-field nonsense. 

Basically, the story is that Showtime Dawn used to be part of this live show with puppets, and then the creator did...something to try to bring the puppets to life. Very normal mascot horror stuff. The first round was unsuccessful, creating the monsters that chase you in the game, but the second round was successful, and made the Dawn we play as, as well as all of her friends. But then something went wrong, and the stadium was abandoned. And now, Dawn has to make what was wrong, right. It's a pretty cool-sounding story honestly. And then Matpat tried to connect it to the Bible and lost me.

**The Singers**

As mentioned before, Random Encounters wrote and released a song for this game. It was aptly called Dawn. Here's every lyric I can remember.

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn,*

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn,*

*Oh,*

*La la la la la la la,*

*I haven't seen a face like yours,*

*In many darkened years,*

*?????*

*This place is kinda weird,*

*But I know we can push right through,*

*So sweetheart have no fear,*

*?????*

*The mystery of here,*

*This can't be real,*

*What happened to my friends,*

*?????*

*The story never ends!*

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn*

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn*

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn*

*Dawn Dawn Dawn Dawn*

That's all. I can't really remember anything from the second verse and the chorus just repeats.



This is everything I know. If someone out there remembers this game, please tell me for the sake of auld lang syne. I'd appreciate it immensely. Thanks!

(Also, if there is anyone here who remembers, don't you think the game was kind of...off? Because, me too. Alright, that's it.)
