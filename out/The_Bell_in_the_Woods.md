How can a sound from a simple item be the source of such recent and existential dread? I still ask myself that question as I lay awake at night. I have given up trying to get back to sleep. The sound, the images, they will not stop. Every moment of every night since it happened, I hear that chiming sound. It rings in tune with my own heartbeat, to the point where I feel like perhaps it has replaced it entirely. That chime so soft and pleasant, yet the things that it revealed, the things that the simple chime ushered into reality, are things I will never be able to forget, no matter how desperately I try. It all started when I found that odd bell. 



 



It was three weeks ago.  I was walking along one of my favorite trails in a state park that I frequented. It was a refreshing and familiar way to enjoy a weekend afternoon. As I walked, I saw something strange near the trail end. It was what looked like a broken sign. At first, I thought it might be the trail sign itself, but it was still standing right where it always was. This one looked different. I stepped closer to see what looked like the burnt remains of a sign, almost like one you would see at a campground. All I could see that was still legible on the sign were the words “Green Leaf”. 



The odd sign picked my interest and when I looked closer, I saw faded footprints near the burned item. I decided to follow them, unable to resist the new mystery I had discovered. I walked for a while in the direction of the faded footsteps, I almost turned back when I thought I had lost the trail, but dumb luck allowed me to rediscover it and I pressed on.  



I reached a small clearing and as I stepped into it, I felt an odd stillness in the air. The sounds of the animals in the forest and the general ambiance of the whole area seemed to depart. All I could hear was the sound of my own heart beating and the sound of my nervous breath.  



I pushed on and walked towards a strange shape I saw on the ground near where the trail had terminated. My excitement increased when I saw what looked like a chest, half buried in the ground. For a moment I thought I had found legitimate treasure! 



I knelt down and reached for the side of the chest. I pulled it free from the loose earth still covering it. After gingerly opening the lid I looked inside. There were no gold bars, no precious jewels. Only one item was in the ornate chest, a small silver bell. It looked finely crafted, yet not ostentatious. I fixated on the silvery sheen and wondered if it might be valuable. I half imagined the idea of buried pirate treasure, but I had no idea who would have buried a single bell in this chest out in the middle of the woods. 



I decided to take the small bell, since I could not find any trace of whoever had exhumed the chest and left it there.  



As I left the clearing and went back to the main trail, the ambiance of the forest had resumed. I thought its absence had been strange, but shrugged it off and pressed on. I considered asking a park ranger about the weird chest in the forest if I ran into one. I hated to admit that I did not wish to, since I wanted to keep my unique prize to myself. The bell was very nice and its smooth and polished surface was almost mesmerizing.  



I walked a bit farther and then I felt a compulsion I had not felt before when I picked it up. I had inspected the fine craftsmanship, but I had not considered just how it might sound until that moment. 



Upon considering that question, I became fixated on it. It was all I could think about. After a few more steps I was unable to move on without knowing the answer to the most important question in the world. What does the bell sound like? 



I held the slim handle between my thumb and index finger and delicately, almost reverently, shook the bell from side to side. The moment the sound rang out, it became the only sound in the forest. The soft chime felt like it somehow echoed for miles around. I felt an immediate sense of displacement and vertigo. I felt like I might be sick and thought I would collapse. Instead of falling down, somehow, I fell up. I whirled through the sky as if launched from a catapult. I remember trying to scream but my voice was gone. I thought, I would fall to the ground when I was plummeting through air high up above the trees in the forest. I discovered that I was not falling and had somehow stabilized in a gentle float high above the canopy of the trees. Somehow, I was flying! 



I looked around and saw the forest stretching on for miles. I had no idea how I was able to remain up in the sky. All I had done was ring the bell and then suddenly I was up there. I looked around and saw a vibrant aura of colors emanating off of the forest and the sky seemed to glow as well. I looked at my hands and they seemed translucent and glowing with a similar array of impossible shades.  



After floating in disbelief for a few minutes, I found I was able to move in an almost swimming like motion. I tried to float back down to the surface and check the trail. Part of me was afraid I had a heart attack or something and I had died. I thought for a moment that the reason I was floating and transparent was because I was a ghost now. 



When I descended back to the trail, my heart sank and my previous suspicion was all but confirmed. I saw myself laying on the ground. I still had the odd bell in my hand, but I was laying on my back in a strange pose. I glided towards my prone form to get a better look. I noticed I had an odd grey like shade to my body and the bell seemed to gleam a strange hue that looked otherworldly. I feared the worst and approached my body. To my relief I saw that it appeared to be breathing still. Whatever was happening I was still alive, at least my body was.  



It seemed to be some sort of out of body experience. The sense of free-floating displacement was almost alike to descriptions of how mentalists believe they can astral project their wills outside of their physical bodies and into the beyond. 



The strange experience felt almost exhilarating, after I was no longer afraid that I had died. The excitement however, was short lived when I saw what happened next.  



I started to hear soft whispering near the edge of my perception. My vision started to double and the skies seemed to darken. There was a tangible shift in the visible aura/energy around me and I felt a strange sense of dread wash over me. I could not describe it, but something bad felt like it was happening. I felt I had to hide, but I also felt exposed since my body was just laying out in the open.  



I tried to wake myself up. I tried to float back into my body, but nothing worked. There were disturbing sounds emanating from the gathering shadows near the trees all around my fallen form. I thought if I could hide it might work, yet to my horror I heard the soft chime of that bell emanating from my very being. The sound seemed to ring out from everywhere and nowhere, despite the physical bell laying unmoving in my rigid grasp down below. 



I started to get desperate; I tried in vain to slap myself awake and force myself up, but nothing I could do seemed to affect the waking world. Then I tensed up as I felt a new presence. I felt the staring eyes of some unseen force. I imagined hundreds of shadowy onlookers, yet when I looked around, I could see nothing. Yet I knew somehow, that I was not alone. Something else was there with me. 



I felt panic welling in my chest and felt like I would hyperventilate, despite this ethereal form I inhabited not truly drawing breath at all. Suddenly I thought I could see hundreds of red dots emerging from the shadows in my peripheral vision. 



To make matters worse, the dim light in the forest seemed to fade even further and when the light died out, the imperceptible beings at the edge of the shadows inched closer to myself, my body and the bell. I caught a direct glimpse of the horrible eyes of one of the entropic stalkers and I was paralyzed with fear. 



 It had no true form, just a moving conglomerate of living shadows, charged with that unsettling aura of oppressive darkness that was encroaching upon me even then. The red orbs it had where its eyes should be, came more into focus as it inched closer.  



It looked straight at me for a moment and then it started to shift and change before my eyes. The amorphous, liquid shadow grew arms, then legs, then a true head. Its colors shifted and changed and took on a dull grey, like my fallen body had. 



When the figure turned back to regard me again after its transformation, I could not believe what I saw.  



It was me, or at least a copy of me that looked exactly like my prone form that still lay on the forest floor. It looked down at my body and then back to me. It twitched in a spasmodic and jerky fashion for a few moments. Then it focused directly on me and gave me a truly unnerving and knowing grin. It knelt down over my prone form and slowly extended a hand towards my body. 



I knew I was out of time. I focused as hard as I could on waking myself up. I willed myself to rise and felt my spirit launched back towards the shadowy doppelganger and my body. It had worked that time and I lurched up with a scream on the forest floor. I was still clutching the bell and my other arm raised up defensively against the lurking horrors in the dark. 



I shuddered when I thought of the shadowy hands of that entity who looked like me. I don't know what might have happened if it had gotten to my body first. 



There was nothing there now, but as I stood back up, I saw I had another problem. Somehow it was the dead of night now. It felt like it was only a short while in that strange state of ethereal motion, yet it must have been several hours in the waking world. 



I only had the flashlight on my phone to try and find my way and I resolved to get out of there as soon as possible. I ran into the second problem at that point. Wherever I was, was not the state park anymore. I was on a trail, but not the one I was on before. It was not just the dark playing tricks on me, this was a different trail. 



I tried not to panic at my situation, but it was hard not to. I was lost and alone after an out of body experience in an unrecognizable place at night. I was not confident I could navigate out of wherever it was I was stuck. I decided to try and find shelter for the night. I found a small outcropping near what looked like the side of a mountain I did not recognize. I had a half tarp in my backpack I normally used for a mat for impromptu picnics. I used it and some sticks to form a micro shelter and I hunkered down and tried to stay warm in the cold forest. 



Sleep did not come at all however. After laying still for what felt like an hour, I heard something that terrified me. Or rather it was what I did not hear again. The sounds of the forest, even the cold wind blowing through the trees was silent once again. 



I looked down at the bell near where I was sheltering. It seemed to be vibrating and moving almost on its own. 



Then I heard the whispering voices again and to my horror I saw what looked like the hazy images of eyes looking at me in the quiet blackness of the night. I tried to rise to my feet and scream but I felt paralyzed by the nightmare image of the formless shadowy eyes moving towards me again. The whispering voices increased in volume and the sounds were becoming more perceptible. Then I realized in horror, that I knew what they were saying. They were calling for me, they were calling my name! 



I forced myself to rise and break out of the nightmare scene in a blind panic. I started to run before tripping over the small bell. I toppled through the dark and smashed face first into a large tree. As I tried to rise and groaned in pain, I heard the faint sound of the bell still chiming after my foot had inadvertently struck it.  



The next moment my spirit was flung outside my body again. Not as high up as before, as I seemed to have slightly more control over my spectral wandering. I saw that even at night things seemed brighter here, colors contrasted starkly with certain elements in the environment. The thing I saw for sure when looking back towards where I had fallen, were the wisps of reddish smoke that no doubt represented my shadows stalkers. 



My heart sank as I realized they were down there yet again with my empty vessel. 



I swam back down as fast as I could.  Some of the red wisps lingered close to my fallen body. I got closer still and saw the nightmarish form of the red featureless entities close in on my body in the waking world. 



Three of them loomed over my shell and looked back to see me arrive. They smiled in unison and reached down towards me. I tried to scream and willed myself awake again. Once more I succeeded and I lurched up, finally vocalizing the frozen scream my ethereal form was unable to utter. It was daylight again. I looked around and saw that I was on the trail I was originally when I had found the burnt sign. The same trail that led me, in pursuit of those mysterious footsteps, to this odd little bell.  



I looked down and saw I was still holding it in my hand. I felt a chill creep up my spine as I swear, I heard the whispers again. I ran back to the burnt sign and down the trail that the now faded footsteps had led me down. I found the chest laying in the clearing and I returned the bell to the chest and closed the lid. I did not have a shovel, but I tried to scoop handfuls of dirt over the chest. After what I had seen, I felt compelled to ensure no one discovered the thing ever again. 



When the deed was done, I started back to my car. As I trudged on, I considered the strange bell, the out of body experience and the awful night, hiding from the hungry shadows that whispered my name. That horrible face that mimicked mine and whatever intent it had for my corporeal form. I shuddered and resolved never to return to the park again. 



 



I still do not know what any of it really was. I do not know what I really saw three weeks ago, but I wish I had not seen it. I wish I had not found it, because whatever I caught a glimpse of in the forest with that otherworldly bell, it is not done with me. 



I thought I could put the matter behind me, but I realized in subsequent days it would not be that easy. Recently I have begun to hear things and I fear that just ridding myself of the bell was not enough. Every night since then I hear a faint chiming at the edge of my mind. I hear that sound, the chiming of the bell, slowly growing louder each night.  



Even though I have not touched the thing since I discarded it back to the earth, the chiming is still with me.  



The true horror dawns on me when the whispers begin again. 



I don’t know what to do now, but I am afraid. I am afraid that I was not the only one to come back from those woods. The stillness in the air is palpable and the soft chime makes me feel that familiar sense of displacement. I need to focus, they will be here soon and I don’t know where the sound will carry me next.
