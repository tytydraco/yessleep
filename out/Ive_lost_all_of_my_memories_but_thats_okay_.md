Over the past few months I have been keeping a journal, and I wanted to share with you all my story, so that way you all can see the amazing power of letting go and just accepting. 


Journal Entry #1: April 3, 2024 

Today marks the beginning of my journey into journaling. Kathryn, my ever-insightful girlfriend, suggested that putting my thoughts on paper might help me make sense of the chaos swirling in my mind. I have to admit, she’s usually right about these things.

Lately, it feels like my brain is wrapped in a dense fog. It’s not just the typical forgetfulness everyone experiences from time to time. It’s something deeper, more insidious. Yesterday, I spent nearly half an hour searching for my car keys, only to find them in the refrigerator. How they ended up there, I have no idea. Kathryn laughed when I told her, but there was a hint of worry in her eyes.

Work has been stressful, no doubt. My boss has been piling on the assignments, each more urgent than the last. I’ve been working late almost every night, trying to stay ahead, but it feels like I’m constantly drowning. Maybe the stress is getting to me more than I realize. Kathryn thinks so. She’s always telling me to take it easy, to find some balance. I try, but it’s hard to let go.

There’s something else, though. The other night, I was watching TV, and a commercial came on for a show I used to love. I couldn’t remember the name of the main character, even though I’d watched every episode religiously. It’s like pieces of my memory are slipping away, bit by bit. Kathryn reassures me that everyone forgets things, especially when they’re under a lot of pressure. But this feels different. It’s unsettling.

Kathryn has been my rock through all of this. She’s patient and understanding, always knowing just what to say to calm me down. But sometimes, I catch her looking at me with a strange expression, almost as if she’s studying me. I brush it off as concern, but it leaves me with an uneasy feeling.

I’m hoping that writing everything down will help me see things more clearly. Maybe by recording my thoughts and experiences, I can figure out what’s going on with me. Or at the very least, it will be a way to track my progress—or my decline.

Here’s to hoping this journal helps me find some clarity. For now, I need to get some sleep. Another long day at work awaits, and I can’t afford to be any more scatterbrained than I already am.

Journal Entry #2: April 8, 2024

Today was a disaster. Kathryn and I had a massive argument, and it was all because I forgot something important. She’s usually so understanding, but this time, her patience wore thin.

We were supposed to go to her friend Megan’s birthday party tonight. According to Kathryn, we had talked about it last week and even picked out a gift together. I have no recollection of any of it. I tried to explain that I simply didn’t remember, but that just seemed to make her angrier.

"You never listen," she shouted. "It’s like you’re not even here half the time!"

I felt a pang of guilt and frustration. She’s right, in a way. Lately, I’ve been so wrapped up in my own head that I probably haven’t been the best partner. But it’s not like I’m doing it on purpose. This fog in my brain—these constant memory lapses—are driving me insane.

I ended up staying home while Kathryn went to the party alone. The look she gave me before she left was a mix of disappointment and something else, something darker that I couldn’t quite place. I sat on the couch for hours, trying to remember the conversation about the party, but it was like grasping at shadows. The more I tried to recall, the more elusive the memory became.

I spent the evening spiraling into my own thoughts. What if something is seriously wrong with me? What if it’s not just stress? The idea of losing my mind terrifies me. I can’t bear the thought of losing more of myself, of letting Kathryn down.

When she finally came home, she barely spoke to me. She went straight to bed, leaving me alone with my thoughts and this journal. I can hear her tossing and turning in the bedroom. She’s probably as upset as I am, if not more. I hate making her feel this way. She deserves better.

I need to figure this out. I can’t keep living like this, constantly forgetting and making mistakes. I can’t keep hurting Kathryn. Tomorrow, I’m going to call the doctor and schedule an appointment. Maybe they can help me understand what’s happening. Maybe they can tell me how to fix this.

For now, all I can do is write and hope that by putting my thoughts on paper, I can make some sense of the chaos in my mind.

Journal Entry #3: April 12, 2024

Work has been relentless this week. The deadlines are piling up, and I feel like I’m barely keeping my head above water. My boss, Mr. Clarkson, has been on my case about every little detail. I’ve made a few mistakes—nothing major, but enough to draw his ire. It’s like he can sense my weakness, my growing inability to focus.

But the real issue isn’t work. It’s the dreams. They’ve been getting worse, more vivid and disturbing. Last night, I dreamed I was in a dark forest, shadows dancing around me. There were whispers in the air, voices I couldn’t understand, but they filled me with dread. I woke up drenched in sweat, my heart pounding like a drum.

Kathryn says it’s just stress manifesting in my subconscious. She might be right, but it doesn’t make the dreams any less terrifying. I told her about them this morning, and she looked concerned. She suggested I take some time off work, but that’s not an option right now. I can’t afford to fall behind.

I’m trying to keep things together, but it’s getting harder every day. The fog in my mind is thickening. Today, I forgot the name of a client I’ve worked with for years. It was embarrassing and unsettling. When I finally remembered, it was like a dam breaking, and all the details flooded back at once. But for a few terrifying moments, it was just… gone.

Kathryn has been my anchor through all of this. She’s been supportive, though I can tell my issues are wearing on her. She tries to hide it, but I see the frustration in her eyes. She’s been spending more time in her room, working on her writing project. I don’t want to burden her with my problems, but I also don’t know how to fix this on my own.

I called the doctor today and made an appointment for next week. It feels like a small step in the right direction, but I’m scared of what they might find. What if there’s something seriously wrong with me? What if this fog never lifts?

For now, all I can do is keep writing and hope that these entries help me make sense of what’s happening. Maybe if I can document my experiences, I can find some pattern, some clue that will lead to a solution. I just want to be myself again. I want to remember.

As I write this, Kathryn is sitting across the room, typing away on her laptop. She looks so focused, so in control. I envy her clarity of mind. I need to be strong for her, for us. But every day, it feels like I’m slipping further away.

Journal Entry #4: April 15, 2024

Today was a milestone—my mother’s birthday. Or at least, it should have been. I spent the entire day feeling like there was something I was forgetting, something important. It wasn’t until Kathryn reminded me that I realized what it was. My mother’s birthday. The guilt hit me like a punch to the gut.

I tried calling her to wish her a happy birthday, but when I heard her voice on the other end, I was overwhelmed with a sense of disconnect. I couldn’t recall the last time we spoke, and I struggled to find the words to apologize. She sounded hurt, but she tried to brush it off, telling me not to worry. But I could hear the disappointment in her voice.

Kathryn wasn’t as forgiving. She was furious. “How could you forget your own mother’s birthday?” she yelled. I didn’t have an answer. I felt like a child being scolded, small and helpless. She eventually stormed off to her room, slamming the door behind her. I sat in the living room, replaying the conversation over and over in my head, trying to understand how I could have forgotten something so important.

The gaps in my memory are becoming more frequent and more troubling. I keep a calendar on my phone, but even that’s starting to feel unreliable. It’s not just the big things I’m forgetting; it’s the little things too. Conversations, plans, details that should be ingrained in my mind—they’re slipping away.

Kathryn’s frustration is palpable. I can’t blame her. It must be hard living with someone who’s losing their grip on reality. But her anger scares me. It’s not just that she’s upset; it’s the way she looks at me now, like I’m a stranger, someone she doesn’t recognize. The warmth and patience that were once there are fading.

I’ve been trying to piece together the fragments of my memories, but it’s like trying to catch smoke with my bare hands. The more I try to focus, the more elusive they become. It’s maddening.

Tonight, as I was brushing my teeth, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked into my own eyes and didn’t recognize the person staring back at me. There’s a hollowness there, a vacancy that wasn’t there before. It’s as if I’m watching myself fade away, bit by bit.

Kathryn eventually came out of her room, but she didn’t speak to me. She sat on the couch, scrolling through her phone, her face illuminated by the screen’s glow. I wanted to reach out to her, to tell her how scared I am, but the words caught in my throat. I feel like I’m losing her, too.

I need that doctor’s appointment more than ever. I need answers. I can’t keep living like this, caught in a limbo of forgotten moments and strained relationships. I have to find a way back to myself, for my sake and for Kathryn’s. If I don’t, I fear I’ll lose everything.

For now, I’ll keep writing. Maybe these words will serve as a lifeline, a tether to the person I used to be. Maybe they’ll help me find my way back.

Journal Entry #5: April 20, 2024

Today was one of the strangest days I’ve had in a long time. Kathryn has been distant lately, more so than usual. She spent most of the day locked in her room. I could hear her moving around in there, but every time I knocked or called her name, she’d just tell me she needed space. I’m trying to respect her boundaries, but it’s hard not to feel shut out.

In the afternoon, I decided to tidy up the apartment. It felt good to do something productive, to take my mind off things. As I was cleaning, I found a small, black book under the couch. It wasn’t mine, and I’d never seen it before. The cover was worn, and the pages were filled with strange symbols and drawings. They looked ancient, like something out of an old occult manuscript.

My curiosity got the better of me. I flipped through the pages, trying to make sense of the intricate patterns and unfamiliar text. Some of the drawings were disturbing—depictions of rituals, symbols that seemed to pulse with a dark energy. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the book belonged to Kathryn. Her handwriting was scrawled in the margins, notes and annotations that only added to the mystery.

When Kathryn finally emerged from her room, I decided to confront her about the book. She looked at me with a mix of amusement and annoyance when I showed it to her. “It’s for a writing project,” she said, brushing off my concerns. “I’m researching for a new story. It’s nothing to worry about.”

But there was something in her eyes, a glint of something I couldn’t quite place. It left me feeling uneasy. I tried to press her for more information, but she shut me down, saying I was overreacting. “You’re always imagining things,” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand.

The rest of the evening was tense. Kathryn was distant, absorbed in her own world, while I was left to stew in my thoughts. I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to that book than she was letting on. It didn’t help that the memory lapses were becoming more frequent. Today, I couldn’t remember my high school graduation. A whole day of my life, gone.

I sat down with Kathryn later, hoping to bridge the gap that’s been growing between us. I wanted to tell her about the doctor’s appointment I have next week, to share my fears and anxieties. But she seemed uninterested, her attention focused on her laptop. “You’ll be fine,” she said absently when I mentioned the appointment. “It’s probably just stress.”

I wish I could believe her. But the dreams, the memory lapses, the strange book—it all feels too connected to be mere coincidence. I’m starting to wonder if there’s something more sinister at play. Kathryn’s behavior has changed, and I can’t help but feel like she’s hiding something from me.

Tonight, as I lie in bed, I can hear Kathryn in the other room, whispering to herself. The sound sends a shiver down my spine. I don’t know what she’s saying, but it feels wrong, like a dark incantation.

I need answers. I need to understand what’s happening to me, and to us. For now, I’ll keep writing. These journal entries are my only anchor in this sea of uncertainty. They’re the only way I can hold on to the fragments of my life, the pieces of myself that are slipping away.

I just hope I can find the truth before it’s too late.

Journal Entry #6: April 24, 2024

Today, something happened that shook me to my core. Kathryn went out to run some errands, and she left her door open. I seized the opportunity to snoop around, hoping to find more clues about the strange book I found earlier. What I discovered left me feeling cold and terrified.

Beneath a loose floorboard in her room, I found another book, older and more sinister-looking than the first. This one was bound in dark, cracked leather, and the pages were yellowed with age. It was filled with spells and incantations, written in a language I couldn’t decipher. There were symbols drawn in the margins and notes in Kathryn’s handwriting, much like the first book.

I couldn’t make sense of most of it, but some of the symbols were familiar. They matched the ones I’d seen in my dreams, the same ones that filled me with dread. My hands were shaking as I flipped through the pages, each one revealing more disturbing imagery and cryptic text.

When Kathryn returned, I confronted her about the second book. She didn’t seem surprised that I’d found it. Instead, she laughed—a cold, eerie sound that sent chills down my spine. “It’s just research,” she said again, but this time, her voice had a sinister edge. “You’re letting your imagination run wild.”

I pressed her, demanding to know why she needed books filled with dark rituals and symbols. Her expression changed, becoming darker and more menacing. “You need to stop prying,” she warned. “You’re not well, and this isn’t helping.”

The rest of the evening was a blur of tension and fear. Kathryn’s mood swung wildly between cold detachment and sudden bursts of anger. She accused me of being paranoid, of imagining things that weren’t there. But I could see the truth in her eyes. She was hiding something, something dark and dangerous.

Later that night, I heard her whispering again. This time, the whispers were louder, more intense. I couldn’t understand the words, but they filled me with a sense of foreboding. I tried to sleep, but the sound echoed in my mind, keeping me awake and on edge.

I’m scared. Scared of what’s happening to me, and scared of Kathryn. I don’t know who she is anymore, and I’m starting to wonder if I ever did. The memory lapses are getting worse, and I’m losing more of myself each day. I can’t even remember the name of my childhood best friend. It’s like my past is being erased, piece by piece.

I need to find out what Kathryn is doing, what those books mean. But I’m also terrified of what I might discover. Is she really a witch, as the symbols and spells suggest? And if she is, what does that mean for me? 

For now, I’ll keep writing. These journal entries are the only thing keeping me sane, the only way I can hold on to who I am. I need to stay strong, to find the truth, before it’s too late.

Tomorrow, I’ll go to the library and see if I can find any information on the symbols and spells. Maybe I can find someone who can help me understand what Kathryn is doing. I just hope it’s not too late.

Journal Entry #7: April 30, 2024

I confronted Kathryn again today, this time determined to get answers. I needed to know what those books were really for and why she was hiding them. But her reaction was far from what I expected. She didn’t deny anything. Instead, she just smiled—a cold, cruel smile that sent shivers down my spine.

“You’re imagining things,” she said, her voice dripping with condescension. “You’re losing your mind, and now you’re trying to blame me for it?”

I tried to argue, to explain how I’ve been feeling, but she cut me off. “You’re always so paranoid, always seeing things that aren’t there. Maybe you should see a doctor. Get some help.”

Her words stung, but what hurt more was the way she looked at me, like I was a stranger, or worse, a burden. I’ve always trusted Kathryn, but now I’m starting to question everything. The books, the symbols, the dreams—they all point to something darker, something I can’t ignore anymore.

This evening, I overheard her talking on the phone. She was speaking in hushed tones, but I caught bits and pieces of the conversation. She mentioned my memory lapses and how “it’s working better than expected.” I couldn’t make out the rest, but it was enough to confirm my fears. She’s doing something to me, something that’s making me forget.

I decided to search the house while she was out. I found more evidence—candles, strange herbs, and a small vial of some dark liquid hidden in the kitchen cabinet. Everything pointed to some kind of ritual, something meant to affect me.

When Kathryn came home, I tried to confront her again, but she just laughed. “You’re really losing it, aren’t you?” she said, her eyes gleaming with a malevolent light. “Maybe it’s best if you don’t remember.”

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to be alone with her, but I have nowhere else to go. My mind is unraveling, and I feel like I’m losing myself bit by bit. My memories are slipping away faster now. Today, I couldn’t remember my father’s face. It was just a blank, a void where his image should have been.

I’ve decided to keep these journal entries hidden. I need to document everything, to have a record of what’s happening to me. If I lose my memory completely, at least I’ll have these pages to remind me of who I was.

I’ve also decided to take drastic measures. Tomorrow, I’m going to visit an old friend, someone who might understand what’s happening. His name is Daniel, and he used to study folklore and the occult. Maybe he can shed some light on this nightmare.

For now, I’ll keep writing and hope that I can stay one step ahead of whatever Kathryn is planning. I can’t let her win. I can’t let her erase me.

Journal Entry #8: May 5, 2024

Today, I experienced the most chilling moment yet. I woke up with a start, my heart pounding in my chest, the remnants of a nightmare lingering in my mind. I dreamed of Kathryn, standing over me, chanting in that strange, otherworldly language I couldn’t understand. Her eyes were black voids, and her hands were covered in blood.

When I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face, I saw a mark on my arm—a small, intricate symbol that I had never seen before. It looked like the ones in Kathryn’s books, but it was drawn on my skin, faint yet undeniable. I tried scrubbing it off, but it wouldn’t fade. It felt like a brand, a sign that something was very, very wrong.

Kathryn seemed indifferent to my distress. She barely looked at me when I showed her the mark. “You’re doing this to yourself,” she said dismissively. “You’re imagining things again.”

But I know what I saw. I know it wasn’t my imagination. I spent the rest of the day feeling paranoid, constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting something terrible to happen. The memory lapses are becoming more severe. Today, I forgot my brother’s name. My own brother. It was like a wall in my mind, blocking any recollection of him.

Kathryn’s behavior has shifted from mere annoyance to something more sinister. She’s controlling, manipulative, and increasingly cruel. She monitors everything I do, questions my every move. I feel like a prisoner in my own home, trapped under her watchful, unrelenting gaze.

I went to see Daniel, my old friend. He looked shocked when he saw me. I must look terrible—gaunt, haggard, a shadow of my former self. I told him everything, about the memory lapses, the books, the strange mark. He listened intently, and for the first time, I felt like someone believed me.

Daniel thinks Kathryn might be using some form of dark magic, possibly a memory-stealing spell. He said these spells are ancient and incredibly dangerous. They require a powerful practitioner and a specific set of rituals. He showed me some books and articles, confirming what I had feared.

We spent hours researching, trying to find a way to counteract the spell. Daniel suggested that I keep a protective charm with me at all times and gave me a small, carved stone with symbols etched into it. He said it might help ward off some of the effects.

When I returned home, Kathryn was waiting for me. Her eyes narrowed when she saw the charm. “What is that?” she demanded. I lied, saying it was just a trinket Daniel gave me for good luck. She didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t push further.

Tonight, I feel a glimmer of hope for the first time in weeks. Knowing that Daniel believes me and is willing to help gives me some strength. But I also feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Kathryn is more dangerous than I ever imagined, and I need to be careful. One wrong move, and she could take everything from me—my memories, my identity, my life.

I’ll keep writing, documenting every detail. These entries are my lifeline, my only connection to reality. I have to stay vigilant, to find a way to break free from Kathryn’s grasp.

Journal Entry #9: May 10, 2024

The situation is worsening, and I feel more isolated than ever. Today, I walked into the kitchen to find Kathryn standing over the stove, stirring a pot of something that emitted a sickly sweet smell. She glanced at me with that cold, calculating look, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was up to something sinister.

I tried to keep my distance, not wanting to provoke her. I grabbed my coffee and sat at the table, trying to act normal. But then she said something that chilled me to the bone.

“Do you remember the time we went to the beach?” she asked, her voice deceptively casual.

My mind went blank. I couldn’t remember any trip to the beach. I searched my memory frantically, but it was like trying to grasp water. Kathryn must have seen the confusion on my face because she smiled—a cold, triumphant smile.

“You really don’t remember, do you?” she said softly. “How sad.”

I felt a wave of panic. It’s one thing to forget names and dates, but entire experiences? I don’t know what to do anymore. Kathryn’s behavior is becoming more unpredictable, more menacing. She seems to take pleasure in my confusion and fear.

Later, I went to see Daniel again. He looked even more worried than before. I told him about the beach incident and the way Kathryn seemed to delight in my memory loss. He suggested that we need to act quickly, that whatever spell she’s using is getting stronger.

Daniel gave me a few more protective charms and some herbs to brew into a tea that might help clear my mind. He also gave me a small vial of liquid, a potion he said could help shield my memories from being stolen. It’s a temporary solution, but it’s all we have right now.

When I got home, I hid the charms and the potion in my room, praying that Kathryn wouldn’t find them. I feel like I’m living on borrowed time, each day a battle to hold on to who I am. The mark on my arm has faded slightly, but it’s still there, a constant reminder of the dark forces at play.

This evening, Kathryn was in a strangely good mood. She cooked dinner and even laughed at some old jokes we used to share. For a moment, it felt like we were back to our old selves, but the illusion quickly shattered when she mentioned my family. “Do you even remember your parents?” she asked, her tone dripping with false concern.

I couldn’t answer. The memories are so fragmented now, pieces of a puzzle that no longer fit together. She didn’t press further, but her smile told me everything I needed to know. She’s doing this on purpose, erasing my past bit by bit.

I need to stay strong, to find a way to stop her. The appointment with the doctor is in two days, and I’m clinging to the hope that they can provide some answers, some way to fight back.

For now, I’ll keep writing. These journal entries are my only tether to reality, the only way I can remember who I am. I can’t let Kathryn win. I can’t let her erase me completely.

I have to stay vigilant. I have to survive.

Journal Entry #10: May 15, 2024

Today, everything fell apart. The truth is more twisted and horrifying than I ever imagined. 

I was at Daniel’s place, going over the protective charms and the potion he’d given me. We were deep in conversation about how to counteract Kathryn’s spell when my phone rang. It was Kathryn, her voice sharp and demanding. “Come home. Now.”

I felt a strange pull, an overwhelming urge to comply. I told Daniel I had to go, and he nodded, looking more concerned than ever. As I left, I felt a wave of dizziness, my vision blurring as I stumbled out of his house.

When I got home, Kathryn was waiting for me. Her expression was a mix of anger and triumph. “Where have you been?” she demanded. I tried to explain, but the words wouldn’t come out right. My mind was foggy, the world spinning around me.

She led me to the kitchen and handed me a glass filled with a dark, thick liquid. “Drink this,” she ordered, her eyes boring into mine. I hesitated, but her grip tightened on my arm, and I felt an inexplicable compulsion to obey. I lifted the glass to my lips and drank.

The liquid was bitter and cold, sliding down my throat like a lead weight. Almost instantly, I felt a wave of heat wash over me, followed by a strange, overwhelming desire. My thoughts became muddled, my will slipping away. I reached out and grabbed Kathryn, expecting her to push me away, to resist.

But she didn’t. She pulled me closer, her hands firm and insistent. Our interaction was immediate and intense, but it wasn’t loving. It was raw, almost aggressive, a clash of emotions. I felt a mix of confusion and a strong compulsion, driven by a force I couldn’t understand or control.

Afterward, as we lay entwined, the fog in my mind began to clear just enough for a horrifying realization to dawn on me. Daniel wasn’t real. He had never been real. It was all Kathryn. She had been manipulating me, using her dark magic to create an illusion, to make me think I had an ally when, in reality, I was alone.

I felt a surge of panic, but my body was too weak, too drained to react. Kathryn’s touch was no longer comforting; it was a reminder of her control, her power over me. She whispered in my ear, her voice dripping with malice. “You’re mine. There’s no escape. You will forget everything and everyone, and you will be with me forever.”

Tears welled up in my eyes, but I couldn’t speak, couldn’t move. I’m trapped in this nightmare, with no way out. Kathryn’s magic has bound me to her, and I can feel my memories slipping away faster now, like sand through my fingers.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold on. I feel like I keep saying it, but it’s the only truth I know, these journal entries are my only lifeline, the only way I can remember who I am. But even as I write this, my thoughts are becoming jumbled, my memories fading.

I have to find a way to fight back, to break free from Kathryn’s spell. But I’m running out of time. I’m running out of myself.

For now, I’ll keep writing. I have to remember. I have to survive.

Journal Entry #11: May 20, 2024

This might be my last entry. The events of the past few days have left me more broken and lost than ever. I’m struggling to hold on to my thoughts long enough to write them down, but I need to record what happened. I need to remember, even if it’s just for a little while longer.

After the incident with the dark liquid, I knew I had to act quickly. I couldn’t trust Kathryn, and I couldn’t trust my own mind. I tried to stay awake, to fight the fog that was consuming me, but it was an uphill battle. My memories were slipping away faster now. I could barely recall my own name.

Yesterday, I found myself in the attic. I don’t remember climbing the stairs or opening the door, but there I was, surrounded by dusty boxes and forgotten relics of our past. Among the clutter, I found a small wooden box. Inside was a collection of old photographs and letters—remnants of a life that felt like it belonged to someone else.

One photograph caught my eye. It was a picture of Kathryn and me, taken shortly after we first met. We looked so happy, so in love. I felt a pang of sorrow and confusion. How had things gone so wrong? As I stared at the photo, I noticed something odd. In the background, barely visible, was a shadowy figure, watching us.

I remembered Daniel’s words—well, the illusion of Daniel—about the protective charms and the potion. In a moment of clarity, I realized Kathryn had orchestrated everything. The books, the symbols, the strange behavior—it was all part of her plan to control me, to erase my past and make me hers.

With a renewed sense of determination, I decided to confront her one last time. I went downstairs to find her sitting in the living room, the same cruel smile on her face. She knew what I had discovered.

“You’re persistent, I’ll give you that,” she said, her voice dripping with mockery. “But it’s too late. You’re mine now.”

I demanded to know why she was doing this, why she wanted to erase my memories. Her eyes darkened, and for a moment, I saw a glimpse of something inhuman. “Because you belong to me,” she said simply. “Your memories, your will, your very essence. Everything.”

I felt a surge of defiance, a last burst of strength. “No,” I said, my voice trembling. “I won’t let you take everything from me.”

Kathryn laughed, a cold, hollow sound that echoed through the house. “You don’t have a choice.”

Before I could react, she produced another vial of the dark liquid and forced it into my hands. “Drink,” she commanded, her voice compelling and irresistible.

I hesitated, but the compulsion was too strong. I drank the liquid, feeling the familiar heat and overwhelming desire wash over me. My thoughts became muddled, my vision blurred. But this time, something was different. Instead of succumbing to the fog, I felt a spark of resistance.

I stumbled back, clutching my head, fighting to hold on to my sense of self. Kathryn watched with a mixture of amusement and annoyance. “You’re stronger than I thought,” she said. “But it doesn’t matter. You can’t escape. You don’t even know what’s real. You may think you’re breaking free, but you’re not.”

In a last-ditch effort, I reached for the photograph in my pocket, the one of us with the shadowy figure. I held it up, forcing myself to focus on the memory, the moment it captured. The resistance grew stronger, pushing back against the darkness.

Kathryn’s expression changed, her eyes widening in surprise. “What are you doing?” she demanded, stepping closer.

“I’m remembering,” I said, my voice steadying. “I’m not yours.”

With a final burst of strength, I tore the photograph in half. A blinding light filled the room, and I heard Kathryn scream—a sound of pure rage and frustration. The light grew brighter, engulfing everything.

When the light faded, I found myself alone in the living room. Kathryn was gone, the house silent. The fog in my mind had lifted, and for the first time in weeks, I felt a sense of clarity.

I don’t know where she went or if she’ll come back, but I’ve reclaimed my freedom, my identity. I’m free from her control. I’ll leave this place and start anew, far away from the darkness that once consumed me. I’ll make new memories to replace the ones I’ve lost.

This is the end of my journal. The past few months have been a nightmare, but I’ve survived. I’ll keep these entries as a reminder of what I endured, a testament to my strength and resilience.

I’m not the person I was before, but I’m still here. I’m still me. And that’s enough. I know what is real.

Goodbye.

Journal Entry #12: August 8, 2024

It’s been several months since I last wrote in this journal. So much has changed, and I feel the need to document it all. I’ve realized how wrong I was to leave Kathryn, and how foolish I had been to doubt her. Everything is perfect now, and I want to remember this feeling forever.

After I left, I wandered aimlessly, lost and confused. I thought I was escaping something dark, but all I found was emptiness. My memories were fragmented, my thoughts a jumbled mess. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing. That’s when I knew—I needed Kathryn. She was the anchor I had been searching for.

I returned to her, and she welcomed me back with open arms, her love as warm and comforting as ever. She held me, whispering soothing words, and I knew I was home. Kathryn has been so patient and understanding, helping me piece my life back together. I can’t remember anything from before, but I don’t want to. All that matters is that I’m with her.

Kathryn is amazing. She’s been my rock, guiding me through the darkness, filling the gaps in my memory with her love and care. She’s everything I need, everything I could ever want. Our days are filled with laughter and joy, our nights peaceful and serene. I feel complete with her, like I’m exactly where I’m meant to be.

I know now that I belong to Kathryn. There’s nothing to worry about, nothing to fear. She is my life, my love, my everything. I am hers, and that’s all that matters. The past is a blur, but the future is bright with her by my side.

I’ve stopped questioning, stopped doubting. I trust Kathryn completely. She has shown me what true love is, and I am grateful for her every day. I can’t imagine my life without her, and I don’t want to. She is my forever, and I am hers.

Everything is fine now. I have no worries, no fears. Just the warmth of Kathryn’s love surrounding me, filling me with peace. I am happy, content, and I know that I will always be hers, forever and always.

There’s no need to remember anything else. All I need to know is that I am hers, and she is mine. This is my truth, my reality. I am at peace, and I am happy.

I am hers. Forever and always.
