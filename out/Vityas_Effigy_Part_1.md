Someone once said that beauty is pain, and I have to think that they too were once visitors to the Inferno Gallery.  That, or they happened to be acquainted with the brilliant sculptor Victor Levchenko.

Back in the early aughts, I was fresh out of college and in debt, taking on odd jobs to supplement the meager income my roommate brought in.  This story happened around the time I’d started a job putting up flyers for whoever commissioned the business.  It was pretty standard stuff:  missing dog posters, impromptu poetry slam nights, grand openings or closeout sales of sundry grocery stores, you name it.

But there was one particular stack of flyers that caught my attention, one foggy day in mid-May.  The design was simple, yet effective.  In an elegant white font on a black background, it read “Madame Blanc’s Inferno Gallery”, and had an address and a phone number at the bottom.  Normally I’m not a stuffy art person, but one small line at the bottom of the flyer caught my attention:  “Admission free to the public”.  

I was already intrigued.  My roommate was going to be out with her girlfriend that weekend and I was planning to pig out on crappy pizza and a romance movie, so having something constructive to look forward to that night would be great.  As if I didn’t need more convincing,  I checked out the back of the flyer.  Most people don’t put things on the backs of flyers that are supposed to be posted on bulletin boards and other places, but the client had asked for these flyers to be handed to people directly, so it made sense.

The back of the flyer wasn’t as put-together as the front.  Rather than featuring any fancy fonts and text sizes, it simply bore a list of names:  

Sandra Gulley-Ransom

Daisy Fay

Curly Canton

Neville Pilgrim

Alice-Rose Beckett

Victor Levchenko

As much as I was a little put-off by the pretentiousness of the names, I had to do a double-take at the last name on the list.  I knew that name very well.

Back during my college days, before I found out just how hard it was for a person to get a job with an English degree, I was a bright-eyed nineteen-year-old trying to glean any inspiration I could from all the unconventional art students, the counter-culture junkies, the 21st-century beatniks.  They were pieces of sea-glass in the middle of grains of sand, and I wanted to know everything about them.  And one of those beautiful nonconformists was Victor Levchenko.

Out of all the weirdo art punks on campus, Victor was definitely the least approachable.  He was tall and imposing, with whiskey-colored eyes, messy dark brown hair, and a vaguely Slavic accent that nobody knew the origin of.  Victor barely spoke to anyone on campus except this one freckle-faced photography major with bright green eyes, so it was a shock to me when he agreed to an interview for a blog I was running as part of a class project.  

The two of us became somewhat close until he graduated, after which I lost track of him…at least until now.  I couldn’t deny the way my heart did a somersault when I read his name on the list.  I had to see him.  There was no way he’d remember me, of course, but I at least wanted to know how he was doing.

Saturday couldn’t come fast enough.  I wasn’t sure what people wore to fancy art exhibitions, but I was on a budget, so I had to make do with a mostly unwrinkled button-down, a skirt I'd bought at a thrift store and never had any occasion to wear, and the fanciest shoes I owned.  Which were a pair of beat-up Converse I’d saved up my money for because I thought they were cool.  

It took me a while to find the address on the flyer.  I’d only lived in this town for six months, but it was a small enough town that I thought I knew where everything was.  The Inferno Gallery was held in a small stone church that I’d never seen before.  The grey bricks were cracking, the wooden door faded and starting to splinter in some places.  I wasn’t expecting much, maybe a few easels set up with some LED gamer lights plastered on the walls, but when I pushed open the door, I was met with a drastically different environment.

Instead of a dark, slightly damp chapel, with mouldering pews and a dilapidated crucifix above the altar, I stepped into a sleek, modern-looking room.  The walls were some shiny material I couldn’t place, between metal and plastic, and were lit from below with blue neon strips.  The space seemed impossibly big for how small the church looked from the outside, but more confusing than the room itself was its contents.  

Trying to describe all of the pieces contained in that room is…a daunting task.  There was everything from stop-motion animation playing on a screen, to a slideshow of the most heartbreaking photos you could imagine, to paintings portraying people in various states of unimaginable grief.  Every type of physical and/or digital art one could imagine, there was at least one example of it in the gallery.  At one corner of the room, a young woman sat under a flickering spotlight that cast a halo on her auburn hair, playing a mournful melody on a cello.  There were a dozen or so people meandering around, but whether they were curious visitors like me or the people who made these pieces wasn’t clear.

In the center of the room, on prominent display, stood a limestone statue on a black pedestal.  It was around three feet tall, not life-size, and depicted a frail old man doubled over, an expression of pure agony on his face as he turned his head to look towards his back.  The old man’s back was split open, and a younger man could be seen clawing his way out, a manic smile on his handsome face as his twisted body struggled to emerge.  A small placard on the pedestal read “Evolution–Victor Levchenko”.  I couldn’t help a small smile.  I would have recognized that gut-wrenching realism anywhere.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” said a soft voice from behind me.  I turned around to find a woman around several years older than me standing a couple feet away.  She was round and doe-eyed, with mousy brown hair and soft pink lips curled into a demure smile.  I shrugged.

“That isn’t the first word I would use, but, yeah, I guess.”  The woman moved a bit closer, circling the pedestal.

“Victor’s work is always so inspiring,” she said, clasping her hands together.  “Sometimes I think he’s Madame Blanc’s favorite.”  All of a sudden, she sidled back over to me and stuck out a hand.  “I’m Sandra, by the way.”  I shook her hand with a small smile.

“Olivia Song.  Livy.”  I glanced around, trying to see if I could catch a glimpse of the sculpture’s reclusive creator.  Not seeing anyone resembling him, I decided hanging out with Sandra for a bit wouldn’t be so bad.  She seemed friendly, and maybe I could ask her a few questions about this gallery.  “So, which one is yours?” I asked, gesturing to the rest of the works in the gallery.  Her cheeks turned a bright pink.  

“Oh, um, I did the stop-motion animations over there,” she said, pointing.  I walked over to two of the smaller screens, little more than glorified iPads, that were set up on pedestals next to a glass case. The case contained three handmade figurines, two of which looked like they were made out of clay.  The third looked like it was made out of paper, and oddly looked a lot like Sandra herself.  I bent down to peer at the figurines.  

“Is this one you?” I asked, pointing to it.  Sandra brushed her hair back from her face.  

“Y-yes and no,” she said.  “She wasn’t supposed to be, but when I was making her, she just kind of ended up looking like me.”  I glanced up at the iPads, noticing the “Sandra” figurine featuring in a couple of the animations playing, and realized with barely suppressed alarm that one of the short sequences featured the puppet being set on fire.  “I-I made several of her for that one,” Sandra remarked, noticing what I was looking at.  “Ended up keeping this version for the exhibition, it’s the most detailed.  I think I messed up the joints a little, but…”  She trailed off.

“Even if you did fuck up the joints, who’s going to be able to tell?”  I jumped at the voice coming from behind me, recognizing the thick accent instantly.  Sandra also jumped, clearly startled.

“J-jeez, Victor, I didn’t see you there,” she said, hunching in on herself.  I didn’t blame her.  Anyone with a spine that wasn’t made out of titanium would be intimidated by him.  He honestly hadn’t changed much from the last time I’d seen him.  His hair was a bit longer, and he’d had to start using a cane within the last couple years, but he was still the same old Victor.  Sandra was still meekly apologizing nearby, but Victor had eyes only for me.  

“Well, well, if it isn’t my favorite writer,” he said, the faintest hint of a smile crossing his face.  “It’s good to see you, Livy.” At some point, a man wearing a black cowboy hat had joined the woman with the cello in the corner, accompanying her cello playing with languid picking on a banjo.  Very romantic, I thought.  

“Hi, Vic,” I said, resisting the urge to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.  Neither of us were very good at small talk, so he ended up just showing me around the gallery and pointing out things by the various artists.  Once, we passed a man in a tuxedo standing in front of a baroque-style painting of a man chasing after a fleeing woman.

“That’s Neville,” Victor said next to my ear.  “Don’t talk to Neville, his head is so far up his own ass he could do his own colonoscopies for free.”  I tried my best to stifle a laugh, both from the hilarity of that mental image and out of sheer giddiness.  I couldn’t remember when, but Victor had placed a hand on the small of my back when I hadn’t been paying attention.  God, I’d missed him.  

It seemed like I spent hours in that gallery, admiring the works displayed there, as disturbing as they were.  Victor told tell me little bits of trivia about each one, as he’d gotten to know the artists rather well through this gallery (except Neville), and eventually I felt like I’d gotten to know them too, if only through their work.  

“*Your attention please,”* a French-sounding female voice came over a loudspeaker, startling me.  “*The gallery will be closing in fifteen minutes.  Please make your way to the exits and enjoy your evening.”*  

“Who was that?” I asked.  Victor smirked.

“Our mysterious benefactress, Madame Blanc,” he said.  “She has a flair for the dramatic.”  As the patrons made their way towards the front of the gallery, Victor held me back.  “Stay for a bit?” he asked.  “I’ve been meaning to catch up with you, but you aren’t exactly easy to find.”  I was about to make some excuse of not wanting to intrude before Sandra came over, accompanied by the cellist and the banjo player.  

“The five of us usually go out to dinner after gallery night,” she said.  “We were wondering if maybe you’d want to join?”  

“Five…but there’s only four of you,” I said.  Just then, a woman with short blond hair and what looked like a flapper dress came jogging out of a separate wing of the gallery, her heels clicking on the floor.

“Sorry, everybody, had to use the ladies’ room,” she called out, smiling.  Seeing me, she shook my hand energetically and introduced herself as Daisy Fay.  I highly doubted any of the names listed on the flyer were these people’s real names, with the obvious exception of Victor.  My friend chose that particular moment to introduce me as “an old friend from college”, to which the others gathered around in fascination.  Apparently they, like many of my old classmates, had been under the impression that Victor didn’t have friends.  

“If everybody’s ready to head out, I say we move along and rustle up some food,” said the cowboy, who introduced himself as James “Curly” Canton.  Curly had a charming Texas twang and could easily win a Heath Ledger lookalike contest.  I learned he’d grown up on a cattle ranch near Fort Worth before coming up north to seek his fortune, against the wishes of his ailing grandfather, who had hoped he’d take over the ranch.  As we made our way out of the building to Sandra’s SUV, I was introduced to the rest of the Inferno Gallery’s star artists.

Alice-Rose Beckett, Alice for short, was from a middle-class family in Vermont, but her parents had perished when she was twelve and she’d spent the rest of her childhood under the care of a wealthy aunt who had fostered her love for music.  It was also clear to me that she harbored a subtle crush on Curly, as she kept staring at him even when he wasn't speaking and made a concerted effort to be near him.  

I’d been wondering why Sandra had a hyphenated last name, as I’d had the notion that only rich people did that when they didn’t want to lose the prestige of one name just to take on another of equal merit.  However, I soon found out that she had recently been divorced, and had chosen to keep her husband’s last name of Ransom appended to her own as a stage name of sorts.  It sounded like he wasn’t exactly the Prince Charming she’d thought he was. 

Daisy was by far the most colorful of the group, and also the most mysterious.  Even after talking to her for well over an hour, I still knew only a few things about her.  She loved black and white photography, she loved the 1920s, and above all, she held a deep, abiding affection for any film starring Jimmy Stewart.  

“He’s just so emotive, you know?” she explained over slices of the greasiest pizza I’d ever had.  Anyone else might have gotten a stomachache from the grease, but I grew up eating my mom’s kimchi and have the intestinal fortitude of a primordial god.  Eventually, however, the conversation inevitably turned to me and what I did for a living.  

“Oh, um…Well, right now I put up flyers for whoever's paying, but if I could do whatever I wanted…I dunno, I’d probably write for a magazine or something.”

“Pulitzer material, this one,” Victor interjected, patting my shoulder.  I looked up at him, confused.  Victor didn’t *do* compliments; in fact, you’d be lucky to get anything more than a “not bad” out of him.  It almost seemed like he was proud to know me, which was nice…even if totally out of character.  It also made me realize I was super out of practice with my writing.  Maybe I ought to start up that journal again, I thought.

When I got home that night, my roommate wasn’t home.  She must have spent the night with her girlfriend.  Not wanting to go to bed just yet, I decided to flop on the couch and channel-surf for a while, snagging some leftover Traverse City Fudge from the freezer on the way.  

There wasn’t much on TV, just some cop show reruns, *Dateline* and one of those skeezy reality shows involving scantily-clad women, so I ended up settling for a few episodes of *Columbo.*  I didn’t always like the show’s format of showing the killer right away, but I could definitely respect a man who was so completely in love with his wife that he mentioned her every episode.  I was a romantic back then.  Maybe some part of me still is.

In the middle of a riveting interrogation scene, my phone buzzed.  I picked it up to see I had a text message from a number I didn’t recognize.  It simply read *Hey.*  My mom always taught me to not answer texts from strangers, but this one made me curious.  I didn’t remember giving my phone number to anyone at the pizza place earlier.

\-*Hi?  Who is this?*  I typed, sitting up on the couch, spoon hanging out of my mouth.  The message was read almost immediately, but it was a while before the person on the other end started typing.

*-Oh, sorry.  It’s Victor.*  There was a pause before he added, -*I figured you hadn’t changed your number.*  Now I remembered.  When I interviewed Victor for the university paper, I had given him my phone number so he could text me when he was available to meet up.  I was debating what to say next when he started typing again.  *-I meant what I said earlier.  It was good to see you.  I was wondering…*

*-Wondering what?* I asked.  

*-Would you maybe want to get dinner with me sometime?*  I nearly dropped the phone.  *-I get you’re probably busy, but I really do want to talk with you more.*  I set the phone down on the couch next to me before I *did* drop it.  

“What?” I said aloud, before looking at the text again.  “No, no, I definitely read it right.  What?”  Honestly, I had already been planning on visiting the gallery again next week on the insistence of Victor’s artist friends, so it couldn’t hurt.  What did I have to lose?

\-*Sure.  Did you have anywhere in mind?*

*-I was thinking the Red Dragon Buffet over on Great Portland Street,* he typed.  I raised an eyebrow.  The Red Dragon Buffet was my absolute favorite restaurant in town, mostly because of their delicious yet somehow affordable lo mein noodles.  Was it a coincidence, or was Victor somehow clairvoyant?  I suspected the latter.  

*-OMG, I LOVE Red Dragon!*  

*-Excellent.  When are you free next week?*

*-All weekend, basically.  Friday night?*

*-Perfect.*  I couldn't help a giddy little squeal as we agreed to meet up at Red Dragon at 6pm the following Friday.

The following week was a blur.  I went to work, went grocery shopping, ate, slept, but all I could think about practically the entire time was seeing Victor again.  I hated to admit it to myself, but I was lonely.  Kristen, my roommate, had been with her girlfriend for over two years by that point, and I was jealous.  I wasn't ugly by any stretch of the word, but I had one of those faces that guys just didn't pay attention to except to assume I was Japanese and proceed to quote Naruto at me.  It didn't help that I was usually pretty quiet and kept to myself unless I had a group project in school.

Friday night came with pouring rain and fog that rolled off the asphalt in thick waves.  I was lucky I lived only a few blocks from Red Dragon, but by the time I arrived, my brand-new wrap dress was soaking wet and my bangs were plastered to my forehead..  I found Victor sitting at a booth near the back, the decorative paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling casting a rosy glow across his pale face.  He'd pulled back his hair, presumably to make himself more presentable, but was wearing the same old, beat-up bomber jacket he always did.  Frankly, I wouldn't have had it any other way.  He smiled when he saw me, waving me over, before his smile fell as he noticed the state of my clothes and hair.  

“You're soaking wet, what happened?” he asked.

“I don't have a car.”  He clucked his tongue, shaking his head.

“Next time I'm picking you up.  You're going to end up sick.”  Over my protests, he took off his jacket and placed it around my shoulders.  

“There's going to be a next time?” I asked, nudging his arm.  A smirk twitched across his face.

“Do you want there to be?” he asked, handing me a fortune cookie.  I didn't answer.  I didn't need to.

There would indeed be a next time.  And a third time.  And a fourth time.  The fifth time I had dinner with Victor, we went back to his place together, and I learned exactly what those sculptor's hands of his were capable of.  The next morning, he made me breakfast and I spent the day in his studio, watching him work on some new pieces before he drove me home late in the evening.  Life was good, and for the most part it still is, but after our fifth date, things started happening that I will never be able to forget.
