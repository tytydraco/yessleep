Hello loves, I have another one for you tonight. And I still don’t know what happened.

To start My radio station WKCRP loves to involve our towns citizens — Making it more personal. Normally, I don’t do interviews, but Management wanted to punish me after I inadvertently started a union for the interns. 

Who keep going missing. 

My punishment: to go to Southend place, and interview the passengers travelling on the Crayford to New Christ night bus.

“Is this a punishment or an excuse to get me out of the station for the night” i thought.

Truth be told, I was excited. As a kid, I loved double-decker buses, always rushing to the top to watch the world below. . My favourite thing to do was look into people houses or balconies.

You can tell a lot about people by what they own and how they keep their environment.  And as the awkward kid, the outsider, the one who was always a little too smart, a little too observant—I made a habit of understanding people, even when they refused to understand me. I got really into understanding everyone else. Tangent aside. 

I got to the bus garage with my newly assigned intern Hannah. She was aggressively average in every possible way. Which, I suspect, was my real punishment. Not the task. No, the true suffering was being stuck with her. She spent the entire car ride gossiping about station staff—nothing I hadn’t already heard from the shadows that linger in the cracks of the studio.

Took me a while to make friends with them. Cost me my sight for a week—a trade of good will. The shadows hear, but they don’t see, so they asked if I’d lend them my eyes. I agreed. A fair deal, though inconvenient at the time. Now, they tell me everything.
 
But Hannah? Hannah was something else entirely. It wasn’t just the gossip. It wasn’t even her off-key screeching of Sabrina Carpenter songs, though that nearly sent me into a homicidal spiral, or her ego, thinking she was the universe’s greatest gift. No, that wasn’t enough. I had to listen all the unsolicited AO3  smut theories she thought about management. And how he looked at her.

Which is odd, seeing as he doesn’t have eyes. 

To much information wasn’t something Hannah seems to know especially when she decides to where those red boots of hers clicking her heels like she was Dorothy from the wizard of oz.

I physically had to restrain myself.

By the time we arrived, the depot was desolate. Not unusual. It was midnight, after all. The building itself was a sad excuse for a station—rotting wood, rusted metal, a place abandoned even by time. not like the depots in the city I use to live.

And, The town council wonders why citizens complain all the time. 

By the grace of the old gods, a bus finally arrived. 

“Are you ready for this interview!” Hannah smiled with glee “ I’ve never been on a bus before. “

I turned to look at her, aghast. “How? … you know what don’t answer that.”  quickly not wanting to be drained of patience. Knowing I’d probably hear about it on the way back to the studio. 

She rushed forward, about to knock on the bus driver’s window, but I pulled her back.

“What are you doing?” she protested.

“We have to wait.”

“Why?”

“Drivers get fifteen minutes between routes. Ten for a break, five to check the bus.”

“But all they’ve done is drive—”

I wanted to respond to her I wanted to go off on a rant about how ungrateful she was and that the only reason she was even interning at the station was because daddy made a deal with management —whom she had a crush on —that would help us go against the cult that was the OBC. 

But like luck always favoured the privileged or the universe didn’t want me to get into more trouble with management, I saw my favourite person. Mr. Shinzo.

As he exited the bus, hand raise head slightly bowed to me. A greeting. A silent thank-you.
Mr. Shinzo was a good man. Took the night shift so he could spend the day with his wife and animals. Sometimes, he called into my show during long, lonely drives. My program controller, Rhys, knew to put him through immediately, no matter what. Listeners loved it. Our night chats became so popular that once a month, we opened the lines for anyone to join, strangers connecting over the airwaves.
 
My favourite part of chatting with me Shinzo was the stories he would tell some about things he’d seen or experience on the road and the juicy ones about former residents of our town. I was glad to have him tonight.

I smiled. “Daijoubu desu ka?”

“Ahh, Daijoubu, Daijoubu.” I remember him responding, “yatto konya, kimi to ferī ga dekiru n da!”

“Could you speak in English?” Hannah interjected. “For the interview.”
We both turned to look at her.

“We’re here to interview the passengers, not Mr. Shinzo,” I reminded her, gritting my teeth. Oh, wanting to bitch slap her in that moment. 

We stepped on. I took my usual seat near the driver; Hannah, to my dismay, began searching for the best spot to get at her next victims.
 
Silence filled the bus as we set off. When we reached our first stop the doors to the bus opened . The first passenger to board was an old woman. Her clothes were traditional, but nondescript. She sat at the front, hands folded neatly in her lap, her gaze fixed ahead. Shinzo began to drive again. 

I just watched Hannah spring up to her, undeterred, approached her. 

“Hi, miss! I’m Hannah, and we—” she gestured at me “—are interviewing passengers on the night bus. Would you like to participate?”

Silence.

I continued chatting with Shinzo, discussing mundane things—cat-sitting, mostly.

Hannah realised she would get nothing from the woman turned to leave, the old woman spoke.

“ Do you want to hear a scary story?”

She was speaking to Hannah but staring at me. Her beady eyes and that smile— stretched too wide. innocent to the ignorant. But,  I knew better. 

“Sorry what did you say “ Hannah asked. 

Silence. Two minutes passed.

Then, again: “Do you want to hear a scary story?”

Hannah hesitated. “Um—”

Without prompt or response the old woman started. 

“On a dark and lonely night like this, a solitary bus on a mountain road not a soul on the bus traveling down its usual route. A girl is waiting at the bus stop the bus driver stops but no one gets on. He closes the door perplexed. and continues down the lonely road.

Suddenly, a small high pitched cry is let out.

“Let me off!”

We entered the old tunnel near Shoe Bridge. Darkness swallowed us for five seconds. No more.

And when the light returned—the old woman was gone.

But her voice remained.

“Let me off.”

Hannah screamed. As the light flooded back.

“ He looked in the rearview mirror, and there behind him… Is a doll sitting on the backseat.” 

“Let me off.” She Wining once more holding a life like doll. 

“You can stop now.“ I heard Hannah beg.

Finally the old woman looked at her dead in the eyes. 

“How about you would you like to hear a scary story?”

“Hannah why don’t we do your idea and have you interview the bus driver.” 

I could see Hannah was taken aback by me now calling Mr. Shinzo ’the bus driver’. Our town was privy to odd occurrence. And if being tapped here for gods knows how long has taught me anything it’s when  people you don’t know start acting weird you never say your name—or anyone’s name . 

We pulled to the next stop. More passengers boarded—a salaryman, a mother with a pram, two high schoolers. Normal people.
I took the old woman’s abandoned seat. Hannah sat behind me, still rattled.
Then, again, that voice: “Would you like to hear a scary story?”

Silence

Then, again: “Would you like to hear a scary story?”

The high schoolers, naive, said, “Sure.”
 
The bus lost control crashing into a ditch.

I remember Chaos. Screaming. Luckily no one was hurt just shaken. 
A cacophony of voices my own included rang out indistinguishable to tell who said what but… 

“ is everyone ok!”

“ What happened?”

“Who gave the Asian a licence?”

“Did we crash?”

“Of course we crashed you idiot”

“My baby!”

“Oh my god”

“Is everyone ok”

Checking on Shinzo. The doors opened, and we stumbled onto the roadside to see what had happened.

And Hannah, frantic, shrieked: “Where is she? WHERE IS THE OLD WOMAN?”

I searched the bus. Every row. Every seat.

Nothing.

She was gone.

When I re existed Shinzo emerged, something clutched in his palm—glass-like, but black as obsidian. Black ice. Cold enough to burn your skin.

“How? It’s spring.”

“I don’t know” he said. “ is everyone ok?”

“No major injuries. Just rattled nerves. But—“ throttling my sense of danger “The old woman… she’s gone. Vanished.”

An hour and a tire change later, we drove again.

I don’t know when I noticed it, but the baby— flies were drawn to it. if you got near her you smelt a putrid scent. 

Hannah was interviewing the mother. Patty. 
 
“ The accident scared me, the last accident I was in I lost my husband, Michael— almost lost this one” patty cuddled the bundle close “They thought she was stillborn but miraculously she’s alive.”

We reached the next stop finally and there at the stop— I saw her. 

The old woman. 

Waiting patiently.

I saw shinzos eyes in the rear view mirror looking for the answer to ‘what do I do?’

I mouthed: Drive.

We passed her. Then another stop. She was there. Another. Again.
Again. Again. Again. until Hannah screamed.

“Shouldn’t we …”

“ NO!” I answered cutting of the question.

The road seemed endless, but every mile or so a bus stop would appear and there she was just standing there. Smiling. Waiting.

Being the busy body Hannah had move on to her next victim. The salary man.

I had moved to the back of the bus looking back as we passed her again. By the tenth time, I was sick of seeing her face. So I walked to speak to Shinzo catching the tail end of the interview.

“My brothers Otto Heinz will be back soon and I need to get home, my brother needs to avoid loud places, so we are  going to drive to our father’s cabin instead.”

Hannah let out a“That’s so sweet.” And a chill ran up my spine. I remembered that’s story, I remembered what happened it was big news all over town. so much so the council had to bring in outsiders who would have never otherwise set foot here.

“Hannah come here.”  Softening my smile to whisper “when did he say his brother was getting out?”

“He got out at midnight which is odd right like Why would he be released so late tonight?”

I wasn’t really listening just responding to my own thoughts “ he killed a woman and cooked her “ 

“What! The brother.”

No longer hiding behind a smile.

“Otto Heinz had no brothers or family.“

without warning—the bus stopped. No longer on the side of the road, She stood in front of it. Smiling.

The doors opened . 

She stood in front of it. Smiling.

The doors opened.

Shinzo hadn’t touched them.

He was standing now, transfixed, his eyes glazed over.

The old woman stepped inside. The doors shut and the bus started driving again this time without a driver.

She turned to us.

“Do you want to hear a scary story?”

No one answered.

She just smiled.

Panicked I looked at the others to… I don’t know, get reassurance then I noticed the two high schoolers were gone. 

“Do you want to hear a scary story?”

No one answered.

“Once there was a bus —quite like this — on a desolate road, carrying 4 convicts. 

The first a mother who refused to let her child die, Fed it her own blood and flesh to keep its rotting corpse alive. 

Then, a man dressed in all black, ill-fitted in a suit and mismatched socks. He escaped his cell with a briefcase packed with a human head. 

Next, a girl so sweet and meek — this was all deceit. she was cruel, cold, bullying the young and old. One day she met her classmates on a rooftop covered with mold. She pushed them off one by one to gain ahold—a pair of shiny red boots. “

Hannah’s face twisted in rage. She lunged— the old woman vanished. 

Hannah’s momentum carried her forward, face smashing against a pole. A sickening crack. Blood dripped from her broken nose.

Her voice came from behind,

“And finally, the witch who never quite fit. She fell in love with a priest, gave him the kiss as she carved out his heart to escape into her own twisted bliss. But he didn’t die, did he.

All trapped on a bus binding their fate.”

“shut up you hag, this is my quota” a disembodied voice bellowed.

We turned to face her.

Empty.

The road had changed. A tunnel now at its end. Glowing bright red. 

The bus sped forward. Screams filled the air.

Then—nothing.

Just the light.

And then—

I don’t remember what happened just coming out on the other side. 

 When I came to, we were back at the bus garage. Shinzo and I.

Everyone else was gone.

All that remained were the pram, the briefcase, and Hannah’s red boots.

I stepped off the bus, dazed. Shinzo walked me to the car.

“What just happened?” I asked automatically. I remember blinking so hard against the morning sunlight.

Shinzo sighed. “Go home. Get some sleep. I’ll have Mizu drop Frank off on Sunday.” He paused. “You’re honest and true. A good friend.”

I just nodded. As I was about to get in the car. As he walked away, I heard him say 

“I hate that hag, always trying stealing my kills.“
