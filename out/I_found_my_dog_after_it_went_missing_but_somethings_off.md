My dog, **Bailey**, went missing a few days ago. I'd been out all day with my friend, bearing in mind I'm usually home the majority of the time due to being unable to work, so the dog is never alone, and usually if he is it's not for too long. I also live with my parents and brother, so a lot of the time there's at least one person in the house.

  
Monday, I had gotten home later than usual, my parents hadn't got home from work yet and my brother had left to stay at his girlfriends a little after I'd left. As usual I'd walked into the house shouting to Bailey that I was home. I walked into the kitchen to unlock his crate and let him out when my heart sunk. The crate door was wide open, I didn't panic straight away, I thought maybe my brother had forgotten to put him in his crate. Although deep down I knew that the cameras and alarm would have picked up any movement. 

  
It had been about 10 minutes after I got home when I realised that the back door was still open. I immediately rushed outside looking around the garden to see if Bailey was out there, but within seconds I realised a part of the fence was broken and he must have somehow squeezed through it.   
I ended up calling my parents, and then my brother who was adamant that he'd locked the backdoor and put the dog in his crate. Although, it wouldn't have been the first time he had forgotten to do so. I then ended up checking the cameras, that in my panic I completely forgot about.

  
This, however, freaked me out a bit. 

  
On the camera you could clearly see my brother putting Bailey in his crate, locking it, and then checking that all the doors and windows were closed. My heart sunk, I felt violently ill, the only other way he could have got out would have been if someone broke in. The thought bought up so many questions. How did they unlock the door? How was there nothing broken? Why didn't the camera movement notification go off? I forwarded the cameras to see if I could find who let him out and opened the door. Maybe my brother came back again? 

  
I got to one part in the recording and realised the dog was no longer in his crate, the door was wide open, as I had found it. I went back a bit, but the recording didn't seem to have picked up any movement between the time he was in his crate to when he was gone. Nothing had shown up on any of the other cameras either.

  
At this point everyone was absolutely heartbroken, we didn't think anymore of the weird situation and started asking around if anyone had seen him, we put up posters, posted things on social media. We were so determined to find him. I started getting nightmares after the first night he was gone, I'd often wake up in a cold sweat multiple times in the night, I couldn't stomach the awful images and thoughts surfacing in my head, about what could have happened to him. I have been so attached to this dog the moment we got him, to ever think that he wasn't going to come back... the thought was just unbearable. 

  
So, when we found him today, Thursday morning, I felt like I could actually breathe again. We were all so relieved to have him back. 

  
That was until now. 

  
Bailey had been off ever since we found him, but originally it was just brushed off because he'd never been away from us that long, and we thought it had obviously shaken him up a bit. My parents still keep saying that, but his eyes... they're not his eyes, they're not those cute innocent little puppy dog eyes. They're dark and cold and empty. And I know you could just say that it was from being alone outside for days but there's just something wrong and I know it. No one believes me, but that is not our dog. Bailey was playful and would cuddle up next to you and you'd feel so happy and loved, but this thing acts and pretends to be Bailey, but I swear it's not. 

  
The way it stares at me, like I'm some sort of prey. When it cuddles up next to me all I feel is cold. My anxiety feels at an all-time high, like the dog, the thing, right next to me is dangerous. It looks at me like it knows, it knows I know. 

  
I've ended up staying at my friend house for a few days, I just don't feel safe at home. I've been looking back on the cameras over and over and I swear I can see some kind of shadow. My friend said my brain is making it up because I want to see something, for some kind of explanation. Maybe she's right, but I don't know. I swear to you in the back of the garden, the same hour Bailey went missing, there's a face in the bushes, and it's not a human one. The figure is so hard to see but it looks lanky and on all 4s, and it's staring right at the camera, that figure is the same silhouette I can see on the kitchen floor on the camera after Bailey miraculously disappears. It's completely unnerving, I want to stop looking but I can't seem to pull my face away from the screen.

  
I don't what's going on, I just know that, that dog at home, if it even is one, is not Bailey, and I have a sinking feeling it'll do anything to make sure no one else finds out that itâ€™s not.
