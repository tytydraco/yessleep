The town I live in is dying, no doubt about it, but the tourists gobble it up. Is it because of all the interesting civil war history? No. It’s because of the legends of Wendigos throughout the area.



I can’t really seem to find an exact date for when the snipe hunt began, but it was around the early 2000’s. Supposedly some dude was attacked by one while going on a smoke break, which reignited a local legend about confederate troops partaking in cannibalism after a major win in the area. Ever since then all the gift shops are filled with stupid plastic figurines of the thing.



But, that's not important, at least not yet.



I was driving home from my job. It's a short drive, but it is very scenic, but something bolted in front of my car, killing it instantly. I didn’t get out. I knew I’d hit it, but I decided to let it die.



Later that night, there was a knock on the door. I looked out my top window to see my neighbor.



“Do you know what this is?” my neighbor said, handing me a phone with a video playing.



 The video had the animal letting out calls, begging for someone to put it out of its misery. “Also… this was this attached to the deer” the neighbor said, handing me a note, which had the word “WATCH” written hastily across it, like whoever wrote it was in a rush.



Below the ominous word was my address, written in the same rushed way.



“I… I don’t understand” I said, slowly backing up before shutting the door in my neighbor's face.



I couldn’t do it, if not for me being cowardly maybe I wouldn’t have had that attack happen to me.



I needed to get something out of my mind, and the best way to do that in my mind was alcohol. I headed out to my garage, my puppy following me. I got about one sip before I heard a faint sound of glass breaking from inside my home.



I slowly crept into my main home, and something instantly hit me. A painful, frigid temperature in the air, freezing my throat like drowning in snow. Then I saw it.



A large, shuffling creature, deer antlers, pool of blood at its feet. It turned around and let out a loud shriek before charging at me, fortunately, it missed me, but unfortunately, the charge coincided with my dog trotting up the stairs, so my precious puppy was no more.



“No… NO!” I screamed



The Wendigo consumed it all, it was short, quick, and sad.

I bolted toward the upstairs and shut the door to my room, hiding myself within it. I held the door shut for hours as the Wendigo punched in my door, shrieking loudly. I almost fell asleep, I was so exhausted. 



It’s been a month since then, and I’ve moved on. But therapy has been the only thing I really have to help me more. But, I think the town's legends are much more fact than fiction, but I learned that the hard way. I’ll never go hunting, fishing, or do anything to destroy nature. I hope you listen to me, because everybody else thinks I’m insane.
