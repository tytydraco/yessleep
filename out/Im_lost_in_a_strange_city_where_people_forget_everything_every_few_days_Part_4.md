**(8:58 AM - 10:00 AM)**

Well, today is yet another reset day — or, at least, it could be. I’d say there’s about a 45% chance it could be today, a 45% chance it could be tomorrow, and a 10% chance it could be the day after that.

Unfortunately, I don’t have the luxury of rolling that dice. I never do.

I despise reset days. On days like this, not only is everything I need to do twice as urgent if it’s at all reliant on the memory of others, but it’s also a time when I’m not allowed to take this device off of either the safety of my person or the safety of my hotel room after 5:00PM, unless of course I’m in the mood to risk dropping it when I pass out and someone taking it for themselves before I can get it back.

I checked my email again when I woke up this morning. Still nothing. I’ve stopped checking it at every hour of the day now, but I try to check every morning, afternoon, and when I go to bed at night. I probably won’t have the time today, but tomorrow, I’m going to finish drafting up that email to my Uncle and send it off. He’s my last big hope to get any contact with my family while I’m still here. I don’t know if he’ll even believe me. I don’t know if *anyone* will believe me, or if they’ll think it’s all just some big sick joke, but I have to try.

So far, I don’t have any comments on my latest post, either, but I have thought of something I really could have asked about yesterday at the archive. I could’ve asked about why all the buildings close after nightfall. Unfortunately, I don't think I can get another visit to the archive scheduled before the day is out, so I’m probably best off waiting until the reset has come and gone to think about asking for that — besides, I don’t want to look suspicious, trying to nose around the records every day. People might start to wonder.

It’s a shame reset day had to fall on a Friday this week. Tomorrow is my only day off, so it would’ve been the best time to schedule anything I wanted to do, but I guess that’s just the way life goes. Maybe I can at least take a carriage up north to the city where my grandparents were allegedly born and try to research that, take Sunday off from work, too, so I have extra time, if I don’t have any other plans by then. I hate feeling like I’m not making progress.

**(2:34 PM - 3:52 PM)**

Two hours off from the time when I have to retire this device to my pocket, I’m stopping here and there at lulls in the workflow to update you all a little and check for comments.

I do have a new comment on my last post (as well as one I apparently missed yesterday on my second post; thank you for that, by the way, I’ll make a mental note to answer you individually once I’m off work and have finished preparing this post for the night, provided I don’t get knocked out by then) which has quite a lot input on yesterday’s visit to the archives, suggesting that the reason the town is in this state could be because of some disaster that could still be causing the resets today. That…actually makes a lot of sense to me.

When I first got here, I did get the impression that everyone remembers everything’s happened prior to my arrival in this world, and the archive seems to suggest they remember a lot, but…maybe I’ve been looking at it wrong. Maybe I only think they remember because I don’t have any way of proving whether or not the events they remember before that time are really all that have happened. Maybe there’s even more that’s gone on that no one knows about. It’s at least worth considering. Maybe I should dig deeper into the history to see if there’s evidence anywhere of things once having been more advanced, or at least a clear point when technological progress seemed to come to a halt. There was that basement beneath my family’s house….is it possible that’s something left over from a previous era?

It‘s a lot to think about.

I’ll definitely look into the family histories of some of the people on record who disappeared like you suggested. I do wonder if what happened to them actually *is* somehow like my situation, too. Did they get sent to my world, like I’ve been sent to theirs? Are some of them walking around there with all of you, just trying to get back home? If that’s true, going home for me could be as simple as walking outside the city walls after nightfall. Still, I’d feel bad for them, since I don’t know how *I* got here. They might just be stuck there now, unless I can figure that out, too.

For anyone who might be wondering, no, Clayton hasn't stopped by the theater today to make up for missing his usual Thursday meal — at least, not so far. There’s still a little bit of time, since I’m writing this part at 3:32, and we still have a few hours before we close. I was asked in the comment I received to check on him, since he might be in danger. Honestly, I was thinking about that, myself. The trouble is, I don’t get off until after 6:00, and I still don’t know if the archives close after that, like most places here; they’re not exactly a business in the traditional sense of the word, so it *might* be an exception, but I really can’t be sure. If nothing else, I’m going to try. I know I said that I don’t want to stop by the archives this soon to look at records because I don’t want to draw suspicion, and I probably couldn't get it scheduled anyway, but I’m sure I can find some excuse to get in there for just a few minutes. Maybe I can convince them I forgot something.

If not, I don’t know what I’ll do. I don’t know where he lives. It could be there, or it could be somewhere else entirely.

**(7:49 PM - 10:20 PM)**

I’m back at the hotel for the day. Thankfully, the reset hasn’t hit yet. I don’t know when it’s going to happen, so I’ll try to keep this as brief as I can — though it’s only just now hitting me that I can’t post this for another 8 or so hours, and if the reset is going to happen today, it will have happened by then. Wonderful. Well, I suppose I might as well take my time with this and simply hope for the best. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll just be making this post twice as long tomorrow…

I went to the Archives as soon as I got off of work. Although I’m *not* completely convinced that anyone from this world could or would find this post and stir up any trouble, for the sake of plausible deniability, I’m just going to say that I borrowed something small from a nearby and convenient location and decided to use that as my hopeful ticket to entry, saying I’d accidentally taken it with me from the Archives yesterday after Clayton had allowed me to use it, and that I wanted to return it and apologize to him.

Honestly, I wasn’t sure an approach like that was even going to work. I didn’t even know if the building would be accessible by that time of night, but, apparently, for once in my life, I was in luck.

The same old woman greeted me at the door, and to my surprise, let me in without a single moment of hesitance once I’d made my case. (Her name is Margaret, by the way, if that matters to any of you; I did confirm that with her. Kind enough person, it seems, if you can get past her usually stiff and emotionless expression. I owe her thanks for tonight.)

She pointed me towards a row of shelves near the staircase and told me I could find Clayton there if I really needed to see him, though I was welcome to just leave the pen on the desk and she’d explain for me. Obviously, that wasn’t what I was really there for, though. I’d come there for Clayton, and I was going to see him.

Well, I have to tell you, it was quite a sight when I did. And not really in a good way, either.

In every interaction I’ve had with him, since the very first time he came into the theatre, Clayton has always been very well put together, well spoken and well dressed. Before I knew he was the head Archivist, and certainly before tonight’s conversations, I’d always assumed he was the sole heir to some wealthy family who was always so pleasant because he knew he didn’t have to worry about his future.

That’s why seeing him hunched over a stack of books with his head in hand, dressed like he’d slept in the same suit I’d seen him in yesterday and probably hadn’t used a brush since then, either, really…unnerved me. It was such a different side to him that it almost felt for a moment like he’d turned into someone else entirely.

I knew then, for sure, that you all were right. This wasn’t just embarrassment over an awkward conversation with someone who worked at a place he frequented. Something bigger was going on.

I remember very clearly the first thing he said to me, when he noticed me standing there. He looked up at me, and with the most hauntingly distressed eyes I think I’ll ever see in my entire life, he said: “Something’s wrong... I think you’re right, Michael, I think I *am* forgetting things. I think a lot of us are.”

You know, all along, I’ve been waiting for someone to notice — someone to finally acknowledge that these resets *are* happening, that I’m *not* going insane — but I never imagined that when it happened I would just be standing there speechless. I didn’t imagine how awful it would actually feel. Even now, I don’t know why it does. I should be happy about this, but I’m not.

I don’t even know exactly what was going through my head at that point. I think I was running on pure paranoid instinct. I’d asked him what he meant, but the minute he actually started to answer, I felt like we would all be in immediate danger, if we kept talking about this out in the open, so I asked him if he would come back to the hotel with me to discuss it instead. I was worried he was going to turn me down, but…he agreed. And that’s where we’ve been ever since I started writing this part of the post. 

We’ve been talking about a lot of things. Things about how he first started to realize something was off, about the resets, the forgetting, the strange rules here… I’ve been noting things down myself as we go along, and I’ve been having him write down a lot of what he’s saying, too, both for myself and to share in a post here with all of you. But the more I’ve been taking moments to write here, the more I’ve come to realize that I don’t want to be spending time doing this when any moment now the reset could hit, and I’m going to lose my chance to talk to the only person who seems to have any recognition of what’s going on here besides me — a person who very soon will forget that all of this ever even happened, and wake up back in his house just like everything is normal.

I have to go now. I’ll write out the more important details of our conversation in my next post. For now, I’m going to focus on getting those details in the first place. And then, when the time comes to post this, I will, if I’m still awake by then. We could get lucky and not have a reset until tomorrow. All I can do is hope.

**(8:17 AM - 8:27 AM)**

…Well, the reset happened less than a half hour after finishing that part of this post, so that hope was in vain. I didn’t wake up until just now, which means I missed the time I usually post, too.

I know I said I was going to maybe take off tomorrow and arrange to travel today to the other city if the reset happened, but honestly, I think I’m just going back to sleep for now after I post this. I have a lot on my mind. I’ll get back to you either tomorrow morning at the same time, or…I don’t know, I’ll figure it out. I’m wondering right now what the right thing to do is. Do I leave Clayton in his newfound blissful ignorance? Or do I tell him, show him, what we talked about last night? Will he be safer if he doesn’t know, or just more vulnerable?

I’ll have to think about it when I get up later. I’m tired.
