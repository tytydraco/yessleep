I had left my old healthcare lab tech job because they offered me a 1.5% raise after working through a pandemic and doing three peoples jobs, so I jumped on the first offer I could to get through the next few months. 


It was a night shift lab tech job, where they told me I would be alone in the lab, since the workload would be low. I would basically run a few tests on samples that came late, do maintenance, and run quantity control. 


Shockingly, nobody was there to greet me on my first night. They left a note instead.


Hey Matt! Welcome to (redacted) hospital lab! Here’s a quick list to get you started! 


1.) When reading gram stains, please mark down any bacteria you discover that seem to ‘glow’. 

2.) Any and all pathology samples should be placed in formalin, unless they are marked for special testing, or if they continue to move after separation from the patient. 

3.) Any traumas requesting ["Type C blood"](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/s/APgVAiO8Pp) from the blood bank are to be denied, and reported to management to follow up on the next day. 

4.) Stool samples that contain undigested body parts are to be run as normal, and do not need to be reported, unless those parts are still moving around.

5.) We do not accept samples from outside clinics after midnight, anyone insisting on delivering samples should be denied entry, and the police called.

6.) Blue urine samples are not unusual for this area, please run them normally and report any abnormal results. 

7.) Kidney stones are to be stored at room temperature, unless they hatch. In this case, the creature is to be stored in a freezer, and reported to day shift for dissection. 

8.) The local church sometimes will bring in pregnant women to give birth. The only part of this procedure that will impact the lab is if the infant is stillborn, in which case it must be disposed of by incineration after delivery to the lab. 

9.) Any and all accidental needle sticks must be reported to management, our small town has lots of unidentified pathogens, and we want to keep our staff as healthy as possible.

10.) Children are not allowed near the hospital since the incident. Any and all sightings of children should be repor-


I was cut off to a slam on the door. A frightened, pregnant woman stood outside, glancing back and forth desperately. 


“Please, help me,” she moaned, “don’t let them take me back, they’re-”


She was cut off as a group of robed figures grabbed her by the hair, dragging her down the hall and away from the lab. 


About twenty minutes later, a nurse handed me a container, containing a dead infant. Its skin was green and scaled, lids stuck open, revealing dark voids where the eyes should have been, and even though it was dead, I heard it crying. 


I grabbed my coat and left. 


Am I the asshole here? They say healthcare isn’t for everyone, but yeesh.
