I know it sounds crazy, but you read that correctly - I am from the future. Or, at least, a future. Hopefully not the only possible one.

You can call me Sven. I am - was - an American physicist. I earned my Ph.D. in 2037, and shortly thereafter I was accepted into NASA. My area of expertise was theoretical physics, but ever since childhood I had always wanted to be an astronaut. Even though I was likely to be stuck with a desk job for the rest of my life, I still made sure to keep myself in shape to reach the threshold of physical training required for space flight, just in case.

It's not like my job was boring, though. I was assigned to the Alcubierre Project - NASA's initiative to develop a faster - than - light, space - warping engine. It might sound like something out of science fiction, but the theory is well-known, even in your time (you can look it up if you're interested).

We never actually managed to build a working prototype, but that's not for lack of trying. In fact, we may very well have been able to eventually build one, if we hadn't made a different breakthrough during the course of our research. Science is funny like that sometimes - you spend years looking for one thing, only to stumble upon something else you never expected to find. In this case, we discovered how to build a device that came to be known as a "quantum dissociator" (I wasn't the one who named it, for what it's worth). The theory behind it is so complex that even I don't fully understand it, but if it worked like we predicted, it could allow us to build an engine that would make the Alcubierre warp drive look like a tricycle in comparison.

This technology would allow an object, and all of the quantum wave functions defining its existence, to become temporarily separated, or "unstuck", from the rest of the universe. The object could then reenter normal spacetime, theoretically at any point, and the trip would be instantaneous from the perspective of the object itself.

Most of us were skeptical at first, naturally. The idea that such a thing was even possible seemed incredibly far-fetched, but as we performed more experiments and built increasingly advanced prototypes, everything began to fall into place, with almost unnatural serendipity. Practical and theoretical barriers were overcome quickly, and soon we had a working model of what we had nicknamed the "Leap Drive". A moderately - sized nuclear reactor was more than enough to power it, and it could make a practically unlimited number of "leaps" with little to no recharge time. Animal experiments had shown no adverse effects on living tissue making the transit, and in April of 2043, I volunteered to become the first human to make a "leap".

I walked into a specially - prepared capsule sitting in a hangar in the JPL in California, and listened to mission control count down on my headset. When the count reached zero, I suddenly felt a dizziness and disorienting sensation, but it passed in seconds. I received an all clear message, and opened the door to the outside of the capsule - emerging in a completely different hangar, in a facility in upstate New York. I had traveled over 3000 kilometers in a fraction of a second too small to be measured.

After being kept under observation for a few weeks to see if any adverse symptoms developed, more tests were carried out, with similar successful results. There was only one real issue with the Leap Drive that needed to be solved before it could be employed for practical space travel and exploration.

Despite the drive's incredible ability to traverse unlimited distances instantaneously, Einstein's theory of general relativity still applied - and that meant that space and time were linked, and no meaningful information could truly travel faster than the speed of light without violating causality. And violating causality was exactly what the Leap Drive did. Over relatively short distances, like from California to New York, the effect was barely even noticeable, but the longer the distance traversed, the more out of sync with the present the traveler would become.

To better explain, let's say that, hypothetically, someone was observing the Earth from a distance of 2000 light-years away, using a powerful telescope. They would see the light that had left our planet 2000 years ago, during the time of the Roman Empire. If this observer also had a Leap Drive, and used it to travel directly to Earth, they would also arrive 2000 years ago - as that would be the frame of reference they were in due to their initial position. If they wanted to return to their point of origin, they would travel a further 2000 years into the past, ending up returning 4000 years before they left. The ability to alter the past and potentially create paradoxes was a major concern, so we tried to solve this issue before attempting any long - range leap experiments.

Our luck held, and we succeeded. It was impossible to fully eliminate the time differential caused by the Leap Drive, but, with the help of a state -  of - the - art quantum computer, we created a system that was capable of analyzing and compensating for it. The nature of the drive allowed it to travel into the future as well as the past, and by combining those two functions, this program would calculate the distance it leaped, and attempt to cancel out the time differential, arranging it so that it would arrive at its destination as close as possible to the time it left (using the reference frame of the origin point). So a leap of a light-year might only deposit the craft a fraction of a second in the past or future, instead of an entire year.

We performed more tests, and finally deployed an unmanned probe, equipped with a prototype Leap Drive, to the outer solar system. Less than five minutes after it left, it returned, its databanks filled with close-up pictures and information on Pluto, Eris, Sedna, and several comets it had been programmed to visit - something that would have taken a conventional space probe at least decades to accomplish.

For a longer - range mission, though, we insisted on using a crewed vehicle. There would be no way to communicate with Earth at those kinds of distances, and we couldn't rely on even our most sophisticated AI to make all of the necessary decisions in the face of the unknown, and adapt to whatever circumstances it might find itself in in deep space.

Around a year and over 80 billion dollars later, the Chronos was completed. Appropriately named for the Greek god of time, this vessel was over 200 meters long, equipped with a Leap Drive and quantum computer to synchronize it, heavy radiation shielding, and enough food and supplies to last a crew of 4 up to 8 months. It was also covered with the most advanced cameras, sensors, and other scientific instruments NASA had as of the year 2045.

I had advocated strongly to be part of the crew, and, somewhat to my surprise, NASA actually agreed. I was given the primary task of operating and troubleshooting the Leap Drive and its synchronization computer, as I had contributed significantly to their development. The captain, whom we'll call Evans, was a veteran astronaut, who had logged multiple stays on the ISS in the past. Our engineer, Vitar, was in charge of the maintenance and repair of the rest of the Chronos' systems, and a young woman by the name of Meadows was our astronomer, responsible for collecting and interpreting the scientific data gathered on our trip.

Our mission was relatively simple - after making a series of short leaps around the solar system to make sure the drive was functioning properly, we would visit Alpha Centauri, Barnard's star, and a few other nearby systems, before leaping to a main sequence star around 1200 light-years from Earth, which had recently been determined to be host to the best candidate yet discovered for an Earth-like exoplanet. Its mass, distance from its parent star, and atmospheric composition were so promising that some of us had even taken to calling it "Second Earth". If it turned out that it could support human life, then colony ships with Leap Drives of their own wouldn't be far behind us.

When the day of the launch finally arrived, I tried to act professionally, but on the inside I was as giddy as a schoolboy. I had trained in zero-g simulations for years, but now I was finally going to achieve my lifelong dream of going into space. Not only that, I was going to be one of the first 4 humans to ever leave the solar system! Neil Armstrong, eat your heart out.

The rest of the crew also had experience with short-range leaps as part of their training, so when we first engaged the drive, taking the Chronos from a hangar underground to several hundred kilometers above the Earth, we quickly recovered from the dizziness, and captain Evans began firing the ship's maneuvering thrusters to bring us into a stable orbit.

"Chronos, this is mission control, do you read? What is your status?" the radio blared to life.

"Roger, mission control, this is Chronos," Evans responded. He briefly turned his head to Vitar, who gave a nod as he read the indicators on his control panel. "All systems are nominal, we are now in geosynchronous orbit."

"Time differential is negligible," I added, looking at the readings from my own console. Over such a short distance, the quantum computer barely had to make any corrections in the first place.

"Acknowledged, Chronos," mission control replied. "Conduct full systems check and radio back when you're ready for your second leap."

"Roger," Evans replied, turning off the radio. He didn't need to tell the rest of us what to do - we all unstrapped ourselves from our seats and began to make our way through the zero-gravity environment. Despite how thoroughly the craft had been inspected on the ground, there still remained the possibility that there might be some flaw or malfunction that would only become obvious once we were in orbit. We spent several hours performing the tedious task of making sure that the Chronos was spaceworthy before returning to the cockpit and contacting ground control again.

"Control, this is Chronos. Inspection complete - we have found no abnormalities in any of our systems or equipment. Now preparing for second leap."

"Roger, Chronos," came the voice over the radio. "We'll contact you again once you achieve lunar orbit."

I began manipulating the computer interface, setting the controls to our next scheduled destination, roughly 200 kilometers from the near side of the Moon.

"Leap in 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0" a computerized voice counted down, and suddenly the light outside the windows shifted.

Quickly recovering from the disorienting effects of the leap, we now saw the cratered surface of Earth's moon below us, our home planet itself having receded to a relatively small disk in the sky.

We all took a few seconds to admire the view, one that only a few dozen people before us had ever experienced in person. Captain Evans was the first to snap out of it, as he switched on the radio again, after making sure that we were in a stable orbit.

"Control, this is Chronos. We have achieved lunar orbit. No problems so far."

"Time differential is still negligible," I added.

A second or so later, the familiar voice responded. "Roger Chronos, we are triangulating your position. Give us a few seconds and we should have you on scopes."

We waited while several Earth-based and orbital telescopes coordinated their searches to pinpoint our position above the Moon.

"Chronos, we have confirmed your location. How's the view way out there?"

"Beautiful, control," Evans grinned, letting his mask of professionalism slip a bit. Looking at the bright lunar surface below us, no one could blame him. "We'll make the next leap now, unless there's any reason to delay."

Another short pause, then "Roger, Chronos. Keep in mind that real-time communication will be impossible from now on, until the end of your mission. Good luck and godspeed."

Evans cut the connection, then I pulled up the navigation interface again, inputting the next destination, this time in orbit around Mars. In literally no time at all, we were above the red planet.

I had remembered watching the Mars landings back in 2035. At the time, there was nothing I wanted more than to be one of the astronauts making those first steps onto the Martian surface. As I gazed down at the red landscape, I still found it hard to believe that I was actually here.

Meadows pointed out a large dust storm forming in the northern hemisphere, and convinced us to stay in orbit for an hour or two to gather more readings, on both the storm and the planet in general. We were able to exchange a few messages with ground control too, since the radio lag was only a few minutes at this distance.

"You know, I was almost chosen to be on the crew of the first Mars lander," Evans said.

"We know, you've only told us that about a dozen times," Vitar rolled his eyes.

"Yeah, well now I'm kind of glad that I wasn't. Imagine spending 9 months cooped up in a tiny spacecraft just to get here, when only a few years later we'd have the Leap Drive."

"It sort of takes some of the mystique out of it, though," Meadows mused. "It's like space travel suddenly became too easy."

"Don't call it easy until we put this thing through its paces with the interstellar leaps," I said, continuing to monitor the drive settings and feedback for any abnormalities.

"We've got one more stop within the solar system first, and it's a doozy," said Evans, as he sent a message to control indicating that we were about to begin the countdown for our next leap. Not bothering to wait for a reply, he gave a nod and I started the computerized countdown again.

"Leap in 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0".

Another wave of dizziness, followed by a sudden pale blue light from the window to my right. Looking out the window, I could see the roiling clouds of Neptune below me, so close it felt like I could reach out and touch them if I wanted.

"Whoa, did we come in too close?" Vitar asked. "It looks like we're right on top of it."

Meadows laughed. "Neptune is very large. Believe it or not, we're about 3000 kilometers above the surface."

"And in a stable orbit too," Evans added. "Time sync?"

I quickly looked away from the mesmerizing sight of the ice giant planet and back to my computer monitor. "Ah... negative 5 seconds, roughly," I read from the display.

"That means we arrived here 5 seconds before we left Mars orbit... pretty weird to think about," Meadows muttered.

"Isn't that a bit too much of a margin of error?" Vitar asked. "We're only a few light-hours out. I thought we wouldn't be seeing lag like that until we left the solar system completely."

"Leaping is still a poorly-understood process. The computer can't always predict and compensate optimally," I reassured them, as I ran a software diagnostic. In just a few minutes, I found a variable that was probably responsible for the lag, and made a few adjustments. "There, that should minimize the relative time differential for further leaps," I announced.

"I was just thinking," Vitar said. "You know we're farther than any humans have ever been from Earth right now?"

"Where no one has gone before?" Meadows chuckled. I rolled my eyes at the pop-culture reference.

"We're about to go a whole lot further," Evans said, before he turned to face me. "Are you sure you got all the bugs worked out for the next leap?"

"As far as I can tell," I answered, double-checking my calculations.

"We should perform a few tests first before leaving the solar system," Meadows suggested. "Try a leap to the opposite side of Neptune, so we can image the entire surface. Then maybe we can get closer to Triton or some of the smaller moons."

Even though we were all eager to be the first interstellar travelers in history, we were still professionals, and saw the logic of her suggestion. After about an hour of making short leaps around the Neptunian system and gathering readings, we sent a tight-beam transmission with our findings to Earth, and it was now finally time to make the biggest leap yet.

"Proxima Centauri, here we come," Evans grinned, as I began the countdown.

"Hold on a second," Meadows said, before I could finish the initialization.

"What is it now?" Evans asked, seeming slightly annoyed that our trip had been delayed yet again.

"Instruments are picking up something, an unknown object a few million kilometers to port. Size, approximately 200 by 50 meters."

"What's so unusual about it?" I asked as I shut off the computerized countdown. "Probably just another one of Neptune's moons, too small to be detected from Earth."

"I don't think so," Meadows replied, adjusting the controls on the telescopes and sensors at her station to get better readings. "It's in a decaying orbit... it will hit Neptune's atmosphere in about 82 hours. And I'm ninety-nine percent sure that it wasn't here just a few minutes ago."

"A rogue asteroid?" Vitar suggested.

"Unlikely. Spectrometers are reading a mix of metallic elements that can't be natural... it's very similar to our own hull, in fact."

"Put it on screen" Evans ordered, now sounding somewhat uneasy.

The mysterious object filled the forward monitor, but at this distance, it was hard to make out any details. It appeared as a silverish, fuzzy blob, longer than it was wide, slowly tumbling end - over - end.

"Another ship?" I asked. "Did NASA send it to contact us?"

"Chronos is the only craft of that size equipped with a Leap Drive," Evans insisted. "This is something else."

We all paused for a moment to look at each other, the unstated implication hanging in the air. The possibility of encountering alien intelligence had been discussed during our mission briefing, but it was considered unlikely, especially while we were still within our own solar system.

"Make a short-range leap. Take us closer, so we can get a better idea of what we're dealing with," Evans ordered.

"Roger," I replied, as I entered new coordinates into the Leap Drive, aiming to put us a few hundred kilometers away from the mystery ship. I decided to skip the computerized countdown this time, and the familiar wave of dizziness and nausea arrived and passed just as quickly. Meadows immediately trained the ship's instruments on the object, now much closer.

"No way..." Vitar muttered, as the high-resolution image filled the monitor.

"That's... how is that possible?" Evans repeated, jaw slack.

I was too stunned to attempt a reply. On the monitor, drifting in space, was a near-identical copy of our own ship. The NASA insignia and mission patch, with the word "CHRONOS" emblazoned on the hull, were clearly visible.

"I thought they only built one Chronos," Meadows whispered.

"They did," Evans replied. "But look at it - it's taken some serious damage."

He was right. One of the doppelganger ship's solar panels was missing, looking as if it had been snapped off, and there were several dents and scratches all over the hull, and no signs of activity.

"Can we contact them?" I asked.

"I've been trying," Vitar replied, "but getting no response. It looks completely dead."

"How can there be another Chronos?" Meadows mused, looking equal parts frightened and intrigued.

"There isn't," I answered, finally voicing my conclusion. "It's the same one... it's us."

The rest of the crew looked at me, waiting for further clarification.

"The Leap Drive," I explained. "It must have malfunctioned somehow - taken the Chronos back into the past. It's the only thing that makes sense... what we're looking at is a future version of our own ship."

"But won't that cause a paradox? We were warned to avoid anything like that," Evans argued.

"The paradox has already happened... we're viewing our own future. There was nothing we could have done to avoid this."

"What happened to them - to us?" Meadows finally voiced the question that had been on all of our minds.

"This is way outside of our mission parameters," Evans said, trying to regain some control over the situation. "I suggest we leap back to Earth and ask for further instructions. We can still return in plenty of time before the second Chronos crashes into Neptune."

"What if they're still alive?" I asked. "Their ship is clearly damaged, they might not have much longer until their life support gives out completely. We have to dock and search for survivors."

"Rescue... ourselves?" Vitar asked. "But wait, if we return to Earth now, won't that change the events that led to this? Whatever happened in their past to get them into this situation won't happen anymore, so we'll be saving them - us - by just aborting the mission."

"If that were the case, then we would never have run into them in the first place," I mumbled.

"This time travel stuff is giving me a headache," Evans grumbled. "But if there's a chance that there are living people on that ship, we can't just leave them. Leap us closer so we can initiate docking maneuvers."

"What if there's some kind of danger or contagion aboard?" Meadows pointed out. "Maybe they picked up an alien virus or something from Second Earth - we could be exposing ourselves to it."

"We'll wear environmental suits," Evans replied. "And when we return we can eject the used suits out of the airlock, if it makes you feel better."

We said nothing as my hands flew over the keyboard, programming another leap, this one only a few kilometers from the second Chronos. We could now see it clearly out the windows with our naked eyes.

"Come on, let's suit up," Evans said, as he unbuckled his seatbelt and pushed himself off of his chair, drifting through the zero-gravity environment to the rear of the command deck.

"Call it a cliche, but I have a really bad feeling about this..." Vitar muttered.
