I think we all know sleep is important, but that doesn’t mean we all agree about it. How much should we get? Should you sleep in pajamas, underwear, nude? TV on or off? Hope or cold? I mean, we can’t even agree on if we like it or not! 

Personally, I like sleeping. More specifically I like dreaming. I love seeing what my brain can come up with, and if we’re being really honest my life isn’t exactly as pleasant or interesting as the dreams I have. Sure I’ve had plenty of “nightmares” too- murderers, abductions, monsters and the like. I just don’t feel afraid in my dreams for some reason? 

I mean, I’ve once dreamt of having a drill slowly pushed into my head by these demonic creatures from hell, chasing me with fingertips lined in saws and scratching at my flesh while I ran… but not once was I scared. I did wake up with my skin stinging and a mild headache, but that sorta thing happened a lot. I \*felt\* my dreams a lot- or maybe what I felt influenced my dreams? Who knows.

Anyways, this isn’t about my dreams or my sleep really. It’s about what happens when I \*don’t sleep.\* For starters, I’ve got ADHD, and while I’m unmedicated it means things like coffee don’t really keep me up like that. Hell, I used to drink it to make myself ready for bed when I was younger. 

What \*has\* always kept me up though is sinking myself into something interesting. A new video game, an obsessive Wikipedia search, writing an essay I was excited to share, or even reading a particularly thrilling book. You know how it goes though- wake up, have a full day, get ready for bed but you’re not ready yet. So, you stay up a little bit, and next thing you know the sun’s come up. 

That’s how easy it is, \*that’s how you stay up for your first 24 hours.\* From there you can’t really go to bed though, or I guess you could but it’d have to be a weekend or else you’d jeopardize your sleep schedule the rest of the week. It’s one thing to haven’t had slept, but it’s an even worse thing to have barely slept at all. 

So I always elect to stay up, and that’s when it starts to get weird. By lunch it’s usually been \*about 32 hours\*, give-or-take, and that’s when they start. In the corner of my eyes I’ll start to see glimpses of things. Like a shadow moving just out of sight, or a small glint of bright light only to see nothing there. It’s a common visual hallucination, even for people who aren’t sleep-deprived. 

There’s also the noises. Subtle at first too- a friend’s voice being startling loud when they start to talk, or a pencil hitting the floor sounding for a second like it was metal instead of wood, or a small bump now sounds like a door slamming somewhere far off. These hallucinations start slow- maybe 1-3 an hour at most, and that’s combining the audio and the visual. 

It’s also around here the exhaustion hits, a big slump. It’s odd, it’s always when it’s the brightest out that you get tired- not when it’s dark. No, later when it’s dark it’s \*starting to approach 40 hours\* or so. Now’s when you should’ve gone to sleep the day before, except you’re still awake. What’s even stranger is… you’re not tired. I never am anyways. I’m wide-awake. 

It’s strange being up in the middle of the night, alone, when everyone is asleep. It’s even somewhat thrilling if you’re that sleep deprived though. The hallucinations are stronger by now. Small glimpses become full movements. A stray hair in the corner of your vision looks like a curling tendril for just a second. Or a gust of wind outside sounds like a garbage truck driving past.

Actually, it’s about this point that I notice a very specific hallucination. It’s always the same, and sometimes it comes earlier in the day, but always at night it’s the sound of a dinner party in the next room over. Low and hushed chatter, clinking plates and glasses, and this vague but whimsical jazz playing. I’ve never been to any sort of party like that myself, but it’s unmistakeable. I could close my eyes and see exactly what that room would look like, almost like it was out of the 20’s itself. 

Then there’s the tactile hallucinations. These are… less comforting. Random itches will crop-up, only to disappear the moment you graze them. You’ll feel the brush of hair on your ankles, wrists, and neck every so often- only to swat at them and feel nothing there. Very rarely, and I do mean rarely, you’ll feel a firm \*poke\* or \*tap\* on the shoulder or arm. 

Obviously nothing is there, but by this point these things become frequent enough to be a distraction. They start to occur once every 10 minutes or so, and in random ways. By time morning arrives it’s officially been \*48 hours\* and it only ramps up. 

Here is where things get scary… the hallucinations, they’re just that- hallucinations. What gets scary is everything else. You stop being tired. Actually, you feel kind of amazing? More awake than before. More acutely aware of everything around you than before. Food tastes better, light looks brighter, and even a beam of a cold winter sun feels warmer on the skin. 

Sure the hallucinations continue, and they do ramp-up, but… it’s wonderful. It’s like the same level of vividness you could only experience in a dream. The world stops feeling real then, and people start to feel… off. It’s like when you’re watching a movie, and you’re right there connecting with the characters, and the next thing you know you realize “you’re not real, why do I care?” That immediate hollow detachment hits. 

So yes, the world is beautiful and you feel great, but you stop caring about people- no… you stop relating to them is more accurate, you stop feeling like a person. I’m… I’m not sure how to describe this next bit. Usually by lunchtime it’s around \*hour 56\* and that’s where things start to get genuinely scary. 

By now the hallucinations are more real than before. A man stares at you from the corner, and when you turn your head to confront him you realize it’s a coat rack. You don’t see the crosswalk light change until you’ve almost stepped out into traffic. The sound of your own voice becomes foreign to you. It feels like somebody is always bumping into you, grabbing you, or nudging you. 

They’re constant now. One every few minutes, at the very least that many, and they’ve started to overlap. A girl in front of you tosses her hair while your shoe squeaks? Congrats, you’ve just hallucinated birds flying at your face. You get jumpy, and sensitive, and everything is almost too much and yet not enough. 

I’d usually get home around \*hour 60\* or so, alone in my house and get constantly surrounded my noise. That damn dinner party is louder, there’s constant sounds around you that aren’t real- snippets of shows, conversations, songs. It’s not overwhelming or bad or even unpleasant, it’s just… it’s there. 

I’m… I’m ashamed to admit I’ve never made it past \*hour 63\*. That’s my personal best anyways. It’s not because I got tired or anything either, no. Actually, it’s because I got scared. The scariest part isn’t that you hallucinate, or that your mind is a wreck- it’s that \*it feels so good\*. It feels so much better than normal life. It feels exactly like when you wake up in the morning and want nothing more than to stay asleep. It feels like the times when my dream feels better than reality, when staying asleep is better than waking up. 

It becomes a challenge to go to sleep. Melatonin, Benadryl, NyQuil- none of them work at this point, I’ve tried. I once read that approaching 72 hours of no sleep puts you at immediate risk of a cardiovascular event- namely a heart attack. I believe it. I believe it in the same way they say you can feel so much joy, or laughter, or pleasure that you die from a heart attack too. 

 You start to feel… lost. Like you’re slipping into a dream, except the dream is you being awake. The only way I’ve found that works for me is to listen to that jazz in the distance. I close my eyes, find the music through all the sound, and focus. I listen to the music, the conversation, and ignore everything else. Eventually, I open my eyes and I’ve slept. 

I used to want to push my record. It’s true. That jazz used to come sooner too, around hour 24 at first. I kept pushing my limits though, more and more… I lied when I said I hadn’t made it past hour 63. One time I made it to \*hour 64\* and it was then that the music just… stopped. It vanished. I couldn’t find it anymore. I couldn’t sleep without it though either. 

I looked up music online frantically, I needed it to sleep, I needed to sleep. I needed to wake up from this waking dream by going to sleep. I think I must’ve given myself a panic attack because I don’t even remember going to bed. I remember freaking out, clawing at the touching all over, plugging my ears as best I could… I woke up 17 hours later groggy. 

That was the last time I stayed up. I’m too scared to do it again. So whatever you take away from all of this- don’t stay up too late, and just go to bed.
