The old diesel truck coughed loudly before falling completely silent, parked next to the tool shed. The engine had a life of its own, just like the house’s power generator, which had already failed three times that week. "It's a gas guzzler," Dad used to say. We always kept a can of gasoline next to the outdoor cabinet — an emergency measure we knew we’d eventually need. Life out there was like that: patched together, fragile, but functional — at least most of the time.

The night before, the usual calm of the farm was broken by the frantic barking of the dogs. Dad, used to small intrusions by wild animals, grabbed his shotgun and walked out with heavy steps. I followed, carrying a flashlight. "Stay behind me," he ordered, his eyes fixed on the darkness.

The dogs were circling the pigpen, their bodies tense as if facing something invisible. There was a metallic smell in the air — a mix of blood and damp earth. As we got closer, we saw the scene: one of the pigs was dead, thrown against the broken fence. Its skin had been torn off in patches, exposing its ribs. The eyes seemed to have been gouged out.

"Cougar," Dad said, but the word came out hesitant. I looked at him, noticing the doubt in his voice. "Was it a cougar, Dad?" I asked, my eyes wide. He didn’t answer right away. He inspected the surroundings, but there were no tracks, no clear signs of a struggle.

Back inside, he reinforced the door locks and muttered to himself, "Just an animal. I'll take care of it tomorrow." But deep down, something was bothering him. That strange smell, the silence that took over the forest after the barking stopped — it was as if the woods themselves were too scared to breathe.

That night, I had trouble sleeping. I woke up twice, swearing I heard something scratching at the wood outside. The second time, I tried to ignore it, but an inexplicable chill ran down my spine.

Dad didn’t sleep either. He stayed in the living room, shotgun within reach, listening to the generator’s intermittent hum outside. When the machine failed for the third time, he almost went to check it, but changed his mind. "In the morning," he thought, as if making an empty promise.

He had no idea that dawn would bring more than just a simple generator repair. Something was lurking out there — something that wasn’t a cougar, or anything he could face alone.

And it was just getting started.

The sun had barely risen when Dad went out. I followed, dragging my feet, still heavy from lack of sleep. The smell of the dead pig already filled the air — sour and nauseating. The fence was still broken, and the chickens wouldn’t stop clucking, restless, as if something was still prowling nearby.

"Go get the tarp from the shed," Dad told me, holding the flashlight. I hesitated, glancing at the forest around us, but obeyed. When I came back with the tarp, he had already dragged the pig out of the pen, trying to ignore the animal’s gruesome state.

The body was almost unrecognizable. The claw marks were deep and distorted, as if the creature that attacked it had inhuman strength. Dad tried to rationalize it. "It was a cougar. It had to be a cougar." But the absence of tracks and the mysterious silence from the day before still unsettled him.

We wrapped the pig in the tarp and dragged it to a hole near the back fence where Dad usually buried dead animals. The work was slow and unpleasant, and even the crows that usually hovered around stayed away, as if sensing danger.

"Done. It's over," Dad said, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. But he knew he was lying.

The rest of the day was filled with an uncomfortable silence. I tried to keep up with daily chores, but the tension in the air was palpable. "Dad, are you going to leave the fence like that?" I asked late in the afternoon, but he just shook his head.

"I'll take care of it tomorrow. I'll check the generator before dark," he replied, grabbing his tools from the shed. He spent the whole afternoon trying to get the damn motor running properly, but the problem seemed bigger than he thought. The gas can next to the cabinet remained untouched, but every time he passed by it, a strange unease climbed up his spine.

The sun began to set, painting the sky blood-red, and the tension on the farm only grew. I brought the dogs closer to the house and locked up the pigpen. "Dad, can we go to bed early tonight?" I asked as the lights started to flicker.

"Yeah, we are," he replied. But Dad had no intention of sleeping. Something inside him screamed that the night would bring worse problems than a broken generator.

While we were having dinner, the dogs started barking again. This time, it wasn’t just a warning — it was pure terror. Dad stood up, grabbed his shotgun, and looked at me. "Stay inside."
"But what about you, Dad?" I asked, clutching his arm tightly.
"I'll be right back. I just need to see what it is."

But deep down, he knew he wasn’t ready for what awaited him outside. The night was alive, breathing through the house like a beast stalking its prey. And it hadn’t shown its teeth yet.

When he went out, the sight was horrifying: two of the dogs were dead, their bodies twisted at impossible angles, as if crushed by something monstrous. The third was barking at the darkness but suddenly fell silent, letting out a final agonized yelp before being dragged into the woods.

Dad smelled it. It wasn’t just blood — it was something deeper, like rotten flesh mixed with sulfur. He pointed his flashlight at the trees, and what he saw made his blood run cold: glowing yellow eyes, burning like embers.

"Who's there?!" he shouted, his voice betraying his fear. The answer came as a guttural growl, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. Then, a figure emerged. It wasn’t a man, nor an animal. It was something in between, with deformed muscles and black fur that seemed to pulse. Its long, filthy claws gleamed under the weak beam of the flashlight.

The creature lunged with impossible speed. Dad fired. The shot echoed through the night, but the monster didn’t stop. The impact only seemed to enrage it. It knocked him to the ground with a brutal blow, his shotgun flying out of reach. As he tried to get up, he saw the creature tearing into one of the dogs like it was just a snack.

Inside the house, I heard my father's screams and started praying, but I knew prayers wouldn’t be enough. I grabbed the machete Dad kept behind the door, my heart pounding as heavy footsteps approached.

The door burst inward, and the creature entered, its eyes locked onto me. I screamed, terrified, but didn’t back down. As the monster lunged, I swung with all my strength, striking its face. A horrible howl filled the air, but the machete got stuck in its thick flesh.

Dad, wounded, crawled to the door and saw the scene: I was struggling while the monster gripped my arm, lifting me like a rag doll. "Let go of my daughter, you bastard!" Dad grabbed the gasoline can with trembling hands and doused the creature before striking a match.

The fire engulfed the monster, which thrashed in agony, dropping me. The smell of burning flesh was nauseating, but even in flames, the creature didn’t die. With a final roar, it ran into the woods, disappearing into the darkness.

We survived, but we didn’t come out unscathed. My father lost his right arm that night, and I was left with scars that will never fade. Despite everything, we decided to stay on the farm. We reinforced the fences, took turns keeping watch, and always kept our weapons close.

But the howl of that creature still echoes in my nightmares. I know it’s not dead.
I know one day it will come back to finish what it started.
And all we can do is be ready to face it.
