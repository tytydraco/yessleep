Everyone knows *The Flintstones,* the 1960 Hanna-Barbera cartoon about a family of cavemen. I'd watched that too, but also what the show was inspired by. I'm getting old and can no longer keep this secret anymore. 

Back in the 50's, there was a secret kept from the American public about a series of scientific experiments based on anthropology. After the Second World War, the Americans, as well as the Soviets as I am told, raced to advance in all forms of science, not just in cosmology. In the US, we had developed a piece of tech which allowed for an entire organism to form from a single strand of DNA. The scientists tried it on animals. First on a rat, then a cow, and after many tries, the extinct Dodo bird. A year after the Dodo was brought to life, it perished of a mysterious illness. My Dad told this to me, handing me a photograph of the bird which as since been mysteriously misplaced.

Now, onto 'The Flintstones'. The Flintstones was the nickname given to the family of Neanderthals Dad and the other scientists kept at a nature facility. There was a giant barrier of one-way glass which surrounded a lush, green forest. Some of the trees had cameras placed high above so we could see them. We observed them using those cameras as if they were television screens (Color TV hadn't been come around yet, and so everything I saw was black and white). So, when my parents took me to see 'The Flinstones', this was what they meant.

I was very little when I went to see them. I went to observe them twice every month as a treat from my parents. I remember sitting in front of a small TV screen and marvelled as I watched a real caveman run across the forest floor. Another scene I recall vividly was when I saw a group of three take down a wolf the scientists had put inside the forest. I would laugh every time I saw them.

The scientists nicknamed one of them 'Fred', and the codename for the experiment was 'The Flintstones'. That was all I could remember, and so when I saw the cartoon I instantly linked the cartoon with the experiments. My theory is that perhaps one of the producers of the cartoon had a friend who was involved in one of the experiments, but I'm not so sure. Even then, I don't put any blame on the cartoons' creators for any involvement in the experiments. It might really have been a coincidence.

Eventually, something happened. Something which I still think about today. One evening, I overheard my parents talking about the experiments. My Dad had been saying that he could no longer continue research because he felt it was unethical. The truth was that Fred was dying of the same illness that had befallen the Dodo. Soon, the rest of his family had caught it and were dying. Dad refused to show me the footage and my parents never took me to watch them ever again.
