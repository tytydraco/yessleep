Part 1: Why are you running?

It was a humid day, and the sun was starting to set, creating a beautiful pink and orange hue in the sky above. Johnathan, an 18 year old high school student that bullies others, was walking down the old, kinda damp, dirt road through the deep, dense, and dark forest to his house, being late again from being held back in detention. “Ugh, stupid school making me stay back” he said to himself “can’t believe I have to walk out here at 7 pm.” Minutes later, he heard sudden rustling in the bushes, making him jump and look in the direction of the sound and saw… a harmless rabbit. He groans and kicks the rabbit-making it squeak-cruelly as he mutters “stupid rabbit” and continues walking on. He continues walking for a while, then he notices something off. “That’s strange…” he murmured to himself, confused “this path feels longer than usual today…” Then, Johnathan hears another sudden rustling in the bushes, looks over, and sees two rabbit ears poking out of the bush. “Another rabbit?” he grumbled, annoyed, as he went over to kick it away. Suddenly, a man in a light gray hoodie stands up, holding the rabbit in his hands, which were covered in black gloves. The man lets the rabbit go, then turns to face Johnathan. “Who are you?” Johnathan choked out in fear, sweating, but the man said nothing. After what felt like hours of staring intensely at each other, the man finally says “Hello, Johnathan” and starts laughing. 

“W-what? How do you know my name? Leave me alone!” Johnathan yelled as he threw a punch                 at the man. The man caught his fist, pulled out a machete seemingly from nowhere, and cut his hand off, blood splattering on both of them. Johnathan screamed as the man laughed maniacally, a distorted, disturbing laugh, and Johnathan ran down the path. The man screamed “Why are you running away, Johnny? Why are you running away?!” and Johnathan heard the man’s thundering footsteps come after him as he yelled back 

“Leave me alone! Please!” 

“You shouldn’t have thrown yourself down the rabbit hole!”

Johnathan looks back briefly, seeing the man’s bulging, bloodshot eyes, and upon seeing them, Johnathan screams and runs faster. Eventually, he sees his house lights, shining with brightness and hope. He runs inside and slams the door behind him, but sees that there’s no objects or people inside. “Mom! Dad!” he yelled “Where are you?! Where is everything?!” but to no answer. 

  


Then he heard tapping at the window. He slowly turned to the window and saw the man, who had a pearly white grin on, pointing at a gravestone, in Johnathan’s lawn, one he’s never seen before. He screamed. The gravestone had his mother’s name on it. Johnathan runs to his bedroom, locking the door behind him. He cried and trembled in his room as he heard the window break, and footsteps walking through the house.

“Johnny…” the distorted voice of the man called out “Where are you? I just wanna play…” Suddenly, a blade bursts through the door, making a humongous crack in it, and the blade pulls back out as the man looks through the crack and yells “Here’s PsychoFreak!” as he continues chopping through the door. Johnathan screams as the man finishes breaking through the door. 

“Please!” Johnathan pleaded 

“Don’t kill me! I don’t want to die!”

“No one wants to die” the man said “but unfortunately for them-and for you-death is a process of life.” and as the man said this, he dropped his machete, put his hand in his own mouth, then pulled out a bat “any last words?”

“no, no n-!”

crack.

And then there was silence.

  


Johnathan wakes up at home, his head covered in bandages,

“What the…” Johnathan murmured, looking down at his hand, seeing one is also covered in bandages. He then heard a creak outside his door and immediately tensed, calling out “Who’s there?!” After a few seconds, Johnathan’s dad walks in. “Dad?” Johnathan asked, confused, “Why is my head covered in bandages? And my hand?” 

“Don’t you remember, son?” his dad replied “You hit your head after slipping in some mud and hitting your head on a block of concrete, and you had lost your hand for a while, after the accident with the wood chipper.”

“Why can’t I remember that?”

“The doctor said you might have partial amnesia. You've been out for a few days.”

Johnathan stared at his hands for a while, then looked back at his dad and asked “Where’s mom?”

Johnathan’s dad’s face immediately darkened “You’re mother… she passed, remember? a few months ago. Died of cardiac arrest.”

Johnathan teared up “No… no… I had a terrible dream, dad, I was walking home, and a strange man chased me, and he showed me mom’s grave, and-an-”

His dad hugged him “Don’t worry, it was only a dream. There are no strange men here. It’s only you and me… Johnny.”

Johnathan’s eyes widened. His dad never called him ‘Johnny’

His dad started laughing manically and gripped Johnathan tighter as Johnathan’s heart pounded in his chest, beating so loud he thought his dad could hear it. He yelled “No! No! Dad, let me go! Please! 

“I ain't your father no more” his dad said, still laughing “I’m a Psycho now”

Johnathan struggled and screamed “I thought it was a dream! I thought it wa-”

That’s when a sharp pain came through his back, and he fell back.

Before he passed out, through his blurry vision, Johnathan looked into his father’s eyes, and what stared back were the same, bulging, bloodshot eyes of the man in his dream.

And then the world went dark.

  
Part 2: The man at the top of the stairs

Amelia was a 36 year old British single mother in a high paying job.

One night, while writing an essay on her computer, She heard her daughter, Amy, call out to her.

“Mummy!” Amy said, staring up the stairs.

“Yes dear?” Amelia said, wondering why she staring up the stairs

“There’s a man on top of the stairs.”

Amelia immediately jumped up and exclaimed “WHAT?!” then ran and looked up the stairs

There was nothing there.

Of course, just another prank by her mischievous little crumpet.

“Now why would you go on and scare me like that?” Amelia asked, heart racing yet slightly amused

Amy just giggled mischievously and ran back to her room, probably to play with her toys.

Amelia sighed “That girl is going to give me a heart attack one of these days” and went back to her computer and continued typing.



Later, she got up and went to watch her daughter play with her dolls.

“What are you doing, dear?” Amelia asked

“Missus Buttercup and Sir Twiddledinks are having a tea party!”

“Where’s your teapot?”

“It’s on the top shelf… I can’t reach it! Can you get it for me, Mummy?”

“Of course, dear.” Amelia said, grabbing the teapot and giving it to Amy.

“Thank you Mummy!” Amy said while pouring tea for her dolls

“You’re welcome sweetie.” Amelia replied as she left the room and went back to her computer.



Hours later, she heard a thump on the top of the stairs.

“Amy!” she called out

Then a voice came next to her. “Yes, Mummy?”

Amelia nearly jumped out of her skin

“JESUS!” Amelia exclaimed “Amy? How’d you get down here so fast?”

“What?” Amy asked “What are you talking about, Mummy? I've been down here the whole time.”

that sent shivers down Amelia’s spine as she swiftly got up and said “Stay right here, dear.” as she went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, then walked to the bottom of the stairs.

She looked up the stairs.

Nothing there.

She started ascending the stairs slowly, the sound of the soft creaking of the floorboard under her shoe reaching her ears.

Another thud.

She reached the top of the stairs and looked around.

Still nothing.

Another thud.

It sounded as if it was everywhere yet nowhere.

She checked the bathroom.

Nothing.

Another thud.

She checked the bedroom.

Still nothing.

Yet another thud.

She checked the playroom.

This time the thud was behind her

“Mu-”

Amelia swiftly turned around

and plunged the knife into her daughter’s head.

The world went quiet as she realized what she did.

Her daughter fell to the ground.

Amelia fell to her knees and cried.

She heard footsteps next to her.

She looked up and saw a man with a pearly white smile and a bat.

She screamed and ran down the stairs, though they kept going and going.

She didn’t stop running down them anyways.

She could hear the man following her.

She kept running.

And running.

Amelia looked behind her and saw the man with the same smile plastered on his face.

She kept running until finally she saw a gun on a step.

She grabbed it and fired at the man.

He didn’t stop walking no matter how many holes went into his body or head.

She stopped, stared at the gun, put it to her own head and fired.



The next day, police arrived.

“What happened here?” the investigator asked

“Suicide, we believe.” The officer responded

“Any reason for that?”

“We, uh, did come here months ago. Her daughter Amy went missing.”

“Has anyone found her daughter yet?”

“They haven’t.”

They didn’t pay attention to the daughter’s drawings.

Why would they? Just innocent drawings.

Of a man at the top of the stairs.

They didn’t hear the screams of a little girl under the staircase.

Because there were none.

Because under the staircase, lies a skeleton of a young girl.

She had been there for months.

She was killed by her mom.

And now no one will find her remains.
