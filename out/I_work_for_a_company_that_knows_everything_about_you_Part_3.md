I needed a change of clothes. My blood had soaked into my white button-up, turning it shades of pink and deep red. I looked like I had just risen from the dead, which was fitting because I strangely felt full of life.

I felt a kind of joy I hadn't felt in such a long time. That childish joy when you find out school is canceled because of snow or that joy you feel when you finally get something you've wanted for months. It was extremely misplaced. I was at a loss as to how I could feel so free in such a terrible situation. I can't describe how overjoyed I felt when I opened the front doors leading into the parking lot. The air outside filled my lungs, it felt new, it felt clean, and it was refreshing. Was it always this way? I spent a long time taking it all in before a new feeling came and took over with an urgency I couldn't ignore. I grabbed my mouth as I realized the feeling was ready to spill out of me all over the concrete. My body hunched over next to a small bed of flowers now ruined by me.

Many of you advised me to refrain from going to the hospital. I probably have a concussion and against my body's warnings, I agree with you. Time is of the essence here. Your best friend doesn't just body press your head into the floor for no good reason right? 

I looked at the Christmas card for a moment trying to focus my eyes on the text again which was growing incredibly difficult.

A long time ago I learned to keep at least an extra T-shirt in my car in case of emergencies like getting stuck in a surprise rain storm with no umbrella or something of that nature. I fought to get my damp blood-soaked shirt off of my body. It was like I was peeling off a second set of skin. It clung to my arms as I tried pulling it off and I felt so tired I had to take breaks. When I finally got it off and slipped my T-shirt on I sat in the driver's seat of my car and looked at my head in the rear view mirror. I looked pretty bad. Dry blood ran across my forehead and was intermingled in my hair. I couldn't see the wound but felt around and it felt like it wasn't bleeding much anymore but it was still definitely exposed and tender to the touch. It couldn't be seen but I didn't have a way to get the blood off of me, without a shower. But I had a baseball cap. I slowly lowered the cap onto my head, scraping my head wound in the process turning my insides some more. I looked at myself again and smiled, determining whether I looked deranged. A small chuckle slipped out and quickly turned into a tear-jerking laugh. I don't pass for normal in the slightest. I look shadier than I did with the bloody shirt on, but I laughed anyway. I enjoyed the site of myself laughing like I'd never seen myself laugh before. I felt insane, I felt so different and I had no idea why.

I tried to drive, Tried to take a right, drifted far left, and rolled up on a nearby curb.

I shouldn't have tried to drive. I dug through my cupholder where I kept random change and took all the quarters out then headed for the nearest bus stop.

I waited alone for a while before the bus arrived. I took my time getting on to the bus making sure not to skip a step. I must’ve been taking too long to get on because the bus driver was glaring at me. I avoided eye contact and lowered the brim of my cap. 

 “How much is it t—” 

“two-fifty” He quickly cut me off.

 I pulled a handful of quarters out of my pocket, dropping some on the floor. “Oh sorry I—” 

Tap, tap, tap

He tapped on the farebox. I got down to pick up my change and as I stood back up a bit of relief washed over me. The bus was mostly empty, just a dingy-looking man sleeping, a tired woman in a suit, and two kids listening to rap music way too lou—TAP, TAP, TAP—it hurt my head. “Hey! Two-fifty, come on man we gotta go.” I looked down at my hand and started trying to count the change but I was finding it immensely difficult t—the lights were burning my eyes, and the music was splitting my brain apart. Everything was clouded in a tiny white mist. I—screeching— The bus jerked forward before I threw all my change into the farebox giving up on counting. I caught myself grabbing a balance bar. The kids laughed, and I smiled, but they didn't. I made my way to the back of the bus and took a seat. 

I tried to zone out my surroundings. The world around me was overwhelming. Closing my eyes I tried to ease my ever-growing headache. Taking deep breaths to ease this strange sense of anxiety I had. I felt like I was being wa—it's quiet now—I opened my eyes. They all looked away. 

The kids cut their music back on to a new song and the tired woman opened a book.

But the sleeping man was no longer sleeping… He was staring at me. His full body turned around staring at me. He winked at me. I looked down to ignore hi—“SHUT THAT SHIT OFF!” he shot up to his feet and marched over to the kids. “I said shut that fucking shit off!” He then snatches their Bluetooth speaker and starts to smash it against some seats. It explodes into pieces in his hands. One of the kids hails the bus to stop. When it does they run off the bus wearing an expression of anger and fear. He just kept on smashing it. Over, and over, and over, and over, an—I felt happy—a calmness came over me with every piece that flew off of the speaker. I watched as the woman annoyingly packed her book back into her bag and exited the bus. Over, and over, and over, and

 “Do you want to try?” He appeared next to me, his eyes egging me on. The remains of the speaker in his hand. 

“Here, give it a try. You look like you've had one hell of a day. I'll even hold your cap.”

He holds out his other hand. I sat there for a second confused but still compelled to take the speaker. I slid off my cap and fresh blood rushed down my forehead. My wound opened up again. 

He takes it. Tries it on. It fits him well.

“Go on. Give that thing a swing.”

I hesitated looking over at the bus driver who was just staring straight through the rearview mirror. I half-heartedly swung the speaker into the metal balance bar. Not even a dent. 

“Come on man. What the fuck was that? Swing that thing!” 

\-drip- 

I put a little more into it, but still, no pieces come off of it. 

“I said fucking smash it! We don't have all day!”

\-drip- 

I swing, harder this time, breaking off small pieces from the speaker. 

“Harder!” 

\-drip- 

I swing

“I said Harder!” 

\-drip- 

I swing harder. 

“FUCKING DESTROY IT!” 

—Blood pours down our faces— 

My heart races. I throw the speaker onto the floor and start to smash it into a corner of the bus. It felt… good.

I felt alive.

Something inside of me broke loose. A repressed anger was now free leaving behind only bliss. 

I couldn't stop myself, I didn't want to stop myself, I just wanted to be—Screeching— 

“Sir, This is the last stop, it's time to go!” I open my eyes. I'm sitting in the back of the bus alone. I went to wipe my forehead but hit the brim of my cap.

“Hello! This is the last stop you have to get off the bus!” Was I… I look up at the driver who is shooting daggers at me in his rearview mirror. I heard you shouldn't sleep with a concussion. I stand and make my way to the exit at the front of the bus. 

I pass the pieces of the destroyed speaker on the way out.
