When I was younger, I used to help my papa plant his vegetable garden. I came out every morning to water them, it was my little job. Papa liked having something to bond over. I remember the way he patted my shoulder and told me I had done a good job when the first tomato appeared. My older brother and I picked them when they were ready and we made a salad. I didn’t like it very much but it was fun to cook (with papa’s help of course). From that day on, my brother joined the vegetable garden ritual. 

Very soon I became obsessed with the garden. I was fascinated with the idea that the plants grew when we weren’t looking. The garden was conveniently placed behind my bedroom so every night I started looking at the plants to see if they would magically grow when nobody was there. Nothing ever happened, but I still enjoyed looking. 

One night was different. I looked out of my window to see the vegetable garden and instead of watching the garden I saw a man. He had long black hair and wouldn’t stop smiling. As soon as I opened the curtain and saw him he looked up at me, his smile somehow grew. He waved. 

I shut the curtain immediately. My legs couldn’t stop shaking and I struggled to remain standing. I shouted for papa.
“What is it my boy?”
“There was a man, a man waved from the garden!”
My papa opened the curtains and saw nothing. He ruffled my hair.
“It’s all in that imaginative head of yours.”
He smiled. I wished he would stop smiling. 

I stopped opening the curtains at night until one night, it was as though I had no choice. I walked over to the curtain, I knew I was waking but I didn’t want to. When I opened the curtains the man was there again. He was standing closer to the window and this time held up a big note.

“You should have waved.”

I tried to close the curtains but his eyes wouldn’t let me. I watched my brother cling onto the back door, but some supernatural power pulled him away. I heard the screams, I heard his tears and yet I couldn’t move nor could I should. He was screaming for help. The man’s smile grew and he took my brother’s hand. 

At this point I was crying and screaming for papa but papa never came. The man led my brother away from the garden and into the woods. My brother was clawing at the man’s arm, doing everything to get free and yet nothing worked. 

They turned around before walking into the trees. My brother looked at me, as if he was giving one last cry for help. I was locked into place. The man waved. They left for the forest, one in charge and the other fighting to be freed. I never saw them again. 

Papa’s never let me outside after that incident. I’ve been locked in my room, I’ve lost count of the days though it’s been a few years. He doesn’t want to lose me too. I can’t take it anymore. Now I just sit on my bed and wave at the now barred window in hopes he sees.
