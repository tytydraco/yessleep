My family have always lived in the countryside, but we moved to a bigger house because the previous owner was getting impatient for it to be sold, so he crashed the price. This new house was in a pretty deep part of the forest, and I read that Native Americans lived in this area about 14,000 years ago.           A couple months after we moved in, I decided to explore the forest. I never really found anything interesting, until one day. I went further in the forest then I have ever been before. I found an old, dilapidated, log cabin. I would have went in the house the same day I discovered it, but I had no necessities on me at the time.
I came back to the house after 2 days with a Swiss army knife, about 1 liter of water, and a thick jacket. I noticed some candle holders that were sunken into the ground. Oddly enough, one of the candles looked like it had been recently lit, with some wax that seemed to have run off. I entered the house, and everything seemed normal.
That is, until I saw something that stuck out. There was an attic to this house. I was afraid to enter the attic, but I entered anyways. Once I got to the attic, I saw something horrifying. It was a terrible effigy with the legs of a goat, antlers of a buck, but the most horrible part was the torso of a human. I threw up at the smell in this room, and passed out.
 I don't know how long I was asleep for, but I immediately ran out of the cabin, even though it was dark out. I could roughly make out new markings on the trees- it seemed to be symbols, but I couldn't understand them. I got back to my home and it was then that I noticed I was bleeding at my chest. I was bleeding because i had a symbol that looked the same as the ones in the trees on my chest. 

I took a shower and fell asleep until the morning. My family told me that they're going to the store, but I told them that I wouldn't be going. I spent most of the day inside on my phone, but every now and then I saw something dart across the yard. I finally put up my phone when I heard a loud, bellowing screech outside. 
It wasn't like any other animal I had heard in the woods. I opened my blinds to find a horrifying creature about 20 feet away. It looked similar to the effigy I saw earlier except  this creature had a hood over where it's head was supposed to be. It looked at me and I saw its eyes, but no head. Just an empty black void. 
It screeched one more time before returning back to the woods, and it shook the ground with every step. I told my family over the phone that I would be moving out immediately.
