 We decided to take a late-night walk in the woods. 

We were made to do that after a bet with some friends. It was me, my friend Millie, and my dog Loui. We were told to go to this forest in our local area, they said some weird shit happens there. Like some people go there at night and never return. They wanted to see if those rumours were true or not, so they made a bet to us that we were to go there and see if we come back in one piece, and then we would tell them what happened, they also told me to bring my dog Loui because they thought he would be useful for whatever may be in these woods. 

Once we drove there, we could already tell we were in for a treat. It was 11pm once we got there, and This place looks like a picture you would find when looking up a creepy forest on the internet. While we were walking, we were not expecting it to be this cold at night, I should have checked the temperature before going out. But Loui does not mind though, dogs are lucky to have a fur coat. 

We have been here for ten minutes, and we have not found anything unusual, that was until we heard something. A sound of something big stepping on some sticks. This caught Loui's attention and ran towards where the sounds he heard might have been. We tried chasing after him, but we lost track of him and had no idea where he went. 

We have been looking for Loui for an hour now. We have been calling his name many times but to no effect. Then we heard distant barking that sounded like Loui. me and Millie ran towards the barking. As we got closer the barking stopped. 

We found Loui. 

But he was lying limp on the grassy floor bleeding and covered in scratches. he was barely breathing. That barking was not him. 

In the distance, was something neither human nor animal. 

It was around ten feet tall; it was skinny with human looking skin and its face looked like a wolf’s skull.  

It looked straight at us and started walking towards us.  

Millie grabbed Loui and we ran faster than we did in our lives. We got into the car and drove off. the back seats were covered in blood, but as much as Loui tried to stay strong during the amount of pain he was in, he sadly did not make it. 

  
 

**AFTERMATH.** 

  
 

Loui is buried in my garden, and we told our parents that he was attacked by a bear, because they would probably not believe what we saw that night. when we saw our friends, we also did not say anything other than Loui being attacked by a bear and dying. That creature has been stuck in my head for months now. And all I can see in my head at night is just that thing, and staring at me with its dark, hollow eyes.
