Nobody tells you how hard it is to look after a parent. Is this how they felt looking after us, all those years ago? Attention being demanded in the dead of night, meals that ought to be eaten, discarded like trash. And to think our parents did all of this for us with a smile on their face. That must be love. I did my best every day for my dad. When I got home from work I tirelessly cooked, cleaned, and cared for him. But still, he’s been getting worse. You might not have noticed if you only saw him once or twice a day, But I noticed. Rare conversations and small sentences here and there became silence. Smiles became slack jaws. Walking was a thing of the past. Unblinking eyes only faced one direction. Three weeks of this made me wonder if he was still happy. Did he even know what happiness was anymore?

Three children have gone missing in the last two weeks. One of them, just a block away from Annie's house. Something unheard of in our town. Two of them went missing when they wandered too far from their parents, and another was stolen right from his bed. Missing flyers went up like a storm. Thousands and thousands were printed in a matter of days. Every pinboard in every building was overwhelmed by flyers. Each child fought for the lead position on the boards. Every home was given multiple sheets of the same child. Desperate parents handed out flyers in the streets like candy. Since each disappearance, our town hasn’t talked about anything else. You couldn’t get their poor little faces out of your head if you tried.

Since the first child was snatched at the park, our local church sent out missionaries, going from door to door, handing out flyers, and using the opportunity to convert anyone who would listen. It’s hard to be rude to someone holding the faces of missing children.

“Have you got a minute to talk about the Church of Christ?” The missionary handed me another poster of the last kid to disappear.

“No. I’m sorry, I’m busy at the moment.” And I was. I could hear the water boiling over in the kitchen.

“I won’t keep you long, sir. I think it’s really important to talk about faith, what with these children going missing recently.” He looked down at a picture of one of the kids. Nice guilt trip. 

“Okay, come in, but it’ll have to be quick because I’m making dinner.” Truth be told I had no interest in joining the church, but I didn’t know how to say no to people. He rattled off a whole spiel, undoubtedly written on a sheet in his pocket. I tuned most of it out until dinner was ready.

“I’m sorry to cut you off but my dinner’s ready and I still need to feed my dad.”

“Oh? Where is your father? I haven’t heard anyone else since I came in.” He was challenging my excuse. I bit my tongue and tried not to be rude.

“He has dementia. He’s not fit to be up and about.”

“I understand. My dad had dementia too.” I loosened up. That was the first real thing he’d said to me. The missionary turned to leave and I realised I hadn’t caught his name.

“Brother Adam.” I shook his hand and smiled.

Annie came over to visit today. She brought a pot of soup for both me and Dad. I knew my father wouldn’t eat it but thanked her anyway. She had barely been in the house for five minutes when she noticed a horrible smell coming from the garage. I don’t know how I hadn’t noticed it sooner, but when you were close to the door you could smell something rotten. Something dead. Neither of us opted to go in there. Our stomachs churned just being near the door. We chalked it up to whatever animal had been in my house before. It must’ve gotten in and not been able to get out again. I didn’t handle decomposing corpses well, so I decided I’d call an exterminator in the morning and let him deal with it.

Evening rolled around and I was busy changing my dad’s sheets when I heard a wet, lip-smacking noise coming from downstairs. I followed the noise and found my father in the kitchen, in a resting squat position, hunched over an empty packet of mince. He turned his head to look at me, baring his sharp teeth. I stumbled backward, unsure what to do, adrenaline took hold of my body.

I made a dash for the closest door to me. Slamming the garage door behind me and barricading it with an industrial shelf, I quickly began to choke on the smell of death. It overwhelmed my lungs to the point I considered turning back. The grotesque *slap slap slap* of my father's bare feet carried him closer to the door at an impossible speed. How could this be real? How could any of it be real? The footsteps halted. He was on the other side of the door. I could hear him sniffing under the bottom. He knew I was there. My hyperventilating caused me to breathe in the putrid smell of death, which in turn made me feel like I couldn’t breathe.

The sniffing stopped after a few minutes and gave way to the sound of dripping behind me. Little droplets landing in a puddle. I looked around for the source. It was coming from behind my old car. It was so dark that I had to crawl around on all fours cautiously. *Maybe there was a burst pipe*, I hoped in vain. I stopped when the palm of my hand dipped into something wet. I raised my hand close to my face and squinted my eyes, barely able to see without the lights on. Blood. My hand was covered in blood.

I looked up and saw my father's nurse lying on the trunk of the car. Her head hung off the side, exposing her torn jugular. I must’ve gone into some sort of catatonic state because I didn’t hear the shelf in front of the door getting knocked aside. The light wasn’t the only thing that entered. I just stared at her lifeless face for what seemed like hours. It was my whole world for those few moments. I came back around when the nurse's body began getting tugged away from the other side of the car. She disappeared from view, followed by a thud.

Those children… the nurse… the animal in my house… I peered around the back of the car. My father's head peeked out. His muzzle had extended far beyond a normal human's, bearing his fangs. His nose had been pulled halfway down his snout. His skin had stretched and pulled taught into the point at the end of his maw. Small cuts and tears opened his skin around his mouth and nose. While I looked on, disturbed beyond measure I could see his snout visibly growing, his skin still stretching like an inflating balloon. I could hear the skin tearing in real-time. His head darted back behind the car.

A rustling noise came from the other side. Slowly, I crawled around the back of the car. I saw my father on all fours, dragging a piece of tarp off the shelf with his teeth and crudely covering the body. He nuzzled the nurse's arm underneath the tarp.

“D- Dad?” was all I could muster. His head snapped onto me. His eyes burned into me, and then they fell to the floor. He looked sad. My father scampered away into the darkness of the house. So many feelings flooded my head it was hard to tell what I was feeling at all.

I climbed to my feet and cautiously walked into the house, praying my dad wasn't there. I couldn’t hear anything. I walked into the living room and saw the window hanging open, the curtain blowing in the wind.

Throughout the night I did my best to dispose of the nurse's body. The whole situation was ludicrous. I still couldn't wrap my head around what was happening, but I knew it wouldn’t look good if I left the dead body of my father's nurse in the house. And I absolutely couldn't blame it on my Alzheimer-ridden dad. I wrapped the body in a tarp, which is harder than it sounds. (Especially because rigor mortis had already started to set in.) It took a few hours to dig a hole big enough. I managed to dump the body in the hole and fill it in by 11 AM. I didn't bother going to work because I knew I was fired. Instead, I spent the afternoon cleaning the mess in the garage.

I was just in time burying the corpse too, because the police arrived today. They asked if I knew anything about the nurse's disappearance. I told them I didn’t and it was made clear I wasn’t on their high priority list. They gave me their card in case I heard anything and then left. On their way out, one of the officers asked me about the motion mat placed at the front door. I nearly choked when I heard the question but managed to spit out an answer.

“It’s for- It *was* for my dad. He passed away recently.” Perhaps he would be better off that way now. I felt like a horrible son for saying that, but maybe it’s true.

I stared out the window into the darkness while doing the dishes, thinking about the time my dad washed our dog in the sink. He was a small pomeranian and hated bath time. It was made worse for him especially, when my dad accidentally put the hot water on full blast, giving our dog quite the scare. (Don’t worry he was okay!) I find myself reminiscing a lot these days. It was one of the only things besides Annie that made me smile now. My daydreaming was violently interrupted when I stepped on something sharp and hard. I thought it was another tooth until I picked it up. A fingernail. There was another one lying next to it. And another behind me. I must’ve found about eight. Both fingernails and toenails. They weren’t there before. Weirdly, I wasn’t as surprised as you’d think. My mind was so numb to the whole situation that I just picked them up and put them in the bin. My dad must still be near.

It’s been six days since I last saw my dad. He visits me every night. I can hear him in the halls of my home, roaming on all fours. When I opened my door to see him, there was nobody there. If it weren’t for the pieces of him left behind in the morning, I’d've thought I was imagining it. Usually, there’s a clump of hair or a fingernail. Today, there was a clump of hair lying on the living room carpet, with part of his scalp still attached. I don’t know what to do. I hope he’s not in pain. I stay inside now, all day, every day. I think a part of me still wants to see my dad one last time.

Brother Adam stopped by earlier today. He handed me another flyer, the same one as last week. This time when I looked at it I felt a surge of guilt wash over my body. My skin went cold.

“The reason I came by again today was to ask you how your father was getting on. It can’t be easy for you. I know it wasn’t for me.”

“I’m hanging in there.” I lied.

“May I see your father?” Brother Adam asked.

“No!” I answered too quickly. “He’s sleeping at the moment.”

“I’ll only be a minute.” He compromised.

“No, he’s not fit for visitors at the moment.” I’d never been good at lying but for being put on the spot, I didn’t think I was doing too badly.

“Well, which is it?” Brother Adam smiled.

“What?” I said.

“Is he asleep, or not fit for visitors?” Touche. He saw right through my lie but didn’t seem angry or upset.

“Look, I’m really busy at the moment, I’m sorry. You’ll need to leave. Perhaps another time.” I ushered him out the door and hoped I’d never see him again. My dad hasn’t visited me in a few nights now. Is it weird that I hope he’s okay?

Over the next two days, I tried to distract myself with the garden work. I still had to clean the garden and get rid of the smell which had attached itself to the plants. I spent my day doing chores around the house and surprisingly felt better when they were done. It took nearly the entire day, but I got everything back to normal again. Then came a knock on the door. It was the same two officers from before. They came inside and asked me some repeat questions.

“Have you seen or heard from your father's nurse?”

“Have you been contacted by anyone who may know her?”

“Was she into anything strange? Drugs, loan sharks, etcetera.” Then they asked some new questions.

“What happened to your hands?”

“Digging.” I said as I looked down and felt my palm with my thumb.

“What were you digging?” The officer asked. His expression seemed serious. I knew if they had something I would already be at the police station, but keeping it together was still hard. I pointed to my backyard.

“My septic tank stopped working, so rather than call someone out, I thought I would save the money.” Liar. Septic tank? What were you thinking? Nobody around here has a septic. We’re connected to the main line.

“Right. Well, that should sum up our questions for today, sorry to bother you again.” The officers exchanged a brief look at each other as I showed them to the front door. One of the officers, Sergeant Stone, stopped and looked down at the motion mat.

“How long ago did you say your dad passed away?”

“About a month now.” Liar.

“So if that’s the case, how come his nurse was still visiting until a couple of weeks ago?” My heart was suddenly in my throat. I choked on it.

“Uh- we were friends. She would often come over and we would share stories of my dad.”

“According to Conscience For Caring, the company she worked for, she was coming here on official business. On the clock.”

“Weird.” I struggled not to squeak the sentence. The officers left, and once I watched them drive away, I collapsed crying on the floor.

The next day when I woke up, there was no sign my father had been in the house last night. There were no ‘pieces’ and nothing out of place. For a brief moment, I felt like a small weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I visited Annie later on, we spent most of the day relaxing and watching movies. It helped take my mind off things. I never told her about any of the things that had been happening recently. She didn’t know about the cops, I told her my father had passed away and that I was made redundant. She, of course, was very sympathetic towards me, just for the wrong reasons. She tried her best to cheer me up, watching my favorite movies, making my favorite meals, and… you get the gist.

When I got home, I was barely in the door for ten minutes when there was a knock. It was the police, I could just feel it. They’d found something damning and had come to arrest me. I struggled to make it to the front door, my knees were jelly. I shakingly put my hand on the doorknob and twisted.

“Howdy friendo! I just came to check in on you. How’s your father doing today? How are you doing?” Goddamn missionary. He stepped into the house and walked past me into the living room. Before I could tell him to leave, the bible was being presented to me.

“I’ve thought long and hard about this, I think both you and your father would benefit from accepting our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into your lives.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Was all of that before just a ploy to get me into the church? Was it all just a goddamn scam?

“The power of Christ is made perfect in weakness.” I grit my teeth and clenched my fist. I wanted to tell him to fuck off and never come back. Before the words could escape my mouth, a familiar beeping came from the back door behind Brother Adam.

Just behind Brother Adam, I saw my father. Not as I remembered him, however. He slunk on all fours, slowly creeping across the living room. He was abominable. His skin, full of cuts and tears where the flesh had stretched far beyond its limits. His snout, fully formed and his hair was all but gone. What remained was patchy and coarse. His fangs were at least an inch or two long. His arm and leg joints had twisted and contorted to allow him to walk properly on all fours. His heels stretched up to his ankles and his ears had completely shriveled off, leaving behind two dark holes in the side of his head.

“What – What is that thing?” Brother Adam shrieked. He ran up the stairs with me hot on his heels.

“Wait!” I yelled. “Please just wait!” I barely managed to get into my own bedroom before he slammed the door.

“A demon! Was that a demon?” He sobbed. Brother Adam pulled out his phone. “I’m calling the cops. They can help us.” He stared at the door, trembling. I stood behind him. I pictured the police coming to my house, shooting my dad. Finding the body. I couldn’t let that happen. Something inside me snapped. Before I had time to think it over, the base of my table lamp collided with his temple. The first hit knocked him to the floor. The second hit fractured his skull. The third hit broke it. The fourth marked an end to the carnage. I kneeled over the missionary. My hands were drenched in blood. A thick layer coated my face. I dropped the lamp and opened my bedroom door. My father was gone.
