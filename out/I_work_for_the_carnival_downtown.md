For the first time in my adult life, I’m not broke.

I can finally afford to live, not just survive. I buy the things I want, eat more than instant noodles, and even live in my own apartment. It’s nothing glamorous, just a small one-bedroom on the edge of town, but it’s mine. No roommates. No crashing on someone’s couch. Just mine.

I eat out whenever I feel like it. No more counting pennies or skipping meals to make rent. For the first time in years, I feel stable. Content, even.

But that was before I learned the truth. Before I figured out why they pay me so much for so little work.

My job isn’t difficult. It’s almost laughably easy. Supervise the games, smile at customers, and collect my paycheck at the end of the month. That’s it.

But now I know. That money isn’t for the work I do.

It’s for my silence.

The carnival opened a few years ago and quickly became the talk of the town. People come from neighboring cities just to visit. My job is to manage one of the games: the Sword in the Stone. You’ve probably seen something like it before. A sword, embedded in a stone pedestal, waiting for someone to pull it out and be crowned “the chosen one.”

What they don’t know is that the game is rigged. A mechanism inside the stone decides who wins. When I first started, I thought I’d be the one to trigger it, choosing winners at random. But that was a lie.

My real job is simpler: keep the game running smoothly. Smile, keep the crowd happy, and ensure there’s no chaos when someone pulls the sword. That’s all. I don’t control the mechanism. I don’t decide who “wins.”

But recently, something changed.

I started noticing missing person posters around town. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Cities like this always have their fair share of disappearances, right?

Then I saw her face.

She was beautiful, hard not to notice someone like her. I remembered her because she’d pulled the sword just a few weeks ago. She’d been a winner. One of the “chosen ones.”

And now, she’s gone.

That’s when it hit me.

I started looking closer at the posters, connecting the dots. Every single face belonged to someone who had pulled the sword. Every single one.

My stomach churned as I stood in front of those posters, bile rising in my throat. My hands trembled as I pulled out my phone and dialed the police.

I let it ring.

And then… I hung up.

I walked past the posters, past their staring faces, swallowing the guilt threatening to crush me. I didn’t stop until I was home.

My home.

The home this job gave me.

Before this, I was living like a beggar, crashing on couches and scraping by with part-time jobs that paid next to nothing. This job saved me. It gave me a chance to start over.

Should I give that up? Should I throw it all away?

And what if they come after me? What if they decide I need to disappear too?

Now I understand why my coworkers smile that strange, knowing smile every time they crown a winner. Why my boss pats me on the back and says, “Good job,” when I bring in more customers.

And now, I understand the chilling phrase they always say when someone pulls the sword:

“Another one for the buyer.”

I hate myself for knowing. I hate myself for staying quiet. But I’m trapped.

If I speak up, they’ll come for me. I’ll lose everything I’ve built, and I don’t even know if I could return to the life I had before or if I would even survive to live it.

But if I stay…

If I stay, I’ll keep watching. I’ll keep seeing people disappear, knowing I didn’t do anything to stop it. Their faces already haunt me. How much longer before I can’t even look at myself in the mirror?

So tell me, what should I do?

Should I stay silent? Should I go to the police? Should I run?

I don’t think I can keep pretending much longer. It’s not just paranoia anymore... they are [watching.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/)
