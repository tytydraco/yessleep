This happened a couple of weeks ago, and things have gotten so much worse since then.

For context, my names Tracy, (22F) and I live with my roommate, Dan (23M)

I woke up around midnight a couple weeks ago, and sauntered into the kitchen to raid the refrigerator, when I heard a "hey" from the couch behind me. I was taken aback because I swore I was alone, but Dan was sitting there on the couch of the living room, nursing a glass of wine.

"Me and Veronica broke up today" he told me.

"Oh...really?" I tried to hide my excitement as my stomach began to fill with butterflies. I'd had a crush on Dan for a long time, but he had been in a relationship with Veronica for the last 5 years. It was always weird to me that they hadn't moved in together yet, although I would never complain about it.

"Yeah, I just found out she's been cheating on me for months, if not longer" Dan said gulping down his glass of wine before pouring another.

"I'm so sorry, do you want to talk about it?" I asked.

"Not really, I want to do something to take my mind off of it, do you want to watch a movie or something?" Dan said staring up at me with a sad puppy dog kind of look.

I had to work super early but I couldn't say no, I poured myself a glass of wine, plopped down next to Dan on the couch and fired up *A nightmare on elm street.*

We were about halfway through the movie when we finished the bottle of wine and I went to the fridge to get another. I looked behind me while I was bent over in the fridge fishing for a second bottle and thought I saw Dan checking me out. He had a weird, cold, mannequin-esque look on this face, like he was sizing me up.
His expression melted back to his old comfortable smile almost in a flash when he caught me looking back at him though, so I couldn't be sure.

I cracked the bottle open and poured us another glass, I could feel myself getting a bit drunk as I sat down on the couch and Dan cozied right up to me and put an arm around my shoulder.

Everything starts to get a bit hazy for me around here, I remember looking over into Dan's eyes and... just feeling lost, like I was hypnotized or something.

I don't know who started it, but we began to make out, and eventually had sex. I laid sprawled out on the couch in pure ecstasy afterwards as Dan excused himself to the bathroom. It only felt like I had been laying there for 5 minutes, but when I looked up at the clock it was almost 3am, Dan would have been in the washroom for almost an hour. 

I started to get concerned and got up to check on him when I heard a key turning in the door of the apartment, I froze as... Dan stumbled in.

"No way! You're still up?! I have some great news!!" He said.

I was flabbergasted, I probably stood there slack jawed as he told me about how he and Veronica were now engaged and he would be moving out and into a new place with her.

"Is this a fucking joke?" I asked him. "You just went to the washroom after we..."

I trailed off as Dan looked at me with concern. 

"Are you feeling ok? Maybe you just had some dream?"

I felt like I was going to faint, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer and went to open the bathroom door, it was unlocked and the door swung open to reveal an empty room, the only thing out of place was an open window. That would have been a feasible way Dan could have gotten out and back to the front door...if we didn't live on the 7th floor of the building.

Dan moved out later that week, I had been feeling sick and had decided to hide out in my room so we hadn't really said much to each other since that night. I think I freaked him out after I explained to him what had happened. I thought I was initially feeling sick out of anxiety, I just felt so fucking violated after everything that had happened. But I had also been noticeably gaining weight. I took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. I went to a doctor and they told me I'm about 7 months pregnant and it's too late for an abortion, which should be impossible as I only had sex two weeks ago.

I don't what's growing inside of me now, but everyday my stomach gets bigger and bigger. I've tried everything to miscarry and nothings worked, I'm running out of options here so unless any of you can help, I might just have to take myself out along with whatever's been trying to kick and claw its way out of me.
