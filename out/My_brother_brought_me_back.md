When I was twenty three I died in a car crash. My brother and I have always been close, clinging desparately onto each other as liferafts in the sea of chaos that is the rest of our family. That my death broke his heart was something that I could have predicted, I'd have felt just as ruined.  Even the fact that he tried to bring me back wasn't that strange, not when you considered the environment we'd been brought up in.

What was surprising was that he succeeded.

My first memory after death was Frank trying to sew a hole up in my body and failing miserably. It was almost funny that a man who had bested boundary of life and death couldn't close a simple wound so I took the needle from his shaking hand and slowly, Frank explained to me everything that had happened.

I want to be clear that when I say I died I mean *died* died. None of this 'technically dead for twelve seconds' bullshit -- I was the kind of dead that nobody even tried to save, it was such a lost cause. The magic Frank had done shouldn't have been possible and at first, I thought it was a miracle.

Then my plants started dying.

My room had always been full of plants since I was a child. Initially just weeds and grass I'd brought inside, as an adult I'd graduated to sneakily taking cuttings of supermarket herbs or vulture-like rescues of plants thrown away from the local garden centre. Everything had always flourished before now.

Frank had said that the spell that saved me had required some life force. What he hadn't realised was that reversing death is not a one and done deal, the death has to in some small way be reversed over and over again.

It took me almost a full month before I realised that my boyfriend was not acting differently because of the stress of my accident but was sick, hopelessly trying to cope with less than half the energy that he was used to. I started to look out for it more then and realised that my friends, coworkers, even the cashiers at my local grocery store often seemed more run down than usual.

When my boyfriend passed out in front of me I tried to die for the first time. I did something that should have killed me but when Frank saw the scars he angrily told me that it wouldn't work anyway. Frank had cast powerful magic begging me to live and so as long as he was alive, I would be too.

I tried to figure out how to be a hermit. I wasn't sure what would happen to me if I starved myself from the energy of those around me but the guilt of pulling everybody else down just to stay afloat was sickening. Until last week my plan was simply to run away.

One pregnancy test changed all of that. One new innocent that I had no way to flee from.

Frank loves me too much to let me die and when I was alive the first time around I would have said I felt the same way about him. Maybe I changed. 

If life force can be taken by accident then it stood to reason that it could be taken by force as well. I read through the book containing the spell that brought me back, a tome that my brother had willingly shared with me, and found a spell that could drain his entire lifeforce in one go. Without my brother, his original spell that constantly renewed my life force will instead be replaced with nothing more than the energy that I've stolen from him. As I have no intentions to go out and drain anybody else I doubt I'll even last the year. But that's okay.

I only really need nine months.
