//NOTICE: This file is confidential information. Any unauthorized viewing or sharing of this document is strictly prohibited, and will result in severe consequences.//

The following is the second file I managed to retrieve from the government archive. There were three things inside of the file. The first looks to be a transcript of a 911 call, but a few things are worth noting about it. First and foremost, the names were removed from the transcript before I even got it. There’s nothing for me to change for my own safety, as everything has already been changed by someone else.

Another thing to note is that the caller and dispatcher are referred to as ‘8’ and ‘6’, respectively. This is strange, not only because they are numbers, but also because they are out of order and seem to have very little relevance to the call itself.

8: Hello? Hello, someone, please help!

6: 911, what is the nature of your emergency?

8: Oh thank God! I need the police. I need someone, now!

6: Ma’am, do you know your location?

8: \[//EXPUNGED DATA//\]

6: Okay. Police are on their way. What is happening, ma’am?

8: Someone is at my door. They’re trying to get in.

6: Okay, listen to me. Make sure the door is locked, okay?

8: Okay. (tapping)

6: Please stop that, ma’am.

8: That’s not me. It’s coming from the door.

6: Listen, the police are on their way. Find a safe place to barricade yourself. Maybe a bedroom?

8: (soft footsteps)

6: Did you hear me?

8: I’m in my bedroom now.

6: Okay, great. Now, try to push heavy objects in front of the door. Maybe a dresser, chairs, a bed if you can.

8: (scraping, grunting)

6: Now, just stay calm, the police will be there very soon.

8: (heavy breathing, tapping)

6: Ma’am, are you still in your bedroom?

8: (tapping)

6: Ma’am, are you okay?

8: (scraping, tapping)

6: Hello? Please, answer me. I’m here to help you, okay?

8: (tapping, getting louder, then silence)

6: Hello? Are you okay? Police are on their way.

8: (soft creaking and scraping of wood on wood)

6: Ma’am, please do not open the door. Stay in your room. Ma’am? Hello?

8: (screaming, crashing)

6: Ma’am! What is happening? Are you okay?

8: (silence)

6: Hello?! Please, answer!

(end, by caller)

The second file in 003 looks like it is unrelated to the first file. It looks like a print-out of a social media post and comment section. The post itself looks to be an image of a woman standing under a streetlight, posted by a user named der\_Retter. At first glance, it looks just like an artistic piece of photography. But closer inspection of the photo reveals that the woman is covered in blood, and there is blood on the sidewalk all around her. Here is the comment section of that post:

FredMan1002: What the hell man. This is fucked up

Dreadidiom: What are you talking about?

FredMan1002: The blood

Deadidiom: Oh holy shit I just noticed

junipertree3: who the fuck is this person

FredMan1002: I dunno, this is the only thing on their profile, no bio no anything

junipertree3: maybe its just artistic?

Deadidiom: There’s no way this is real, right?

junipertree3: fuck no. people these days love nothing more than to fuck with other people.

FredMan1002: Well, it worked. I’m scared

jesse: cowaRd

Deadidiom: who the hell is that?

junipertree3: dont know, profile is empty

jesse: all of yoU are cowards

FredMan1002: Fuck off, jackass

jesse: you are all Next

junipertree3: this isnt funny, bitch

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

jesse: you are next

Deadidiom: dude what the fuck

FredMan1002: This isn’t a fucking joke

junipertree3: i don’t like this

FredMan1002: Do we like report this shit or something?

Deadidiom: done, i reported them for spamming. their profile should be deactivated soon

junipertree3: thank god their fucking ass is gone

jesse: im never gone

jesse: i know your full names and addresses

jesse: want me to prove it?

FredMan1002: What the hell? I thought they were deactivated

Deadidiom: they must have gotten a new account

junipertree3: stupid fucker

jesse: i am coming

There are no other comments on this post. None of the users who commented ever posted again. A little bit of digging revealed that each of them went missing the day after the last comment was posted by jesse. There were also no more posts or comments by the jesse profile or the der\_Retter profile.

Speaking of the der\_Retter profile, I did some translating and found out that der Retter is German, and it translates to ‘the savior’. This could mean one of several things, but what I believe it means is that this ‘Jesse’ does not believe that she is committing crimes by killing people. She must believe that she is doing the world a favor, being a ‘savior’. However, that’s assuming that der\_Retter was created by Jesse in the first place. It very well might be a random person.

In this file, there was also a flashdrive. Inside is a folder, and inside that is a text file which looks like nonsense. The folder is titled "RMAAM", and the file titled "dear julius". I do not think this file was directed at me, however.

The tapestry being woven by these files is not only concerning to me, but terrifying. I should not be sharing these, yet I am. It is not my own safety I worry for, but for the safety of the people who are reading this. I don’t know if you or I will be able to make it to the end of these files. Please, I beg you, reach out if you receive any threats or notice anything strange. But please, call 911 before me.

Sincerely,

Julius Klein
