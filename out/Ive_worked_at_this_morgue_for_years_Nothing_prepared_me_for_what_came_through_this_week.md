I've worked at a morgue in a restricted facility for 4 years now. I can't tell you where, it's classified and honestly - I wish I didn't know either. 

We don't get normal cases. Sometimes the bodies come sealed in double layers, tags replaced with alphanumeric strings instead of names. We're trained to not ask.

Earlier this week, we received a body that, as I'd have to say, broke every rule of what I thought was possible. 

It was something hard for me to fathom, but the senior pathologist, I'll call him *M* \- didn't know how to process it either. 

**The Body** \- Male, late twenties, no visible injuries, and no signs of decay. No rigor mortis either, which was strange. Skin was cold to the touch, but soft - rather, too soft. Vitals? None.

Autopsy was scheduled for 00:00 hours. We placed him in locker C-7, cleaned our tools and logged the intake. That was it. 

Except... the locker door didn't frost over like the dozens of others. It stayed clean & warm.

We had an old landline on the far wall. We used it to call other departments down the corridor - say maintenance, logistics, security. In most of our night shifts, and in cases which were deemed urgent or "special care" (like this one), it'd almost never ring.

About 20 minutes in, after locking C-7, the phone screamed. Yeah, *screamed*. It didn't ring, it broke out into a jagged, electric wail - like modem noise. I remember *M* and I staring at it, expecting it to stop. 

Then the tone shifted dramatically. It started coming in bursts. Short and long, repeating. Almost rhythmic. I personally tried picking it up, but there was no receiver on the other end. 

*"Morse Code?", M* joked.

We broke into uneasy laughter, and the sound didn't stop. It'd die for a while and come back louder, noiser. The pattern was irregular initially, but it grew tighter like a heart learning to beat again.

To keep in check for any incidents that were to follow, I started recording it on my phone.

We hadn't brought out the body for inspection yet. Just before we began, around midnight, I stepped out to the washroom to ensure I wasn't going to contaminate the subject. 

The phone hadn't died. It kept beeping. Making that terrible sound. We thought better of jolting it out of the wall, since that would be against protocol.

The air felt colder than usual, static like it was crawling up my arms. Then the lights flickered. Once, twice - then darkness. I heard the phone still beeping erratically in that rhythm, echoing down the hall.

Then came the scream. A *human* scream, followed by several metallic thuds and groans like a distant commotion.

I ran back in.

*M* was on the floor, convulsing, clutching his throat. A scalpel lay beside him, his white coat was blooming red from the chest. He tried to point at an upper corner of the room, gasping something that sounded like "...*behind... beh-"* before his hand dropped.

Power had died completely, but the phone hadn't stopped.

In the darkness, I saw several dark lines of crimson liquid creeping from locker C-7. It was left ajar, the metal  almost torn.

The locker door was hanging open - empty.

I grabbed my torch and the emergency radio, stumbling toward the backup generator room in the dark. The hallway smelled wrong - like copper and wet meat.

The corridors were streaked red, finger marks smeared along the walls like something had been crawling. I could hear wet footsteps behind me, soft and irregular. 

The flashlight caught quick glimpses - a pale hand disappearing behind a corner, and the glint of eyes reflecting the beam.

Then, near the generator, I found *him*.

The body - *the thing* \- curled up in a fetal position, smeared in blood like it had been bathing in it. Its eyes were open, but not seeing. They shone, catching my light in a way no dead eyes could ever.

It was shaking, small - violent tremors. The sound coming from its throat wasn't breathing - it was clicking, like the start of another code.

It pulsated as the beeps from the phone catched with its bodily rhythm, like a beating heart fit into a pale corpse.

I backed away in disgust, tripped - and hit my shoulder on the wall. The flashlight spun out of my hand.

It looked straight up at me, eyes tearing from narrow slits... and lunged.

It hit me hard, cold fingers digging into my chest. I felt something tear into my shoulder - razor sharp, like broken glass. The beeps from the phone grew more frantic.

I slammed its head hard against the wall, and all of a sudden, it collapsed like a puppet. For a second, it twitched - but it finally died with the phone's beeps as they faded out - or so I like to think.

I reported the incident to security. They reviewed the surveillance footage nonchalantly. 

*"We should have let you know what you were dealing with",* they remarked.

They ultimately sealed locker C-7, scrubbed it clean. Took care of the body with an incineration order. But now I doubt why it was brought here in the first place. 

I tried decoding the landline's beeps I recorded on my phone. I triple-checked, it definitely reads like a message.   
  
I haven't had much luck, but here's the only meaningful phrase I could place:

.-.. . - / -- . / --- ..- -

*(LET ME OUT*)
