It was early December. I drove by myself in my dinky little car all the way from Nashville, Tennessee, to the snowy state of Colorado. The drive took three days. I stopped in a few crappy motels along the way and ate mostly gas station beef jerky.

Being from the south, I was not used to this much snow. And especially not used to people actually being prepared for it. Thankfully, the company's housing was on the ski resort. Which, you know what, was pretty dang cool. I love skiing and this job actually had skiing as a requirement! My family had taken several ski trips when I was younger, so I grew to enjoy it. The caveat was I had to have a roommate, but for free housing in one of the most expensive places in the United States, hell, I didn’t mind.

John turned out to be a pretty cool guy, too. He was from Minnesota, so he was a tad more acclimated to the weather. Meanwhile, I was shivering my ass off. We got to be pretty close, working together and living together. He’d worked here for a few years, so he’d show me around the town. We’d go have drinks and go bowling in Snowmass every Friday night. Good times.

John was the nephew of the owner of the resort, but he never used that as a crutch. He worked there just like the rest of us. Didn’t even own a car. For this, we all liked him. I’ve had jobs before where family gets special treatment. It gets old, so I was happy John wasn’t this way. 

Now you may ask, what was my job exactly? I was a server / bartender at the ski resorts lodge. Pretty standard work. I’d been a server before. Of course, a lot of the clientele here were a lot richer than back in my hometown. So that came with its own set of challenges. Everybody talks about entitled Karen’s, but there honestly should be a new term for the residents here.

Everything started out normal, and for a while, it was great. Everything I had asked for. I was desperate to get out and experience the world, and this opportunity came knocking. Sure, this was an expensive town, but with the money I made from tips, it didn’t matter. I felt like, if I just worked here for a while and saved up, I could do anything I wanted. Paris. London. See the world. It all felt doable now. At the rate I was going, I was probably making over 50 dollars an hour working there. Life was grand.

It happened on a Wednesday. Everything shifted. I greeted John when he entered the room. No response.

“Hey, what’s going on?”

“As if you don’t know.”

“What are you talking about?”
Silence again. I looked at him. He had a strange look on his face. A hateful gaze had replaced his normal cheery glow.

“Hey man, seriously, are you okay?”

“You only care about yourself. I don’t want to be friends with you anymore.”

“Dude! I don’t even know what you’re talking about! Please, enlighten me.”

“Yeah see. That’s you. You never know what your problem is.”

I stood in shock. I didn’t know what to say. What had I done to him? I couldn’t remember anything out of the ordinary today. Just like that. It had only been a few months since I’d gotten here, and now things were already going downhill.

I tried to calm myself, but I was a wreck. The emotions were so high in that room you could almost feel them. That’s when I first saw it. His eyes. John’s eyes were now pitch black. Instead of pupils, two dark voids stared back at me. My whole body shook. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. His face twisted with the most ferocious rage.

I eyed the door. He was standing right by it. I had to get away.

“I’m gonna get some fresh air. Just need to clear my head.” I crept past him. He breathed so heavily, never taking his gaze off of me. I’d never seen him like this. What happened to his eyes? I tried so hard not to show fear and remain calm. I turned the doorknob and walked out into the icy night air. He still stood there watching me, jaw agape, breathing fast.

I closed the door behind me and panicked. What was I to do? Something was wrong with my friend. If that was even him anymore. Was there something wrong with me? This couldn’t be happening, right? Was I going crazy?

I got in my car and drove. I didn’t even know where. Going so far up the mountain roads that I lost all cell service.

I felt I couldn’t tell anybody about this. Would they even believe me? I feared it was my fault. Had I truly done someone to cause this? I didn’t know. I felt like I was losing my mind. Had I seen that correctly? Were his eyes really black? 
Getting out of the car, I turned my head towards the stars and a wave of calm washed over me. It was so beautiful. I was all alone. Just me and the universe, the best view you could ever imagine.

Tears streamed down my face, chilling my skin as they rolled down. What could I do? How could I fix this? I must have stood there for an hour, deep in contemplation. I had to go back. What was wrong with him?

I climbed back into my vehicle and headed towards civilization. Didn’t even listen to music on the drive there. My car was the only one around for miles. So alone in every way.

Finally, I arrived back at the lodging. The headlights of my car illuminated the dingy living space as I peeled into the driveway. The lights were off. Was he still here? Was he still like that?

I cautiously opened the door to the dimly lit room. As my eyes adjusted, I peered at our bunk beds. John had tucked himself in on the top bunk. Sound asleep. It’s strange, even after everything, I felt calm and safe. Maybe everything would be alright again. I’d have my friend back.

But that fear slowly crept up in the back of my mind. That I would set him off again. That I would anger him and those black eyes would come back. Maybe this time he would hurt me. I saw that rage in him. I hoped I’d never see it again. But if I did. Who would believe me? All my coworkers know John as a kind man. They’d think I’m insane. Maybe I am.

The next morning, everything appeared to be fine. John was himself again. We went back to work. We laughed, we joked, it was great. Yet, I couldn’t shake that feeling. I felt like it was all make believe. Did I not see that last night? His eyes were black. I had the urge to say something to him, but I was terrified, afraid that I would bring it back.

A few days passed, exactly like this. On the surface, normal. But, on the inside, my emotions were eating away at me. I felt like a shell of my former self. I could barely eat. My stomach was in knots. There was a constant fuzziness in the back of my skull. I began performing poorly at work. Spilling drinks, dropping trays, forgetting customers’ orders. I was a mess.

Then, one day after work, we were heading back to our room. I drove him home from work unless he stayed later than me, in which case he would walk home. It wasn’t far, after all. I was so exhausted mentally and physically after that shift, then he asked me a question.
He asked if we could go to Snowmass and hit the bar. Not tonight, I said. I’m so tired. In a split second, he swung open the passenger door while I was driving. He glared at me and demanded we go right now. I sheepishly agreed, white knuckling the steering wheel as I made a u-turn. He calmly closed the door.

My throat dried up. I was afraid to speak. I kept glancing at him in my peripheral vision, afraid I’d see those dreaded eyes. They never came.

The next day at work, I pulled a coworker aside. Didn’t know him that well, but I had to tell somebody what was going on. I told him about how John was flipping out lately and he was really scaring me. But, I didn’t tell him about the eyes. I knew he wouldn’t believe me. He shared genuine concern and said he’d help me out if I needed it. Told me to call him if things got dangerous. I thanked him and finished my shift. But this relief was only temporary.

I left work. They scheduled John to close, and I had already finished my shift. I did not want to wait for him. When I arrived, however, John was already home. I flicked on the lights to find him standing in the middle of the room with his back to me. A knife clang to the floor, landing in a puddle of blood. He turned around and looked at me. Those eyes. Oh god, they were back.

“I thought we were friends!” He screeched. “Why were you talking to him?! I hate you!!”

“What did you do?!” My heart beat so fast, I felt like I was going to collapse.

Already halfway out the door, I ran to my car and got behind the wheel without looking back. 
I made it all the way to Denver until I ran out of gas and called the cops. I’m sure John is long gone by now. He’s probably cleaned up his mess and no one will believe me. 
He’ll do it again, and there’s nothing I can do. So, the next time I find a job that seems too good to be true, I’ll accept that it probably is.
