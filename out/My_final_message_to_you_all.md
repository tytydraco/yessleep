I feel like I should post this somewhere and this community has always been near and dear to me. Feel like this is the kind of story you guys would like anyways. I fear this will be my first and only entry though. Just need to put it up somewhere.

Day 1:

Dear diary,

Another day of working from home. I don't mind it, really. It's been years since I left the house, and the world outside doesn't hold much interest for me anymore. I'm content to stay in my little bubble, typing away at my computer all day.

I've decided to keep a diary to have someone to talk to at least. Everyone I used to talk to just seems so distant lately. I've been so lonely. At least this way it'll feel like I'm talking to someone.

Something strange has been happening lately. I've been hearing noises at night, little creaks and shuffles that I can't explain. It's probably just my imagination, but I can't shake the feeling that something is lurking in the darkness, watching me.

Day 2:

Dear diary,

The noises were worse last night. I heard something scratching at the front door, like a fingernail tapping against the wood. When I looked through the peephole, there was nothing there, but I could still feel eyes on me, staring at me from the darkness.

I tried to tell myself that it was just my overactive imagination, but the feeling of being watched won't go away.

Day 3:

Dear diary,

I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. The noises are getting louder and more frequent, and I can't shake the feeling that something is in the house with me. I've been checking and re-checking all the doors and windows, but they're all locked tight.

I tried to call someone for help, but my phone won't connect. It's like I'm completely cut off from the outside world. I don't know what to do.

Day 4:

Dear diary,

The noises are keeping me up at night. I hear footsteps pacing back and forth outside my bedroom door, and something scratching at the walls. It's like something is trying to get in, but I don't know what.

I'm starting to feel like I'm being watched all the time, like there are eyes on me even when I'm alone. I'm too scared to leave my room

Day 5:

Dear diary,

I haven't slept in days. The noises are too much to bear. I'm starting to see things, too - shadows moving in the corners of my eyes, shapes that disappear when I turn to look at them.

I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Day 6:

Dear diary,

I think there's something in the house with me. I can hear it breathing, slow and rasping, like it's right behind me. But every time I turn around, there's nothing there.

I'm too scared to leave my room. I haven't eaten in days.

Day 7:

Dear diary,

I'm starting to think that the thing in the house with me is a monster. I don't know what it looks like, but I can feel its presence all around me.

I've been trying to barricade myself in my room, but I don't think it will hold. I don't know how much longer I can hold on.

Day 8:

Dear diary,

I think I saw the monster last night. It was just a glimpse, but I swear I saw something moving in the shadows.

I'm too scared to leave my room, even to use the bathroom. I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped here forever.

Day 9:

Dear diary,

I can't take it anymore. I need to get out of here, but I don't know how. The monster is everywhere, lurking in the darkness.

I can hear it whispering to me, calling out my name in a voice that's both seductive and terrifying. I'm starting to think that I might be in love with it.

Day 10:

Dear diary,

I'm not sure if I can trust my own thoughts anymore. I keep seeing the monster, but every time I try to get a better look at it, it disappears. It's like it's playing games with me, teasing me, making me question my own sanity.

I don't know how much longer I can take this. The monster is consuming me, and I can feel my grip on reality slipping away.

Day 11:

Dear diary,

I tried to run away last night, but the monster caught me. It dragged me back into my room, and now I'm trapped here, alone with it.

I can feel its breath on my neck, hot and moist. It's whispering to me again, telling me things that I can't understand. I'm scared, but I can't deny that there's a part of me that's drawn to it.

Day 12:

Dear diary,

I can't fight it anymore. The monster is inside me now, consuming me from the inside out. I can feel it moving through my veins, changing me into something else.

I know that I'm not long for this world. But I don't care. I want to be with the monster forever.

Day 13:

Dear diary,

I can feel the end coming. The monster is growing stronger, and I'm growing weaker. But I'm not afraid anymore. I'm ready to join it, to become one with it.

I can hear it calling out to me, in a voice that's both beautiful and terrifying. I'm going to answer its call, and I'm never coming back.

Day 14:

Dear diary,

This is the end. I can feel the monster inside me, consuming me completely. I don't know what's going to happen next, but I know that it's going to be beautiful.

Goodbye, world. I'm ready to become one with the monster.
