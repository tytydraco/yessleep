The worn Nike duffel bag lay open on my bed, waiting to swallow my camping gear. My eyes drifted to the wall of photos from my high school experience. There was Charlie, my best friend since kindergarten, grinning like a maniac, his arm slung around my shoulder, joint poised in his lips. Another shot showed June and I, her smile radiant, a guitar clutched in my hands, My eyes locked on her as she sang along. My long-time crush, even when she was in a relationship. Then there was Jason, in his basketball jersey, usually with some girl of the week clinging to him. We’d been through so much together, from awkward middle school romances, to sneaking out to smoke behind the bleachers in high-school. Now, graduation caps thrown behind us, and this camping trip to Manistee National Forest felt like the last hurrah of us before we all scattered across the country.

A buzz from my phone. Charlie. "Yo, Almost there home skillet!"

I quickly shoved the last few items into my bag, before zipping it up and heading downstairs. "Bye, Grandma, Grandpa!" I called out, walking over to give my grandpa a hug. Grandpa was already by Grandma’s bedside, gently adjusting her blanket, untangling her dialysis machine. She’d been bedridden for months, and he was her constant, quiet guardian.

"Love you, Nana," I said, kissing her forehead. "I'll be back after the weekend."

"Oh, I love you too, son," she replied, her voice a bit labored, as she reached an arm over me to hug me. "Don't have too much fun now."

She and Grandpa had been my everything, raising me since my mom passed away. My dad was never really in the picture, gone long before I was born.

Just as I reached the porch, a cacophony of honking erupted from the street. The beat-up Dodge van, Charlie’s pride and joy, pulled up to the curb. Charlie’s head popped out the window, “Hope you're ready to trip absolute donkey dick this weekend” Charlie said holding up a baggie of brownie, Ashley and June giggled from the back. I grabbed my bag and jogged out, a nervous excitement fluttering in my chest. This was it.

The drive into Manistee National Forest was a blur of green. We passed one other campsite, a small tent tucked away with a few campers by the fire. They raised their beers as we passed by, before reaching our spot at the end of the drive-in. It was pretty secluded, surrounded by towering white pines. The air thick with the scent of the needles damp with the earth. We quickly set up our camp, the two tents and fire pit, fueled by the energy from a promise of a wild night.

And wild it was. This was our graduation celebration, after all. The music blared from the speaker, a mix of grunge and classic rock. We passed joints around, the sweet, earthy smoke mingling with the campfire smell. Charlie, true to his eccentric nature, pulled out the baggie of mushroom Brownies. "For a real trip, boys and girls. Keep arms and legs in and buckle your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride!" he announced holding them out, his eyes gleaming. We all took a few, the laughter growing louder.

The world began to warp. Colors intensified, sounds became echoes. I remember looking up at the canopy of trees, seeing the stars spin like glitter. Then, a pair of Yellow eyes in the darkness, a black owl, perched on a branch, watching us with an unnerving stillness. Later, I saw him again, or thought I did. This time on the shoulder of a figure, tall and gaunt, moving silently through the trees, a native man. I remember trying to focus, to make sense of it, but the mushrooms had me in their grip. I just chalked it up to the trip, continued laughing with my friends.

The next morning was a dull ache. Waking up to Charlie holding me in a little spoon, Jason's feet pressed against my cheek. My head throbbed, my mouth felt like sandpaper, but the first joint of the day was already lit courtesy of June, easing the edges of the hangover. I stumbled away from the campfire needing to pee, headed deeper into the woods.

That’s when I saw him again. The native man, just as I remembered. Well without the owl anyways, walking slowly, his back to me. My heart hammered. This wasn't a trip. I called out, but he didn't respond, just kept moving. I followed, a strange compulsion pulling me forward. He seemed to glide through the undergrowth, always just out of reach. I lost sight of him around a tree. I waited for a moment, before turning to give up and go back. When there he was, suddenly, right behind me, his eyes piercing, ancient.

"You must leave," he said, his voice a low rumble, like stones shifting. "Leave this place, its cursed land of the Paguk and you are tresspassing."

"Were you… staking us?" I blurted out, before I could stop it. "You and your owl, last night. Watching me."

His eyes widened, a flicker of genuine shock crossing his stoic face. "The owl? You saw the Muut?" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. "Then you know. The curse is upon you. Death is coming."

"Thomas! What are you doing?" Jason’s yell cut through the heavy air. I looked over my shoulder, startled. By the time I turned back, the native man was gone, vanished as if he’d never been there. The woods were silent once more, except for the distant chirping of birds and cicadas.

Back at camp, the others were already cracking open beers, trying to shake off the lingering effects of the night. I tried to tell them about the native man, the owl, the warning, but they just laughed it off. "Still tripping, dude," Charlie said, passing me a beer. I sighed, cracking it open and sitting down on the folding chair. We settled into talking about the future. June, her eyes bright, spoke of moving to LA, of singing on big stages. Charlie, ever the instigator, grabbed my guitar. "Come on, Thomas! Play something for June!"

I hesitated, but June’s expectant smile was enough. I strummed a few chords, tuning the guitar I knew already was, before playing the tune of “Fast car” by Tracy Chapman. I loved it when June sang it, something her blush told me she already knew. She began to sing, her voice clear and beautiful, echoing through the trees. It was a perfect moment, fragile and fleeting. I stared at her for a moment when the song was over, watching her smile and laugh as she thanked her friends applauding.

Then Jason interrupted. "Hey, check this out!" He pointed to the van. The front tire was completely flat, parked directly on a broken glass bottle. "No spare, either," he grumbled, kicking the tire. We’d planned on staying another night anyway, so it wasn't a disaster, but it meant calling AAA tomorrow. Jason was already fuming about the cost.

“Its okay baby, we can ask the other campers, they had a truck but the spare might fit” Ashley added trying to lighten the mood

“Yeah lets go interrupt their time to bring them into our problems” Jason interjected.

June, ever observant, pointed to the oldest, gnarliest tree near our camp. "Woah look at this," she said, tracing something carved into its bark. "It says… Pau’Guk, it looks freaky."

A chill ran down my spine. The name felt wrong, heavy. Just then, a bloodcurdling scream tore through the forest, coming from up the drive, from the other campsite. Charlie’s face went pale. "I’ll stay here with the woman," he stammered, clearly terrified.

I chuckled, *always so extra*, I thought before exchanging a look with Jason.

"Let's go," he said, grabbing a flashlight. I nodded, a familiar unease settling over me. There was always a strange distance between us, and I wondered if he felt it too.

"Hey, you good, Tommy?" he asked, confirming my suspicion.

"Yeah, I'm good. Just never alone with you, I guess," I admitted.

"What, you scared of me or somthin?" he teased.

"No, no. You just seem to have it all figured out," I replied, choosing my words carefully.

He scoffed. "I'm far from that. I always thought you did. You aced school, play amazing guitar... June won't shut up about you." He grinned as my face flushed at the mention of her name. "No, for real. Even when we were together, I could tell she liked you. Why haven't you asked her out yet?"

"But she was your girlfriend before," I explained, "I didn't want to seem like a jerk for asking her out after."

"You know, Thomas," he said, his voice low, "you're a good dude. Always have been." It was a rare moment of vulnerability from the jock, and it made the horror we were walking towards even more unsettling.

We stumbled upon the other campsite with a dreadful swiftness, the flickering firelight casting an eerie glow on a scene of carnage. Two men and a woman lay sprawled amidst their overturned gear, their bodies grotesquely gutted.

Near their tent, the two men lay, lifeless. One with his throat slit ear to ear and his abdomen violently splayed open, exposing a tangle of viscera. Beside him, the other man was a mangled mess, his arms ripped clean from their sockets, leaving behind ragged, bloody stumps.

The woman's body was equally disturbing. Her severed hand, frozen in a death grip, was on the handle of the truck, a testament to her effort to escape. Her torso lay on the ground, her jaw completely missing, a gaping, bloody void where her mouth should have been. Her eyes, or what remained of them, were gouged out, leaving only raw, empty sockets.

The sheer, brutal force evident in the dismemberment and mutilation was horrifying, far beyond anything a human could inflict. My stomach lurched, threatening to betray me.

"Jesus fuck, we have to call somebody, We need to get them help," Jason whispered, his voice hoarse. 

“Help,” I questioned, “I think they are way beyond helping, Jason.”

 We pulled out our phones, but there was nothing. Dead zones. Jason remembered seeing a map at the entrance. "We can take the golf cart back to the group, then head to the ranger station. I saw it on the map up the drive."

I agreed and we raced back to camp, the smell of blood still in my nostrils, wind hitting our faces through the open cage of the cart. We relayed the information, our voices hushed, urgent. "Animal attack?" Ashley whispered, her eyes wide. "Lunatic?" Charlie offered, shaking his head. We didn’t want to find out.

We piled into the golf cart, the engine sputtering to life, and sped towards the map at the drive-in. From there, we found the path to the ranger station. It was a small, dilapidated cabin. Pulling up into the lawn, we saw it looked completely empty. As we pulled up, the sky opened, a sudden, violent storm lashing rain against the windows. We had no choice but to take shelter.

"A phone, a radio, anything to call for help," Jason urged, and we fanned out, desperate for a way to reach someone.

Charlie snatched up the radio, his voice tight with panic. "Yo, hello? Man, you gotta send someone, people are dying and shit, man, it's scary up in this bitch!" Only static answered. "Yoo! Helloo!" he screamed, his voice cracking.

"Guys, look!" Ashley's voice was a strained whisper. She pointed out the window at the antenna tower. Its dish lay on the ground, the tower itself bent at an almost ninety-degree angle.

"I don't think we're getting any messages out," June added, her voice flat with resignation.

I pointed to the map on the wall. "There's another DNR station ten miles out. If we can make it there, there are bound to be people." They quickly grabbed the map, their gazes fixed on the front doors.

As the doors swung open, a hulking, skeletal figure, its very essence vibrating with unnatural speed, stood waiting. It brandished a silver knife. Ashley screamed as the creature slashed its arm, its limbs crackling with an unsettling sound. She stumbled back, clutching her stomach as it carved a gash across her abdomen, falling to the ground.

Charlie spun to run, but with impeccable speed, the creature snatched a bow from its back and drew the empty string. Charlie collapsed, clutching his leg, an arrow-sized hole appearing just above his knee. The creature drew the phantom arrow again, aiming it at me. I froze, paralyzed by terror, as Jason's voice boomed, "Hey, Boner!"

The creature turned just as Jason fired a flare directly into its shoulder. It recoiled, releasing the invisible bowstring, and something heavy smashed against the wall behind my head—a clock, now shattered. With a guttural snarl, the creature disappeared into the storm.

Through the rain-streaked window, I saw it again – the owl, perched on a branch, its eyes glowing. The Muut. A surge of primal fear, mixed with rage, coursed through me. I grabbed the nearest object, a heavy, dusty book, and hurled it at the bird. It shrieked, a sound like tearing fabric, and flew away into the storm.

We needed help, desperately. We rummaged through the ranger station, our hands trembling. We found some tannerite for stumps, another flare for the flare gun, and a hunting rifle. I pocketed the tannerite, grabbed the flare gun from Jason as he took the rifle. "We're going for help," he said, his voice grim. "There's another ranger station, ten miles away. We'll take the cart."

"Out to that *thing*?" June asked, her eyes wide with concern as she looked at me.

"We'll be okay, June," Jason said, holding up the rifle. "Just look after Ashley for me, please."

He glanced at Ashley, who was wincing on the couch, clutching her belly. "What about me?" Charlie asked, his voice barely a whisper.

"Yes, you too, Charlie," Jason added, a note of finality in his tone.

We left Ashley and Charlie huddled together, June clinging to them, and piled into the golf cart. Jason slammed the accelerator, and we lurched forward, plunging into the raging storm. The two-track trail, already slick with mud, quickly became a marsh. The golf cart, built for leisurely strolls, not a desperate escape, groaned and shuddered before its wheels spun uselessly.

"Dammit!" Jason grunted, trying to rock it free. We jumped out, pushing against the back, our feet sinking into the muck. It was useless. The cart was stuck fast.

"Only two more miles," Jason gasped, his face pale in the faint glow of the headlights, his breath plumbing in the frigid air.

We started walking, the wind whipping at our clothes. Jason was limping heavily, his arm slung over my shoulder, leaning on me for support. The storm howled around us, a primal scream that seemed to swallow all other sounds. Trees swayed like drunken giants, their branches clawing at the sky. Every shifting shadow held a perceived threat, every creak and groan of the forest sounding like approaching footsteps.

Just when I thought my legs would give out, a faint light appeared through the driving rain. The second ranger station, a small cabin nestled amongst the trees, stood as a beacon in the oppressive darkness. We stumbled towards it, half-collapsing against the door.

The door opened, revealing a burly man with a kind, weathered face. He took one look at our soaked, terrified expressions and the blood staining Jason’s sleeve, and his demeanor shifted instantly.

"What in God's name happened to you two?" the ranger exclaimed, his eyes scanning us with concern.

"We... we need help," I stammered, my voice hoarse. "There's... there's something out there."

"Our friends are back at our campsite," Jason added, his voice strained. "One of them hurt badly."

The ranger didn't hesitate. "Get in. I'll take you back. Just tell me where." He grabbed his keys from a hook, his gaze firm and reassuring. "We'll get 'em."

"Thought my night was over," the ranger chuckled, his breath pluming in the cold air as he started the truck.

It was far from over.

The world exploded. A blinding flash of lightning ripped across the sky, followed by a deafening roar of thunder. For a split second, I could have sworn I saw the creature running alongside us in the tree line, a blur of skeletal fury.

"Oh, shit!" the ranger yelled, his voice tight with alarm. The truck spun wildly on the slick trail, headlights sweeping across the thrashing trees, before we slammed into something with a sickening crunch.

My head snapped forward, slamming against the dashboard. Disoriented, the world tilted and spun. I shook my head, trying to clear the fog. Jason groaned from the passenger seat, his leg twisted at an unnatural angle. Broken. I lunged to help him, but the ranger was nowhere to be seen.

Then came his screams. They ripped through the storm, echoing from all sides of the woods, agonizing and raw. A sickening thud followed, and then, in the stark beam of the headlights, his head rolled into view. His eyes were gouged out, and a grotesque, stretched smile was carved into his cheeks.

"Run!" I screamed, grabbing Jason and hauling him to his feet. We stumbled, half-ran, half-crawled, Jason’s dead weight, a terrible anchor, back towards the first ranger station.

We burst through the front door of the ranger station, adrenaline coursing through us, only to be met with another wave of horror. Ashley lay slumped against the far wall, unconscious, a fresh, deep gash marring her arm. Her breath was shallow, almost imperceptible. Charlie was in even worse shape; he was clearly nodding out, his eyes glazed and unfocused, his breathing distressingly shallow. But the most chilling discovery was yet to come.

"June!" I screamed, my voice cracking, the name tearing from my throat. She was gone.

Panic, cold and sharp, seized me. My eyes darted frantically around the room, searching, praying. And then I saw it: a sickening smear of blood on the worn wooden floorboards, leading directly to the back door. A clear drag trail followed, disappearing into the impenetrable darkness of the woods beyond.

Without a second thought, driven by a primal urge to protect, I snatched up the rifle Jason had dropped earlier. Its cold metal felt heavy and strangely comforting in my trembling hands. "Stay here," I muttered, the words barely audible, though I knew it was a futile request. They were barely capable of staying conscious, let alone defending themselves. My gaze fixed on the grim trail, I pushed open the back door and plunged into the swirling, chaotic darkness of the storm.

The crimson trail, stark against the damp earth, led me deeper into the churning chaos of the storm. The wind howled, and rain lashed down, but I barely registered it. My focus was solely on the deepening smears of blood, which, to my growing dread, veered sharply off the main trail, leading to a cluster of ancient, gnarled trees. There, half-hidden by a cascade of thick, dripping vines, lay the gaping maw of a hidden cavern. Its entrance was a jagged, dark void, exhaling the damp, earthy scent of ancient stone and something else… something foul.

I pulled the flashlight from my pocket, my fingers fumbling with the cold metal. Its narrow beam cut a weak swath through the oppressive, absolute darkness that swallowed the cavern’s interior. Each droplet of water falling from the stalactites seemed to amplify the crushing silence.

"June?" I whispered, the name catching in my throat, my voice trembling despite my best efforts to control it. The sound felt swallowed by the vast emptiness, a fragile plea against the encroaching terror.

My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the quiet. I swept the beam across the cavern floor, past glistening, jagged rocks and stagnant puddles. And then, in a small alcove carved into the rock face, I saw her. June.

She was huddled in a tight ball, shivering uncontrollably, her face pale and streaked with dirt and tears. But she was alive.

"Thomas!" she cried, her voice a raw, choked sob of pure relief. Her eyes, wide and luminous in the flashlight's glow, found mine, and for a fleeting moment, all the horror outside seemed to vanish.

I rushed to her, pulling her to her feet. Her body felt frail and cold, trembling violently as I helped her steady herself. But just as her feet found solid ground, a profound shift in the air, a chilling drop in temperature, made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

From the deepest shadows of the cavern, a form began to coalesce, a presence so inherently wrong it stole the breath from my lungs. The beast. The Paguk.

Its eyes, two pinpricks of malevolent, glowing red, ignited in the darkness, fixed on us with an unwavering, predatory intent. The air crackled with a palpable, ancient evil. There was no escape.

My hands, slick with sweat and shaking violently, brought the rifle up. The Paguk loomed, a horrifying silhouette against the faint light from the cavern entrance, its malevolent eyes burning. I squeezed the trigger.

Once.

The shot cracked, a deafening report in the enclosed space, echoing off the damp stone walls. The creature barely flinched, the bullet seemingly absorbed by its unnatural form. A fresh wave of despair washed over me, but I didn't stop.

Twice.

Another shot. Still, it stood, a dark, terrifying monolith of pure malice. No visible wound, no sign of pain. It was like shooting at a shadow.

A third, desperate squeeze of the trigger.

*Click.*

The sickening sound of a jammed rifle. My blood ran cold.

The Paguk lunged, an impossible blur of speed. I barely had time to react, throwing myself backward, but its razor-sharp claws raked across my outstretched arm, then tore through my shirt, carving a searing path across my chest. Pain flared, hot and immediate, blossoming into a thousand tiny agonies.

We were locked in a desperate, brutal dance in the suffocating darkness. The creature was a whirlwind of claws and teeth, a phantom of destruction. Every swing, every parry, every desperate dodge was met with another agonizing tear. I was being shredded, cuts appearing everywhere, but I kept moving, a desperate, singular focus driving me: keep it away from June. I snarled, pushed, shoved, anything to maintain a sliver of distance between the beast and her.

Then, a flash of movement.

From the corner of my eye, I saw June. With surprising, almost impossible strength born of sheer terror and desperation, she had torn a jagged stalactite from the cave ceiling. It was heavy, razor-edged, and glistened menacingly in the dim light. With a raw, desperate cry that ripped from her throat, she plunged it, with all her might, into the beast’s side.

The Paguk shrieked. It wasn't a roar, but a sound of pure, unadulterated agony, an ear-splitting wail that vibrated through the very rock of the cavern. It recoiled violently, its glowing eyes wide with what seemed to be shock and pain. For the first time, it faltered.

"Run!" I screamed, the single word ripped from my raw throat as I seized June's hand. Her fingers were cold and trembling, but she squeezed back, a silent testament to her terror and resolve. We stumbled, half-crawling, half-dragging ourselves towards the glimmer of the cavern entrance, the Paguk's guttural roars echoing behind us, a primal sound of fury and pain. Every ragged breath I took felt like broken glass in my lungs, every muscle screamed in protest, but the image of that monstrous face propelled me forward.

We burst out of the stifling, oppressive air of the cavern and into the still-howling, storm-ravaged night. The rain lashed down, instantly chilling us to the bone, but the fresh air was a welcome shock after the stagnant dread of the cave. As my eyes frantically scanned our surroundings, a desperate thought, a fragile thread of hope, sparked in my mind. The tannerite.

My hand plunged into my pocket, fumbling blindly for the small, explosive canisters. My fingers, numb and clumsy, struggled with the fuse. I pulled it free, a small, cylindrical shape, and with a surge of adrenaline-fueled urgency, I knelt and placed the tannerite just inside the cavern entrance, where the Paguk was likely to emerge.

"Get back!" I bellowed to June, my voice barely audible above the storm's shriek. I yanked the flare gun from my belt, the smooth plastic cold against my palm. My aim was steady, a desperate focus narrowing my world to just the gun, the fuse, and the raging storm. I squeezed the trigger.

The flare shot from the barrel, a brilliant red streak against the dark, churning air. It arced perfectly, a fiery arrow piercing the tempest, and plunged into the cavern, directly onto the tannerite.

Then came the explosion.

A blinding flash of white light erupted from the cavern's mouth, momentarily searing itself into my retinas. It was followed by a thunderous roar, a concussive wave that slammed into us, shaking the very ground beneath our feet. The earth trembled, a deep, resonant rumble that vibrated through my bones. Tons of rock and earth rained down, a cascade of debris that hammered against the forest floor. Dust and pulverized stone billowed out, forming a choking cloud that momentarily obscured everything.

When the echoes finally faded, and the dust began to settle, the cavern entrance was gone. Sealed. Buried. The monster, hopefully, along with it.

We ran. Not a slow jog, but a desperate, lung-searing sprint. Adrenaline, the last vestiges of it, pumped through our veins, a burning fuel that pushed us onward. Every shadow still seemed to hold the grotesque face of the Paguk, every snapped twig the sound of its pursuit. June stumbled beside me, but I held her hand tight, pulling her forward. Our ragged breaths plumed in the cold, rain-soaked air, mingling with the last lingering echoes of the explosion.

Then, through the blurring rain and swaying trees, we saw them. A kaleidoscope of flashing blue and red lights pulsed through the dark, cutting through the storm like beacons. Police cars. Dozens of them, it seemed, clustered around the first ranger station. They were already there.

A wave of profound, overwhelming relief washed over me, so potent it almost buckled my knees. It was over.

The next few hours were a disorienting blur. The sudden shift from primal terror to the organized chaos of emergency services was jarring. Uniformed officers, their faces grim and questioning, moved with purpose. Paramedics, their movements efficient and practiced, immediately took over, their voices calm amidst our trembling. They patched up my numerous cuts and gashes, cleaned June's scrapes, and gave us blankets that felt impossibly warm.

Then came the questions. So many questions. They wanted us to recount the impossible, to put words to the unspeakable horror we had just endured. How do you describe a creature that defies all known biology? How do you explain a fight in a cave against a being of pure malice? We tried, our voices hoarse and our minds reeling, repeating the same unbelievable story over and over. They listened, their expressions unreadable, scribbling notes on pads.

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, they let us leave. The storm had begun to subside, leaving behind a cold, clear night, but the quiet offered no comfort. The world felt irrevocably changed.

On the long, quiet drive back, the world outside the car window felt strangely muted, almost dreamlike. The storm had finally broken, leaving behind a crisp, star-dusted night, but the quiet offered little comfort. My thoughts were a jumbled mess of terrifying images and the dull ache of the cuts across my body. Then, my phone buzzed incessantly in my pocket, a harsh, insistent vibration that cut through the silence.

I pulled it out, my thumb brushing against the screen. Twenty-four missed calls. All from Grandpa. My heart sank, a leaden weight in my chest. A cold dread, separate from the horrors of the night, began to spread. He only called that many times for one reason.

I called him back, bracing myself for the worst. The phone rang three times before he picked up. His voice, when he finally spoke, was tired, worn down by grief, but strangely calm.

"Tommy," he said, his voice raspy. "It's Grandma."

"I know, Grandpa. I saw the calls," I managed to choke out, my own voice tight.

He paused, a long, heavy silence stretching between us. "She went peacefully, son. In her sleep."

A strange, quiet grief settled over me, a heavy blanket that absorbed all other emotions. It was a profound, aching sadness, utterly unlike the visceral terror I had just faced. Coming after such a violent, chaotic night, this gentle, final passing felt surreal, a stark contrast to the brutal death we had witnessed. The world had torn itself apart, but in the quiet solitude of her bed, Grandma had simply slipped away. It was a raw, aching pain, made all the more poignant by the impossible events that had just unfolded.

The aftermath of that night didn't just leave physical scars; it shattered the existing bonds between us. The group, once united by a shared purpose, fractured. Jason and Ashley couldn't withstand the immense pressure of the trauma they'd endured. Their relationship, once seemingly solid, crumbled under the weight of the unspeakable. The memories, the fear, the raw horror – it was simply too much, and they eventually went their separate ways.

Charlie, still visibly shaken by the events, his eyes often distant and haunted, found solace in staying close to Jason. He ended up moving in with Jason, perhaps seeking a familiar anchor in a world that had suddenly become terrifyingly unpredictable. They shared a different kind of burden, a quiet understanding of what they’d witnessed, but it was one that pushed them inward, away from the wider world.

But June and I… we found something else in the aftermath. Something unexpected and profound. A shared understanding, a silent language forged in the crucible of terror. That night, fighting for our lives in the dark, had stripped away all pretense, revealing raw courage and an undeniable connection. It was a bond forged in terror, yes, but it was also steeped in a deep, unspoken trust.

We clung to that connection, nurturing it, letting it grow. And just as she’d always dreamed, we left the ghosts of the forest behind and moved to Los Angeles. The city's vibrant energy, its relentless pursuit of dreams, felt like a stark contrast to the shadowy woods we'd escaped. She pursued her passion, her voice a beacon of strength and vulnerability. She sang, her melodies carrying the echoes of what we’d lived through, transforming them into something beautiful. And I, with my guitar, played alongside her, our music becoming an extension of our shared experience. It was born from the darkness, undeniably shaped by the fear and loss we’d known, but with every note, it soared into the light, a testament to resilience, to connection, and to the healing power of shared purpose.
