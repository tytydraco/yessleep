“Wake up!” Kelsey snapped as I forced myself to open my eyes. 

I gasped and took a few long, deep breaths before meeting her gaze. 

“Someone is here to see you,” Kelsey whispered as she helped me stand. 

“Who?” I croaked out before trying to clear my throat. 

\-

“He hasn’t introduced himself. Caleb was able to get the girls outside. He seems to think this thing is dangerous, and I tend to agree. Something's not right.” Kelsey said gravely. 

The phone call came rushing back to me, and I quickly moved to put on my shoes and put my hair in a ponytail.

“He’s here to fire me,” I mumbled as I grabbed my belt and flashlight. 

“Wait.” Kelsey started before I raised my hand to try to silence her. 

“Stay here until I come back. If he kills me or something, make sure to leave the phone alone. Don’t answer it.” I told her before leaving my office, I wasn’t going to give her time to protest.

As I walked down the hallway and down the stairs, it felt like the growing dread was weighing me down. Like the universe was going to come crashing down on me any second. When I saw the man waiting at the bottom of the stairs, my blood ran cold and my body tensed. The man looked normal, at least at first glance. 

“Sky?” He asked as he tilted his black hat forward and adjusted his black coat before slowly making his way up the stairs. 

I took a few steps back, slowly making my way up the stairs. 

“Yeah?” I whispered. 

Everything in my body was telling me to run. If I were fast enough, I could make it to another staircase. Not everything was connected, but a simple climb would get me to where I needed to go. I just had to be fast. 

“I was sent to terminate you. It is nothing personal, but we don’t feel like you’ll be able to provide further use to us. The process is painless.” He said as he started moving up the stairs faster. 

I turned around and took off running to the left. The stairs were each connected to a different floor, but were simple enough to hop to. Once I reached the railing, I hopped up and swung my legs around to hit the next staircase, and held the railing as hard as possible as I made my way up the stairs. With each step, more pain surged through my legs. The events of the last few weeks were wearing me down. 

“Sky.” The man said from behind me. I could hear him following me, but I didn’t dare look back. 

“Sky!” He barked as I made my way to a door and pushed my way inside. 

\-

It looked a lot like the office hallway that we had been staying in, but these offices were all different, and the hallway was filthy. Dry blood soaked the white carpet, and I could see scratches on a few of the doors. I tried a few, but they were locked. Eventually, I found myself at an office called “Head of Security” with an open door. I quickly made my way inside, closing the door behind me as I looked around. 

There was a lot of blood, it was soaked into the white carpet and spattered on the walls and desk. I quickly made my way to the computer and turned it on. As the computer turned on, I got up and moved a file cabinet to block the door. 

“Sky!” I heard the man snap from somewhere in the hallway. 

I quickly made my way back to the computer, and as I placed my hands on the desk, I heard the man scream my name again. I jumped a little and put my head down for a second. I was stuck, and there was no way that I was going to win. For a split second, I was starting to accept that I was going to die. 

That was until I heard something open behind me. I glanced over my shoulder as I watched the wall part, and a soft ding rang out from the hidden elevator. As I watched, the elevator door opened before I noticed that the man who was following me tried the doorknob.

“Come with me.” A man said behind me, and without even thinking about it, I followed him into the elevator. 

\-

“Who are you?” I asked as fast as possible as I watched the blonde man grab his side. He wore a ripped-up long-sleeve shirt and torn black pants. 

“I was the Head of Security. Mike.” He coughed. 

“And what the hell happened?” I screamed. My voice cracked, and I felt like I was ready to throw up. 

“We didn’t find a Director in time, and they came to clean house. We operated relatively smoothly for six months. The Secretary to the Director got a call; she tried to get everyone out ahead of time, but it wasn’t enough.” Mike said as the elevator opened, and I followed him out.

The air was different, heavier. 

“Wait, where are we?” I asked as I looked around. 

“We are on the first floor, in the meeting room,” Mike said as he motioned for me to follow him through the empty room. 

“I think Sarah, the woman before you, was killed in the Map Room. We have to get to her weapon so you can kill-” I cut Mike off as we quickly ran out of the Meeting Room. 

“Were you here the whole time?” I asked him seriously as he slid a keycard out of his pocket. 

“Yes. I was dealing with the containment breach.” Mike said as he opened another door. We could hear slamming from somewhere above us. 

“Containment breach?” I mumbled, but Mike shook his head. 

“Now is not the time.” He said as we made our way into the Map Room. 

We had to jog down a long white hallway before reaching the room. I crossed my arms as I scanned the room. My whole body was shaking. Maps of the world surrounded us, some with different layers and others with what appeared to be missing countries. So far, this had been the biggest room I had ever seen. 

“I will explain all this to you later, when we make it out of here alive,” Mike said with a small smile, but I wasn’t so sure we’d be making it out of this. 

We searched for a while before I found the body of what I am assuming was a woman. She was missing her head, arms, and one of her legs. My eyes twitched as I examined the corpse. This is what was going to happen to me. I would be torn apart. 

As I searched her body, I had to hold back from throwing up. Before I knew it, I was crying; I wasn’t ready to die. I briefly wondered what death would be like. Is there anything after? Would anyone remember me? What would happen to everyone else? 

“Focus,” Mike said to me as I felt his hand on my shoulder. 

I moved Sarah's body and slid something out from under her, a dagger. A light one with a black blade. 

“Once you kill that thing, it will start a timer. We will have a week to find the Director, or they will send four of them.” Mike explained as I got up and slowly tried to steady my hand.

“What if we just try and leave?” I asked him as I rubbed some tears from my eyes. 

“I didn’t hear from anyone who made it out. When they want us fired, that means they want us dead.” Mike said as he met my eyes. 

“Only you can kill this thing. We never found out why. But you can do this.” He offered me another smile. I could only nod in response. 

\-

I slowly left the Map Room. As soon as I hit the lobby, I whistled. I really know why I didn’t call out. I couldn’t even bring myself to open my mouth. It was too much; this had all become way too much. I felt like my body was running on empty. My emotions are shot, my head constantly hurts, and my body is constantly sore. But if I failed here, everyone else would be killed too. 

Too much pressure. 

It’s all too much. 

\-

“Sky!” The man barked at me as he started to descend the stairs. He was clearly angrier; even from about 20 feet away, I could see his eyes bulging. It wasn’t until he sped up that I could see why his eyes looked like they were ready to leave his skull. He was pushing them out, I could tell by the way he was grunting. 

I tried to tell myself that I wasn’t afraid. I tried to tell myself it would all be okay. Everything would be okay, and we would take a long break once this was done. We’d find the Director. But those lies were forced out of my mind as the creature charged at me. 

Its body morphed, slowly. His arms snapped out of place to hang lower, and his mouth opened wider. The moment his eyes fell out of his body, I felt mesmerized. I had to mentally snap myself out of it. 

I ran forward, one slash or stab, and it would drop dead. At least I hoped it would be that easy. The creature swung its arm at me, and I moved under the swing, nearly tripping over myself. I swung my right arm and managed to slash the creature in the leg. I quickly turned around to see the damage I had done. The creature wasn’t bleeding; it was leaking sand. 

It paused and slowly turned its head 360 degrees before charging at me again. This time, when it opened its mouth, it shrieked. The sound slammed into my ears, and my vision slowly became blurry. 

This must’ve been how it killed Sarah. I thought before my back hit the ground with a hard thud. As soon as my eyes focused, I saw the mouth of the creature. I swung my left arm up to try and keep it at bay while I tried to force my right arm up. 

As soon as the creature lowered itself closer to me, I forced my left arm to cover my face. Its teeth sank into my flesh like tiny razor blades. As soon as it clamped down, I screamed, I screamed as hard as possible. It wasn’t letting go. I could feel the blood from my arm hitting my face and neck. It didn’t take me long to lose feeling in my fingers. 

With as much force as I could muster, I slammed the dagger into the side of its head. It finally let me go and practically threw itself off my body. I put my teeth together and blinked a few times; tears and blood ran down my lips. I quickly scrambled to my knees and rushed to the creature. It was twitching on the floor, and my dagger was stuck in the side of its head. 

I quickly pulled the dagger out; it was surprisingly easy. As soon as it was out, I slammed it back into the creature's head again, and again, and again. Eventually, I started screaming. I could feel the fear and pain pouring out of my body. 

I just kept stabbing. 

\-

“Sky!” Kelsey yelled as I felt her arms around me. 

I gasped and coughed a little as I clenched the dagger and let myself cry. I cried so hard my chest felt like it was burning from the inside. 

\-

Eventually, I woke up in my office with Caleb sitting next to me. He told me that he and Kelsey locked the body up in a box. It was dead, he was sure of it. Kelsey has been exploring the building as much as possible. He told me to rest and let them handle the rest. So that is what I am going to do for a while. I just need to [heal.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/)
