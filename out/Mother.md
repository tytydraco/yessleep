I barely remember my life before all this. Although I do remember--before my body showed any sign of the changes--opening my eyes one morning and seeing him beside me, his eyes cavernous with joy, a smile unlike any I'd ever seen. "You're going to be a mother, my darling."

"Mother"... is that what I am now? Whatever it is, I never wanted it. I suppose it once still felt like my choice. There were weeks when at least he tried to talk me into it. When his attempts to convince me made it at least \*feel\* like a choice I could refuse. He kept talking about "the miracle of life". A miracle for \*me\*. For my body to be capable of this. A miracle for \*him\*. To see me in these children and these children in me.

At first, I could only think of how painful it would be. He had no patience for that. "Oh, my love... is that your only fear? Surely you know that you are neither the first nor the last to give birth like this. Yes, it will be painful, but the pain will be nothing compared to what we create together."

He always says that: "together". But of course, it wasn't his body, it was mine. Or it used to just be mine. But my body doesn't belong just to me any more, does it? Where would the children be without it? 

In tears, once, after the first child, I saw us--the child and I--in the mirror together, and I fought back a scream. I couldn't recognize the person I saw. I... she... looked grotesque. But what can I do? He hates it when I don't eat. "You're not just eating for one anymore, my sweet. You have the nourishment of the children to consider." As if he cares about me, but only as a sort of vessel for them. I wish it were still just my body, and nobody else's. 

"Once you actually get to feel them, their skin on yours, their arms around your body... you'll forget all the fear and pain from before." But I know this is a lie now. I've heard it so many times and not once--not once when I've felt their skin on my skin, has it ever been true.

Maybe it would be different if I didn't remember the surgery. Didn't remember all the blood and that tiny body. Maybe if I couldn't feel a conneection form with that delicate, helpless one in the room with me--bloody and barely alive and just screaming--or trying to scream--over and over.

But when, WHEN, will I feel like a mother? How many times counting ten more little tiny fingers, ten more little tiny toes? Feeling little arms too weak to lift. Little legs too weak for me to stand on. How many times will my body have to change, have to undergo this "miracle of life"? How many surgeries will he put me through? How many children will he bring to me through those operating room doors? How many of their limbs will I have to feel, sewn on, against my skin. What will my body, my endlessly growing body, have to look like in the mirror before I see myself and recognize: Mother.
