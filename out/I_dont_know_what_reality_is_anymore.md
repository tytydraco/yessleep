I've been a paramedic for five years now. I've seen a lot of stuff my time, gunshots, babies being birthed at home, fingers lost on a table saw and too many slip and falls with the elderly. I try to keep the things I see from affecting me but after what I saw yesterday, I'm not even sure what to think.

Yesterday was just another day, my shift was nearly done. The day had been busy, three car crashes, no fatalities aside from one broken nose it was all bumps and bruises. I hate to say it but I was waiting for some action to finish off the day, I didn't expect this.

We got a call about a man walking in the mall in his boxers. He wasn't attacking anyone or acting out but he just seemed aimless, babbling nonsense.

When we saw him he was stumbling through the parking lot. When we walked up to him he tried to run but he was slow to move, almost like he was trying to run in slow motion. When I grabbed him he tried to fight back but he was so slow, like he was fighting through molasses.

We didn't have any trouble getting him strapped down on the gurney even while fighting us, this was weird because he wasn't a small guy. He must have been five foot eleven and around two hundred pounds, a similar weight to myself. This should have been a struggle but it wasn't. We had him buckled into the gurney and in the truck in record time, even old people are more difficult to wrangle.

We checked his vitals and tried to ask him a few questions but he kept talking ninsense, something about having a bad dream. Clearly he was having a bad trip on spice. Idecided to stay in the back while my partner drove. That's when I started to pay attention to what this man was saying.

"I need to wake up!" he tried to yell but it was more of a mumble "Wake up damn it!"

He started to close his eyes as hard as he could and open them.

"Don't worry buddy, we're going to get you help. Just relax." I tried to be reassuring but this guy was cooked.

"I need to get up, I have to get to work!" he said a little louder.

He squeezed his eyes shut again and then he was gone. The straps holding him down fell on the gurney, still buckled up, the indent in the cusion slowly faded. He was just gone. Like an effect from an old Twilight Zone episode, he was there and then he was gone. He didn't fade, he didn't get up nothing.

Just gone.

The doors opened to the back of the truck, my partner looked puzzeled.

"Where is he?" my partner asked, a puzzeled look on her face.

"I don't know" was all I could say.

We are both on leave for losing a patient, we have footage from the mall of us loading him up, dispatch has his description, now he's a missing person and everyone thinks I'm a nutcase.
