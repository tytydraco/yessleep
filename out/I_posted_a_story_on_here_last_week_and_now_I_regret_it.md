About a week ago I posted a story on this forum called "Last Night I Unknowingly Joined The Illuminati". First off, I need to reiterate... posting that story was a mistake. A big one.

Secondly... that story was 100 percent completely fake. I'm sorry. I know that the experiences written here are supposed to be true.  It detailed the fictional account of a young man who moved to LA to peruse his dreams in music and uncovered something sinister. Again, this story was untrue.

I deleted the post because something about it just didn't sit right, you know? It was too dark, I guess. But the thing is unfortunately, none of that will matter now.

Yesterday I woke up early to a notification.

*"Foolish. Do you think you can expose the secrets of the Illuminati so casually?"*

I stared at it my mouth open, my brow furrowing in confusion.

A troll, this early in the morning?

"Har-har that's hilarious." I pressed send.

The response was not what I expected.

"Read this carefully. You have made a grave mistake revealing such intimate secrets of the order. For this they will expect payment."

I felt a sudden flash of anxiety. This troll wasn't very funny. The Illuminati? It was a joke... a conspiracy theory like the Knights Templar and Area 51.

'You are living at 8868 Haberdash Lane, Bingleton"

I froze.

"If you want to continue to live you will read to this message very carefully. In five minutes two men in suits will knock on your door. DO NOT answer it. You must sneak out the back through your neighbours garden. The 406 bus will be leaving then, get on it."

I checked when the message was sent. Four minutes ago...

I looked out my front window in horror. Two men in suits were approaching the door. I jumped up from my desk and grabbed my phone, making my way out the back. I could hear them pounding the knocker as I hopped the fence.

I cut through my neighbours garden and then I saw it, the bus.

406

I jumped on, ducking into one of the seats, looking around paranoid. The bus mostly empty. The goofy ringtone I had chose for my phone began to play, any ounce of humour gone from it, now taunting.

"H-hello" I said under my breath.

Their voice was being modulated: "Good you know how to listen." The voice was almost robotic, was it text-to-speech?

"Keep doing that and maybe you'll live"

The voice told me that they were not a member of the Illuminati, but in fact an anonymous rival group set on helping their victims. All of this sounded like complete and utter insanity. They told me that the men who were at my door were assassins. They would have been able to take my life and make it look like I had slipped on a banana and hit my head. I was in severe danger.

The voice assured me they had a plan. The pursuers would need payment of some sort for my misdoings. Thankfully, the robotic voice told me this didn't need to be in blood... All I had to do was go to a specified location and pick up a package. They would then orchestrate the drop off and if all went well... I would be safe.

*There was no other option.*

The robotic voice told me to catch a train to the north, in the highlands. If I moved quickly I would lose them for long enough to retrieve the package. It gave me the address for a cottage and said when I arrived to knock three times and say aloud a phrase which I won't recall here.

Naive I was to have hope.

I arrived at the house in the middle of a highland storm. Wind and rain pelted the cobble roof of the cottage. There wasn't another house for at least a mile in either direction. I looked out to the green of the fields beyond the fences of stone, sheep grazed in the distance.

I walked up to the door, my head down in my elbow fighting against the wind. I knocked on the heavy wooden door three times as instructed. Nothing.

The weather vane spun around rapidly, rattling in the wind.

I tried again three times, and said the password more clearly. Maybe they couldn't hear because of the storm? I gently pushed the door and it creaked open.

I was too late.

A man lay in a pool of blood at a small wooden table face down, a pen in hand. I walked cautiously fearing the killers could still be around. There was a note.

*"I'm sorry. They took the artifact... they will surely be after you next. Get them to open it and look away!"*

Suddenly I heard a car make it's way up the gravel drive. It was the men from before.

I hopped out the kitchen window and started sprinting. I had no idea where I was going, my legs propelled by pure adrenaline. I made my way up the hill behind the house. I was halfway up when they noticed, they started in chase, but I had a sizable lead on them.

I just had to hide...

I got to the precipice of the hill, I could see for miles and miles in either direction. This was no time to admire the country side, I had to hide... but it was no use. There was nothing, not even a boulder to hide behind.

"Admirable." The man said coldly.

"P-please!" I pleaded.

"I won't say anything... you got the package, isn't it enough?"

"It is... but I don't like loose ends" his voice like ice.

This was it... they were going to shoot me. I was going to die here on this hill in a foreign country thousands of miles from where I was born. They would say I just 'disappeared'. I would be another cold case, another unsolved mystery.

"W-w-WAIT!" I yelled as confidently as I could.

"Y-you don't know if that's even the 'artifact' you're after" I still had no idea what any of this talk of artifacts was.

"It's a d-decoy. Open it! You'll see. Open it."

The men looked at each other eyebrows raised. One raised his sunglasses and rested them on his forehead. He pulled a switchblade from a pocket and flipped it open.

"Don't move" he ordered.

I watched as he removed a small ornate box from the packaging. It was pitch black, it was if it was actually absorbing the light within a radius. It was inlaid with white and gold.

"This is it?" the man said gesturing to his partner.

"I think so? It's one of them at least..."

"You need to look inside! The treasure is kept inside. It's a fake." I said desperately clinging to straws. The men looked at each other incredulously. The one not holding the box nodded as if to say "why not?".

I watched as the man clicked the latch and popped the lid open. The men gasped as they peered inside, a bright light emanating from the box. It was like my eyes were being drawn to the light. I had to fight to look away.

The last thing I saw before the light became unbearable was the box and the men floating mid air. Even with my eyes closed all I could see was white. I heard them scream but it was like their voices were being sucked into a black hole. The electromagnetic sound was almost unbearable. Then it stopped.

I heard something fall to the ground. I fearfully half-opened my eyes worried I would experience whatever the men just did. They were gone. The box lay on the ground. I picked it up cautiously, careful not to open it.

I don't know what compelled me to do it. Fear? Worry? I made my way to the cliff overlooking the sea and hurled that box into the depths, I prayed something so dangerous was never to be found again. My phone rang as I walked up to the cottage. It was the voice.

"What happened? Did you deliver the package?"

I stood silent for a moment and spoke.

"Your friend is dead... the pursuers are dead... I threw the box into the ocean"

"Damn..." the voice said defeated.

"I cannot help you now. Surely the police are on the way. They will pin it on you if they find you. Even if you get out of there, the next set of assassins will find you within the day... I'm sorry..." the line went dead.

That brings me to where I'm at now. I ran from the cottage and made my way into the hills. I found a cave. It's been raining for hours and I'm freezing. It's over for me... I'm shaking as I type this.

I think I hear a helicopter in the distance, that must be them... I should have tossed my phone into the sea as well. It wouldn't have mattered...

I guess this is it.

I just want to say. I think there is another artifact. I saw a map in the cottage with different locations. In fact there is even one right in the middle of yrsyjjjjj,,,,,,,,d.......
