Kamael. The first time I saw him everything was so clear, glistening and vibrant behind those cloudy unfocused lenses. The halls reverberated with the holy sounds of ancient cries. 

Something about this work drew me to a specific type of soundtrack, the atmosphere begged to be aided by the trilling of angels. I may not be the most traditionally religious person but death must to be revered. To say the morgue is one of the quietest places on earth is to be sleeping during a violent thunderstorm. 

The morning was filled with the lifting and folding of bodies, cramped into tight iron boxes, ready to be broken down into their most basic components. The washing of crimson tides, each space of the gargantuan warehouse laced with drains and the sprayer by my side. Each day damp and cold, my body covered in rubber. From the wet hum of the machine to the crashing of the blades as bones ground into dust. Each day numerous bodies transmutated from a form filled with mass to a small bag of fine particles. Energy not lost but transformed, physically morphed but unchanged. Wooden boxes filled and secured ready to return home to the living. All the while the familiar chant of monks and ascetics aiding me with their prayers. There is only one way to handle the dead and dying, with devotion. Perhaps this is why he appeared to me. 

Nearly finished with the daily activities, the river  fading as the large squeegee cleared the seemingly endless flow. New boxes packed with those awaiting their final ride. My focus pin pricked on the dangerous metal behemoth that stood before me. The maw as deep and perilous as any abyss. It didn’t take long to learn how many seconds were needed for the gnawing teeth to completely pulverize a skeleton. My counting began once the lever had been switched, mind silent, contemplating the prayer being sung by this most recent congregation. When the seconds dwindled, 34, 35, 36, something interrupted my usual obsessive focus on the work at hand. 

A glint in his eye, head tilted at an inhuman angle, mouth agape, life had returned. The sounds around me ceased to exist, lights shuttered and the world known to me flittered out of existence. All I could see was those eyes, not just the physicality of his eyeballs locking with mine, the intimate hold of one soul gazing into the depths of another, but the voice behind them. Disembodied and brilliant, like a meteor shower appearing in the deepest darkness of midnight. 

That is when I first heard his voice. The thrum began as a slow vibration causing me to catch my breath and brace myself against the cremulator. Stomach churning, this vibration built into a hum that shook my bones, all my mind and body as I knew it began to puddle out onto the floor. My vision falling to a tunnel with those eyes being the only light, a hope for escape. I stumbled towards the body, reaching out towards the light, grasping for a sense of reality. A faint but deliberate echo ruptured from those cold unmoving lips “I am. I am. I am.” 

Awakened by a shuttering pain, surroundings slowly registering with my conscious mind. Damp and shivering against the cold concrete floor. The fluorescent lights twinkling, the ever present blueness of the room taking over once again. The voice could have only come from one other in the room, my eyes tilted upwards and I saw him again. Lifeless and twisted in that box, gazing towards the heavens, the Gregorian chant resuming. The glint had faded and only death and gloom now resided in those empty, glossy, windows. The chemical composition of my world forever altered by a chance conversation, no speaking, no hearing, only vision and voice.
