I’m sharing my story in the hope that it may help those of you who are also haunted find peace.



The trash bins in my apartment complex were tucked away in the courtyard, and I made my way toward them, guided only by the moon’s silvery glow. The rustling wind through the trees and bushes, along with the faint hum of the city beyond the walls, was my only company. However, as I tossed the trash into the bin, those accompanying sounds abandoned me. In an instant, all sound disappeared, as if someone had pressed mute. My senses sharpened in the sudden, eerie silence. I glanced around - nothing. I closed the bin and turned to head back, only to stop cold. Where moments before there had been empty space, a female figure now stood in the middle of my path. At first, I thought she was standing on her toes, her head tilted slightly, as though she were intently observing something. Then I noticed something that sent a chill down my spine: she wasn’t touching the ground.



I jolted awake, drenched in sweat. The clock on my nightstand showed I had overslept by nearly an hour - my usual phone alarm hadn’t gone off. Panicking, I rushed out of the apartment and headed to the university, where my psychology class was about to start. Still shaken by the nightmare, I quietly slipped into the back of the auditorium and spotted my friends sitting to the right. I chose a seat in the far back on the left.



I hadn’t started working on the case study that was due the next day, so after class, I hurried to the library. As I rushed down the hallway, I heard my friends calling out to me, their voices filled with concern, asking if I was okay. But I couldn’t afford to be distracted. I kept my head down, quickened my pace, and slipped away before they could catch up. I knew there were quiet spots in the back of the library where I could focus. However, time slipped away without any progress; my mind felt like a jumble of memories I couldn’t piece together. I pulled out my phone several times but put it back in my pocket without turning it on. Slowly, people left until I was alone, surrounded by empty desks, tall shelves, and creeping darkness. As I stared blankly at my laptop screen, I suddenly noticed an unnatural darkness tugging at the edge of my vision, pulling me back to reality.



For a long moment, I kept my head turned toward the screen, my eyes glued to the shadow beside me. It was a dark figure swaying faintly, as if suspended by an invisible thread. Its legs hung limply, toes pointed downward, hovering just above the ground. My blood froze. I held my breath, paralyzed. Then the smell hit me - a piercing stench of rotten meat. I blinked. The shadow stretched its arms, unnaturally long, reaching toward me. Panic surged through me. I grabbed my laptop and backpack. I ran, eyes down, refusing to face whatever loomed over me.



That night, I barricaded myself in my bedroom with my laptop, staring at endless internet videos, hoping to fall asleep. But sleep wouldn’t come. I knew I had to face the dark hallway to get to the bathroom. Each step back toward my room felt like an eternity, my tunnel vision making me question who was in control of my body. 

Silently praying I was alone, I froze when a sickening snap echoed behind me. My eyes darted to the end of the hallway - and there she was, barely visible in the darkness. She hung there, legs dangling lifelessly. This time, I didn’t wake up, no matter how desperately I wanted to. My throat tightened, ready to ask why she could not let me go. But as if she could hear my thoughts, her black eyes swirled with rage and torment, and her mouth twisted into a grimace. Another snap echoed through the hallway as her neck stretched impossibly, a cruel mockery of her life. Then, with horrifying determination, she began to move toward me. Her body jerked forward, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings, feet scraping against the floor.



I crashed into my bedroom, slammed the door shut, and locked it with trembling hands. But the sounds didn’t stop. What started as soft, tentative taps quickly escalated into thunderous pounding, as if an unseen force was violently slamming her body against the door, driven by mounting rage. Desperate, I pulled out my phone to call for help.



What finally broke me wasn’t the horrific knocking but the notifications on my phone after turning it on. Dozens of missed calls and messages from friends and family - condolences. It hit me like a relentless wave, crashing against the dam of emotions I had built to hold everything back. And that dam began to crack. The first sob broke free - a raw, guttural sound that surprised me, must have been the first sound I had made in a while. I tried to fight back the tears, but the pounding on the door matched the racing of my heart, and another sob tore its way out. Then came another, and another, until the floodgates burst open. Tears streamed down my face, hot and unrelenting, each drop carrying the weight of unexpressed grief, guilt, and regret. The guilt of not being there for her. The guilt of not realizing sooner how much pain she was in. The guilt of not telling her the things that truly mattered.



I surrendered to the catharsis, each sob a release of the pain I had held inside. And when the tears finally ran dry, the pounding had ceased. Silence engulfed the room. Exhausted, I crawled into bed and drifted into the first deep sleep I’d had in a long time.



Life returned to a quiet rhythm. Days passed uneventfully; the campus buzzed with its usual noise, and my friends stopped asking if I was okay. But every now and then, late at night, when the world was still, I’d hear it again. A faint tap - barely there, like a distant echo. It always came when I was on the edge of sleep, pulling me back to a place between waking and dreaming. Sometimes it was just a single creak, like old wood settling. I told myself it was nothing - the house, the wind, the natural sounds of the night. But in those moments, my heart would race, my breath would catch, and I’d stare at the ceiling, waiting. Listening. The silence would return, stretching out like a long, dark road. But I knew it could happen again. Because forgiveness, it turns out, isn’t a one-time thing. It’s something I have to choose over and over, each time the echoes return. And some nights, they do.
