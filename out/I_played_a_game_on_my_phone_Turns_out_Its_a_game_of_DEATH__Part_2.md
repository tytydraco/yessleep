 I thought it was all over. But that message... still sent chills down my spine. I had to know what happened that night. Even if it killed me. So I boarded a flight to New York to find out everything. 

Our old house was right there near Times square and I finally went there too. 

When I opened the door, I didn't know what would happen. I saw the house and it was completely normal. I checked the kitchen but Mom wasn't there. 

I checked the bathroom and all the rooms... and she wasn't there. I went into my old room. I entered my old room and saw a phone with the damn game still running. Giggle Rot.

 I pressed 'Start,' but this time, there were no bodies or gold to collect. Instead, the game told me to 'collect my Mother'. And all of a sudden, the game crashed.

 I heard something... at first I didn't know what it was. Shortly after I realized it was whispers. I decided to follow them. It led me to the window... From there, I saw it. Me—killing Mom. Blood stained the floor. After this thing that pretended to be me killed her, it turned and stared right at me. 

I tensed up and looked down. At that moment, I was scared to my life.

But I didn't know that was nothing compared to what would happen now. I heard someone breathing behind me... I heard someone breathing behind me. turned around and I saw... my father. He looked disappointed, yet calm. He didn't say a word ... and I was sure he was going to kill me.

 Suddenly, a sudden knock echoed through the silent house, making my heart skip a bit. Dad slowly walked towards the door of the house and remained silent... he opened it. 

And there she was. Mom, alive and smiling that twisted smile from the night he "killed" her. She laughed mocking, cruel. I took a step back, but he grabbed me. Then Mom struck me. Darkness swallowed me. I woke up, my wrists bound tightly. Panic surged through me...I was trapped. 

I was terrified from the fact that my Mom wasn't dead. She was alive... but there was something strange about her. All I could see was darkness until I heard a door open. "who's there?" I asked. "It's me" Dad said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. He came closer and whispered "I will kill her again... I'll do it for you" and walked back.

 He was driving me crazy... so I started screaming. As loud as I could. But no one heard me. I looked at him with anger and tears, but he was too indifferent to show compassion. A moment later, I heard Dad calling Mom. Soon, she appeared. 

She stared at me and I didn't move. It seemed as if she was enjoying every moment as she begun to smile maliciously.

 She started to move and came a little closer. Suddenly Dad pulled out a knife and stabbed her in the stomach. She screamed very loudly. 

And every second she continued to scream, the scream sounded more and more distorted. Until it wasn't her anymore. It sounded like a monster. Dad went on to stab her in the throat and in the left eye. 

Mom bled...not red blood, but a thick, black fluid oozing from her wounds. The black fluid oozed like tar, unnatural and terrifying. Dad’s stern expression crumbled, tears streaming uncontrollably down his face. I cried so hard I couldn't stop...

 I've never cried like that in my life. Mom could no longer scream because her vocal cords were broken. 

Her eyes turned completely black. And I still felt like she was looking at me straight in the eye. And then she collapsed. Dad kept crying and ran out of the house. 

After a while I managed to free myself from the rope. Only then did I understand. Dad wasn't the villain... No. he was trying to save me. My mother... she was no longer the woman I once knew. She had become a monster. Suddenly I received a message on my phone saying "Are you ready for round 3? "

 I started laughing. I took the phone and burned it in the fireplace. That's it, it's over. My mother really died this time. And that's a good thing. I looked at the fireplace to see the phone melt away but my smile vanished... the phone...

IT.DIDN'T.BURN

 So I'll ask you this. 

What would you do? would you play round 3?
