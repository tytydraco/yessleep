*FYI, I'm writing this late in the night so I apologize for any mistakes I might make in the text below.*

Ever since I was 9, I've noticed that, at random, I can see a few seconds into the future. In fact, I had this happen to me today. Most of the time, these predictions aren't important, and I've kinda gotten used to having them.

However, there's been one time where one of them could have saved a couple of my bones.

Before I talk about the 'star of the show', I'll give you some examples of what these predictions usually are.

One time, I was out eating ice cream with some friends and noticed the things they spoke sound familiar. Suddenly, something 'clicked' in my head and I knew what one of my friends was about to say. I was pretty confused at first, but that was nothing compared to my confusion afterwards. That friend had said, word for word, what I knew they were about to say.

Some of you might be saying "It must be Déja Vu or something" but I believe it's more than that. Déja Vu is the feeling of an environment, something you're experiencing for the first time feeling familiar, whereas every time I predict something, not only are the events that happen unique most of the time, they happen in the future and play out exactly as I expect them to.

Now, let me move on to the time one of these visions saved me from a lot of pain.

I was riding my bike around my neighborhood, can't really tell why but that doesn't matter. I turn around after reaching the 'end' of my neighborhood's area, which is separated by a gate from the street outside.

As I start pedalling I feel like something is off. I was driving close to a wall of a building, which hid my view of a road in my neighborhood. If this isn't really making sense to you, I'm describing an European neighborhood. Anyways, right as I was about to go on the road I think to myself "STOP". I didn't know why I stopped at that moment but I pictured a black SUV moving silently, but fast down the road I was about to enter. That's when I realized what was happening. Barely a second later, the scene I had imaginated unfolded right in front of my own eyes. 

A large, black SUV rolled right past me, barely making any noise for me to notice it. 

The road is quite narrow, it's barely able to fit 2 cars next to each other, so if I continued riding I would have definitely been hit by that car.

After that happened I just stood there, stunned, knowing that I just miraculously saved myself. 

I haven't had something of bigger severity like this happen to me yet.

I still don't know how this is happening. Is my brain subconsciously predicting these events? But then, how would they be so incredibly accurate?

If we're all in a simulation, is it that my mind is buffering a little too much data, causing me to know things that haven't happened yet? 

Nobody knows.

What I do know is that I saved myself a lot of trouble because of my 'skill' one time.
