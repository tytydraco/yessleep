I first heard of the Letling Room nine years ago. I was a detective then, investigating the death of a brilliant physicist. Or should I say, former physicist. She had once studied dark energy at one of the top universities in the country. Yet one day, she had abruptly quit with zero notice and never published again. In the chaos of her apartment, there was, haphazardly placed amidst piles of papers with crossed out equations and diagrams I couldn't even pretend to understand, a hastily scribbled note,: *The Man In The Letling Room is the ONLY answer*. I had flipped through her diary, curious if it had any clues as to who this mysterious man might be.

In her diary, she wrote of a place called the Letling Room. She described it in precise methodical detail:

*It is not large, about seven by five meters, dusty, dimly let yet there is no lamp, candle or any light source whatsoever to be seen, and no window or any means to let light in from outside. In fact there is no door or any disruption in the smooth walls to indicate an entrance or exit. On the dusty wooden floorboards are piles of books and ornaments with strange writing on them, but the closer one looks, the blurrier they become, so it is impossible to say for certain what is in the books or what the ornaments depict. It is absolutely silent. There is but one piece of furniture in the room, a dusty, high-backed armchair facing away from me. I can't see who sits there, but it is axiomatically obvious to me that someone does, and he is the answer to every question I've tried to answer and failed: The Man In the Letling Room.*

She had, according to her diary, never been to the Letling Room, and seen it only once in a dream, right before she quit her job, and then never again. But I sat down to read through the diary, and sure enough, she wrote about the Letling Room constantly, in increasingly long and unhinged entries, trying desperately to derive an answer to various physics problems, a chaotic sea of matrices and numbers and Greek letters. But every single time, it would all come back to the same answer, repeatedly circled and underlined, sometimes with such vigor that it tore the page: *The Man In The Letling Room.* The final entry was comparatively short and to the point, a few days before her body was found: *11/04/2015. I give up. I've spent my entire life trying to understand why the universe is the way it is. It's the only thing I've ever had. The only thing that makes me happy. And the only answer that can ever make any sense is the man in the fucking Letling Room. FUCK HIM and fuck all the therapists who just repeat 'He's not real' like a broken record. Forget it. I'm done wasting my life.*

That physicist's death was officially ruled a suicide, brought on by paranoid schizophrenia. It was, I suppose, a fairly open-and-shut case. There was a note, an empty bottle of pills, no signs of foul play. Life moved on, and the Letling Room drifted to the back of my mind as newer cases piled up, especially after I got married, moved across the country, and went private--less mindless bureaucracy, more interesting cases that way. Not to brag, but I even managed to crack a couple of high-profile cases  that had been cold for years. And I suppose I forgot about The Man In The Letling Room. For a while, in any case.

Three years later, I was at a bar, three beers in and chatting with some random guy, an older gentleman named Ross who was an archaeologist from the local university. He'd had a few more than I had and seemed all too happy to ramble on about his students and his work--he'd apparently spent over twenty years studying some Bronze Age tribe in the Caucasus and trying to figure out why they'd suddenly disappeared, 3200 years ago. "But that's all in the past," he told me, "Today was my last day! I'm retiring and heading up north to my cousin's farm."

"Okay, congratulations. But why now? Weren't you just on the cusp of figuring out what happened to the Karganians?" I said.

"On the cusp?" said Ross, "Nah man, I've figured it out completely. Hell, I've figured out why everything that's happened in human history has happened. You could even say I've solved History itself. No need to keep working on it. I got into this field to understand it all, and now I do."

Something seemed off  about that, especially the passion and conviction he said it with. Could just be a drunk guy rambling in a bar, but you don't get far as a PI by shrugging off clues as just drunk ramblings. "So tell me. Why has all this shit gone down the way it has?" I said.

He grinned broadly and clapped me on the shoulder. "Why, The Man In The Letling Room, of course," he said with a hearty chuckle.

*Bam*. It hit me in an instant, like a bucket of ice water to the face. I remembered the details of that one case from three years ago and three thousand miles away. Dead physicist. Suicide. The haunting, eerie description of the place she called the Letling Room. I narrowed me eyes. "And who the *hell*," I said slowly, "is The Man In The Letling Room?"

"He's the answer to everything I've been trying to figure out," said Ross. He downed the rest of his beer, belched, and continued, "See, a couple weeks ago, I was smoking a blunt and started hallucinating, which is weird 'cause weed doesn't normally do that to me, y'know? But I saw this creepy little room where I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, it was silent as a grave, and there were these books and figurines all over the floor, but any time I tried to look at one, it was just blurry gibberish. And the only furniture was--"

"An armchair?" I ventured. I became vaguely aware that my heart  was racing and I was clenching my beer way too hard.

"Huh. You're damn right" he said, "Anyway, so it was facing away from me so I couldn't see who was in it, but I just had this *feeling* that The Man In The Letling Room was sitting in that chair, I *knew* he was there, and *he* was the answer to all of it. Not just the Karganians, but everything that's happened that that we don't know why. He didn't say anything, I didn't see him, but that's okay. I've found out everything I've always wanted to know!"

He paused, ordered another drink, then turned to me, seeing the look on my face. "Say, how'd you know about the armchair? Have you seen the Letling Room too?"

"I...well...I knew someone who did," my drunk brain managed to stutter out, "She told me about it once."

"Oh!" he chuckled, "Well, good for her!"

"She's dead," I said quietly.

Ross's face fell. "Well, I'm truly sorry to hear that," he said. He pushed his stool back and stood up. "Anyhow, I'd best be going, I'm leaving early tomorrow. Have a good evening."

"Wait!" I said, "You're just walking away from, what, forty years as an archaeologist because you hallucinated some weirdo in a chair? Giving up on your life's work?"

"I told you," he said, "I've just *finished* my life's work." And with that, he was gone.

I couldn't sleep that night. After a few hours of tossing and turning, I gave up and sat in my study thinking until the sun rose and my wife Sara brought coffee. Two seemingly random people, across the country, who saw the same eerie vision, described it the same, and spoke of The Man In The Letling Room. One quit her job, fell into a deep depression, and killed herself. One quit his job, seemed to be in bright spirits, and wasn't dead, at least not yet.

There had to be a connection. There always was. I pulled every stop, called in every favor I had, spent weeks trying to find any connection between these two people, putting all my other cases on the back burner. But there was nothing. No sign either had ever posted about the Letling Room online. No sign they'd ever exchanged private correspondence, or even knew each other. Two people had genuinely seen the Letling Room, completely independently of each other, then uprooted their lives because of the mysterious Man In The Letling Room, whom neither of them saw, but insisted was real.

If there were two, perhaps there would be others. I turned all my energy to scouring the country, and even the world, for more people who saw the Letling Room. My work suffered greatly for this, and in a few short  months, I was fired from my firm. Sara, sweet and supportive to a fault, hugged me, gave me a gentle kiss, and assured me that we'd get through this together, even took a second job to make ends meet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

With her taking care of us, I continued my work. My true work, my real calling, finding The Man In The Letling Room. And I made real progress. I did track down a number of other people who'd seen the Letling Room. My notes and diagrams and photos filled every wall of my study, and slowly I began to piece together patterns. I was pretty good at that, you see, it's a big part of why I ended up as a PI.

No one ever says they've actually *been* to the Letling Room, or even know where it is. They just see it in dreams in visions, or simply, inexplicably know about it without ever having been told by anyone, and are always alone, except for that mysterious presence in the chair that they cannot see. They always describe the exact same thing and always know it as the Letling Room, even if they have never heard of it before and never seen or heard that name. It doesn't even matter what language they speak, it's always  the Letling Room. Believe me, I should know: I even interviewed--entirely through Google Translate--a despondent former mathematician in Uzbekistan who had burned his life's work, dismissing it as "trivial and flawed, broken proofs" and turned to herding goats in the mountains, and even he called it the Letling Room and referred to that presence as The Man In The Letling Room, and said he was the true answer to all his conjectures, and he no longer felt the need to study mathematics. Described that damn room exactly the same as everyone else, too.

But not just anyone knows of the Letling Room. Those who have seen it are those who obsessively study the deepest mysteries and the hardest questions known to humanity, in many different fields, almost always truly brilliant luminaries,  who have devoted their lives to knowledge and made sacrifices and difficult choices to be where they are. Those who have embraced their obsession and become one with it. That is their typical profile.

Yet after they see the Letling Room, they inevitably cease their work and stop seeking to understand the universe. They quietly feel, in their hearts, that this, truly, is what the answers they seek all boil down to. Some, like Ross the archaeologist, give up the pursuit of knowledge in exaltation because they believe that all their questions have been answered, and that answer is The Man In The Letling Room. Some give up out of despair, feeling that they will never find an answer other than simply The Man In The Letling Room. And some give up out of sheer weariness or fear or many other reasons, but invariably, those who see the Letling Room in their mind's eye have made their final contribution to the tapestry of human knowledge. Many people do kill themselves as a result, perhaps a quarter of those who have seen it. But not everyone dies or is even directly harmed by their experience. It depends a lot on their personality. But one thing is constant: when they see the Letling Room and feel the presence of The Man In The Letling Room, they forever abandon the pursuit of knowledge that once drove every fiber of their being.

In spite of these successes, I never drew any closer to my ultimate goal, to find out where is the Letling Room and who is The Man In The Letling Room. And I must admit, I was far from the best husband during those years. While Sara worked long hours, waitressing by day and working in a warehouse at night, I was holed up in my office all day and well into the night, searching for clues, or else hitting the road to investigate witnesses of the Letling Room and their families and friends. And when she was home, I was always either wrapped up in this great mystery, or sound asleep in my office chair, or scarfing down a meal before racing back to my office.

And she too started to grow cold and distant in turn. I think on some level, I must have seen the signs.  She stopped massaging my shoulders, stopped bringing coffee in the mornings, stopped calling me "my love". Somewhere along the line, there was a last time we slept together, a last kiss, a last meal we shared together. If I hadn't noticed any of those, perhaps I could've noticed her crying herself to sleep alone in our bed, or the open tab on her phone with a Google search for divorce lawyers. Perhaps I could've realized that she was--understandably--coming to resent me, suffering through long hours of backbreaking labor while I obsessed over some strange mystery instead of working as most people understand it. That with my long hours locked in the study until late into the night, and my constant random trips to interview witnesses, she would start to think there was another woman, or perhaps even several. But I brushed it all off, for solving this mystery, finding The Man In The Letling Room and putting a stop to whatever he was doing to people was more important than work, more important than love.

It all came to a head one night three years ago, around 2 AM. I was expecting a call from a lead, the daughter of a German neurologist who had woken up one night raving about the hard problem of consciousness and "Der Mann Im Letling-Zimmer"; he was now missing, presumed dead. But I had dozed off and I suppose Sara had heard the buzz of my phone and pounced on it, and seen the WhatsApp photo of my lead--a blonde, busty twenty-something. Sara had grimly marched into my study, barely holding back tears, and shaken me awake, thrusting the phone in my face without a word.

I blearily glanced at her face, stroking my beard--it had grown unkempt and scraggly in the three years since I was fired--and tried to devise the most optimal response. "I know how it looks, but don't worry," I said at last, "She's just a lead. I think she might know someone who has more info on The Man In The Letling Room."

Sara reacted faster than I could've expected, dropping my phone with a clatter and slapping me in the face. It hurt more than it logically should have, and not just physically. In that moment, it felt more like she'd slapped my soul. "Man In The Letling Room, my ass! More like the woman in your hotel room!" she snapped.

I sighed heavily, took a sip of lukewarm coffee, and glanced at a case report: some Harvard philosopher who'd abruptly walked away from his job to start a new life in South America. "Sara, I promise I'd never. You know me," I said softly.

"No, I don't, Jason. Not anymore," she retorted. She sank to the floor, her back to the wall, no longer able to hold the tears in. "You know, it was my birthday today, and you didn't even say anything. After *everything* I've done for you, the three *years* I've stood by your side while you did fuck-all and didn't even give a shit about me, let me work myself to the bone, weren't even there when my grandma died, and THIS is how you fucking repay me?!"

"I'm...I'm so sorry," I said at last, "And, uh, happy birthday."

"You have to go. Get out," Sara said shakily.

She locked herself in the bedroom the next day while I packed my things, didn't respond when I said goodbye through the door. I spent the night in some seedy motel, staring at the ceiling tiles and fantasizing about crashing through the wall of the Letling Room, tipping over that stupid chair, and beating the shit out of The Man In The Letling Room, whoever or whatever he was.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was clear there was only one path forward now, and  that was to continue my calling with redoubled energy. So that's exactly what I did, wandering from place to place to investigate whatever leads came up and working odd jobs for spare cash. Sometimes couchsurfing, sometimes sleeping out of my car, sometimes stopping by a random library to add info to my ever-growing Google drive filled with profiles of those who have seen the Letling Room.

There must have been hundreds of witnesses by that point, at the very least. I was starting to find more and more of them. I don't know if that's because I was getting better and better at finding them--to be fair I was, but I still had my fair share of false positives--or if more people are actually starting to encounter The Man In The Letling Room. But I have noticed that knowing about him tends to increase the probability that one will eventually, well, not visit, for I increasingly don't think it's a place you can find on a map, but somehow have a mental picture and memory of the Letling Room, and feel the mysterious presence in that chair. At least for those with the risk factors, the thirst to answer hard questions and the drive to sacrifice it all for the answers.

Some of the living witnesses have speculated about the nature of The Man In The Letling Room. Some say he's God. Some say he goes far beyond that. Some say he wants to hurt humanity, some say he wants to help, some say he simply doesn't care. Some swear that if they could somehow see just go to that room for real and look at that armchair...that it would be *empty*. But for most, he's simply The Man In The Letling Room.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

About a year ago, I was at a rest stop on some godforsaken stretch of highway somewhere in the Midwest, with nothing but the highway, thinly populated with trucks, slicing ruler-straight across endless flat fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. The bitter cold sliced right through my thrift-store coat, too thin to provide any real protection, and flurries drifted in the air. I had just interviewed a fellow disgraced PI, now slowly drinking himself to death in a trailer in the middle of nowhere, who'd insisted that The Man In The Letling Room was responsible for every case he'd ever failed to crack, and was on my way to investigate a dead quantum physicist in Boulder, apparently a suicide, and speak with his family.

It was getting towards sunset, and I'd been driving across past these never-ending fields all day, so I figured I would pull over and take a nap before continuing. And as I ate my ham-and-cheese sandwich and sipped my coffee, staring morosely into the distant fields, I suddenly remembered something. Sitting there, in that rest stop, out of nowhere, *I remembered seeing the Letling Room*.

I don't know when or how, but the memory was just as vivid as if it had been yesterday, and I remembered seeing it *myself*, not just imagining it from other peoples' descriptions of it. It was like all the hundreds of people had described it: a small room dimly lit from an unknown source, with piles of books and ornaments on the floor, and that mysterious armchair, facing away from me because of course it fucking was. I somehow remembered picking up one of those books, only for the contents to melt away to an illegible blur as soon as I focused on them. I remembered realizing with absolute certainty that The Man In The Letling Room, whoever or whatever he was, sat in that armchair. I remembered hurling the book at the back of the chair in a fit of rage, and that The Man In The Letling Room did not react in any way whatsoever, nor was the absolute silence broken as the book hit the chair and fell to the floor. I remembered wanting to step forward and see what was in the chair.

And that was all that I remembered of my experience with the Letling Room, regardless of whenever and wherever it may have been, or if it even truly happened. But it was enough. In that moment in the rest stop, I was absolutely, unshakably certain that this was as good as it was ever going to get, that this was the closest I would ever come to an answer, no matter how much I tried, no matter how hard I thought, no matter how much evidence I gathered. This was it. The Man In The Letling Room is the explanation for all that is inexplicable and the answer to all that is unanswerable. That's all. A pity I wasted all these years and ruined my life, only to arrive at that conclusion.

That night, I burned all of my case files in an empty field. There was no more need for them. That revelation in that random rest stop was the end of the line, the furthest I or anyone else  was ever going to get towards solving the mystery, I knew that  with absolute confidence from the moment I felt the presence of The Man In The Letling Room. The next morning, I stopped in the first town I came across and settled down there.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It's been a year since that fateful day. I'm doing alright now, I suppose. I mostly keep to myself now, eking out  a living flipping burgers in this random town. Sometimes I think about my old line of work, or about trying to track down Sara to apologize and explain myself. But what's the point? I and countless others have tried and failed to search for answers and explanations to the deepest mysteries time and again. It's not worth it. The only thing you'll ever find is The Man In The Letling Room.
