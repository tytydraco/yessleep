“No one ever visits the McKenna’s”. That’s what Liam told me when me and my family first moved into Wayward.

 

“Why?”

 

“Dude, be real. Do you really think people like that want to be bothered by people like us?”

 

The Mckenna Manor was massive, to say the least. 5 acres of lush dense greenery surrounding the property, all well maintained, and the hedges trimmed into different shapes from lions to elephants. The house itself was immaculate. A 3-story manor with over 70 windows with some even being made from stained glass. The exterior was painted entirely white, except for the roof, which was made of dark grey tiles. I even had to squint a little to see with how bright the paintwork had become in the midday sun. The property had a fleet of gardeners and security guards patrolling it and keeping its exterior pristine.

 

“What about them?” I said while pointing at the security guards.

 

“I doubt it. My Dad said people like the McKenna’s wouldn’t need to talk to their workers since they’re all probably paid online. I heard Alex’s Dad is one of the gardeners though.”

 

“Who’s he?”

 

“Don’t worry about it. You’ll come across him in school, he usually sticks to the new kids before people can tell them how weird he is.”

 

“Oh.”

 

“Come on, I'll show you around the neighborhood.”

 

The town of Wayward looked like it had come straight out of one of those old adverts where the family’s skin is a little too clear, their teeth a little too white, and their kindness a little too genuine. It was the epitome of traditional American ideologies with its residents all little homebodies, close-knit neighbors, and dream chasers. Liam showed me everything the town had to offer, which wasn’t much since it only took us 10 minutes to see everything as we peddled around on our bikes. It was clear from the start that this town ran on their faith in the church with a pair of missionaries around every corner and the church the most well-kept building the town had to offer. That is, besides Mckenna Manor. The awkward silence between me and Liam started to become unbearable.

 

“Hey, Liam!”

 

“What’s up?”

 

I didn’t think this far ahead.

 

“Do you want to go to the store?”

 

“What? Why? It's literally 5pm dude my dinner going to be ready soon.”

 

“Yeah, but I’ve seen this cool drink on TV. It's really cool.”

 

Liam made a face as if calling me a weirdo before sighing and stopping his bike on the curb of the corner store.

 

“This better be good.”

 

We were greeted by a pleasant chime as we entered the store with a woman shortly snapping her head round the corner and beaming a smile.

 

“Hello boys!”

 

“Hey Josie”

 

“Well hello Liam, I didn’t recognize it was you when you came in, and who might you be?” She said motioning towards me.

 

“Noah”

 

“Well it's very nice to meet you, Noah, I’m Mrs Benedict but most people call me Josie. What can I do for you boys?”

 

I had no intention of buying anything since I just blurted out the first thing I saw to break the silence between me and Liam.  I made up the name of a drink.

 

“Yeah, do you have any Energy Slime?”

 

Liam turned his whole body to look at me with an eyebrow raised. I think he could tell I had made it up.

 

“No, I don’t think so. I’m sorry, is there anything else I can get you?”

 

“No thanks.”

 

I said awkwardly and started shuffling back to the door.

 

“Hey Josie, your husband works for the Mckenna’s right? Has he ever met the Mckenna’s before?”

 

“Yes, yes, he takes a lot of pride in that fact. He was interviewed and hired by the head of security so no. He usually gets his paycheck sent to his bank account, but the Mckenna’s are busy people Liam. They do a lot for this town so we should at the very least give a little back don’t you think and leave them be.”

 

“Yeah, I was telling Noah about that, but he was asking about seeing them.”

 

“Is it that right Noah?”

 

“Oh… Yeah, I said something like that. It's just that Liam said no one visits them so I just wanted to know why?”

 

“Why? Why it’s because they are rich Noah. If you were as rich as can be then would you be thankful for the visit of a door-to-door salesman or a flier through your door about new road works? Just like their workers, the Mckennas fund the town and we in return take care of it.”

 

Josie was right. The people of Wayward really did take care of the town. 6 years later me and Liam had become closer. With how strange I was when I was 12, I really didn’t expect him to stick around all that much and thought he would ditch me just like people did with that Alex kid. He didn’t. I think he found how awkward I was funny, and after some late-night talks on Xbox and close-call accidents when playing in the street I think our friendship started to really take form. We got in a lot of trouble with the Sheriff. I’ll be the first to admit that unlike the residents of Wayward me and Liam didn’t take any pride in maintaining the integrity of the town. To us, it was just a stepping stone. While more and more people flocked to the generous donations made by the Mckenna’s, me and Liam counted down the days until we could leave this place behind and move on to bigger and brighter things. Our problem was cash. What little we had Liam would spend on weed from the town over, only to get us a fine and a week in jail not moments later. Sheriff Cassidy was nice enough. He understood us but he couldn’t just let us go about the place off our heads and staining the image of Wayward without some level of punishment even if it was minor in comparison to the stuff we did. By the seventh time he caught us, he gave us a punishment that I believe he hoped would make us realize how lucky we were to live there. He made us announce the recent donations made at the town’s monthly meeting.

 

Liam was a nervous wreck. For how cooly he talked all of them years ago I think the weed was starting to make him paranoid. I never smoked it. Liam was my best friend. Wherever he went, I went. He always respected me when I said no but I would always be punished just the same by Sheriff Cassidy just by being there and being associated with him.

 

“Hel- Hel- Hello Way- Way”

 

I placed my hand on his shoulder reassuringly. He cleared his throat and started again.

 

“Hel- Hello Wayward. My name is Liam, and this is Noah. We are here today to announce the donations made to the town this month. Want to take over N- No- Noah?” He said with a grimaced smile.

 

“Thank you, Liam. Thank you to everyone who donated this month and without further ado let’s get down to the list. From the Benedict’s we have received a donation of $1000 worth of supplies to our lovely food bank, the Greens have donated $1578 through their church bake sale, and the Mckennas have donated $10,000 to our police force…. let’s see here, oh yes, the Mckenna’s again have donated $10,000 to the church... oh and again the… the Mckenna’s have donated $10,000 to Wayward Elementary School… and errrr. Well, folks! Long story short the Mckenna’s have donated over $150,000 to the town this month.”

 

The town’s townspeople clapped following each name I read out, but they erupted when I mentioned the Mckenna’s. Me and Liam looked over at Sheriff Cassidy who gave us a brief nod to indicate the end of our punishment. Little did he know, we did in fact learn something from his punishment. Well, at least Liam did.

 

“Dude, I know how to solve our cash problem.”

 

“How’s that.”

 

“The McKenna’s man! They’re loaded! I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before. We’ll be able to leave this place for good with that kind of money.”

 

“Liam… man. The security. You know better than I do that the Mckenna’s has guards patrolling the grounds 24/7.”

 

“That’s just it! We’ll hit it Sunday morning. Everyone will be at church. In all my years living in this hell, I’ve never once heard about or come across someone who worked as a servant or cleaner or whatever inside the manor. That just leaves the Mckenna’s.”

 

“Right?”

 

“Dude it’ll be fine. They’re probably just some elderly couple who have nothing better to do but boost their ego with these donations each month.”

 

“What about the cameras?”

 

“Most they’ll do is keep a recording of us since there won’t be anyone to watch them live and even, so we’ll be long gone by the time they get back.”

 

“Okay, okay. I’m in…. but we’re wearing masks okay.”

 

“You got it.”

 

Nothing had changed since the first time I saw it. Bright white and glistening in the morning sun. The sprinklers making their rounds spraying across the garden. Flowers from tulips to roses bloomed with every step we took. Despite how many trees there were, the gardeners paid close attention to ensuring that they trimmed them in a way that meant there wasn’t a single shadow in sight. The Mckenna’s were a beacon of light with no skeletons or secrets to hide. They were the American Dream in all its dazzling might.  Liam didn’t care though. He was more blinded by the treasures which awaited us inside.

 

“Come on man! Pick up the pace, I don’t know if you realize this, but this is a robbery, not a tour.”

 

“All right, all right. What’s your plan then? We climbed over the fence now what?”

 

“We’re going to knock.”

 

“You’re joking.”

 

“Well, how else are we going to get in? There's likely no way we can lockpick our way through so the plan is we knock and when they open the door we rush them.”

 

“We’re not killing them.”

 

“What? No of course not. We’ll just threaten them and tie them up or something.”

 

“Ahh right, much better. We’ll just traumatize them for life.”

 

Liam shrugged at me still making his way to the door. I didn’t quite realize it before, but this would be the first time I would see their front door. I know it sounds silly but with how much we spoke about them and how much the town idolized them I suddenly realized that I didn’t even know the simplest things about the place. Like the door having a golden knocker in the shape of a lion. The door itself was nothing to sniff at. It was nicer than any of the houses in Wayward combined and I could tell Liam was thinking the same thing as he broke into a toothy grin at the thought of what lay beyond.

 

*\*Knock Knock Knock\**

 

No one answered.

 

*\*Knock Knock Knock\**

 

“Dude, I don’t think anyone’s going to answer.”

 

“One more time”

 

*\*Knock Knock Knock\**

 

“They’re probably at church… like one where rich people go?”

 

Liam sighed. For how little stupid my guess sounded I think he genuinely believed it. He turned from the porch to face me, but then stopped halfway as the floorboard beneath him creaked.

 

“What if we go down into the crawl space?”

 

“Do you even have a torch?”

 

“I have this!”

 

He said while revealing a lighter from his pocket. Before I could even tell him, it was a dumb idea he was already on his hands and knees prying away the floorboard. He was turning red in the face while trying to use a garden shear as a crowbar but to my surprise, his dumb resilience paid off.

 

*\*Creaakkkk\* \*Snap\**

 

“We’re in!”

 

Beaming a smile at me and already descending into the hole. Standing there fidgeting with my feet tapping against the porch I couldn’t help but feel nervous. Was I really going to rob someone?

 

“Come on!”

 

“God I’m coming!”

 

I climbed down into the hole, the spiderwebs already greeting me in the face as I scrambled on my hands and knees.

 

“Put the board back.”

 

“What? Why?”

 

“What if they come back? They’ll clearly know someone tried to get in.”

 

I guess he was right, but it still took a lot of courage for me as I picked up the board and with a heavy sigh slotted it haphazardly back into place. No, we were in complete darkness.

 

\*Click Click Click\*

 

Liam finally got the lighter to work. It hardly lit his face not alone on the floor beneath us but with his mind set he spun round and crawled forward. The soft glow surrounding the dark figure before me was my only guide through the abyss. Unlike most kids growing up I was never afraid of the dark and I didn’t believe in boogeymen or vampires or werewolves or anything like that. Crawling on my hands and knees in the dark was a cakewalk, but as we neared the center of Mckenna Manor another knot would be tied in my stomach with every inch. The walls seemed to get tighter and the manor itself seemed to emit a low hum that grew with intensity as we advanced. However, to my shock, the walls weren’t made of brick or cement that I would expect for a crawl space but rather reflecting from the lighter were glossed dark wooden planks. Encased by the walls and restricted in our movement, Liam determined we had crawled far enough as he began slamming his fist against the floorboards above.

 

\*Bang Bang Crack\*

 

Both coughing as invading clouds of dust swarmed our position we squinted to see above. We expected a barrage of light to come shining through the cracks. We expected paintings of grandeur and elegance. We expected gold, silver, and treasures only talked about in fairy tales. There was no point in squinting. No light welcomed us back to the surface as Liam's lighter flickered in the gentle breeze. It was as if we never left the crawl space at all. The lighter failed to reveal anything. Where it was reflected by the walls surrounding us in the crawl space, the room instead absorbed the light leaving us at the mercy of our imagination.  An overpowering smell of damp, rot and musk filled the room, choking us as we paced around the room in a frenzy for fresh air. I bumped into one of the walls as I reached my hand out to support myself. It felt wet and sticky as I pealed my hand away with the sensation that I was being pulled back by its strands causing me to gag.

 

“Hold on a second man I think I found a light switch”

 

\*Flick\*

 

A chandelier hung over head gracing us with its light. We stood frozen in place as our minds tried to comprehend the sight before us. The walls were coated in a sickly black mold that had expanded into the corners of the paintings that hung there. The bear rug squelched under our feet releasing a cream-coloured liquid that bubbled up and spilled onto the hardwood floor and down into the crawl space. The fireplace was filled with ash that begun to intermingle with the inexplicable amount of dust that swirled around us in the air sending flies and mosquitoes off course. The curtains were a deep shade of purple and were all drawn to cover the windows each fitted with a hammered nail to keep them pinned. There were 3 paintings in total which all faced 2 old and beaten red velvet armchairs. The first painting appeared to be of a young girl with blonde hair reaching for an apple, the second a depiction of a beautiful garden without a single dead flower in sight, and the third seemed to be a portrait of the Mckenna’s. There were 6 of them. A Mom with dark raven hair and wrinkleless skin, a dad with a thick grey mustache and eyebrows to match that gave him a serious look about him, a young boy who appeared bored and pouting, a young girl who unlike the rest of her family remained staring at the viewer, an old lady who held her hands together in prayer with all of her pearly white teeth on show, and then an old man who didn’t seem to be making an effort to look at the painter at all rather opt to look down at his shoes with a stone-faced expression.

 

“Liam I-“

 

Our attention was stolen by a sudden hammering of footsteps that passed overhead shortly followed by slow and heavy thuds that caused the chandelier to sway. My heart racing I started to inch closer back to the crawl space as Ian passed in front of me and made for a splintered white wooden door turning the handle and walking into the next room. Swallowing my fear I followed him into the next room.

 

“Well looky here we got some more rats!”

 

I nearly jumped out of my own skin at the sound. 2 men stood in front of me and Liam. They both wore dark green flannel shirts pulled up past their forearms and each sported a black leather gas mask that obscured their face and hair. One of them wore a grey top hat while the other had 5 gold watches strapped to his right arm all while holding a long black cane.

 

“Wh- who are you?”

 

“We’re eleventh which makes you the Twelfth.”

 

“Wh- what? Eleventh to what?”

 

They both chuckled to themselves, the gas mask muffling the sound to resemble hiccups.

 

“Eleventh in line to the reward.”

 

I had no idea what they were talking about. The more confused I became the louder they laughed as their hiccupped glee echoed around the corners of the room.

 

“You really don’t get it, do you! We’re the eleventh to try our luck with the McKennas. The Firsts get to decide what they want to take first. You only have so many hands and so when they’re gone it’s the Seconds and the Thirds and so on! The Firsts are still deciding is all, but you’ll get your turn. That is, you survive that long!”

 

The one wearing the top hat finished as they both erupted in laughter clapping their hands and stamping their feet as they danced around the dinner table at the centre of the room. I made to say something when a door opened, and a figure emerged into the room. I tried to scream but the man in the gas mask slammed his cane onto the floor leaving me stunned and glued to the spot. The figure was hunched over at a right angle and wore an old maid’s outfit that was covered in stains and the same black mold as the room before. The upper part of their body hung over the floor. Their neck rippled like an accordion with large lumps bulging out. Their clothes hung low below the nape of their neck revealing how prominent their spine was as the skin seemed to stretch against its jagged protrusion. Their hair was almost nonexistent save for a couple loose grey strands that dragged along the floor due to their length. I couldn’t see their face as they remained in a constant bow. The figure didn’t say anything as they shuffled closer to the table and placed six bowls down.

 

“It is my pleasure to serve the Mckennas”

 

The figure then left the room and closed the door behind them. My heart thumping in my chest and my quivering mouth agape I was unable to react. The men pulled themselves out a chair and sat down dragging a bowl each towards them. Inside the bowls was black sludge that seemed to bubble and move despite the bowl remaining motionless. The men removed their gas masks. Their long greasy hair remained matted to their forehead and their wrinkles were just beginning to show. The eyes were both pale blue and held heavy dark bags. Their teeth were dark yellow and covered in plaque as they shoveled a spoonful of the sludge into their mouths leaving trails down their chin. I gagged at the sight trying to cover my mouth to prevent them from seeing. Snorting into their bowls like pigs they finished their meal and replaced the gas mask over the head without wiping their face of the slop.

 

“You rats want a tour!”

 

Liam began to follow without uttering a word. Every room was the same. Dust, mold, stains, old but luxurious furniture, and paintings, but there was something different about each room. It was the floor. Not every room had one but in most we passed through there was always a crack or a large gaping hole surrounded by fractured floorboards with the depths appearing darker than the mould and sludge itself. Even in the light, there was no sign of the bottom.

 

“Wh- what’s down there?”

 

I shuddered. The man with the cane turned to face the hole.

 

“That my dear friend is the rest of the manor.”

 

“I thought Mckenna Manor only had 3 floors.”

 

This was the first thing Liam had said since we entered. The men chuckled.

 

“No, no, no. The manor is much larger, some say the richest riches lay at the bottom.”

 

The men continued forward as I tailed behind, but Liam remained staring at the hole only to break his gaze at the opening of the previous door. A large man stepped into the room. I froze staring at the man who had fixed his attention to Liam as he backed towards us. I could hear the hiccupped chuckle of the men as they began tugging my arm to follow them. Veins and arteries protruded from the man’s body wrapping around his limbs, tunneling through his nostrils and the corners of his eyes as they snaked outward into tree-like formations. His arms were stick thin and seemed to be broken in several places as sharp jagged turns made them appear zigzagged. His feet were large stumps, his nails rotten and peeling off to reveal the bright pink flesh beneath. My hands were drenched in sweat, my knees buckling, as fear took hold spinning me on my heels and pushing the men forward as the beast released a loud pained moan and beginning to charge. We darted through the corridors as the man advanced, his stumps thundering towards us at alarming speed as the hiccupped chuckle of the men reverberated in my ears. I begged God to make it stop. To free me from this nightmare and deliver me to safety.

 

A small ginger cat stepped out at the end of the corridor. The men began to tremble as their hiccupped chuckle ceased and was replaced by uttered prayers. The man still thundering behind, the men stumbled back in terror of the creature that sat before them. I was suddenly pulled by my arm into another room, the door being slammed shut behind me. I looked up to see Liam bent over panting. Both suspended in terror gasping for air.

 

The screams were deafening. A cacophony of deep grunts and gargled yowls, snapping bones, and labored wet tearing that ended in an elastic snap as something banged against the wall. Blood pooled in from under the door staining my shoes and hands as I remained on my hands and knees sobbing. Liam broke into a whisper.

 

“That makes us the eleventh.”

 

Still sobbing I looked up. Revealing a toothy grin he began walking over to the desk in the corner of the room.

 

“Are you serious!?”

 

He picked up a pile of paper from the desk and began reading.

 

“Hey!”

 

His eyes were on fire as they darted from left to right across the pages. His smile never slipping he looked up and locked eyes with me.

 

“Dude, these guys are richer than I thought! They’re the one percent of the one percent!”

 

I was enraged. I began rushing towards him as fury clouded my mind.

 

\*creeaaak snap\*

 

The floor gave way beneath as I spun wildly crashing to the ground to be shortly welcomed by a thud and a squelch of something wet beneath me. The smell of rot and decay invaded my senses as I vomited immediately for it to splash back up at me from the floor. I couldn’t handle it anymore. Fear overpowered friendship as I broke into a sprint into the darkness. I didn’t know where I was going. It was pitch black, the smell intensifying as I gained more and more speed. Smashing through the obstacles that lay in my way I embraced each snap and crack of wood as I felt hope bubble up inside. I ran for what felt like miles through different rooms. Grandfather clocks drowning out all other sounds, rooms that were so bright they were blinding, rooms so dark they couldn’t even be lit by the lights above. Clanging, screaming, snapping, banging, sawing, scraping. An orchestra of sound vibrated through my eardrums and throughout my being causing my whole body to tremble and muscles to tense. I kept running. I ran, and I ran and I ran until….

 

\*SNAP\*

 

I was blinded by the light. Stumbling onto my knees I brought my hand up to obscure the brightness trying to let my eyes adjust. When I finally came to my legs were too weak to stand as I strained to look behind me. It was a wooden wall. It was set into the side of a mountain and was heavily overgrown. I had no idea where I was. The birds sang overhead and the river by my side trickled as it funneled towards a waterfall. Asking hikers for directions and begging people for bus money, I finally made it back to Wayward. Sheriff Cassidy doesn’t believe me. He told me that I should really lay off the weed and that they would look for Liam in the woods. I think they believe he could have been taken by wildlife, but I know what happened. I’m terrified, I’m confused, and I’m curious. I don’t know what happened at Mckenna Manor, but I know one thing. It’s a good thing no one visits the McKenna’s.
