Part 2

I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.


I hated living in New Brunswick. I had moved here the summer before grade 1 and was now in grade 7. I was 13, it was 2006.

It was spring and me and my friends wer at Wilbur's place for his birthday sleepover.

Me Murrey, Arik and Wilbur were walking through the woods listening to tales of how he saw a dire wolf in the woods.

"He was up to my shoulders the bugger." Wilbur recited. "He made eye contact with me and I was so scared. He had big red eyes, and then he was like 'miracle child'  in my head."

"This is not the fucking thing to be telling us when we are lost in the woods you freak." Arik barked. "How dare you scare me so much?"

"I'm with Arik" Murray stated. "I really don't like how you told us wed go for a walk, and then just say you don't know the way back like that. I'm tired and I'm angry and you are now my least favorite person here."

Wilbur looked puzzled and bewildered. The harrasment was warranted, and it continued. I listened for a while but then decided to hang back. I was looking through the woods,and then I saw a cat on a tree.

I walked up to the cat and it looked at me from up in the tree. 'Flee human, this is a trap.' It looked terrified.

I looked around and none of the other boys were in sight. I could still hear them talking though. 

I yelled and berfore long they were back in sight. Murrey was the first too speak.

"Man I was so scared that Arik was going to dissapear and Wilbur was going to kill me. I'm so glad you called out." Murrey said wth releif.

Arik looked at all 3 of us with suspicion. 

"We are still lost." Arik said angrily. "You better not fucking do that again Sean. I was freaked out too. And same to both of you! Anyone dissapears again and I am not staying the night! This is too fucked up for me man."

"I saw a cat in the tree and it caught my atention! If Wilbur has some evil plot I'm not in on it!" I said with disgust.

"What cat?" Murray said pointing at the tree.

I looked up and instead of a cat, there was a racoon. Seeing the raccoon I immediatly realized where we were.

I told the others and lead us all back to Wilbur's house. When we got back Murray gave wilbur a demeaning toungue lashing and we brought out the videogames. We played a bunch, cycling through the usual multiplayer roster. Wilbur's parents had left us the house too ourselfs, and were staying in a camper about 30 yards away from the house.

Murrey excused himself at one point and I didn't ask any questions at first, but after a while it seemed like he had been gone for a really long time. Not taking a long crap long, but like a whole hours long.

I didn't say anything to Wilbur and Arik but I secretly excused myself and went too look for Murrey.

I found hi min the master bedroom, with everyting obviously being searched. He held an odd weapon of some sort. It looked like a half way point between a wand and a knife.

"Voldemort would be pround" Murrey said triumphantly. "Do not tell Wilbur we found this. I'm going to call my parents, distract Wilbur while I use the phone."

"What is it?" I asked, afraid. 

"I'll tell you later, we have not called anyoen since we've been here and none of us have a cell phone, I need to tell my parents to be on high alert just in case we need someone else to call the cops for us" He said curtly.

We both headed back too the living room where Wilbur and Arik were still gaming.

Arik looked angry but Murrey calmed him down with ease. 

ME and Arik went back to gaming with Wilbur while murrey called his parents for a false reason.

I talked Wilbur's ear off while Arik seemed both puzzled and suspicious.

After Murray hung up he spoke to the room.

"Wilbur I know what your up too, what your family is about and I won't out you too the cops. I won't do anything personal too you in school either. I could destroy you socially but I won't. I know if I did you would probably murder me. But thats the thing, I'll pretend to be your friend, come to your parties, and do all kinds of public stuff with you. But I'm never hanging out with you in private again. I will never spend another minute with you unless at least two other people I know are safe are with me. And I advise you two do the same. My parents have their finger on the trigger to call the cops, and they already have, a suad car is going to show up for a few hours tonight and watch us. But if you do anything, if anyone screams, my parents will know. We are safe tonight because the cops are watching, and if you anything to us tonight the full wrath of god will come down on you. I saw your parents in the trailer acting this out and you better believe Sean and Arik can stop you long enough for me to call the cops. I want you to tell your parents that they need to call this off, and I'm going to sit here with my hand on the phone, and if I don't believe that you have, I'm calling them."

Wilbur went outside to tell his parents while we stood there waiting. Murrey explained that a wand knife was for ritual sacrifices and that if it had killed at least one person, it could disable a chakura if it was used to kill another.

Wilbur came back and Murrey was satisfied.

When I was time for bed, neither Murrey or me could sleep. We sat there looking at each other, watching the hours pass.

Murrey talked to me a few times, in such a kind tone, I really beleived he was my friend. Once Murrey seemingly felt the same he drifted off too sleep.

I still couldn't sleep on the other hand and looked out the window, worried about what had happened earlier.

I sat there looking out the window until I heard a voice in my head.

'You're safe, you can go to sleep' the strange voice said in a soothing tone.

I turned around to see an ethereal man standing there. He pointed too his head and winked.

'Who are you?' I asked.

'Who do you think I am?' he responded.

I starred at him for a minute until he pulled out a lightsaber.

'I'm the founder of the closest thing there ever was to a jedi order. Palpatine was actually real. But thats the thing, I'm more powerful than he was. I actually made a bunch of star wars movies back in my time. And the last story ark is the one I gave to george Lukas. So I'm really the one who wrote star wars. George lukas just gave you a bastardized version of 5/9ths of the story.' the man said telepathically.

'But there are 6 movies?' I responded.

'Lets not talk about the return of the Jedi' The man said with a sneer. 'Anyway they were planning to murder 2 of you if the third didn't show up, so be glad Murrey came this time.' The man said with a sneer.

He then disappeared and Arik woke up. He smiled and said "IT's safe now, get some rest I'll take watch."

I went to sleep and woke up the following morning.

We played digimon rumble arena 2 all day. Wilbur was called the white witch and every game we played for hours was a 3 on one.

"It's my birthday!" he cried when he finally managed to connect the dots.

Murrey grinned and said "They'll eat you at school if you don't wait till were out of highshcool" He winked at josh multiple times in a mocking fashion.

We left soon after all being driven home by Wilbur's father. WE made a pact to all check in after we got home.

Once we knew everyone was safe I felt a sigh of releif.

Things continued as normal and I went back to school the following monday. Not long had passed when I had real weird day at school.

It started when I got there in the morning. 

"Grease ball! Why don't you ever change your shirt" Stephen yelled at dakota.

"I like this shirt!" He said with a grin.

"You wore it all last week and your still wearing it! Did you wash it?" He commented.

"No, I haven't washed it in 3 weeks and have been wearing it this whole time. I just wanted to see how long it would take for someone to smell me." Dakota said with a grin.

Stephen looked at him in disgust. Then came the jeers from the rest of the class.

"Greese monkey!" someone yelled.

"Greese ball!" like 5 people yelled.

Caitlin, the prettiest girl in the class walked up too Dakota.

"You are the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and I hope you get anthrax for what you did to Sydney!" She yelled.

A bunch of girls made distgusting noises and Dakota sat there wit ha grin, relishing the attention.

Josh then walked up too Dakota with a grin.

"The value of your soul is totally worthless, so I'll do you one better. I'll offer you twisted color gummy in exchange for your soul." Josh said with delight.

Dakota looked worried and distressed, making jerking movements and weird faces.

"Fuck off you weirdo, I want 10 packs of them" he said.

Josh twirrled a pencil and spoke with authority. "But look what happened to persephone who sold her soul for a pomegranate seed? Was she not made a queen? This is your chance to get away from being your disgusting self forever."

Dakota made more Jerking movements and weird faces. "5 packs!" he yelled.

Josh looked upset. "To be a king though, like persephone."

Dakota filled with rage and said with malice "Don't ever speak to me again"

Josh walked away and twirled his pencil again. "You lost your only friend, freak."

The day continued until I felt the presence of the man again. He looked at me and no one else could see him. He stood in front of the teacher in history class.

'Hello again Sean' everything else quieted down and I heard him and only him. 'I want you to sell your soul to Josh. If you do I'll give something in return. It won't be immediate but by the time you really need it I'll give it to you.'

'I don't even know who you are, why do you expect me too trust you? Maybe your the real dark lord George Lukas will talk about in 7, 8 and 9.' I responded.

'Your lack of beleif is warranted. How about I give you the history lesson your teacher should be so you can make a decision. I am Sargon of Akkad, the most powerful man that has ever lived. I'm astral projecting to you across 3000 miles and 4500 years. I built the pyramids after I conquored ancient Summeria. Once I had brought Egypt to Iran under my control something happened. Up until that point we were bronze age like they tell you, but once I had conquored Sumaria a traveler from the stars came. Something called an Atla. It came down and hovered above Akkad. It then started broadcasting to the edge of my kingdom. Over the next 20 years the atla spoke to us, teaching us how to harness it's energy. In 20 years we went from bronze age to more advance then you are now. Flying cars, light sabers, Computing wall level computers. And then in the next 20 years we built pyramids all over the world too rebroadcast the Atla's wireless power. We had a planet wide grid, you didn't even need a battery in the flying cars.' Sargon stopped.

He turned from me and looked to the audience. 'Hey there Cesareans? How bad do you want this to be? Yeah pulled the plug on my computer so you couldn't see the screen, and you still did. Here is the threat I warned you about. Touch Caesar and your getting all 3 ticks right away.'

He stopped and looked at me 'I can only show you the door you, need to walk through it. Sell your soul to Josh and I'll give you a lightsaber to defend yourself from them when you need it.' He walked to Dakota and drew his lightsaber. He then hacked his head off in one slash and dissapeared. It didn't fall off, but Dakota screamed and started crying. He was excused and when people asked him later he wouldn't tell anyone anything.

The next day I was sold. I came up to Josh and said I'd sell my soul for the gumy. He wrote out a contract and as soon as it was signed I felt my soul leave my body.

'Will I ever get it back? Did I sell my soul for a lightssaber I thought?' not expecting a response, but hoping.

I heard the man again and he appeared. 'He is your friend and once he finally realizes what a souless husk you are, you'll get it back. Thats going to happen before you get your saber though.'

'Wait!' I was panicking. 'WHEN!?!!?'

He winked. 'Before you'll really need it.' He laughed and dissapeared.

I felt off after that. Like my soul was missing... I didn't know what to do. Sargon would aoccassionally reassure me not to buy my soul back but it's getting harder and harder. IS that man evil? I didn't know what to do.

In my soulessness I retreated further and further into video games. My favorite game at the time was monster hunter. I was playing it on my playstion 2, just soulessly grinding away. I was trying to catch a rathalos and I looked at the guide for what quest to get a monster componet. I just caught him over and over again for what felt like forever, never getting the wing I needed for my sword.

I was about to catch him for the, I don't know lost count at 20th time. When the game froze. There was a rathalos on the screen. He starred at me with a smug expression. Istarred at the game wondering what was going on. This was certainly weird. It didn't seem like an error, this was very high quality, "Art" I guess you could say. Then I heard a deep draconic voice in my head.

'This is a sign from me, to keep playing my games! You think this one is good? Try diablo 2, that's my favorite game yet if you want an RPG! Doom 3 is my favorite action game yet, but that won't run on your dad's computer' the voice said.

'Who are you and why are you talkign to me' I was terrified the rathalos was still on screen starring at me. Then the screen changed. It was a red dragon head with a long neck writhing around, connected to something in the background. I was so weirded out that I unlugged the PS2. The image dissapeared and I started crying. I had never been so scarred in my whole life.

After that I started hearing a voice in my head, tellign me too do things. I couldn't be sure if it was good or bad.

One day when we were at school Dakota was trying to convince me Arik, and Josh to come play Diablo with him in the access center. Sometimes we went there and played warcraft 2, but we had never played diablo.

We were heading for the access center when we got to the door and I saw Sargon standing there.

'Tell them you don't have a dollar to play and go to the gym instead. If you walk through this door you will go down a very wrong road, from witch there is no return. To walk through the right door again you need to not do this, or by the time you realize whats happening it will already be too late.' He said with a scared expression.

'Play you will have so much fun! You'll beat diablo 2 a whole 3 times you'll like it so much after you play it with your bros' IT said.

I wondered if it was the red dragon. I thought it must be.

I told them I didn't have a dollar and went to the gym. I found a friend and had a ok time.

After school I saw Sargon one last time. 'The golden age is over kid. This is where things get dangerous. I'd advise you just check out of gaming entireley. They don't get better from this point, they just get more and more filled with curses, that are going to get easier and easier to activate. IT's not that dangerous yet, but please be careful, you are not just wasting your time.'

What I assumed was the red dragon talked to me after that, telling me to do things like, buy a PS3, buy an Xbox 360, buy the revolution! He said if I had all 3 I'd never miss a great game.

I tried to listen to Sargon but as souless husk I just couldn't stop myself from listening to that strange voice and continued my gaming habit. I almost stopped once or twice but the voice started threatening me. 

One day me and my brother were in my room talking, swapping manly stories. He all of a sudden went to my dresser and said that he had been searching in the other day and found something weird.

I went to the dresser and I saw an envelope that said Scotty's first haircut.

"Our parents are so fucking weird" Scott said. "Lets open it!" he then tored the envelope and shook it. A lock of hair came out and he starred at it. He looked extremely freaked out. "Let's just put it back" he said.

That night when I was going to sleep I saw someting I will never unsee.

I sat bolt upright and starred through the open door to my bedroom. On the other side of the door was a weird purple red world, with a purple red version of me starring back. I heard a voice in my head.

'Buy a playstation 3, Xbox 360 and a wii, or I'll eat you for dinner' the voice said.

The shadow me and his strange world then dissapeared and I saw the hallway.

The voice kept talking to me and telling me too do things and I tried not to listen. But  as a souless husk, my mind was easily used against me. I bought an xbox 360 before long as the voice insisted. After I did it left me alone. But I've always been scarred it will return.
