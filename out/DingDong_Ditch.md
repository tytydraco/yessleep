*ding-dong* Rang the doorbell, after little Johnny decided to ring it as a joke. He was out playing around the neighborhood with his friends Matt and Steve and,since they had their bikes and could run away quickly, they decided to play an innocent round of Ding-Dong Ditch. 

Johnny and Matt rang two doorbells each and ran for their lives,while little Steve was too scared to even try. "Come on Steve,don't be a little pussy!" said Matt,trying to get his friend to play. "Shut up you fatty! I'm not a pussy!", replied Steve,sounding more angry than he had ever been, "I'm just afraid that whoever catches me will call my dad and he'll ground me so we wouldnt play together anymore!" he continued. "Chill bro, we are going to run as fast as we can so no one can catch us and you wont get in trouble!" said Johnny, who just wanted to calm Steve down. "Fine, I'll just ring one doorbell and then we'll all go back home." said Steve, while exhaling a huge breath.

 The three boys all got on their bikes and reached a house that was apparently normal, after parking their bikes in front of the sidewalk, Matt and Johnny pushed Steve in front of the door. Before he rang the doorbell, Steve decided to take a peek through the window, to see what was going on in that house and if anyone was going to catch him. He expected to either see an empty room or someone sitting down watching TV, but something else was awaiting him behind that window. 

He saw a little kid sitting on the floor and looking at the wall. Steve just thought that was a little weird,until he noticed something on the wall: there was a pair of eyes staring at him, eyes that shined a bright white light inside the darkness of that room. Steve got scared and turned back, but while he was turning his head, he noticed way more "wrong" things: there was a TV that only showed a static image of what looked like a police sketch,but was just a lanky shadow with "IT IS HERE. IT KNOWS." written next to it and the house looked dark from the outside, but those eyes were shining way too bright. 

While Steve was observing the scene, scared for his life, the child in the house turned and stared at him. He looked human, but some key details were not. His eyes were emanating the same bright light as the ones on the wall and they lacked pupils, that thing had a grin on its face, but it was too stretched and there were definetly too many teeth in it.

Steve was so scared he turned back and ran away without even taking his bike, he was too afraid to even look at that house. His friends chased him and asked what was wrong, but he just couldnt explain it, it was like if his voice was petrified.

That night, Steve couldn't sleep. He thought those creatures had followed him and were now watching him from the shadows, every little sound coming from the rest of his house sounded like footsteps to him. In the moment before he finally managed to fall asleep, he caught something terrifying in the bushes outside his window: a pair of glowing eyes staring at him.
