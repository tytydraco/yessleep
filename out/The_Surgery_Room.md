I don't know if this post fits this subreddit, or if it's creepy enough, but it really freaked me out at the time and I wanted to share my story. This really did happen to me.  
  
A long time ago, when i was quite small, I used to go to this play place/indoor playground quite often. It was rather normal, with a purple carpet, blue walls, and a massive play structure in the middle of the hall. If you went to the right of the structure there was a little passage under it which would let you go behind the structure where there was this little arcade sort of area with games and stuff. Also to the right of the structure was this row of doorways leading to about 10 or 7 of these little birthday rooms each with different themes. Most of the time, none of them were in use and so were blocked off by couches, but me and my sister would often sneak into them as we found it quite interesting.

One day, me and my sister were playing around near that little row of rooms when we noticed that there was a little couch against the wall at the very back of it. For some reason, we pushed it aside to reveal that behind the couch there was a little opening crawlspace type thing. Being little children, we decided to see what's inside.

 I went in first and after crawling through it I came out to this little room. The room was clearly quite old and hadn't been used for a long time, being lit with the eerie yellow glow of the evening sunlight filtering through the singular frosted glass window. The wallpaper (Or was it paint?) was peeling, and everything was in a state of disarray. The room was medium sized, and to me and my sisters horror, in the very middle of the room was an operating table, with controls, operating room light, equipment and all. It was clearly very old and damaged, as the padding on it was peeling and coming off, and some of the panels on the old machinery had come loose and there were wires sticking out. If my memory serves there were also old medical posters on the walls. I have no idea what that room was, or why it was there. We ran out of that room, placed the couch back into place, and the memory of it still haunts me and my sister to this day.

If I could, I would go back to that place, just to see it again. If only I could have taken some pictures. The play place is now closed down I think and probably abandoned, and getting in there would be tricky. If anybody has any ideas what that place was, or why it was there please tell me, and if there's a better subreddit I could post this on (Because I assume that this subreddit it for made-up horror stories), then please tell me. I just needed to say this, and it's a memory I've carried with me for a while now.
