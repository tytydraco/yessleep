Last year I had the worst experience of my life me and my wife were driving back from visiting her parents up north, we were driving down long stretches of winding country road, on either side of us was farmland and forests the only thing to illuminate our way were a pair on narrow headlights.

 

We drove for hours down those roads, my wife turned to me and spoke.

 

“Thank you for coming I know you don’t like my parents, but I appreciate it any way”.

 

I remember those word rattling around my head as black SUV smashed into the side of us sending us spinning down a hill, we land an embankment at the bottom of the hill, the last thing I remember is the blood dripping town my wife’s face.

 

I woke up in the hospital 3 days later, wifeless, I was told that the driver who hit us was also killed on impact, so I take some solace in that, but not much.

 

That was 9 months ago but I’m slowly moving on with my life and getting back to where I was, she’ll always be part of me but it’s nice that not all I think about anymore is her… or it would be, if it wasn’t for what happened.

 

It was a regular Thursday afternoon, I had just got home from work and stepped out of the car. I walk over to the door only to find it slightly ajar; I pushed open the door and there was some broken glass from a picture frame on the floor, but other than that there was nothing. I looked around to check but the only thing that was wrong that broken picture frame.

 

“Maybe I left the door open when I left for work and the wind blew it over”

 

but as I look at the picture of my wife covered in broken glass all I can see is her in that car.

 

I decided to put the picture in a draw until I can by a picture frame. I was making dinner scrolling through amazon looking for a new one, when suddenly the doorbell rang.

 

“Who would that be at this time of night”

I lean past the door to look out the side window to see someone at the door, it’s a girl, she’s soaking wet from the rain and looks freezing, but she looks exactly like my wife, but it couldn’t be she’s been dead for months.

 

I shout through the door “who are you, what do you want?”

 

To no answer I think its best to just leave this be if she was in danger or hurt there are other people on this street, but she doesn’t leave she just stands there, waiting in complete silence, we stand there in silence both staring at the same door but from other sides of it. After a few minutes of deafening silence, she suddenly begins to knock, after what felt like a life time of silence the sudden knock almost makes me jump out of my skin.

 

She kept knocking getting louder and more aggressive i told her to stop multiple times until I eventually called the police, not only because it freaked me out, but I figured if she needed help that badly that she would be best off with the police. Even as they pulled up, she kept knocking.

 

“BANG BANG BANG”

 

Over and over, it took 3 officers to drag her away. After the police dragged her away, they questioned both of us, I stood outside my house talking to the police she was sat in one of the cruisers with a blanket around her. She said nothing the entire time she hardly moved at all, barely even blinked but her eyes were transfixed on me so much so I had to ask the police to swap sides with me so I didn’t have to look at her, but even still I could feel her eyes burning into the back of my skull.

 

I was told there was nothing they could do in regards to pressing charges,

 

“it’s not illegal to knock on someone’s door more than once”

 

the cop stated with a stern look, almost as if he was judging me for calling the police on this girl, but he could see I was clearly freaked out.

 

“We can take her to the hospital and give her a warning, but that’s the best we can do”

 

I was all for what the cop said the way she was looking at me with a blank look in her eye was really starting to mess with me. I went on with my life, but I always saw her out of the corner of my eye just for a second. On my way to work, as I was parking up, standing outside my local coffee shop when I’m getting my morning latte. I really started to freak me out because I would never properly see her, as soon as I’d notice her, she’d be gone by the time I turned around.

 

I started to notice that when I left for work in the morning I would fine notes on my doorstep, I can only assume where they came from, they’d say thinks like.

 

“don’t you recognise me?”

 

“don’t you love me?”

 

“Can’t you see the love of your life?”

 

I reported all of this to the police, but I think they saw me as more of an inconvenience than anything else, they said that they would look into it but it never stopped. The longer it went on, the more aggressive the notes became, and I think that they began to be written in blood.

 

I started working from home, which my boss wasn’t happy with but what could I do. It got so bad I decided to install some security systems, lights, camaras, locks on all the windows and extras on the doors. I kept the police updated but they couldn’t be bothered, they said things like.

 

“Just man up”

“you’re a man, just deal with it”

 

It made me feel like I was less than a man eventually I stop reporting to them all together, it wasn’t worth the ridicule. Until eventually it just stopped, the notes, the dead animals showing up on my doorstep, seeing her all together. It all felt so sudden but that only made me more paranoid, I stopped attending work altogether all I could do was sit in my house hiding waiting for something to happen.

 

I stopped eating, I hardly sleep. Its always there clawing at my mind, I started to think I was truly losing my mind, what else could I think. I decided it was a good idea to see a doctor, he explained it was probably some sort of ptsd from the accident, he gave me something to help my sleep and said to get some rest and come back to see him in a few days.

 

I went home and took my pills and rested my head on my pillow, my eyes got really heavy and just before my eyes closed, I saw a shadow dart across the room, I tried to keep my eyes open, but I was powerless to. I woke up the next day and there she was my wife, standing right in front of me she looked exactly like the day she died same clothes, same make up. I dart up out of bed ready to fend of whatever she had coming.

 

“Did you have a bad dream”

 

“After we got back from our trip you just passed out”

 

“I’m surprised your even awake”

 

I just stood there stammering like a fool, I didn’t know what to say. Was this my wife? Was it all just a dream? I had a real trouble remembering anything.

 

I don’t know what is real that’s why I’m writing this down this is everything I can remember from what happened, I don’t know if it was a dream or if it was real but what’s more likely my wife dies comes back to life and starts stalking me or it was just a bad dream, but it did feel very real. What ever the case is I have my wife, and that’s what really matters, Right?
