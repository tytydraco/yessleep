I am starting to think he is alive, which is honestly even worse... I asked my boss about his record, and he said that he was fairly clean other than drug charges. I have not slept in 3 days. I can’t stay awake much longer, and my mom won’t be home for 3 days. This is so scary to me. I know I was rude to him but why would he take it to this extent.

I keep finding small dead animals around my house. I want to call the police, but part of me feels like he is listening, and I am still alone. I am so on edge. If I could think straight maybe I would know how to deal with the problem. I have been carrying my switchblade, but to be honest he is a lot bigger than me, so if he attacks me, I am probably still screwed even with the knife. 

I really wish I lived in a city right now. Living in huge rural areas like mine make this so much worse. The closest “neighbor” I have is like a good 2 miles off and I am really scared to use my car right now. What if he messed with it? I can’t seem to shake off the feeling that he is watching me right now. I feel like that no matter where I am. I found a picture of me in the shower next to the kitchen sink. Could a ghost even do things like this? 

I left the tab open before finishing this update and decided to make it longer because something awful just happened. My cat… Oh god I feel like I am about to vomit. My cat is an outdoor cat, so I did not worry much about her but this is so awful. He left her at my doorstep. Her head is GONE. It is so cleanly sliced, there is no way another animal did this. This is sick. 

I feel like I am meant to take this as a threat. How else would someone take this? I have work tomorrow thank god. I have to sleep soon. I can't stay awake any longer, but I am just so terrified to fall asleep. What if he kills me because he knows I won’t put up a fight in my sleep. I just wish I could go back in time and treat him better. He was a shitty person and no one who knew him could deny it, but I had NO idea that the situation would be this bad. Was I really awful enough for him to do something like this?

I never thought anything like this would happen to me. I am just so confused and scared. I don’t know what to do anymore. If I don’t get him away from me, I am going to lose it. I think I might have lost it already to be honest. 

I am just so tired. I can’t stay awake any longer. If I don’t update, I’m dead.
