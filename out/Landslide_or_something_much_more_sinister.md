Landslide or something much more sinister?

My paternal grandparents lived all their lives in a small mountain village about 30 km from my hometown. I loved my grandfather very much, he was the only grandfather I ever knew.  And he was so kind and gentle with me.  Every time I couldn't wait to go back to him.  But our trips were quite rare as my family didn't have a car and there was no bus to my grandparents' mountain village.

 My grandparents had 5 children together: 2 girls and 3 boys, of which my father is the youngest child.  Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away a year before I was born.  But ever since I was very little, I used to visit my grandfather sometimes.  He is no longer with us.. but he will allways be in my memories.

When I was about 10 years old, I had a rather interesting conversation with my grandfather.  He told me that he had actually had 5 children, not 4 as I knew.  His second child, a girl, drowned in the river on a terrible summer day.  Her name was Rodica (we are from Romania, Transylvania).  She was only 5 years old when she died.  My father, being the youngest child, never met Rodica, because she had died before he was born.  My grandparents, devastated, gave her a proper burial.

My parents chose to lie to me until I was 10, telling me that my paternal grandparents had 4 children, because they thought the whole story would really upset me and I would start having nightmares. Iâ€™m not mad at them, now I understand them.
But, 25 years after Rodica's death, trouble befell my grandparents again, when their firstborn also died, a girl named Maria.  Thus, my grandparents wanted to bury Maria above Rodica, so that the two sisters would remain together forever. 

But here comes the unusual.  Those who dug the pit found Rodica's grave only 0.50 meters deep, lying horizontally.  But my grandparents, 25 years ago, buried Rodica properly, 2 meters deep and vertically.  Since they didn't have time to look for other solutions, because their first child had to be buried as soon as possible, they decided to cut Rodica's coffin into pieces and throw her bones into the pit, because the coffin was already embedded in the ground, after  25 years, and it could no longer be taken out and repositioned.  

The cemetery where this grave is located is on the slope of a hill.  Initially, I thought that maybe, in the 25 years, there was a landslide that led to the unnatural moving of Rodica's coffin.  But, after talking to several elders in the village, it seems that there was not a second case similar to Rodica's.  If it really was a landslide, shouldn't there have been more coffins affected?  

I wonder if the whole story isn't hiding something much more sinister. A friend of mine suggested it could be a case of necromancy. Please help. i'm trying to understand what happened with my aunt's coffin.
