I am scared as hell.

I live in Obscurit√©, Vide Brilliant, one of the few big cities around here.

It was a usual night walk, the moon shining weakly,  the cold weather of a winter night hitting my face, that kind of stuff.
Then, I saw someone.

Dressed in a simple black robe, with lots of blood red eyes drawn on it, they had a silver-colored, flat mask, so I couldn't see any distinctive features.
But, I mean, that was suspicious enough.

I started following the person through the dark, filthy alleyways, they were not faster than me, and I actually thought that they were aware of me, and were doing this on purpose.
Spoilers, I was right.

I followed them to an old building, it looked like it was in the brink of collapsing, the person stopped in front of the doors of the building, then *broke* the doors. Metal doors.

I thought for a moment, no one would believe me, but, I mean, things like these were always news material. I am a journalist, by the way.

I entered the building and started walking, the place was eerie, the smell of rotten things were all around.
Oh, and the eyes, lots of eyes.

There were eyes, blood red eyes drawn all over the walls, the floor, even the ceiling. And other figures, dark, shadowy hounds with, indeed, blood red eyes on them.

And one more, a **crown**, drawn with light bluish green. An oddly specific choice of coloring, anyway, and there were tentacles around it, lots of them.

I wandered deeper into the building, the air getting heavier and heavier, the smell of rot intensifying, then I started hearing chanting, Latin, I suppose.

I only understood one word, "Imperator", Emperor.
Then I saw them, a group of people with the eyed black robes and flat masks, chanting in front of a triangle drawn with blood, with someone with a golden mask seemingly leading them.

They started chanting louder as all light sources in the room died out, and the triangle started glowing menacingly.

I was shocked, I could only watch what was happening, I had no idea who these people were, but I was right in front of a cult, summoning something evil.

Then it happened, the triangle turned into a pit of darkness and emptiness, like it was absorbing all existence. Then a figure started to come out of it, levitating.

It was made out of pure darkness, and only its outline was visible, and its eyes, glowing blue eyes, but they looked like they were also absorbing all the light.

Then it looked directly at me, pointed at me with its arm, then said something in it's dark, menacing voice,

"**This one.**"

All cultists turned their heads to me, and then they all stood up together, in sync, as if they were all one.

I started to run.

They were after me, still chanting, trying to capture me.

I was scared as hell, I didn't know what was gonna happen if they got me, but I could imagine it would probably include some kind of sacrificing.

I ran away as fast as I can, and surprisingly, I somehow made it!

Or atleast that was what I thought. I was seeing them everywhere, stalking me, some even tried to capture me again.

I changed my face, my identity, everything.
I got a letter today.

"We know.
Ave Imperatori"
