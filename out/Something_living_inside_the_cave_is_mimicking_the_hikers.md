I have a lot of experiences to share from my two years as a ranger in Silverpine Ridge National Park. I've dealt with frantic campers, missing hikers, and even a bear or two.

The work was never boring, but it wasn't always glamorous either. Verifying trails, answering calls, and assuring guests that the squirrels weren't rabid and that the park maps were accurate if you could read them were all part of a routine. I had developed a deep affection for the smell of the trees, the nighttime cricket chirp, and the way the stars appeared to be much closer. I didn't object when the superiors informed me that I would be relocating to the fire watch tower on Raven's Crest. Sincerely, I was anticipating the solitude. The tower sat perched on the edge of a rocky outcrop, high above the valley. 

From the small wraparound deck, I could see almost the entire park, a patchwork of evergreen forests, meandering streams, and rugged cliffs. There were caves down in the valley, their dark mouths barely visible from the tower. They’d been off-limits for decades, the official reasoning being “unstable rock formations.” It was the kind of bureaucratic phrasing that didn’t invite questions, and I’d never had a reason to give them much thought. My job didn’t include spelunking. My first week on the post was quiet, peaceful even. Mornings began with coffee brewed on a small propane stove. 

The scent of pine filtered through the open windows as I sat at the desk, logging observations into the station’s weathered notebook. Afternoons, I’d settle into the worn chair by the tall windows, scanning the horizon with binoculars for smoke or anything unusual. Evenings were serene, the sky streaked with hues of orange and purple as the sun dipped below the horizon. Nights, I’d fall asleep to the soft hum of the radio, the occasional static-laden message from other towers breaking the silence. By the fifth day, I’d fallen into a comfortable routine. It was the kind of quiet you could sink into, the kind that makes you feel like the world has slowed down just for you. That morning, I brewed my coffee as usual and stepped onto the deck to take in the view. The valley stretched out before me, shrouded in a gentle mist that clung to the treetops. The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of damp earth. It was perfect

“Ethan, you there?” 

Leah’s voice crackled through the static-laden radio, slicing through the late-afternoon stillness that had settled over the watchtower like a heavy blanket.I straightened in my chair, pulling the mic closer. 

“Here. What’s up?”

“There’s smoke down in the valley,” 

she said, her voice tinged with a mix of urgency and fatigue.

 “Northeast side, near the old mining trail. It’s faint, but it’s there.”

I stood and peered out the tower’s wide windows, scanning the treetops and ridges. The sun hung low in the sky, casting long, golden rays over the endless expanse of green. My eyes caught nothing unusual, but Leah’s reports were rarely wrong

.“Think you can check it out?”

 she asked, her voice crackling again before cutting back to clarity.

“On it,” 

I replied without hesitation.I grabbed my weathered field bag from its hook near the door, stuffing in a few essentials: a canteen of water, my notebook, and the compact first-aid kit I never left behind. As I swung the bag over my shoulder, I took a final glance around the tower, making sure everything was in order. The radio crackled faintly in the background, a constant companion in these isolated stretches of wilderness.Locking up the door behind me, I descended the narrow metal stairs with practiced ease. The tower creaked softly as the wind picked up, rustling the trees below. At the base, my Wrangler waited, dusted with a fine coat of pollen and dirt from countless trips into the forest.I threw my bag into the passenger seat and climbed in, pausing for a moment to let the familiar hum of the engine settle into my chest as I turned the key. 

The vehicle rumbled to life, the sound resonating in the otherwise silent woods.The drive to the valley wasn’t long—twenty minutes at most—but the deeper I ventured into the trees, the quieter the world became. Gone were the distant chirps of birds and the faint rustle of leaves that usually accompanied me. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.The Wrangler’s tires crunched over the gravel as I navigated the last stretch of road leading into the camp. 

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm amber glow over the valley. The light felt distant somehow, as though the world had slowed just a bit, suspended in an uneasy calm. As I approached, I could see the small cluster of tents and equipment set up in the clearing ahead, a familiar sight—yet something was wrong.I stopped the truck and cut the engine, the sudden silence that followed feeling unnatural. My heart skipped a beat in the quiet. The world felt almost too still. My eyes scanned the camp as I stepped out, the door slamming softly behind me, a sharp contrast to the heavy silence that surrounded the area. The air, once fresh with the scent of pine, now carried a faint, acrid smell that stung my nostrils. The camp was still, too still, with no sign of life—no movement, no voices. Just an unsettling void of activity.I took a few cautious steps toward the center of the clearing, my boots crunching the dry ground beneath me. The scene that unfolded before me wasn’t just one of abandonment—it was chaos.

Tents were ripped open, their sides torn and flapping in the wind like a flag of distress, fluttering in the cold, late-afternoon breeze. Gear was scattered across the ground—backpacks torn open, sleeping bags shredded, and personal items strewn everywhere as though someone had been in a frantic rush. A half-finished meal sat cold on a makeshift table, forgotten, with a few scattered plates and utensils tossed carelessly aside, the remnants of something once normal, now left to rot. My stomach churned uneasily. This wasn’t a typical case of abandonment or a messy retreat. This was something else—something deliberate. A warning.I crouched down beside one of the torn tents, my hand brushing the frayed edges of the fabric. The material was old, worn by the elements, but the slashes that marred its surface were recent—too fresh. There was a faint, musty smell of mildew, but beneath it, something else. Something heavier. The ground beneath me was disturbed, as though something—or someone—had been dragged through. Deep gouges marred the earth where heavy objects had been pulled, or maybe bodies. I didn’t want to think about it.I rose slowly, scanning the area for any other signs of what might’ve happened. No bodies. No blood. No obvious signs of struggle—just this... wreckage. 

The camp had been torn apart, left in shambles. As if something—or someone—had come through and destroyed it, and whoever had been here before me was gone. There was no sign of any rangers or patrol members. It was as though they’d vanished without a trace. My breath quickened, and an icy knot tightened in my stomach. My fingers went to the radio at my belt, moving almost instinctively. I brought it to my mouth, keeping my voice steady. 

“Leah, this is Ethan. I’ve arrived at the camp. It’s abandoned… and it’s been torn apart.”

There was a brief moment of crackling static before Leah’s voice broke through, sharp and clear.

 “What do you mean, torn apart? Are there signs of a struggle? Did you find anyone?”

“I don’t know,” 

I muttered, my eyes darting from one torn tent to the next.

 “It’s like they left in a hurry. There’s no blood, no signs of violence—just chaos. Something’s not right here. It’s almost as if they were trying to get out fast… but there’s no clear reason why.”

“Stay sharp, Ethan. I’m pulling up the coordinates now and looking at the satellite feed. Check the perimeter and see if you can find anything else. Don’t take any chances.”

“Copy that,”

 I replied, though the unease gnawing at me was hard to shake. Something felt wrong—far more than just the wrecked camp. I had an instinct I couldn’t quite place, a gut feeling telling me to be careful, to keep my eyes wide open.I started walking, my boots crunching the dry earth beneath me as I moved around the perimeter of the camp, eyes scanning every corner. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, something hidden just beyond the edges of the clearing. It was a low, unsettling sensation, like the forest itself was holding its breath.And then, I saw it.Strange, uneven tracks—deep, ragged indentations in the dirt—leading away from the clearing. They weren’t animal tracks. These were too large, too erratic, as though something—or someone—had been dragged through the dirt.

 The tracks didn’t go far before they disappeared into the thickening forest, winding toward the old mining trail I’d passed earlier on my way in.I hesitated, my pulse quickening. The tracks were fresh, the soil still disturbed, the earth untouched by the usual wear of time. Whoever or whatever had been here hadn’t been gone long.

“Leah,”

I said, my voice low, as if speaking louder would shatter the silence around me. 

“I’m following a trail. Something—or someone—was dragged through here. They’re heading toward the old mining trail. I’m going in.”

“Be careful, Ethan,” 

Leah’s voice crackled back, a note of concern undercutting the usual professionalism. 

“Call if you need backup.”

I didn’t respond immediately. My gaze was already fixed on the dark line of trees ahead, the track disappearing into the shadows of the forest. The forest felt different now—less welcoming. The quiet, the weight of the stillness, made everything feel more... urgent. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, a creeping awareness that something wasn’t right.And with that, I turned, stepping carefully into the forest, the faintest sensation of being watched crawling over my skin. Something was out there, and I was about to find out exactly what.I hesitated only a moment longer before pushing forward. My boots crunched softly on the forest floor, each step carrying me deeper into the trees. The uneven tracks led me through dense underbrush, past twisted, gnarled roots that seemed to reach out like skeletal hands. The air was cooler here, the kind of crisp chill that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

A subtle tension thickened the silence as I moved farther from the camp, and the atmosphere felt oppressive, as if the forest itself was waiting for something, or someone, to make the next move.The trail had become clearer, the disturbed earth more pronounced. The footprints—if they could even be called that—looked unnatural, as though something heavy had been dragged through the woods, leaving a trail of broken branches and crushed leaves in its wake. Yet, there was no sign of blood or struggle. Just... absence. A feeling that grew stronger with each step, gnawing at me, clawing at the edges of my mind. Something was very wrong here.Minutes later, the trees began to thin, their towering trunks making way for a small, rocky clearing. 

And there, in the center of it all, was a cave entrance. I stopped dead in my tracks, the hairs on the back of my neck prickling. The cave’s mouth yawned open, dark and foreboding, but it wasn’t just the cavern that drew my attention—it was the broken chain lying on the ground just in front of it.The chain was thick and rusted with age but clearly once strong, the links large enough to hold something—or someone—secure. Now it lay twisted and broken in the dirt, as if snapped with ease, the metal scattered in jagged pieces around the entrance. Nearby, the remnants of a rusted fence lay crumpled and bent, one of the posts completely uprooted, the others bent inward, as though something had forcefully breached the barrier. It wasn’t the work of nature. This was too deliberate, too controlled. Someone—or something—had come through here, and recently.I swallowed hard, unease crawling up my spine. The silence around me felt heavier, more stifling. I stepped closer, the crunch of my boots on the gravel the only sound, as I inspected the broken chain. The metal was twisted in a way that suggested brute force, but also something oddly methodical, like the work of someone who knew exactly what they were doing. Whoever—or whatever—had done this wasn’t reckless. They were purposeful.

The air seeping from the cave was cool, with a faint metallic, stale tang, as if sealed for years. I could almost taste its bitterness, drying my throat. Outside, the wreckage—broken chains and a bent fence—suggested an escape, not random destruction. What had been locked away here? And why?Foreboding gripped me, but curiosity pushed me forward. With a deep breath, I clicked on my flashlight, the beam flickering as I ducked under the jagged overhang. The cave smelled of damp earth, decay, and something ancient. A chill ran down my spine, but I pressed on.

The tunnel inside was narrow, winding, and the stone walls seemed to close in on me with each step I took. The faint remnants of old graffiti were scrawled along the jagged walls—hasty marks, symbols I couldn’t make sense of. There was a sense of abandonment here, but it wasn’t the kind of quiet you’d find in a forgotten place. No, this felt like a place that had been sealed off for a reason, and it had been waiting—waiting for someone, or something, to come back.

The deeper I went, the colder the air became. My breath misted in front of me, and the metallic scent grew stronger, thickening with each step I took. The path twisted and turned, and soon I could no longer see the entrance behind me. Only the narrow beam of my flashlight illuminated the path ahead, the stone walls closing in as the tunnel narrowed even more. The echo of my footsteps was the only sound, a rhythmic thudding that bounced off the walls and only served to amplify the isolation.I paused briefly, my hand instinctively tightening around the flashlight. I listened, but all I could hear was the soft echo of my breath, the distant, eerie drip of water somewhere deeper within the cave. 

The stillness was suffocating, and my mind raced. How much farther was I going to go? Was I really prepared to walk into whatever lay ahead?I took another cautious step forward, my pulse quickening, my senses sharpening. And then, ahead, I saw it—a faint reflection in the low light of my flashlight. Something metallic.The path opened up into a large chamber, its high ceilings lost in the shadows above. The faint glow of my light bounced off something rusted and heavy, an imposing structure standing in the center of the room. A large, iron gate. The edges of the gate were covered in cobwebs, thick and heavy, the dust of years—or decades—settled on every surface. But what caught my eye wasn’t the gate itself—it was the chains that wrapped around it, still thick and intact. Heavy, industrial chains, gleaming faintly under the weak light.A chill ran down my spine. 

This wasn’t just an old cave—it felt like a prison. Something had been kept here, something meant to stay hidden away. The chains, the gate—it all pointed to something dark, something locked away for a reason.My eyes scanned the room, my breath catching in my throat as I noticed the strange, uneven markings on the walls. They weren’t graffiti this time. They were... symbols, older, more unsettling. Some were crudely drawn, others faded, as if time had gnawed away at them.I took a step closer, my eyes fixed on the rusted gate. I needed to know what was behind it, but the closer I got, the more uneasy I became. Something in the air felt heavier now. The silence around me deepened, and I could feel a shift, an energy, like something ancient was waking, something that had been locked away for too long.Before I could move closer, a distant, unsettling noise echoed through the chamber—a soft scraping sound, like metal against stone.My heart skipped a beat, and I froze.I froze, the beam of my flashlight trembling in my hand as the scraping sound continued, echoing ominously off the cavern’s jagged walls. My heartbeat pulsed in my ears, drowning out everything else. 

For a fleeting moment, I wondered if it was just the wind—perhaps a draft moving through some hidden crevice, dragging loose stones across the ground. But no. This was deliberate. A slow, rhythmic scrape that almost sounded… purposeful.The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as my breath hitched in my chest. 

“Hello?”

 I called out, my voice barely rising above the oppressive silence of the cave. The words felt fragile, as if they might break the moment they left my mouth, swallowed by the cavern’s vast emptiness.For a long stretch, nothing answered.Then, from deeper within the shadows of the cavern, came a faint voice—a whisper so soft and fragile that it almost didn’t seem real.

“Help... please... help me…”

The words sent a chill down my spine. I felt my throat tighten as I stepped forward, compelled by a force I couldn’t understand, but my legs felt leaden, weighed down by an unsettling instinct that screamed at me to turn around, to leave. But the voice—it was so desperate, so human, it dragged me forward despite everything.I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breathing as my flashlight beam danced erratically over the walls. 

“Who’s there?”

 I called, my voice trying, desperately, to hold onto some semblance of calm. But the tremor in it betrayed my unease, and I hated myself for it. I had to stay focused.The voice came again, softer this time but unmistakably the same: 

“Please… help me…”

I stopped, my heart hammering against my ribs. It sounded so real. So human. But there was something else. Something off about it—like it had been trapped down here for far too long. Too fragile, too familiar, but somehow wrong. The hairs on my neck stood on end.

“Where are you?”

 I called out, straining my eyes in the dim light, my flashlight darting over the shadows. 

“Where are you? Can you hear me?”

“Help… please... help me…” 

The voice repeated, identical in tone and cadence. No variation. The same desperation.A cold dread crawled down my spine. My mind screamed that this was no ordinary plea. It was a mimicry, an echo of something that had been down here far too long. Maybe it wasn’t even human.A sudden, chilling realization made my breath catch in my throat. This wasn’t a person. This was something else—something that had learned to imitate a voice, to play on the most basic, primal urge to help someone in need. 

But why? And what was it waiting for in the shadows?I took a slow step back, my instincts screaming at me to leave, to get out of this cursed cave. But before I could turn, the voice came again, louder this time, more urgent. And yet, it was still the same. Too identical. Too rehearsed.

“Please… help me…” 

The words echoed like a chant now, insistent, growing in intensity. But there was no desperation left in it—just an unshakable, dissonant repetition.I could feel my pulse in my throat, the panic rising in my chest as I spun on my heel. I turned toward the tunnel entrance, my flashlight wavering in my grasp. Something wasn’t right. Suddenly, the ground trembled beneath my feet, a deep, guttural rumble vibrating the very walls of the cave. I froze, my heart skipping a beat as a cold sweat trickled down my back. The noise wasn’t just from the scraping anymore—it was something else. Something… alive. 

Something huge.My stomach turned over as the rumble grew louder, closer. It was unmistakable now: something was moving behind me. Something with mass. Something unnatural.I didn’t hesitate. My legs propelling me forward, I pushed myself into a sprint, the darkness of the cave pressing in around me like a suffocating force. My boots slipped against the jagged floor, and I barely managed to keep my balance as I darted down the narrow tunnel. The scraping sound intensified, merging with the ominous, rhythmic thudding that grew steadily louder behind me.It was following me.The noise of it—a slow, deliberate stomp—was gaining ground with terrifying speed. 

I could hear the earth rumbling beneath me as if it were a giant, something massive chasing after me, the air thickening with each pulse. My breath came in quick gasps as I pushed myself harder, faster, the tunnel seeming to stretch on endlessly, the light from my flashlight casting erratic, dancing shadows on the walls that only deepened the sense of imminent danger.Whatever it was, it was close.I stumbled over an uneven patch of rock, my ankle twisting painfully, but I didn’t slow down.

 I couldn’t afford to. Every instinct screamed at me to get out, to run as if my life depended on it—because it did.The heavy pounding of footsteps reverberated behind me, sending shockwaves of terror through my veins. I was almost there—I could see the faint glimmer of light ahead, the entrance, the open air just beyond the cave’s grasp.I wasn’t going to make it.The thundering noise was deafening now, each step of whatever creature was chasing me like a massive shockwave against the stone walls. It was closing in, so close I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me.

 My heart thudded so loudly in my chest that I couldn’t hear anything but that pulse, like a countdown to my end.Finally, the mouth of the cave came into view. The dim light from the outside world filtered in, offering the smallest sliver of hope. My legs burned, my lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.I reached the broken fence, my hands trembling as I fumbled for the lock. My pulse hammered in my throat, and I could feel the presence of something—something monstrous—just behind me, right on my heels. The air was thick with a suffocating pressure, and I was sure that if I didn’t get the gate locked, whatever was chasing me would tear me apart.

Click.

The lock turned, but my hands shook too violently, my fingers slipping against the cold, rusted metal. The rumble from behind me was growing louder—louder—and I could hear something breathing, something heavy, strained, and primal.

Click!

The lock slid into place just as I slammed the gate shut with everything I had. My heart pounded in my chest as I stumbled backward, panting for air. But I didn’t waste a second. I turned and ran.I didn’t dare look back.The Wrangler was still parked where I left it, the engine idling softly in the quiet dusk, but I didn’t stop to appreciate it. I barely registered the familiar sight of the truck as I sprinted toward it, my legs weak, my entire body screaming in exhaustion. My hands fumbled with the door, and I threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.The noise was still there—the sound of something huge, powerful, and relentless, still somewhere within the cave. 

It hadn’t shown itself, hadn’t fully revealed its shape, but I knew it was there, lurking in the shadows. It hadn’t followed me outside. It had stayed behind, but that didn’t make it any less real.With a final surge of desperation, I slammed the door shut, cranked the engine, and slammed my foot down on the gas pedal. The Wrangler roared to life, the tires screeching against the gravel as I tore out of the clearing, not looking back. My heart hammered in my chest, the adrenaline coursing through my veins as the truck kicked up dust and gravel.

The engine of the Wrangler roared to life as I slammed my foot on the gas, the tires screeching as I tore out of the clearing. My heart raced, a frenzied thump in my chest, but as I sped down the rough trail, I forced myself to focus on the road ahead. I couldn’t afford to look back. I couldn’t afford to lose control now.White-knuckled on the wheel, cold sweat soaking my shirt, I pushed the Wrangler through the winding forest trail. 

Trees blurred past, gravel flew under the tires, and the truck shook with every bump, but I couldn’t ease off the gas. Something had been chasing me—its footsteps close, the earth trembling beneath my feet. Though the rearview mirror showed only the empty road, I couldn’t shake the fear it was still behind me. The cave lingered in my mind: dark, foreboding, broken chains. 

I had escaped, but why? The doubt gnawed at me. Was it waiting for a mistake? I pressed harder on the gas, desperate to reach the watchtower. As the trees thinned, the clearing came into view. It felt impossibly far, every second an eternity. 

Finally, I reached the tower, slammed the brakes, and jumped out. My legs were shaky as I stumbled to the locked door, heart pounding. Even in the stillness, I couldn’t escape the sense that something was watching, waiting.

I forced myself to push through the door and into the tower, the familiar surroundings offering little comfort now. The radio sat on the desk in front of me, its screen dark. The silence of the tower wrapped around me like a shroud, and for the first time, it felt suffocating.I shut the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to slow my breathing. 

The place that had once been a sanctuary now felt like a cage. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the creature—whatever it was—was still out there, waiting. But it hadn’t followed me. It hadn’t chased me beyond the cave.I couldn’t let myself feel safe—I knew I hadn’t outrun it. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows. I walked to the window, staring into the black forest. The trees stood silent, motionless against the starless sky. The quiet was suffocating, pressing in on me. I turned to the radio, my fingers hovering over the mic, but what could I say? Would Leah believe me? The voice, the chains, the scraping—what kind of monster had I encountered?I locked the door behind me, the click echoing with eerie finality. It felt absurd, knowing a lock wouldn’t keep it out, but I needed to feel some semblance of safety. 

Climbing the stairs to the watchtower’s small living quarters, the stifling air and oppressive silence followed me.Sitting on the bed, I ran trembling hands through my hair, trying to calm my racing mind. The cave—the darkness, the chains, the sounds—kept replaying in my head. It felt like a nightmare I couldn’t escape, the weight of it crushing me.

I glanced toward the radio again, then turned away. I wanted to call Leah. I wanted to tell her everything, but I didn’t know how. What could I say? I was terrified, and yet nothing had followed me back. There were no signs of the creature. 

The woods were as still as they always were. But that didn’t ease the unease gnawing at my gut.I pulled the covers up, though I wasn’t cold. The air felt heavy with dread, making every breath feel too thick, too slow. I rolled onto my side, staring out the window, trying to focus on the trees in the distance. The view from the tower had always been calming before, the peaceful stretch of forest rolling out beneath the darkening sky, the distant outline of the mountains beyond.

But tonight, the sight was anything but peaceful. It was a reminder of what lurked beyond the trees. What had been waiting for me in that cave. I clenched my fists, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to force the thoughts away, but they wouldn’t leave. They were like a constant whisper, gnawing at the edges of my mind.

A sudden noise broke my thoughts—soft at first, like a faint rustling. I snapped my head toward the window, my heart pounding again. Was it the wind? A trick of the trees? No. It was a voice. 

A faint, unmistakable sound that seemed to drift toward me through the still night air.I froze. It wasn’t just any voice.

“Ethan…”

It was my mom’s voice. Clear and gentle, like she was standing right outside, calling me. My breath caught in my throat. I sat up straight in bed, my eyes wide, straining to hear more. The sound of my name echoed again, only this time, it was softer, more like a whisper.

“Ethan… help me…”

I scrambled to my feet, heart racing. It couldn’t be her. I hadn’t heard from her in months—there was no reason for her to be here. I rushed to the window, peering into the still, dark forest. No movement, no shadow, nothing but silence.Had I imagined it? Her voice saying my name had sounded so real, so unmistakable. I tried to shake it off as stress, but then I heard it again—a different voice. My sister’s.

“Ethan… help us…”

I spun around, heart pounding, and rushed back to the window. My eyes darted through the empty forest, but there was nothing. They couldn’t be out there. It wasn’t possible.

“Ethan…”

 My mother’s voice again, closer now, just below the window. My hands gripped the sill, trembling. This isn’t real. It’s not real.I stepped back from the window, my breaths coming faster now. I shook my head again, my thoughts spiraling. Was I losing my mind? Was it the stress, the fear, the exhaustion?But the voices kept coming. Over and over again, like a loop—soft whispers that felt like they were right on the other side of the walls. I couldn’t block them out.

“Ethan, we’re here. Come outside. Please.

”They sounded desperate now, pleading.I pressed my hands to my ears, trying to block out the voices, but they were relentless, their words seeping into my mind, their tone familiar and comforting. It was as though they were really out there, like they were just waiting for me to open the door, to step outside and follow their calls. They were so close.I rushed toward the door, my hand shaking as I gripped the handle. I couldn’t explain it. My heart ached, my throat tight. I wanted to see them. 

I wanted to make sure they were all right.But as I opened the door, the cool night air hit me, and the voices stopped. Gone.There was nothing.I stood on the threshold, breathing hard, looking out into the pitch-black emptiness. The same emptiness that had been there moments before. The wind stirred the trees gently, but there was no sign of anyone. 

No trace of them. Not even a footprint in the dirt.

A cold chill swept through me. My throat tightened, and I closed the door quickly, locking it behind me. My mind was spinning. I couldn’t make sense of it. What had just happened?The silence in the tower felt deafening now. No more voices. No more whispers. Just the hum of my own breath, ragged and uncertain.

I staggered back from the door, my mind reeling from the eerie silence that followed the voices. My pulse was racing, the fear crawling under my skin like a thousand insects, buzzing and scratching. My hands were clammy, slick with sweat as I leaned against the wall, trying to steady my breath. It wasn’t possible. None of it made sense. How could I hear their voices? I hadn't seen my mother or sister in years. They couldn't be here. They couldn’t be out there.

My legs gave out beneath me, and I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling uncontrollably. My chest felt tight, as if something were squeezing the air from my lungs. 

My vision blurred, and I tried to focus, to make sense of everything, but the room spun around me.The voices had stopped. But the feeling of being watched remained, like a constant pressure on my chest, suffocating and unyielding.I took shallow breaths, trying to ground myself, but it wasn’t enough. 

The fear, the exhaustion, the overwhelming sense of dread—everything caught up with me all at once. My eyelids fluttered, heavy, and despite my best efforts to fight it, my body betrayed me. My last thought before everything went black was a quiet whisper, the memory of my mother’s voice still echoing faintly in my mind: 

"Help us..."

When I woke, the tower was still silent, the morning light creeping through the small window, casting a pale glow across the floor. 

I sat up quickly, the remnants of the dream—or whatever it was—lingering like a fog in my mind. My head was pounding, my body stiff from the cold. My throat was dry, and a dull ache settled deep in my bones.I glanced around the room, still disoriented, trying to shake off the remnants of the nightmare. It had felt so real. But the tower was quiet. Still. Empty.

I had to focus. I had to do something. I couldn’t stay here anymore. The weight of the night’s events hung on me like an anchor.I staggered to my feet, swaying slightly as I moved to the small desk by the window. The radio was there, silent and cold, waiting for me. 

My hands were still trembling, but I reached for it anyway. My fingers felt numb as I grabbed the mic, pressing it to my lips with a desperation I couldn’t hide.

“Leah…” 

My voice cracked, hoarse from the fear and exhaustion. I cleared my throat and tried again.

 “Leah, this is Ethan. I need to call for search and rescue.”

There was a brief pause on the other end, the static crackling in response. Then Leah’s voice, sharp and professional, came through the speaker.

“Ethan? What’s going on? You sound—what happened?”

I closed my eyes, trying to gather my thoughts, trying to piece together the events of the last few hours. The fear and confusion were still too fresh, still too real. My pulse quickened, but I had to explain. I had to get help.

“I… I can’t explain it, Leah. I don’t know what happened, but I need help. There’s something out there. Something in the cave. The camp—there was no one there. Just destruction. And the voices, Leah… I heard them. I heard my mom and my sister. They called to me. But they’re not here. They can’t be. I don’t know what’s going on, but I need—” 

My words faltered as the weight of everything crashed down on me again. I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breath.Leah’s voice broke the tension, calm but firm. 

“Ethan, just breathe. I’m pulling up your coordinates. Stay in the tower. Search and rescue are on their way.”

I clutched the mic, my hands shaking. 

“Okay… Please, hurry.”

After a pause, her voice returned, more reassuring. 

“We’re on our way, Ethan. You’re not alone.”

I set the mic down, my legs weak as I sank onto the bed. Dawn’s first light filtered through the trees, bringing a faint sense of relief. Help was coming, but the fear clung to me, the cave and voices replaying in my mind. Something still felt off—like I was being watched.I leaned back against the cold wall, closing my eyes, and waited. 

The morning air outside was heavy with anticipation, the horizon stretching wide and silent.Leah had arrived with the search and rescue team a few hours after our conversation. They’d come prepared, their vehicles parked in a loose formation just beyond the tower. The crew was methodical, focused, but I couldn’t shake the lingering dread that followed me like a shadow. Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and I couldn’t explain it. 

But they were here now, and they trusted me to lead them to the cave.I felt the weight of the team’s eyes on me as I gathered my gear. There were six of us—Leah, a few experienced rescuers, and me. Everyone knew their role, but my role felt… heavier than I’d expected. I wasn’t just leading them to a location; I was leading them into a nightmare I barely understood myself.

"Ready?"

 Leah asked, her voice steady but with a hint of concern as she caught my eye.

"Yeah. Let's go,"

 I replied, trying to mask the tremor in my voice.I led the way back through the forest, my senses sharp but on edge. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their shadows deep and dark. The path was familiar, but it felt different now, darker, heavier with each step. I hadn’t wanted to come back here, but there was no choice. The voices, the wrecked camp, the thing in the cave—it was all too real. And now, I had to face it. As we approached the clearing, I felt my stomach drop. The area around the cave felt untouched, the fence I’d hurriedly locked still in place, but something was off. 

The lock—the lock—was gone. 

I stopped dead in my tracks, my breath catching in my throat.

"What's wrong?"

 Leah’s voice cut through the tension, her brow furrowing as she caught up to me. She followed my gaze, her eyes narrowing as she saw the state of the broken chain, now completely gone.I swallowed, fear crawling up my spine.

 “I… I locked it. I swear I locked it.”

But there was no time to dwell on that. The team began to fan out, checking the perimeter, while Leah and I approached the cave entrance. The darkness seemed to swallow the light from our flashlights, and a strange heaviness pressed down on me as I stepped closer.

"Stay sharp,"

 Leah ordered, her voice low and serious. 

"We don’t know what we're dealing with here."

The team moved silently, their footsteps muffled by the dense undergrowth. The smell of decay and old earth hit me again, stronger this time. I could feel the weight of the past hours hanging over me, the dread gnawing at my gut. I looked at the entrance of the cave, the jagged rocks surrounding it like the mouth of a beast ready to swallow us whole.

We moved inside, the air growing colder with each step. The flashlight beams caught the same graffiti on the walls, now faded and distant, the memories of whoever had been here long before us. The floor was still damp and uneven, the strange metallic smell in the air even stronger now. 

And then, we found them.The first body was lying in the middle of the cavern floor, an unsettling stillness surrounding it. The other two were scattered nearby. The bodies were lifeless, pale, and cold to the touch, but there was something more disturbing about them. They weren’t just dead. They had been… moved. Torn apart in places, their limbs twisted unnaturally, their clothes shredded.And then we saw the fourth body.

It was a few feet from the others. The head had been removed—sliced off cleanly, as if with a blade. No blood spilled. Just… clean. The body itself was intact, lying unnaturally still, but the severed head wasn’t anywhere to be found.A chill ran down my spine, and I had to fight the urge to turn and run. This wasn’t just some animal attack or a botched camp. This was something deliberate. Someone—or something—had done this.I forced myself to breathe, trying to calm my racing pulse. 

"These were the camp’s occupants," 

I said, my voice barely a whisper.

 "They… they were here. Something killed them. But—" 

I stopped, my throat tightening. 

"Who did this? What did this?"

Leah knelt beside the headless body, her expression unreadable. 

“We’ll need to call for an extraction. This is beyond us.”

The team documented the scene, but my mind reeled. The voices mimicking my loved ones felt like a distant dream, yet I couldn’t shake their reality. Hours in the cave yielded no answers—no struggle, no weapons, no tracks. The remains were methodically placed, chilling in their grotesque stillness.

The culprit was never found, the investigation closed without explanation. The voices stopped, and the creature remained hidden, as though it had always been there, waiting. Even after ten years, I can’t escape the feeling of being watched.

I still patrol the woods, climb the tower, and try to forget. But some nights, when the wind howls just right, I hear whispers—faint, familiar, but never anyone I know. I’ve never seen it again, yet I know it’s still out there, lurking in the dark, waiting for the next unwary soul.

Sometimes, alone in the tower, the voices return, soft and low, just beyond the wind. But no one’s ever there.
