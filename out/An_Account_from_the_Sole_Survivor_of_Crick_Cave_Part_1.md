In the shadow of an unnamed hill that makes up the Smokey Mountain Range is an opening in the earth where no living thing was meant to go. Millions of people hike these trails each year in search of the sublime views and the feelings of accomplishment that come with summiting these peaks, but most won't even notice the hole, and even fewer think about it for more than a few seconds. A couple of people every year will inevitably wander off trail, and fall into this opening, but the initial drop is only a few feet. Most hike out without injury, while others will need to be rescued due to more severe sprains or the occasional fracture. 

A small group of West Virginians now know this place as the site of the Crick Cave Disaster. Of the four people who have entered Crick Cave that day, I am the only one who made it out alive. In light of recent events, I have decided it’s time to finally share the true story of what happened those years ago.

The narrow entrance of Crick Cave was discovered during a training mission by the Army Core of Engineers over one hundred years ago. No one is sure why they were digging in that spot in particular, but the discovery was noted on a few old maps. For the most part, it was unknown outside of circles of local historians. 

I learned about Crick Cave while researching unexplored cave systems in our area. I have been caving and spelunking since I was a teenager, but my ambitions were always greater than just being a guy with a passionate interest in a hobby. My dream, like many who came before me, was always to be the first one to explore an unmapped cave, to go somewhere where no one had gone before. 

There were reasons why Crick Cave had never been explored. Firstly, that unassuming hole in the woods looks, even to a trained eye, like it goes nowhere. Decades of leaf matter have decayed and turned to soil, which covered the true entrance of the cave. Second, below this layer of undisturbed soil, sits a hole only one foot by one foot in size that leads downward into darkness. Most casual cavers wouldn’t attempt a blind entrance into such a narrow passage without some kind of assurance that it was safe, but I thought of myself as above most cavers. 

We made previous visits by nightfall to fully excavate and inspect the entrance, but then came the day we actually entered the cave. I brought with me three of the most experienced spelunkers I knew: 

Chelse’s narrow frame held the local squeeze record of 7.5 inches, and she had the intuition of a clairvoyant. We always trusted her judgment, and because of it we haven’t had a serious injury since she joined our crew.

Michael was the oldest, and had the wisdom of a sage. He was a bit like the dad of the group. His stoic demeanor and old-fashioned attitude were off-putting at times, but when you really got to know him, you learned he had a heart of gold. 

Dan, well, Dan’s parents were loaded, and he used his nearly unending funds to supply all the rope, ATC’s, headlamps and other gear you could ever need. He was immature for his age, and sometimes he drove us insane. But in truth, without his trademark childish optimism, the dark would feel a lot more empty. 

This was my project, so I was the leader. My “super-power” as some referred to it, was that I had a mild form of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In another life, I could have been a contortionist in a traveling circus, but in this life it made me the best caver around. The chronic pain it brought raised my pain threshold against the discomfort that drives away most to particularly difficult caves, and I’ve become extremely proficient at setting a dislocated limb. 

We arrived at night. In the caves, the placement of the sun doesn’t matter anyway, and though it wasn’t strictly illegal to cave here, it was a gray area. The less attention on us, the better. We stood in a circle around the hole and I climbed in. We agreed that I would go in first to scope it out. There was a very real chance that, beyond where our flashlights could penetrate, the cave narrowed or even ended. I prepared myself for the possibility that I was crawling headfirst to my grave. 

If I got stuck, I might not be able to get unstuck. They may not be able to rescue me before my head flooded with blood and I passed out and died. That thought never left my mind, but I wasn’t scared. Death was just the cost of doing business in caving. We all understood that.

The first dozen feet were easy for someone of my skill level. I pulled myself headfirst down the jagged rocks by one hand, sometimes making only inches of progress at a time. The cave was definitely narrowing, but not enough to be concerned about yet. I would sometimes have to blow all the air out of my lungs to pass through particularly narrow bits, but this wasn’t anything I wasn’t used to. Then I saw shadows of an opening ahead. It was impossible to tell yet, but this was the first sign that this cave went much deeper than we had imagined. 

Then progress slowed to a crawl. Inches became centimeters, which became millimeters. My body was corkscrewing through the tightening walls, finding any movement at all to be a major victory. My breaths grew incredibly shallow. The walls prevented my ribcage from fully expanding.

Then I hit a point where I felt stuck, like truly, panic inducingly stuck. 

Being upside down for an extended period of time causes blood to pool in your face. Decision-making becomes less reliable. The headaches can be skull-splitting. But, in this case, the problem was the swelling. My head was caught between two jutting out points in the wall and wedged completely. Any attempt to move forward was excruciating, and any attempt to back out proved to be fruitless. The sharp rocks dug into my skin, and it felt deep enough to leave score marks in my skull. With one final push, my head was free. Small streams of blood dripped into my eyes, making it impossible to see. In this position, I couldn’t reach my face with my hands to wipe it away so I had to move blindly the last few feet. 

Luckily, that marked the narrowest point. Progress sped up until I found myself plopping out the other side like a rag doll onto the cold, wet rock below. It always feels amazing to be free and able to move again after a tight squeeze. I desperately wiped at the now congealed blood that crusted my eyes as I called up to the crew that I had made it. I didn’t hear their response, but when the grunting and pained moans began echoing to me, I knew that they were on their way. 

I splashed water from my bottle to clean my eyes fully, and I could finally see that I was standing on a ledge about the size of a twin bed next to a drop off that my headlamp couldn’t penetrate to the bottom of. By the time it took for a rock to hit the bottom, I estimated the drop to be around 400 feet. It was nearly perfectly cylindrical. I tried not to dwell on how stupid it had been to blindly drop out of the narrow part of the cave. Anything could have been on the other side. One wrong move would have meant a fatal fall. I always had a propensity to let my eagerness get in the way of my safety, but this was dumb even for me.

Banishing those thoughts from my brain, I could tell that Chelse was close enough to talk to now. I warned her of the narrow part, but she proceeded past it without any trouble. We knew that Michael and Dan would have a harder time, so she volunteered to head back up a bit and chisel away at the extrusion. When she did, the cave responded by rumbling quietly. I had been in caves as the earth settled before, but this felt different. Earthquakes in this area are rare, but not impossible so we all just ignored it.

She successfully returned to the ledge. The chiseling had made it possible for the rest to make it through unscathed. When Dan’s head popped out of the exit, he joked that we should rename this cave Crick *Neck* Cave, and we all groaned at him. He had likely been saving that one for before we even started descending. 

Chelse commented that it might be wise to get the gashes on my head checked out before they got infected, but upon further inspection, they were less deep than they looked, so some yellowing old bandages and expired antibiotic ointment at the bottom of my first aid kit were enough to assure her that we could carry on. 

Dan and Michael talked gear while drilling out holes and setting bolts for the anchor we’d use to rappel. Chelse and I awkwardly sat next to each other waiting for them to finish. Years ago, we had tried to make a relationship work between us, but we learned that adrenaline and adventure aren’t enough to build a life on. We remained friends and swore to never let the breakup drive us apart, but still the scars felt fresh and sensitive, and it was almost difficult to be in each other's presence without a buffer. 

We each broke the silence with excited musings about the progress so far. Even if this was the furthest we made it, my life’s goal had been achieved. I was standing in a place where no one stood before. Every move deeper was only the icing on the cake. We were both relieved when Dan said we were all set to descend deeper into Crick Cave.
