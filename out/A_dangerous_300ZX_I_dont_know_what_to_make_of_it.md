So I met a guy named Mark a few months ago at a local coffee shop. At that time, he was looking to purchase a Nissan 300ZX 50th Anniversary model. A few weeks later, he found the car he was looking for: an 1989, burnt-orange-colored 300ZX coupe, at a local junkyard. I asked him, "Why did you buy a car that is so far gone? It will take a lot of money to restore it back to its original form." His reply was, "That is why I bought this car, because it has potential, and I'll make sure it's the best-looking car ever!"

  
The next day, he told me the car needed a few parts, including the hood, rear bumper, exhaust system, and a few other parts. A week later, he had a complete 300ZX without the motor. The motor had a few blown piston cylinders, so it wasn't worth the cost of restoration. So, Mark purchased a motor from a salvage yard in New Jersey, and it only cost him $700.00, including shipping and handling. The motor was a custom 3.0-liter, VG30DETT V-6 engine, with dual overhead cams, forged internals and aftermarket turbochargers; the motor produced a stunning 630HP. After the motor was installed, the car had the acceleration of a sports car.

  
A few months after Mark finished the restoration, I noticed the car had a black tint on the windows, and a strange sound was coming from the exhaust. I also noticed that the car was equipped with an alarm, and had a very large spoiler attached to the rear end of the car. One night, as I was driving home, I heard the strangest sound coming from behind me, so I pulled over and let the car pass. When the car passed by, the windows were completely blacked out, and the muffler sounded like a loud motorcycle. I could not see inside the car, and the lights were all off. The next morning, as I was leaving my house, I noticed the car parked outside. I walked over to the car, and the interior had been redone. It had Alcantara bucket seats fitted with 4 point harnesses, and a new dashboard with the latest electronics. As I was looking around, I saw a sticker on the rear bumper. It said "Tuner Team," and under the sticker was an inscription, which read, "If you are afraid of this car, then you should not drive it."

  
Mark told me that the car is now equipped with a special computer program, which allows the car to drive itself. All he has to do is punch in a few numbers on the computer, and the car will go wherever he wants. Mark also told me that the car can go from zero to sixty mph in under 3 seconds. I was amazed at what Mark had done to the car. After the upgrades were complete, Mark decided to test the car. He put the car on a deserted road, and started the engine. As soon as the engine started, the car started to shake, and a strange noise was coming from the tires. Mark tried to stop the car, but the brakes were locked, and he was unable to control the vehicle. Mark said, "I think the computer has taken control of the car, and it's trying to kill me." Thankfully, he shut down the engine before anything else could happen.

  
When I asked Mark about the Tuner Team, he told me that the members were all former racecar drivers, who had turned to tuning cars. They would go to a racetrack, and challenge the drivers to a race. If the driver won, then the Tuner Team would modify the car, and sell it back to the driver. Mark said, "I've already had two customers who bought the car, and the first customer crashed the car within two days of owning it."

  
One night, as I was driving down the road, I noticed a car following me. I looked in the rear view mirror, and saw a black 300ZX, with smoked windows. The car was right behind me, and it was not slowing down. I tried to speed up, but the car stayed right behind me. I pulled into a gas station, and the car followed me. I must've done something to anger the driver, I thought.

  
I got out of the car, and started walking towards the 300ZX. The driver rolled down the window, and I could see a young man, with black hair, and a tattoo on his neck. He said, "You'd better not mess with me, or you'll be sorry." Before I could even ask him why he was following me, he rolled up the windows and sped away.

  
The next day, I was at work, and I got a call from a woman, who told me that her son was involved in a car accident. The woman said, "He was driving his car, when another car rammed into him. He died instantly."

  
As I was talking to the woman, I heard a crash, and I looked out the window, and saw a black 300ZX, smashed into a pole. The woman said, "What was that noise?"

  
I told the woman that a black Z has crashed again just now.

  
After I got off the phone, I went outside, and looked at the 300ZX, which was now crumpled against the pole. There was no one inside the car, and it was still running. I shut the engine off, and got back in my car.

  
I told the police that the car was stolen, and that the driver was probably a drunk. When I told Mark about the accident, he said, "It's the car. It's possessed. That's why it killed those people. I have to get rid of it."

  
So, Mark sold the car to a guy named Bob.

  
The next day, I heard on the radio, that a man named Bob was found dead, in his garage. It was said that he had died while working on his car.

  
A few weeks later, Mark bought a new car. He was happy with the car, and said that it was a lot safer than the 300ZX.

  
Then, one day, Mark disappeared. His family said that he had gone away on a trip. But, they had not heard from him in over a week. They called the police, and a search was launched. A few days later, they found his body. It was buried in the woods, and it was said that he had been tortured.

  
The police investigated the case, and they found that Mark had been stalked by the Z for days leading up to the his death.

  
A year later, the police caught the killer. He was a man named Jim, who had bought the car after Bob. He said that the car had spoken to him, and that it wanted to kill. He was put in jail, and the 300ZX was sent to the junkyard.

  
But, the car was never destroyed. Instead, it was bought by a guy from just outside the town. I don't know what will happen, and frankly I wouldn't want to know.
