A few months ago my girlfriend and I moved into this new little neighborhood near my hometown in Wisconsin. We got all moved in and our lives seemed to have begun a brand new chapter, but this chapter has been full of fear and I must admit, I am still looking over my shoulder as I write this.

We started experiencing some weird things going on around house, random tools missing from our shed, hubcaps being taken from our cars, and other stuff like that. We shrugged it off at first because we were the "new couple" and it was probably just some of the neighborhood kids trying to make a quick buck or something. Eventually though, things started to get even stranger. These smiley faces kept being drawn in chalk on our driveway. There was a span of 5 days where we counted them every morning. We counted 19, 13, 9, 12, and then finally 5. I am not entirely sure why he chose those random numbers, but still.

Then all of a sudden they just stopped completely. My girlfriend and I were kind of freaked, but again assumed it was just a bunch of random kids. We ended up getting a few cameras and a ring doorbell though just to be safe. We weren't ready for what they would find. One night we were woken up at probably 3 AM to several alerts of movement on our cameras, something that was always some sort of animal like a raccoon or a coyote. I originally wasn't going to look but my girlfriend insisted.

When I opened my phone to view the live camera feeds, the first 4 had nothing on them. But then I switched to our last camera that overlooks our backyard, and someone was standing on our patio, in nothing but shorts and a T-shirt, staring into the camera and smiling. His eyes were almost completely sunken into his face, lifeless. He also kept slowly opening and closing his mouth, while simultaneously keeping a smile.

My girlfriend and I panicked and went to call the police, but right as I was about to switch off the camera, the man began waving his finger like he was telling me no, almost like he knew what I was thinking. He then pointed straight, still keeping his sinister smile on his face. Right as he pointed I heard my girlfriend scream.

There was another man staring into our bedroom window with the same grin, although his eyes were dark and lifeless. His face was pressed against the window and his breath began forming on it. He eventually wrote:

**"Give Us A Smile!"**

We were panicking at this point. The man in the window began laughing loudly, and my phone started exploding with notifications about movement. Every camera had one of these smiling men in it. I made sure the cameras were recording and I called the police. As soon as I put the phone to my ear, the man in the window began screaming, and his smile turned to a frown. He began crying and pounding on the window, all the men in the cameras doing the same expression.

At this point we closed the blinds, something we will be doing from now on, and waited for the police to arrive. We heard the sirens and eventually a knock at the door, so I checked the camera to make sure it was an officer.

I opened the door, and the officer said that they had caught a random man running through the woods after they arrived. He asked if I could identify him in the back of one of their vehicles. All he was doing was smiling at me. Nothing else. He didn't seem worried, concerned, upset, nothing.

Since that day, we have moved to a completely different neighborhood on the other side of the state, and life is a lot better there. None of those freaks are there either. To this day I still don't know why they were there, what they wanted, and if they were dangerous at all.
