The job listing was as inoffensive as they come. Thankfully I’d taken a screenshot of it before, since now it’s obviously been taken down.

I easily fit all the requirements. To be fair, anyone who’d worked as a bouncer before would have. But the pay was decent, and the bar I’d been working at for a whole year had just closed down, so I needed another gig. 



I sent them an email and got a reply back in less than half an hour. They asked if I could start tonight, to which I replied *Of course! Happy to get in the groove of things as soon as possible!* I hated my customer-service self, but it was a necessity to get jobs. To seem like a perfect person, when nobody ever was.



The next reply took me a bit by surprise, and the tiniest red flag was erected somewhere in the back of my brain by some animal synapse that said: *hey, that’s a bit odd*.



The message read thus:



>Dear Mr. Franklin

>

>We’re pleased to hear that you’ve taken the opportunity to join our exciting team!

>You will start today at 11 PM at The Entrance location, door A. Below is attached all the information you’ll need (The\_Entrance\_Guidebook\_Security.pdf), as well as a non-disclosure agreement for you to sign (Confidentiality\_Agreement\_2025.pdf).

Obviously their real name was there, but I won't divulge it. The agreement, or the NDA, wasn’t a concept I was really familiar with. It scared me a bit at first, but when I read through it, the whole thing seemed quite simple. It basically said that I can’t disclose the name of the company I work for, what the location of my job was, and especially not any of the clients. Otherwise I was free to say whatever. 



If you guys are worried that I’m breaking this agreement, I’m not. I will not be using any of the clients' names, and the other information I’m not supposed to share was explicitly written out, so it’s pretty easy not to put it here.



Even with all the weirdness, I thought I’d give it a shot. If it sucked, I could just walk out or not take more shifts.



I read the guidebook on the train on the way there. It wasn’t much of a book. Barely a booklet. All it had to say were four things:  


>The code to the key-box is “1234”. Return the key into the box after your shift.

>When you meet The Client, be cordial in your stature. DO NOT speak to The Client under any circumstances. 

>Unlock The Entrance with the key. Once The Client is inside, close the door and lock it.

>DO NOT unlock the door under any circumstances while The Client is inside.\*  


>\* Our clients expect a very specific experience at The Entrance, so it is imperative to our Customer Promise that the door remains locked until the next Client comes in.



My first thought was, *okay, it’s a sex club*. Not exactly my forte, but a bouncer is a bouncer is a bouncer. If they didn’t want me to open the door, then I wouldn’t open the door. But I did wonder *why* I’d want to open the door. Also, I guess I just assumed that there’d be another exit somewhere: in one way and out the other. Not entirely impossible.



It took about twenty-five minutes to walk to the location from the train. I won’t divulge anything that could give away where it was, but I’m quite confident in describing the actual site. Mostly because it looked like a million other places just like it: a nondescript warehouse that looked unoccupied. Door A seemed to be the only door leading into it. It was made of sturdy, thick metal, and painted yellow, although the paint was chipping off around the handle from years of use. 



One lamp was fixed above the door, drawing a faint, yellow-white aura around it. No other lights were on, making the location easy to spot. The place felt a bit eerie, as it was so quiet.



Next to the door, drilled into the concrete, was a box not unlike those used for AirBnBs. Stamped on it were the words “DOOR KEY. RETURN AT END OF SHIFT.” I put in the combination and opened it, grabbing the key and closing the box again. 



I wanted to try if the key worked, maybe even take a peek inside, but something in me disagreed. If it was a sex club, or something like it, I don’t think they’d like some random security guy to come stomping in and ogling. So I tamped down my curiosity, checked my watch–*10:58 PM*–and planted my feet next to the door. Then it was just a matter of waiting.



It’s not entirely unusual to have a gig like this. I mean sure, usually you come a bit earlier, have a chat with the owner or whatever, get a security badge and whatever else you need for the night. But since most jobs were the exact same, sometimes I’d show up for a bar gig and just get a nod from the owner, and them pointing to where I’d be standing for the following night, wrestling drunk guys off of each other and getting cussed at by kids with fake IDs.



So, whatever, I thought. Less hassle. But still, it was just that slight bit too weird for me not to think it over as I stood there. Maybe also because everything was silent, outside the door and beyond it. And no one had come in or out…



It was probably thirty minutes later when I heard a car pulling into the small parking lot at the edge of the property. A man stepped out, looked around for a bit, then started walking towards me.



When he was close enough, I put on an amiable smile and straightened my spine. The guy came into the aura of the light. He was younger than I thought, maybe in his early 30s. His hairline had receded enough to make shaving it off a better option. But the man was dressed in a fancy suit, tailored to perfection. He gave off the vibe of someone who’d gotten rich without really meaning to. A man who had enough money to not care about his balding head. Or maybe I was just bored enough that I was making up my own backstory for him.



He nodded, showed his ticket (a small paper that said “The Entrance” and “Admission ticket” with his name) and his ID to match, and I opened the door. I didn’t look inside, but I could see a faint, clinical light shining through lazily, like old fluorescents. And the smell that wafted out… like wet clothing. Dirty and faintly mouldy.



The man smiled and stared inside, the grin stretching from ear to ear. He waited for a moment, apparently taking it all in, although I couldn’t imagine what  could smell like that and be so interesting. Then he turned to me, as if trying to goad me into his mania. He nodded, then slowly stepped inside, still smiling.



When I was sure he was all the way inside, I slowly closed the door behind me. Before it shut, I could hear him whisper “It’s actually real.”



I wondered how many clients the company had every night. It’d taken a while for the first one to arrive, so maybe a handful. But then again, it was already closing in on midnight, so who knew when the most active hours were.



No sound came out. The man had gone in to see whatever was inside, leaving my mind to muddy itself with abject boredom.



I stood there until it was almost four in the morning. No one else had come in. I didn’t even hear a car anywhere during that time. I checked my watch patiently, determined not to leave early. Who knew if they were tracking me by some hidden camera. I didn’t want to lose the gig: boring beat fighting the inebriated and the young at some sports bar downtown. At least for now.



It was around five to four when something slammed inside the door, shaking the hinges. I jumped in fright, my cold muscles straining their way into movement. As I turned to look, the slam was followed by more shaking. Someone was banging the inside of the door.



“Help me! Fuck, let me out! It’s coming!” the man inside screamed.



Now, although the guidebook had said not to let anyone out, this was obviously an emergency. I’d seen enough to know when shit was actually going down, and this was one of those situations. I grabbed the key from my pocket and pushed it inside the lock. It bounced off as the man on the other side punched it once more, shooting it onto the ground. 



When I crouched to pick it up, a voice came from behind me. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”



A woman wearing a baggy hoodie and jeans was standing just outside the light, covered by the darkness. 



“He needs help,” I said, my voice dry and croaky from not speaking for so many hours.



“That’s the point,” the woman said, with no hesitation or danger in her voice. “Now put the keys in the box. Your shift is over.”



“Who the fuck are you?” I yelled, clutching the keys in my hand. I realized it’d contorted it into a fist. The other man was still banging on the door.



The woman stepped into the light. “It’s alright. I’ve got the next shift. Now just put the keys in the box, and go home. Everything’s fine. This is how it’s supposed to be.”



The banging stopped, leaving the air in awkward, sudden silence. Then came a sound like… like the world was about to end. Something between an air-horn and a dying animal, its pitch encompassing the whole spectrum, a drumming bass in my chest and the sticking of needles into my ears. I don’t know how long it went on. Maybe a few seconds, although it felt longer. Then it stopped, and the silence was no longer awkward, but welcome.



“I’m Jenna,” she said, still unfazed. Like she hadn’t heard a peep. “I’m guessing your next question is gonna be, ‘what the fuck was that?’”



I breathed out the breath I’d apparently held, trying to find the balance in my body again. Everything ached a little bit, like I’d gotten the smallest universal cramp, all the way from my head to my toes.



“So, what the fuck was that?” I said.



Jenna shrugged. “I don’t know. Not my job to know. But I should’ve started my shift five minutes ago, so how about we get on with it?”



Jenna seemed normal, by all accounts. Like any other coworker I’d had. Although her hoodie concealed most of it, I could see that she was strong. Broad-shouldered. And her jaw was tight, her eyes like knives. A good look for a bouncer.



I looked at the keys, then fumbled them inside the box. “Shouldn’t I just give these to you?” I asked, realizing the obvious. “If you work here, that is.”



“I’m supposed to get them from the box, so I’ll get them from the box.”



Once the keys were safely inside, Jenna shouldered her way in and grabbed the combination lock. “You should go home.”



A myriad of thoughts tornadoes about my head, each sticking for a moment and then letting go. *Was I involved in something illegal? Or at least unethical? What was inside the door, and who was controlling this whole thing? Why?*



“First time?” she said, startling me.



“Uhh, yeah.”



“You’ll get used to it. Just do what you’re supposed to, then go home.”



The advice seemed genuine. And Jenna didn’t seem like the fucked-up-person type.



“Is it gonna be like this every night?”



She shrugged. “Sometimes. But that’s the gig.”



She took her spot by the door and checked her watch. “You really should go.”



“Okay,” I said, not sure what else to say. What was even *safe* to say. “See you around.”



She made a sound like *hrmph*.



I fell asleep on the train. I had a nightmare about being chased by something long and spindly, but not quite like a spider. Something less animal, but not human either. When I woke up, I had gone two stops further than I should’ve, so I had to take another train back home.



The next day I woke up to an email. The title was “Shift schedule”. It outlined what days of the week I’d be working for the next month. 



And my next shift was about to start in about eight [hours](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com).
