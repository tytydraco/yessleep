When I woke up today, I wouldn’t have thought witches were in the forecast. It was a clear, bright morning, unusually cold for California but filled with crisp sunlight and dancing leaves. As I walked through the park on my way to work, I encountered the usual stream of dog walkers, bikers, and jogging moms with strollers.

Suddenly, a hard grip closed around my wrist. I had been grabbed by a young woman, sharply dressed in a black suit jacket and pencil skirt. She stared at my face through narrowed eyes, one a warm brown and the other an unsettling murky grey.

In an oddly formal tone, with every word carefully over-enunciated, she said, “Beware the spotlights double. They will bring you trouble.”

I laughed nervously and tried to pull away. Her grip tightened further, and an icy-hot sensation, like electricity lacing my veins, traveled up my arm. I realized that we were alone, the next-closest person having disappeared over a small hill a hundred feet away.

She said, still in that strange voice, “Today’s the end for you, shot on a stage of blue.” Then she blinked twice and let go of me.

“Sorry,” she said, sounding confused, “I don’t know what -”

“Hey you! Get out of here!” a shrill voice called from behind us. We turned to see an old woman pushing a walker down the path toward us as fast as she could. Curly white hair framed her face in a frizzy halo.

“This is my park!” the old woman shouted. “I registered it with the coven in 1967!”

The young woman next to me took a step backwards, as if uncertain whether to stand her ground or flee. By now, the angry old woman had reached us. She pointed a shaking finger toward the young woman.

“I’m the only one who practices witchcraft here,” the old woman said. “Get out!”

There was a loud *crack!*, and the young woman yelped and clapped a hand to her cheek, where a raised red welt had appeared.

“Get out!” the old woman repeated. The young woman was already stumbling away from us, unsteady in her three-inch heels.

The old woman laughed nastily. Then she looked at me, and her face instantly softened.

“Oh dearie,” she said. She reached out for my hand. I quickly put both of them behind my back.

Undeterred, she laid a papery palm against my cheek. That same hot-and-cold feeling from before radiated from her touch, sinking into my skin.

“The thread’s already cut,” she said, shaking her head. She smiled sadly at me. “Spend time with your loved ones. Get your affairs in order.”

“What - what do you mean?” I asked.

Her lips quirked. “Not the brightest, are you?” she said, a hint of meanness returning to her voice. “Dearie, you’re going to die in a home invasion tonight.”

With that, she wheeled her walker away, humming to herself.

I stood rooted in place. The young woman’s words from earlier played through my head, the old woman’s prediction of my imminent death giving them an ominous ring:

*Beware the spotlights double.*  
*They will bring you trouble.*  
*Today’s the end for you,*  
*shot on a stage of blue.*
