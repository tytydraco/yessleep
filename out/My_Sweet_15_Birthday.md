I expected going through puberty would be a tough time for me. Guess I was the few lucky ones.

First of all, because of my growth spurt, Once a lanky kid back of the class, now an athelete. Only one year, I became a star. Everyone in my class wanted me in their sport teams or group projects. Making friends seemed so much more easier. Who would have thought that just being taller would matter this much?

Despite all the great things, I also noticed some strange phenomena. Recently, I had to shop for more bug-spray. I got a lot of bites. There's one morning when I woke up, blisters and blebs all over my skin. Bed full with ants. I had an exterminator coming third time this year. Also, more beehives. More squirrels and pigeons around my house, too. Stray cats started following me to school now, huh, weird.

Today's my birthday. I planned to have a huge birthday party, the whole class invited. Actually, I'm thrilled since I never got to do something like this. I was invisible, but not anymore. After my announcement, my party became the only thing everyone was talking about. Dan would bring the cake. Steve had a boardgame. Annie from another class wanted to join. Even Annie, the prom-queen? Whoa.

After basketball practice, I rushed home to prepare things. Almost 30 squirrels at my front lawn. Almost accidentally kicked one. No time for now. Snack, check. Music, check. Play Station, check. I laid down from exhaustion, smiled. Couldn't wait for it. Crumpet hopped to my side. A 5 year old rabbit, very sweet boy. Didn't notice he got this big. I pet him. He seemed more affectionate than usual. He sniffed my arm.

The sun had set. My heart raced. Finally, doorbell! I sprang up so quickly from excitement. Crumpet, startled, bit me in the arm. Ouch! I knew he's jumpy, but he never bit me before. Ding-Dong! "I'm coming!"

I was walking to the front door. Wait, something... was wrong. The air was heavy. Then, I heard a huffing sound, a laboured breathing. It got louder and louder. It's from behind. I turned my head. Crumpet, on all four, twitching, his eyes fixated on me. grinding his teeth.

The rabbit pounced, bit a fresh chunk from my left forearm. "Wha- What the hell!?" I fell, he gnawed my legs with his sharp claws. Teeth digging into my calf. I screamed. Crumpet letted out an atrocious howl. Rabbit couldn't make such haunting sound. I gathered my mind and sprinted. Couldn't even remember which direction. That was the time I was reminded that rabbits are fast, REAL FAST. Crumpet gained on my legs. I pushed him back again and again until I was holed and bloody. I hid in a laundry closet. I could hear Crumpet scratching the door. What happened to my little boy?

Rabies? But this was not anything I had seen on Youtube. Plus, The last check-up revealed nothing. DING-DONG! I totally forgot about my friends. That's right! They could help. Let's call- wait, my pockets were all ripped! My phone must had fallen when I ran. Goddammit!

An hour passed. The doorbell still ringing, so was the scratching. I had to get out. Crumpet got rabid, but he's still a small bunny. After that tamtrum, he had to rest. I waited. At least, the bleeding had stopped.

Two hours. My friends must had gone home by now. My party was ruined. But first, survival. Finally, silence. No shadow at the door. Okay, Okay, Okay. I took a deep breath. "Phone, then front door!" I barged out the closet. No Crumpet at the hallway. I ran like hell.

Suddenly, something moved. At the closet handle. Crumpet, hanging on with his hind legs.

The rabid rabbit leaped onto my face. I grabbed him. Howls and screams. I swayed left and right, hitting everything. I tumbled back into the laundry closet. Detergent knocked all over myself. I tried to throw a basket full of clothes at him. The weight should had stopped him. But to no avail, the rabbit stood strong, maybe from the adrenaline. I was cornered. He glared at me. I had no way to defend myself. My eyes sore from the detergent. He crouched, ready. The buck-teeth predator was meant to kill. CHOMP!

But not at me... Crumpet went ballistic at the clothing in the basket. Tearing them from piece to piece. Why? But, hell, good chance. I locked him up and ran.

DING-DONG! I was surprised. My friends were still there? Anyway, they could save me. I still got some luck left.

As I was limping to the door, "Why the clothing?", still wondered. Then, something ticked. It was my clothing. I remembered an article I read a long time ago. "Why do we feel attraction to each other?" It's because of the thing called 'pheromones'. We all produce them, and it can affect other people, or creatures. I was soaked in detergent, Crumpet then changed his target. "It's the smell". I began to understand. So that's why all the critters had been following me. I must had some unique smell that attracted them. 

Then, I realised the horror. It's not the smell that created intimacy, but appetite. That means, my pheromones could turn a peaceful rabbit into a ferocious carnivore. What about all the animals gathering around my house? I gulped.

Finally, the front door. "P-Please, help me". Heck, my voice was too quite from all the blood loss. Feeling dizzy. I used my remaining strength to reach the door knob.

Before turning, just one horrible thoughts.

&#x200B;

"What about...people?"

&#x200B;

Door opened. The whole class were there. All eyes fixated on me.
