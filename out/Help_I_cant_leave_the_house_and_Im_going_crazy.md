I had woken up to my usual alarm. It is Monday morning and I had to get ready to get back to work. I had spent the last week doing a marathon of League of Legends in my basement and didn’t leave the house during that period. I dedicated myself to spend my staycation grinding to make it to platinum. Unfortunately I was not able to make it, I needed more time. Granted my job is a stay at home job as customer service. Just answering calls and helping people online. That being said, my routine is pretty simple. I wake up, brush my teeth, make breakfast, take Lola for a walk, clock in for my job, and finally spend the rest of the day on League. Yeah I know what an amazing life but today it all changed.

As I brushed my teeth I had an odd feeling. As if something was off. I mean I had just spent the last week playing non-stop League so it could just be that my body is just trying to get back to the routine. When I say I was doing a marathon I was doing a **marathon**. I avoided all outside distractions. Even Lisa, the girl I met two weeks ago, I met her at a party and we really hit it off. I have to thank Dylan before I forget again. Maybe that's what I was feeling. But I don’t feel like that's it. I can't really put my finger on it. I stared at myself in the mirror. I have to admit I did look pretty rough, a bit pale. My hygiene was not in the best shape. Then I turned on the sink and when I splashed my face with some water I noticed the water didn’t feel right. I quickly stepped back a bit freaked out. I stared at the water coming out of the sink. It looked more cloudy. The texture of the water felt off. It felt thicker. I turned it off and on. I mean it looked like water. Maybe there was something going on with the pipes. I will have to call a plumber later. 

I checked the shower and the water was normal. Maybe it really was just the sink. I relaxed a bit with the idea that I can at least take a hot shower. I stood under the water just trying to relax my sense of unease. Something was bugging me. The disconnection of reality even for just a week can really have a toll on a person. Then mid shower the water cut off. Now I was just frustrated. I cleaned myself off and rushed downstairs into the basement to get a fresh set of clothes from the dryer. I angrily put on my clothes but before I went back up stairs from the corner of my eye. I noticed my washer. The opening was gone. I walked up to it for a closer look in disbelief. It was my washer but there was no opening. The door was completely gone. As if the washer was just a block of metal. Someone had to be messing with me. Dylan must have came in the middle of the night while I was knocked out and done this. He probably messed with my pipes too. This is all just some sick prank from him. I ran back upstairs and grabbed my phone. I had put my phone on don’t disturb for the whole week so I had a ton of notifications. I ignored them all to straight away text Dylan. The last conversation we had was the coordinations to the party.

**I saw your prank Dylan, It's kinda lame man. Come here and fix it.**

I breathed in and out. I had to calm down. This isn’t really a big deal. It does save me from having to call a plumber if this was just some prank. Such a lame prank honestly. But it is impressive since I didn’t hear it last night. Huh, I must have been really knocked out. Trying to stay on routine I headed to the kitchen to start breakfast. I placed the pot for coffee and got the eggs out of the fridge. I needed some background noise so I headed to the living room to turn on the tv to listen to the news of the day. When I turned it on I was met with static. I switched through channels and was met with nothing. If it wasn’t static it would just be a black screen.  What the hell is going on? Was this part of Dylan's prank?  I decided to just use my phone. I went on youtube and looked up my favorite podcast. But when I did I was just met with the spinning wheel of death. I had wifi bars. What was going on? I clicked to text Dylan.

**Dude what did you do?**

I checked and both text messages were sent. So at least those are going through. I clicked to text Lisa next to answer her messages.

**Hey it was nice meeting you at the party**

**Are you free this week?**

**Hello?**

I'm starting to think I took my staycation a little too far. Now I feel stupid. I was ready to text her an apology and some bullshit excuse. I can just say my phone was broken. But when I tried clicking the bar to type it wouldn’t let me. I tapped harder and harder but it wouldn’t budge. I started tapping every other part of my phone, home, back to the text app, youtube, back to home, it worked. It just didn’t let me text her. When I got back to the text app her chat bubble greyed out. I have never seen the app do that before. Does that mean she blocked me? I mean I wouldn’t blame her for it. I am such an idiot. But when I started to scroll down I saw all the other bubbles greyed out too. I couldn’t text them either. The only one not greyed out was Dylan. There is no way he messed with my phone too. Now I don't know how to feel. Anger, frustrated, stupid. Finally Dylan responded.

**Hey man, nice to hear from you after a week. I bet the staycation was great. Not sure what you mean by prank, what's going on?**

Now I was actually mad. He is playing this dumb act of not knowing what was going on. I responded quickly.

**You messed with my plumbing, replaced my washer, and did something to my wifi. Its not really funny Dylan, just come here and put it back to normal.**

I waited for a bit and he responded quickly.

**I have no idea what you are talking about dude. I'll come over to see what's going on.**

I was ready to respond back telling him he better but his chat bubble got greyed out too. Now I couldn’t text him. I tried calling but nothing. Instead the call will just drop immediately. Then it clicked in my head. I had forgotten about Lola. I started calling out for her. I immediately began to panic. She always greeted me in the morning but she didn’t today. I ran to check every room. I checked her bed that is usually kept in the corner of the living room. Nothing. She was gone. Now before you judge me I obviously still took care of Lola during my staycation. I literally saw her before bed. Maybe she got out during the night, I must have left a door open. I ran to the backyard patio door and that's when my heart sank. Outside I saw a giant blanket of fog covering the view of my backyard. It was thick and made it impossible to see anything pass it. I could only make out shapes but nothing of the details. I stood there in disbelief. I have never seen something like this. This just wasn’t any kind of ordinary fog. When I reached for the patio door it didn’t budge. I checked the lock and it was unlocked for sure. But the door wouldn’t budge. I pulled and pushed with all my strength and it wouldn’t budge an inch. I reached for the window and it wouldn’t budge either. Now the feeling of dread was starting to really sink in. I ran to every corner of my house and every opening to the outside world wouldn’t budge. My breathing started to become erratic, I was feeling claustrophobic. My heart started to pound in my ears. I started to look around. There has to be an answer to what is going on. 

Then I noticed the eggs I took out this morning were gone. I opened the fridge to make sure I didn’t put them back in by accident but not just the eggs were missing but many food items were missing too. I shut the fridge in frustration and turned to the coffee machine only to see the pot sitting there. I smacked myself to snap into reason. Am I going crazy? I have to think of a reasonable explanation. But I feel like that only made me crazier. If things are going missing from this morning. That could only mean the person doing this to me… Is in my house.

That is the only logical explanation. I don’t think this is Dylan. This is someone who is trying to torment me or worse. Well whoever this is they are stuck in here with me. The only problem is I didn’t want to go look for him. If it wanted to do harm to me, looking for him and potentially walking into its trap is exactly what it would want. I can’t explain the fog outside but at this point, the lengths it's gone to keep me trapped here, I can see it being part of its plan. But then again I realized the flaw of my thinking. I already checked every room in the house when I went looking for Lola. And no one came out to kill me. It could potentially be sitting in a closet waiting for me to open it to lunge out and kill me then. I was shaking at this point. Out of anger or fear I couldn’t tell you.

I opened my phone one more time for a hail mary. Then I noticed the notifications that I ignored earlier. There were multiple new emails, more than usual, and multiple with the important tag on them. When I opened my Inbox multiple emails had the subject as.

**Warning! 5 Days Left**

**Warning! 4 Days Left**

**Warning! 3 Days Left**

**Warning! 2 Days Left**

**Warning! Final Warning!**

I didn’t recognize the sender. The email was unrecognizable. It was a business email that's all I could put together. I couldn’t open the emails no matter how hard I pressed on the screen. How is it possible to be able to see my inbox but not be able to see or respond to my emails? But again nothing on my phone was making sense. I hadn’t received any new text messages. My last email was that final warning email. Now I truly feel like something bad is happening to me. Those subject titles from those emails were only making me more anxious. Could it be a warning from my captors, could I have prevented this if I only had checked my email once during my staycation. I tried calling 911 and every phone number on my phone and nothing worked. But instead of the call just dropping I instead was met with a female voice.

**“Your features have been suspended for the time being”**

Then the call dropped. Shouldn’t it be services rather than features? I don’t know and honestly it was least of my concerns. I couldn’t call for emergency services. Then I remembered that Dylan said he was on his way. The best thing I can do now is to just wait for him to arrive. Thank god I was able to send that text message out. Dylan right now is my last hope in getting me out of this. I should wait in the living room until he arrives but as I walked into the living room it was empty. The furniture and even my tv were gone. Everything was gone. This wasn’t a person doing this, it was an entity, an anomaly, paranormal, this was something not from this world. The world as I know it was coming to an end. My world. Things around my house are disappearing right before my very eyes. In desperation I grabbed a chair from the kitchen and threw it against the patio door. Didn’t budge. It is as if my house had become whole. The fog was still outside. Same as earlier. Then a shadow passed through the house.

I ran to the front door. The shadow of someone passing outside peered into the living room. But when I looked outside I couldn’t make out any details. I only saw the silhouette of someone but I couldn’t make out who it was. Then they walked away. Then someone else passed. I can make out the few feet in front of my house but I couldn’t see past the sidewalk. How are people walking in this fog? How could they even possibly see in it? Unless they weren’t human!? This must have been an alien takeover. It must have happened during my staycation and I was the only living thing that didn’t get kidnapped. But if an alien takeover did happen… How was I talking to Dylan? Was I even talking to Dylan? Now I had too many questions and no answers. My head was spinning. I would sit on my couch but that was gone. 

Finally a bigger shadow peered through the window. The silhouette just stood in front of the entrance to my yard. They just stood there. Maybe it was Dylan. I started to pound at my window with every once of my strength. I yelled at the top of my lungs. I kept going until my hand started to really hurt and my knuckles started to bleed. Please Dylan. Please let it be you. But the silhouette did not budge. It stood there for a few more minutes. It looked like it was looking down, possibly a phone? I checked my phone but I didn’t get any new text messages instead the screen had turned black with a timer counting down from an hour. 

I fell to my knees and rolled into a ball. My dog is gone, my stuff is disappearing, as far as I know my world is ending or has already ended. All I can do is just sit here and do nothing but let whatever forces take me. I began to bawl my eyes out. The feeling of hopelessness washes over me. As I sat there my eye caught the reflection of a red light from one of the walls of my empty living room. It was coming from outside. It looked like it was moving or changing hues. I got up and looked outside. I didn’t see anything at first until I looked up at the angle the light was coming from and there floating in mid air. Big red text lighting the front of my house spelled.
