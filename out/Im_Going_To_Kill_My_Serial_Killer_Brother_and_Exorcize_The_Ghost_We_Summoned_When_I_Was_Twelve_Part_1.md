*To my dearest friends and found family: whatever you’re going to see on the news isn’t the full story. I know you are confused, but I can assure you -for better or for worse- that everything I’m about to say is true. I am mentally sound. I am not insane.* 

*Think about it this way -how much do you know about me? Like about my past, about my biological family, where I grew up, all of that stuff you come to know about someone. None of it -you know none of it, and for very valid reasons I will soon come to explain.* 

*I have an older brother -that’s one thing you don’t know about me. He’s not famous or anything, in fact I’m sure you’ve never heard of him unless you happen to be in a very particular context. If you happen to be driving around Clarkson County, Central Nevada -perhaps on a road trip listening to the radio, stopped at a diner, absentmindedly watching the news, and you see the headlines of eight dead bodies and the uncaught suspect linked to them all, then you’d have heard of my brother.* 

*But you most likely haven’t, because when I moved halfway across the country I made damn sure to move to a place where no one had ever heard of Clarkson County, or Cal. Or me.* 

*If you look on a map, nestled in the upper right corner of the county lines is a tiny dot called Sunset Avenue: Modern Luxury Mobile Living. That’s where I spent the first fourteen years of my life, where I swore to never set foot in again, and exactly where I’m headed the minute I finish this letter.* 

*It’s a dumpster, Sunset Avenue. The name is fancy, but that’s just what you do when your stuck with a pile of garbage: name it something nice to lure in unsuspecting victims, trick them into thinking “It can’t that bad, why would you name it something so nice if it’s that bad,” but it is that bad, I can promise you that. It’s a trap with a name that draws you in like the mouth of one of those big glow fish: forty-two yellowed trailer teeth, cavities of trash in red-gum sand, air hot and thick and sore throat scratchy.* 

*My brother and I summoned a ghost, he tried to kill somebody and I left home.*

*Now, he’s killing again and I’ve decided to stop him. I’d done such a good job of erasing my past life that I can offer you little to no proof except for a diary, the sole possession from my childhood that I’ve kept throughout these years. I’ve torn out snippets and attached them here to be read by you all.* 

*Please forgive me for all that I’ve done. I am not innocent, but I hope that these entries can give you all a little more insight into what I’m about to do and why I’m about to do it.* 

*The day it started Cal was pestering me, as he always was, probably hitting or pinching. He was hurting me for sure, that’s just what he did.* 

*I’ve torn out the first few pages of the dairy where it all started. “Stop whining Mouse-” He probably said, using the nickname he knew I despised, “Don’t be such a-”* 

“-*pussy*,” he says the word in slow motion, all bloody gums and bad breath. Cal’s just started swearing. He says bad words taste like candy: he sucks on each sugary syllable, savors them, and spits them out like the sour coating in a bag of skittles. The park is empty save for the heat vibrating on the horizon and Sunset Avenue opens itself, like an unwanted birthday present, into a reflection of the day before us: endless, empty, and hot.  

I’m relieved for Cal’s sake at the emptiness, and depressed for my own. All the adults are working, and none of the other kids will get near us. It feels like this summer has lasted forever. 

Cal’s sweaty meat hands wrap around my arms and twist. 

“We can go down to the fire roads, Cal. We can do whatever you want: catch frogs, ride bikes down the hill, we can even look for river gold-” 

He twists harder, his hands twice the size of my arm, and pain shoots in a red smear across my vision. 

“We’ve already done that this week,” He hisses. “Im. Bored.” 

“Or play tag,” I’m squeaky like my nickname, his arms wrinkling my flesh like dirty laundry, “or hide and seek-” 

“You're useless!” 

His eyes are angry hot fire. I know what he wants and I don’t want to give it to him, but I always do- 

“Fine! Let’s steal something! Cigarettes from the Gas’n’Go down the block!” I gasp. 

He relaxes his grasp. 

“Now that’s a good idea.” 

We’ve recently picked up smoking, both of us coughing as we’d hide behind the poolhouse; him taking slow, long breaths, inhaling until his eyes watered and he’d choke out smoke in snotty black clouds, me sputtering and gasping as his sweaty hotdog fingers forced my jaw open.

“Breathe, breathe, breathe” he’d mutter, until I couldn’t take it anymore and did.

“The cashier-man saw us last time…” He scowls. 

He thinks, and as he does I can almost see the cartoon-smoke shooting from his brain, an ugly wrinkled thing, like a baby rat, shoved in the corner of a thick empty skull. He looks like a constipated pillsbury dough boy. My cheeks tickle as I try to hide my smile. 

“We’re going to steal ‘em from Mr. Darcey instead.” 

My face goes flat. Oh Goobles.

“Wait -no!- why not the Gas’N’Go!?” 

“‘Cause it’s boring. And there’s no way we’re getting caught -he’s definitely passed out already-” 

He continues on as he starts to pick his way across the trailer rows. 

Each breath makes my chest a little tighter. Chestnut. Goobles. I let the word out-

-Fuck. It helps a little. 

I conjure up a mental rug, lift it up, think the word and shove it under, again and again, until I feel like I can breathe a little better:

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. 

…

Ma says Mr. Darcey is something called a “hoarder,” and a “drunk.” Papa calls him a “real freak,” and a lot of other names like “Ex-Hollywood Dropout,”  “Thinks-He-Knows-Better-Than-Us,” and “Trash.” 

To me, ‘Trash’ is the name that fits best. Spiderwebs of junk fill every crevice of open space; mountains of boxes, plastic bags, old appliances, and tin cans pile up in high stacks on the front lawn until they look almost humanoid, like some demented scene from Night at The Museum. 

“Freak,” Cal mutters under his breath. He always liked Pa's nicknames the best.  

The windows are full of shadows. Styrofoam, beer cans, and takeout-boxes are like overgrown lily pads in a river of dead grass and dry floor. 

I look around, nobody’s watching. The door’s left wide open, Mr. Darcey’s air conditioning has been blown out since forever. 

Cal looks back at me excitedly. His eyes shine in moments like this. 

“If you make a sound, I'll kill you,” he grins. His voice doesn’t match his smile. 

We go in. 

The inside is about the same as the out, save for the swampy trash-smell, thick in the heat like breathing nuclear cotton balls. We spend about forty seconds silently gagging before we can continue, jungle-gyming our way through the small and rare spots of empty ground. Cal’s a natural, somehow perfectly quiet despite his overdrawn, cartoonish tiptoe -a large, grinch-ish smile blooming across his face. Panic like a swarm of bees kicks up in my stomach as I almost knock over one of the hundreds of landmine beer cans. 

Think about how happy Cal's gonna be after this and we’ll never have to do it again, I think, and I’m able to take another step.  

The trash towers block our vision at first, but then there he is, Mr. Darcey, passed out on his kitchen table just like how Cal said he would be. My fingernails dig into the side of my mouth as Cal approaches his unconscious figure, shaking my head violently as he sticks his middle finger out. He’s about five feet away, then he’s only two, reaching out past Mr. Darcey’s head and onto the table -I frantically wave my hands in a big STOP!- and he picks up a pack of American Eagles. 

“Score!” he mouths and holds them up.

“Lets go!” I mouth back.

But he doesn’t, and continues to rummage around the table for a few seconds, pocketing this and that, until he picks up a small purple notebook. 

“Diary!” he mouths joyfully.

“NO!” I mouth again.

He slips it into his pocket. Electricity ribs through my stomach and I double down at the panic-drum inside me. We are no longer kids bumming cigarettes but rather thieves, diary thieves of secrets and scandals, and depending on Mr. Darcey’s scandals, which I imagined were very deep and very dark, we have the very real chance of being hurt. 

I have to get out of here. I inch a step back. 

The heel of my toe bumps into an empty glass bottle, and it upturns onto the floor. 

Clink.

The bottle rolls 

-rattle, rattle, rattle-  

into a box, which shakes a little, and disturbs another series of bottles perched unsteadily on the loose foldings of its lid. They tumble to the floor.

Clink. 

Clink.

Crack! 

Mr. Darcey grunts and lifts his head. The swamp trash smell is quickly taken over by the prickly, hand-sanitizer smell of alcohol. In a past life, Mr. Darcey could have been very handsome, he probably was back in his old life in LA. But now he looks more demon than man: swollen, veiny face twisted like a dark root by age, fingernail pick-spots all over his skin, his face purple and marbled with plague. His eyes, veiny with whites too big for his pupils, are open much too wide and focused exactly on us. 

For a moment, all is silent and we all just stare back and forth. 

Then, Cal turns to me. 

“I’m going to kill you,” he says, his face flushing violet. 

I believe him wholeheartedly. I turn heel and run. 

I’m almost to the door, knocking over towers of trash behind me when I hear Cal’s scream:

“GET OFF ME!-” 

-And I can’t help but turn back and look. 

Mr. Darcey’s arm has latched itself onto Cals, and he’s pulling him back as my screaming, squirming brother tries to run away. 

Cal cries again and yanks his arm, Darcey flies forwards with him, jelly-bones except for his white-knuckle grasp. They topple into a pile of junk, cockroaches splashing out of old take-out and onto their skin. Cal screams again as Mr. Darcey grabs at him over and over in spasming lunges, his head rolling back and forth in bobble head fashion, eyes almost bulging out of his skull. 

“Guaughah,” Darcey groans something unintelligible. A cockroach crawls up his arm and onto his neck.  

“Fucking HELP,” Cal screams, 

Leave him, the voice in my head thumps, a chant in tune with the barrel-drum heartbeat in my ears. 

Tha-thump-tha-thump-tha-thump-leave him. You hate him.

I don’t. 

I grab Mr. Darcey behind the waist and roll sideways, pushing to the side with all my body weight. I’m lucky he’s so drunk -I’m able to offset his balance, and while I smack onto the floor, he crashes into the table, head hitting the corner with a loud whack. He is still.  

I’d seen blood before, on my scraped knees, cut elbows, in little fingernail prints from Cal’s big meaty hands. The thick, creamy red that crawls out from Darcey’s head is something else though, pooling out like a puddle with no rain. 

I’m frozen. There’s something about it. 

“What are you doing!” Cal says, grabs my arm, and pulls me out. The minute our feet hit the cracked-sand floor, we bolt. We are a hurricane of panting and pounding feet until we make it to our trailer. Cal slams the door, latches it, and we both fall to the ground. 

“Idiot-” Cal doubles over. His arms are a patchy white and red from Mr. Darcey’s iron-hot grasp. 

“I’m going to get you,” Spit drips from his open mouth and onto the floor, “I’m going to get you for this…later.” 

*…* 

Cal pulls out his bounty: a pack of cigarettes, two beer cans, an empty glass bottle, a switchblade, and the diary, which is not a diary but rather an instruction manual of sorts.

The insides of the journal are strange, and we look in fascination at penned drawings of upside down goats and scrawled print in foreign languages.

“Papa says he’s one of those Hollywood devils,” Cal mutters as he flips a page, “That he drank himself in, then drank himself right on out of there.” 

I shiver at that. Darcey certainly looked more monster than man. 

Cal flips another page, then pauses. Another series of writing, this time in English. He’s never been one for reading, so he shoves the book at me. 

*To Summon A Dark And Malevolent Force.*

*To Summon A Dark and Malevolent Force: Five candles. An Intention. A sacrifice, skinless. A cup of blood. Must be at 3:33am. Must be able to recite the chant:* 

*Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector*

*Pour the blood upon the sacrifice, kneel, and continue to chant-*

*-*there’s more, but I stop reading. I’m suddenly nauseous. Cal grabs the book from me and tries to sound it out himself:

“Lu-Kerm-Desert-Ugh!” He shoves the book back at me, “Keep reading! I want to hear what happens next.” 

I shake my head, and for a moment I think he may hit me. But he doesn’t, and I allow myself a deep breath -his anger must be dampened by the thrill of stealing and the terror of Mr. Darcey. 

He sighs, gives me an ‘I’ll get you’ look, grabs the book and sulkily flips through pages on the couch. 

He hides it later, when our parents get back from work, then gets right back to it the minute they zone out to the TV. 

He starts to do that a lot in the upcoming weeks. 

… 

“I want to do the ritual.” 

I squirm as Cal’s shadow looms over me. He’d spent the last week ignoring me, flipping through the book with such an uncharacteristic focus and intensity that Ma had tested him for the flu. I, who didn’t know a world aside from the one built around my brother’s terror, had wasted my newfounded freetime paralyzed, nauseous and nervous, expecting *something* to come -and here it did. 

“We can’t,” I say, but I know it’s already been decided. “Darcey will  know we took the book.” 

Mr. Darcey hadn’t died, we’d seen him at the Gas’N’Go the next day with a big ol’ bandaid slapped upon his forehead. He had no memory of that afternoon, although every night since I had dreams of his still body and the spill of his blood.

“Nobody will see us  if we do it on the fire roads,” He says, “Either do this with me or I get you back for fucking it up with Darcey,” he whispers, his eyes are excited and wide. 

I nod. He straightens. 

“I need you to kill something for me.”

…

*Five Candles.*

We pocket them from the Gas’N’Go. Light work, really, Meg at the counter knows us and doesn’t give a flying toucan about what we do -so long as it doesn’t show up on the cameras. Cal takes a lighter. He uses it to smoke. 

*An Intention.*

“I’m going to wish for a thousand dollars,” Cal says, proudly. I roll my eyes. I’m still trying to talk him out of it. 

“And why would the Devil give you of all people a thousand dollars?” I say. 

“Why would he give any of those rich Hollywood shmucks a thousand dollars?” He scoffs, “They're no better than me. Papa says they’re all demon worshipers anyway.” 

He has a point.

“Think of what we could do with a thousand dollars! We could have a truck! A flatscreen TV!” 

Maybe with a thousand dollars Cal will up and leave, or maybe we’ll all leave and find out that it’s Sunset Avenue, not us, that there's something wrong with. Maybe we could be a normal family, who has more than microwave dinners and even goes to a country club.  

I became a little tempted after that. 

*One Sacrifice, Skinless.*

The rabbit winks its nose a couple times. The animals are real friendly in the fire roads, which is strange because nobody ever goes down there except for Cal and I. Unfortunately, it’s the perfect place to summon a dark and malevolent force.

Cal’s hand is like cement on my shoulder.

“Do it, Mouse,” he says. Getting the sacrifice is my job, -‘to make up for what happened with Darcey,’ he said- the skinning is his. He flicks Darcey’s stolen switchblade in and out, a metallic slinking drumbeat to what I’m about to do next. 

The plastic trash bag shakes in my hands and I hold the carrot out stupidly. I’m shaking more than the rabbit. I look back at Cal. He points the switchblade at me. I keep going. 

“Here rabbit, rabbit, rabbit-” I try to say it reassuringly, but my misery must scare the thing because it scampers off. I try to hide it, but I’m more than a little relieved. 

Cal laughs, grows bored, sits under the shade, picks his nose. 

I wander into the tall grass, causing little tornados of scampering and squeaking. 

‘Run!’ I say in my mind, and they do, and it works except for the fact that Cal had said earlier that I would be the skinless sacrifice had I not caught any and my brother became angry when he deemed things not moving ‘fast enough.’ 

Enough fooling around. I sigh and change tactics. I’d watched *Tom and Jerry* more than enough times to know the basics of a bait-and-switch. I lay the carrot out near a tree, and hide myself behind a tall patch of grass nearby. 

My legs strain, and sweat drips down my face but I hold still. A squirrel crawls up slowly, chittering by the carrot. I count to three then frog-leap at it, soaring through the air, for a moment maddened with pure primal instinct. 

Wham! I hit the ground with a thud. The bag pulsates, the squirrel twirling inside. 

Cal, who must have heard me hit the ground, runs over and grabs the bag. Wordlessly he flings it upwards and cracks it down against the tree. There is a strange cry, and a crunch -the sound so visceral and unlike anything I’d ever heard before. The bag is still. Cal stashes it under a root. 

“Let's go,” he says huskily. Something in the violence makes his features, usually so ugly and off-putting, seem to come together with strange harmony.

I spend a long time in the shower that night. No matter how long I let the water wash over my head, that sound, that crack and sharp cry, echoes in my brain over, and over, and over again. 

*A cup of blood* 

The squirrel sat undisturbed all weekend, we didn’t dare go near it when the parents were home. It’s Monday though, and the smell is dizzying. 

Cal lifts up the black plastic trash bag. We are scared of what happens next. 

When he opens it, my stomach tries to empty itself. Black blood has congealed around matted hair and cracked, fleshy scabs. The body’s limp; it’s mouth open, eyes rotted off. 

Cal grabs the head and twists -crack!- and the head pops right off. I have to walk a lap after that. 

He hands me a plastic cup, tells me to hold the now headless squirrel above it, by the tail. The blood that drips out is black. Pink and white tendrils of organ spill out of the neck like little rat tails. 

“A cup of blood,” Cal watches, “I’ll skin it afterwards.” 

Underneath the fur, the tail is hard. It’s like a baby snake. 

*3:33 am* 

The crickets chant so loudly that I wonder if they crawled up my ears and snuck themselves into my head while I slept. It’s all I hear, those ringing clicks. I swear I can feel their little legs shuffling alongside the soft inner-part of my skull. 

Cal’s perfectly alert. He’s been in a great mood all day, like a kid on Christmas morning. 

“A thousand dollars,” he’d whispered to me earlier, and winked. I know he doesn’t care about the thousand dollars. The boy likes to see things bleed. 	

The blankets laid out in front of us -the family blanket that Ma bought for picnics before she stopped caring. Four candles on each edge. Cal’s holding the book. The squirrel, a newly skinned, warty flesh-thing is in the middle. Next to it is the cup of blood. 

If the crickets have crawled up in my head, then I reckon my heart has crawled right out of my body and into the night sky. The blackness pulsates: inwards, outwards. It's a dark, evil thing. 

“I don’t wanna,” I whisper. 

Cal ignores me. He lights a cigarette, puffs, chokes, stomps it out and draws himself up, big and adult like the cowboys on TV. The cricket legs scuttle faster, I think they are trying to chew their way, little scissor pincors, into the inside of my skull.

“Cal, I’m going to be sick.” 

He ignores me again. 

The ritual begins. 

 “Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector,” Cal says. The sky stretches inwards, outwards; my beating heart. The crickets inside me turn into snakes, and I double over, the pain’s electric.

“Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector,” He says again, louder.

He steps forwards, picks up the blood-cup and pours it over the dead squirrel. Then, he lights the first candle. Then the second. Then, he lights the third, and the fourth, and the flames grow high, too high, almost as tall as me. 

Cal’s eyes are black, hellfire dances within them. 

Snakes in my stomach, in my head. I can’t feel the crickets anymore. What are we going to do if the Devil comes? What if something else does?

“I’m going to pass out,” I whisper. 

Cal shoves the book in front of me. 

“Chant.” 

I do.

“Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector,” we both say. 

The candle flames grow taller, taller with each word until they are now twice our size. The sky’s crashing inwards, everythings falling down. The flames are hot, they’re hurting me -it’s hell on Earth! 

My knees buckle but Cal grabs me by the back of my shirt, holding me upwards as my body crumples.

“Keep going,” He growls. 

“Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector.” 

That squirrel body, I helped kill that thing. I think about the blood from Mr. Darcey’s head. 

“Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector.” 

Spinning, twisting, curling, I feel uneven. “Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector.” 

The flames burst outwards, fire branching out and interlocking until we are forced to step back, a fire wall surrounding the perimeter of the blanket. 

I’m falling down, Cal barley keeping me upright, and as my vision spots into blackness I wonder why, why in this whole process I never told my brother ‘no.’ 

“Lucem-desero-et-naturam-meam-veram-amplector,” I can hear him say one more time. I think his voice is shaking.

The world is black. 

Then it isn’t and I’m on the ground, Cal looking down at me. He looks worried. I think I’ve thrown up. 

I lift my head up weakly, the wall of flames isn’t there anymore. There’s a ghost instead. We lock eyes. 

Then, everything goes black again once more.
