This happened to me when I was about 15 I wanna say I was a sophomore in high school at this point.

One night I was home alone because the rest of my family was off visiting my aunts house for a get together. I was ecstatic to be able to play games and eat whatever I want and sleep as late as possible. 

It was about 1:30 AM and I was on my computer playing video games when I had to urge to go poop. Some context about my house’s main door, it has 2 doors one that’s on the outside that doesn’t lock and the main one that locks. As I was doing my deed in the bathroom I can suddenly hear the outer door being opened and slammed back in. My house isn’t very big so I could hear that from the bathroom as it was only like 15 feet away from the main door. I wasn’t initially startled by this as I thought it might have been my dad coming back early (my aunts house isn’t that far away) but then I realized that while I did hear the sound of the outer door opening I didn’t hear the sounds of keys being used to unlock the door. I found this quite odd since if it was my mom or dad why would they come inside? After a few moments of silence I finish my poop and go to my living room to make sure my door is locked, which it is. I had no idea what that was and didn’t wanna think about it so I just went back to playing online games. 

At around 2:40 AM I went back out into my kitchen to get some food cause I was feeling hungry. As I approached the kitchen I noticed that the temperature in the kitchen was a little colder. Now keep in mind that this took place in the summer so maybe it was just my house’s AC being a little too strong but I didn’t pay much attention to it.

Now here’s the part that freaked me out. For some reason after all this happened I decided to start playing games in my room with my lights off. Everything was fine for the most part but around 3:15 AM I start to get this really odd feeling that something wasn’t right, I didn’t want to take my eyes off my computer screen as I was a little bit scared to look at the rest of my dark room but for some reason 5 minutes after this feeling I look towards my bed and I kid you not for a split second I see a dim white figure sitting on my bed, I blink and it’s gone. After this happened I just sat there frozen. Not sure what I’d seen. It would take me a couple minutes before I collected myself and turned off my computer got into my bed under my blankets as I was too scared to leave my room and I kid you not I waited until 6 am when the sun rose until I fell asleep. 

I wasn’t sure what I’d seen that night but the morning after I kind of forgot about it until like a week after when I was in my room remembering it but instead of being scared I felt at ease when I pictured that white figure in my head. It felt like an old relative had visited me or something.
