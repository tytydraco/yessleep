Homeless people have practically vanished from our neighborhood. Many credited the local government's efficiency, but of course, that wasn't it at all. Anyone who has ever dealt with bureaucrats of any stripe knows that expecting them to do anything useful is like planting a cherry orchard in the Sahara and praying for rain.

My father was the one removing them. Well, not personally; he just brought them to my grandfather’s old house and left them in the basement. My mother finished the rest.

One day, she simply went to sleep and never woke up. We didn't grieve for long. After the funeral, she just showed up at the house and started cooking dinner. My father’s hair turned white that night. And I’ll admit, I started having nightmares. But no—she was still our mom. She remembered nothing after the moment she fell asleep, but we didn't care. We were just happy to have her back.

The next morning, the news reported the brutal murder of a cemetery watchman. His internal organs had been removed; his body torn to shreds. It happened at the very same city cemetery where we had just buried my mother. My father decided to hold off on announcing his dead wife’s return. It was the right call—otherwise, they would have taken her away from us.

A week later, it happened again. This time the victim was a mailman delivering the morning papers. We were the first to know, as my father had been woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of crunching bones. Mom was having dinner.

That’s when we should have turned her in, right? Or destroyed her... But she was our mother. 90% of the time, she was the same sweet woman everyone had known her whole life. But at certain intervals, she required a "special diet." That’s what Dad called it.

We adapted. We started living a more secluded life and moved into my grandfather's old house. Mom never went outside. She took care of us—cooked, cleaned, did the laundry, and comforted us through life's hardships. And we took care of her. Family always comes first; that’s what Dad taught me.

My father figured out the cycles of her "special diet." Every so often, he would bring home various marginalized people—the kind whose disappearance no one would really notice. This went on for a long time. I grew up and moved to another city for university.

Dad stayed with Mom. Friends tried to set him up with other women, but he wasn't interested. His wife, the love of his life, was right there with him. My studies took up all my time; I hardly ever went home. Eventually, I started my own life—a wife, children. I saw my parents less and less.

And then, the phone rang. I had just gotten home from work and was planning to take the kids to the movies, but that call changed everything. It was Mom.

I drove to the old house as fast as I could, pushing 120 mph. Mom met me in the hallway. In all those years, she hadn't aged a day. She looked profoundly sad and guilty.

Dad was dead. She told me he had gone out on one of his usual "runs" to maintain her diet, but something had gone wrong. The homeless man he’d recruited for "seasonal work" stabbed him, took his money, and fled. My father managed to crawl back home, where he died in my mother’s arms.

Mom didn't want to tell me what happened next, but when I went down to the basement, I saw for myself. My father’s mangled body lay in the far corner, covered by a sheet. I didn't blame her. She couldn't help herself, and Dad loved her more than life. I think he would have been happy knowing he could help her even after he was gone.

I went back home and talked to my wife. I didn't tell her the whole truth—only that Mom was alone now and needed help. The kind of help Dad used to provide.

Because in the end, family is the most important thing in life. Isn't that right?
