Tragedy, as we’ve had to come to terms with, is just another facet of life. It’s nothing special, everyday terrible things happen to innocent people, this knowledge is inescapable now in our age of information. You gasp at the headlines, hurt for strangers, donate to the GoFundMe, and maybe even find yourself worrying that you’ll be the next person whose name will feature in an in memoriam or trending hashtag.

you might have, but I didn’t. 

Never in a million years did I think what would happen to my family, and me afterwards, was a possibility in life. I suppose that’s what made me the perfect victim of life’s casual dealings of cruelty, my ignorance to it. An open handed slap in the face that the universe saved especially for me. 

That is what it feels like to be struck by tragedy, like it was always waiting for you, reserved by something more powerful. 

As if it were some cosmic puppeteer that arranged for the murder of my wife and children while they slept in their beds.

Maybe it was.

After what I saw with the tree that grew in my backyard afterwards, I’ll believe in anything.

If you’ve heard of a little town called Archmouth, I’m sure you also know about what happened there two years ago. Or rather, who happened. 

The Rock-a-Bye Man. 

That name still feels insulting. Such a gross effort to mythologize a very sick individual, who if you somehow don’t know already, took the lives of four families in the comforts of their own homes.

He’d break in the dead of night with a screwdriver and hammer, sneak into each room where someone slept, and use those same tools on them. Bluntly. A month-long killing spree.

What people should understand is that Archmouth is just a quaint little slice of classic Americana, nestled in the wooded hills of Central Pennsylvania, it borders right on that edge of complete country solitude. The kind of place where the sweet old people you meet live in the same house they grew up in and everyone shows up for the Friday night high school football games. Frozen in time. A place that only really existed for the people who lived there. I loved it.

I was one of the rare “outsiders” as the locals teasingly called me, having moved there to marry my wife, Elle, who I had met while attending medical school in Philly. She was a friend of a friend, a chance meeting at a party with a girl way out of my league. Her pale, sweet face was complemented by intense sapphire eyes and long black hair. 

She was as beautiful as the moon. 

The most kind, intelligent, and playful person I’ve ever met, and after mustering up the courage to ask for a first date, I knew I was utterly captured by her. To my surprise, we clicked together like a puzzle piece, and after three years of being together I knew that what I had wanted from the start was true, she was the one. I took a crazy gamble and got down on one knee. I thought I was dreaming when she said yes, and right after I graduated, we got married.

Elle was born and raised in Archmouth, and having been lucky enough to love her, I wanted to trace it all back to the source, as if the secret to her loveliness was where she was born and would in turn be passed down to the twin babies in her belly. Cody and Jay, who were fortunately every bit their mother, only inheriting my brown eyes and fear of the dark. 

It was Elle who reassured them there were no monsters under the bed, but me? I could never be so sure.

The home we lived in wasn’t anything special by Armouth standard. One of the many old farmhouses that were revived into homes. We were mostly hidden away in the woods. Modest in all accounts except our backyard, which was pretty huge. Elle and I figured it would be the perfect place for the boys to live in. We were right.

Our six years together made everything else before that seem meaningless. I didn’t come from a happy home and haven’t spoken to my parents in eight years, but that’s a whole different story. I thought love like this only existed in the movies. It was like I found more of my heart with them day by day in all the little responsibilities of being a husband and father. My work as a physician was fine, but it was the time I spent with them that I really felt I nurtured something to health.

Archmouth was blissfully disengaged with the rest of the world until the murders brought their attention. Naturally, nobody had a goddamned clue what to do, the worst thing the Archmouth Police Station had to investigate up to this point was a 17 year old who kept stealing vending machines, so neighboring towns and counties stepped in to help, along with national media coverage that gave the monster his name. 

The atmosphere was of course filled with fear, and overnight the warm little town that I had fallen in love with, my home, became a landmark of human wickedness. I was scared the same as everybody else, but when I took Elle to the firing range to learn how to handle the revolver we then kept under our pillow, or when I taught the boys how to hop on and tackle a man down to the ground and keep him there, in the back of my mind I never thought they’d need to use it. I couldn’t believe that such viciousness would be allowed to reach my beautiful family. 

Then one night, after an extended shift at the hospital, I would come home to see what had been done. An image that will never leave me, but I still today can’t describe without sobbing. 

How foolish I was to still let the boys build their pillow forts in the living room during all this.

It wasn’t any of the police’s efforts that found him, the morning after he destroyed my life, he turned himself in. Elle had got one good shot at the bastard, and he had to crawl out of his hole in the woods to get help or die. I remember feeling nothing when I heard the court declare the young man was insane and needed to be hospitalized in a psychiatric care. 

That angered a lot of people that wanted him to be “served justice” like a proper criminal, but all that mattered to me was that he couldn’t hurt anybody else. 

That man’s real name, which is rarely ever said, was Judah Dismas. Just a mute, anti-social orphan who had gone missing three years earlier from his residential psychiatric youth center, which was states away. He was only 15. Whatever happened to him at that time made him into a monster by 18.

But I’m not interested in who he was or what made him that way. To me he was not some boogeyman to psychoanalyze and listen to true crime podcasts about, he was the man who killed my family.

We were his fourth and final victims, sixteen in total.

Morgan Hill, Georgina Hill, Aubrie Hill, Josh Patel, Daisy Patel, Riley Patel, Jamie Patel, Lewis Fisher, Sophia Fisher, Liam Fisher, Elliot Fisher, Haley Fisher  Elle Moss, Cody Moss, Jay Moss, and me, Toby Moss. 

Remember those names instead.

About three months after The Rock-a-Bye reign of terror ended, I had my first attempt at an honest conversation about all that’s happened with my best buddy Ben during a smoke break, him being another physician at where I worked. I remember he asked me if I would move out of town like the many others who did in the time after the killings, which shrunk our population down from about 3,105 to 2,766. 

I said no. 

I thought about it at first, as I really wasn’t living in my house at that point. I just couldn’t stand being inside there. Even with the new carpets, I could still see the bloodstains. I couldn’t even look at my bed or the living room couch, so for an entire year I slept in my car. And of course, I didn’t want to leave where my family was buried, almost as if they would think I was abandoning them to rot in the ground while I dusted myself off to start somewhere new.

Despite being a baptized Christian, I’m not very spiritual or religious, but I did think of them as “watching over me” as so many of the kind old grandmas who offered their condolences told me. 

I know they meant well, but I think all it did was make me feel worse. Haunted.

What were they thinking? Did they resent me for not being there? To neither protect or die alongside them? And if there is another side, would they let me hold them when we meet again? 

Guilt is an unreasonable beast.

Ben and I also felt the need to talk about what happened to our Mayor Kayla Meadows, how could you not? It almost felt mandatory to talk about what happened to her at least one time with each person in Archmouth. 

Meadows before the killings was a humble and traditional older woman who just felt like one of the locals at heart, but she was constantly working behind the scenes to bring the community themed celebrations and fundraising initiatives. She always had a sweet new story from her childhood to tell us during her speeches that always circled back to the importance of keeping a strong community in Archmouth.

The biggest town event was Archmouth’s Harvest Festival, which was always held the day before Halloween at our town park, Cardinal’s Nest, named after all the red cardinal birds that lived in the tall trees. The harvest was what people loved the most, with hayrides through the woods, pumpkin pie-eating contests, an evening bonfire with a folk band, and completed with a shit ton of beer. It was fun.

I remember Cody and Jay would practically hyperventilate with excitement for the “Little Scarecrow Parade”, where all the kids would dress up in rags stuffed with straw and march through the park. 

Elle even had her own crafts booth where she would sell her pottery, mostly mugs. 

She was quite popular because of that. 

Some people even left them at her grave with flowers planted inside.

Now all I can think about is how Cardinal Nest’s was also where Judah Dismas’ hideout was, where he lived deep in the woods and somehow survived for an entire year before crawling out in the dark to do what he did. 

The festival would often extend to the late hours of the night, and sometimes I wonder if he heard all the loud laughter and drunken square dancing while he ate at deer carcasses and slept under a fallen tree.

Maybe that fueled something.

Meadows was rarely ever seen when Judah Dismas was killing people, only peeking her head out to give statements to the media that those in charge “are doing everything they can”.

That was it.

It felt like we had been abandoned by our leader. She even refused a statement when Judah was put away. Complete silence. 

Except for the day of my family’s funeral, which fell on the day of the Harvest Festival. 

The whole community had shown up at St. Elizabeth’s Church, the same place I had married Elle and would put her to rest with our children. To this day, I have nothing but love for the people of Archmouth, the warmth and support they showed me during this time was enough to move mountains, and I’m eternally grateful, even if I didn’t exactly show it at the time.

But to the surprise and disdain of just about everyone, Mayor Meadows walked in the first Archmouth gathering that wanted nothing to do with her.

I was in a haze during all this. I just wanted to be alone. So when Meadows suddenly asked if she could say a few words at the podium beside those three closed casket coffins, all I could do was nod.

From the echoes of my memory, Meadows went up there and said this: “My friends, let me first start by saying I’m sorry. I hope you know I love you all very dearly, and that my silence during these…” I remember she danced around the words, “...tragedies…is inexcusable, even if it was because I was stricken with such overwhelming fear. I have never in my 68 years gone through such a nightmare. Again…I am sorry.” She was silent for a few moments, just looking down at her hands, then a cough from somebody in the pews snapped her attention back at us. 

“I remember when I was a little girl, my Grandpa Alfie would take me down to Cardinal’s Nest every Friday after school. We’d walk down past the dirt road behind this very church down to where the trees grow thick and tall, and with us we’d bring one jar of honey.” She chuckled, I think. “My grandpa would get all mad at me when I would sneakily scoop a finger inside the jar, because we weren’t there to have a picnic. No. We were making an offering.”

She imitated the stern wag of a finger and seemingly her grandfather’s voice. “This land remembers. It takes count of every single one of us, and when it comes time, those born here will return to its soil.” Meadows then started to imitate someone digging with a shovel, still with that voice. “It’s our job to keep it happy, to show our gratitude for letting us live on its beautiful surface.”

She did that maybe-a-laugh thing again as she broke character, shaking her head. “At first I thought it was silly watching my grandpa bury an entirely good jar of honey, but over the years I think I started to understand. Here in Archmouth, belief in anything is powerful…and it’s our love and trust for one another that this land allowed us…it approved of it.” She spoke the next words through gritted teeth. “And that man was an outsider…a cancer out to destroy and unleash torment on the loved…nothing more.” She placed her hand on Elle’s coffin, still for a moment. “Our roots will remain strong forever.”

After that, Meadows started to weep, and as if pulled by an invisible string, she left the church.

A week later she was found floating down Cardinal Nest’s creek. A suicide. 

Her son took over as mayor soon after. 

They don’t do the Harvest Festival anymore.

Ben and I agreed she was a woman with her own troubles, and left it at that.

It was when Ben started to ask about me that I felt myself shrink a little. I didn’t like to talk about myself after what had happened, and hearing Ben's thinly veiled layer of concern in his voice, I already knew why he felt the need to ask. He first told me that I have every right to still be grieving, but was concerned with my behavior around the hospital, specifically about how I would insist on working longer hours and would even sometimes sleep there. And then there was just my general behavior, the way I laughed too loudly at simple jokes, made strangely casual self-deprecating comments, and to put it so blatantly, “was acting like a guy who didn’t get the worse of it”. 

I remember I ended the topic with a simple “I’m fine, trust me”, that kind of nonreassuring tone that says: I’m not giving you anything, so let’s both drop it. I insisted we talked about football instead, which we did. That’s how I presented myself for a while. I was acting like what happened to me was just a bad deal of cards, which I’m sure made a lot of folks, including Ben, very uncomfortable. 

To cry about it would feel like I was defeated. I still couldn’t tell you what I was trying to prove.

I also couldn’t have told you about what was growing in my backyard. I simply didn’t know how. 

I still don’t really know how.

But maybe it’s at least worth a try.

There’s something wrong with Archmouth. Something incomprehensible. Something alive. And it tried to come for me.

It was the day after the funeral, Halloween, when I first noticed it. Something was sprouting out of the ground in the center of my backyard. I had thought it was a weed at first, but when I got a closer look I realized it couldn’t have been. No, it was a small dark branch poking out through the earth with a little red leaf on top. I ran my finger along it, feeling its thorns and wondering what the hell it was. I tugged at it without making it so much as budge, it was firmly in place. 

I kept yanking at it for a minute before giving up. Whatever. 

Who am I to argue with Mother Nature?  I don’t know jack shit about plants anyway, maybe this was normal. 

It took me a second to realize I had cut my finger on one of the thorns. 

Later I was at the town library, where I was spending most of my free time. The owners were sweet people and seemed to be happy that I found some comfort there, where I was reading stories about happier people. 

Anywhere except my house felt better. 

However, something about that nearly black twig in my backyard kept me thinking about it, and out of curiosity, I tried to look up some more information on the computer. I couldn’t find a single thing. You know when you can just feel it in your gut that something strange is going on? Like there really is a sixth sense for the unnatural?

It’s almost funny, because I remember feeling that way right then and there from just a few simple google searches. 

When I drove home I noticed there wasn’t a trick-or-treater in sight despite how late in the evening it was. I guessed the kids had enough of the scariness for one year. I was relieved, because that meant I could comfortably camp out in my car without worrying about anyone disturbing me. 

So I did what I was usually doing at this point: I pulled up in my parking lot, climbed into the backseats, and closed my eyes. Waiting for tomorrow. 

I know. I should’ve been seeing a therapist who could help me find the strength to walk back into my own home for something else besides a shower, change of clothes, and food, which in itself was its own struggle. “Eventually”, I kept telling myself. But I knew there was no chance I could comfortably rest in that house again.

The next morning, when I was walking in my kitchen with my head to the floor, fixing myself a bowl of cheerios, something caught my eye through the back window. That little branch had another red leaf, and not only that, it had already grown about a solid inch.

The next year of my life was a dull blur, most days being a rough repeat of wake up, go to work, drive home, sleep in the car. But now every once in a while I would look in my backyard to see that this branch was growing…and growing…and growing…and before I knew it I was staring at a small tree, about six feet tall with thorny black wood and red leaves, its skinny branches stretching up as if reaching for the sun. 

Enough time had passed for that sense of unease to fade, in fact, I thought it was kind of pretty now. Besides, it was just a tree. Maybe it was the meds that lowered my suspicions.

I had started some medication that Ben had convinced me to try, just some anti-anxiety that kept certain suffocating feelings at bay. The meds helped me think clearly about what needed to be done. What I needed to do to stop myself from floating in a cloud of misery and try to heal. It was Ben who also convinced me to finally move, that Elle and the boys would understand why I had to leave the home we built together, and that it was time to “get out of the damn car, Toby”

I agreed. 

After finally accepting paid leave from work, it was time to make a change. I found an apartment up for lease on the opposite side of town and was moving in just a few days later. Nothing special, just a single bedroom.

I didn’t take anything with me. Not even the small things. Not Elle’s favorite mug. Or Cody’s nightlight. Or Jay’s shoes, still lined up by the door. Some things felt they should stay.

I know I could’ve moved farther, but like I said before, I wasn’t going to leave my family completely. They were still here in Archmouth, one way or another. And I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to this community after all we’ve been through together.

I should’ve left then, because it wasn’t long before the nightmares began.

I couldn’t quite remember them at first, some nights I would wake up with a gasp, like the air was knocked out of me. I couldn’t fall back asleep either. I had this awful feeling in my chest, like something was sitting on me. At first I thought I was developing sleep apnea. I had developed a smoking habit after all, but after getting a check up I was told there were no signs. 

Weird. 

Then Judah Dismas died, and it got worse.

There was nothing dramatic about how I found out. It was about seven in the morning at Frankie’s, my favorite spot for breakfast, where I was sipping my coffee and munching on a BLT, then I saw the headline on my phone. 

“The Rock-a-Bye Man, Pennsylvania’s most notorious serial killer, found killed in psychiatric care.” 

I remember how tightly I gripped my mug as I silently read what had happened, apparently Judah had been acting out at the psychiatric hospital. He was attacking other patients, some nurses too, even bit someone’s lower lip clean off. Judah being thrown in a holding cell for the night wasn’t an uncommon occurrence, but one day when a nurse was delivering his food, they found him lying flat on his stomach with a single stab to the neck from a scalpel. 

The hospital tried to keep this incident under wraps for a few days, not wanting the attention of a murder during their care, but a whistleblower leaked the details before they could properly dispose of the body.

I didn’t know how to feel, I certainly wasn’t sad for Judah, but happy? No, not that either. Judah was only eighteen when it was determined the rest of his life would be surrounded in padded rooms and in straight jackets. Everyone knew there was no chance of reformation. There is no getting better for some people. 

Maybe whoever did it was doing him a service.

That night was when I was starting to remember my dreams. 

I dreamt that I was at home. 

Our home. 

It was Sunday morning and Elle and I were in the kitchen, doing our parts in making breakfast. Sunday was always when we would go all in on the most important meal of the day, with pancakes, muffins, waffles, bacon and eggs, the whole works. We were speaking to one another as we swapped places between the stove and toaster, but none of the words were coming out right, a natural conversation was playing out through muffled noises. I murmured something smug and she laughed, the only clear sound that came out. 

As I was starting to set the table, I looked out the back window to search for the boys, who always played before it was time to stuff their faces. 

They were out there. 

And so was the tree. 

It stood there fully grown, its red leaves swaying in slow dance. Cody and Jay were chasing each other under its shadow, a game of tag between two people. 

Dream-me felt warm inside. 

The tree felt like it belonged there. 

Then behind me I heard the ring of the doorbell. I turned back just in time to see the front door open by itself. Mayor Meadows stood there, dripping wet in the same nightgown they found her in, her skin sagged like it was stapled to skinny bones, a pair of dead fish eyes stared directly into mine. 

I woke up with a scream.

The dreams that followed had that similar pattern. It would always be at home with me and my family doing one of our little traditions, our Friday pizza and movie nights, sledding when it first snowed every year, pumpkin carving in the fall, sweet things like that. 

Then there she would be. 

Either peering through a window, in the middle of the hallway, or outside standing next to the tree, Mayor Meadows would always make her appearance, always looking a bit more dead. 

The worst one had to be while I was having dinner with my dream family. Cody had dropped his fork, and when I leaned down to grab it for him, I was treated to the sight of Meadows crouched under the dining table. 

It started to feel like an accident when I saw her, like she was trying to hide. 

After the first few nights, I was getting less scared and more annoyed. It felt like I had been doing so well. Why was my brain finding a new way to torture me? No amount of stress exercises or sleep aid playlists were keeping the dreams at bay, so one night, I decided I simply wasn’t going to sleep. 

I was tired of it. 

I thought maybe all I needed was a good time with some friends to calm down whatever was happening in my subconscious, so I called up Ben and some other people from the hospital and we made a night of it. It was about 3AM when I drunkenly stumbled back into my apartment. Despite my efforts to convince them to come over, they refused. After all, most of them still had families. 

Soon I was sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn watching Napoleon Dynamite. The perfect movie to watch under some kind of substance. It was right around that scene where Uncle Rico hurls a steak at Napoleon where I started to feel my eyelids get heavy. 

Sleep took me forcefully, but not for too long, because the sound of twigs soon woke me up. 

I had never experienced sleep paralysis before, but as I stared up at the ceiling unable to move my head or the rest of my body, I had quickly realized what was happening. The only thing I could hear was the crunching of wood. 

It sounded like it was below me. 

It was getting louder. 

Approaching. 

I knew that if I started freaking out it would only make things worse, so I closed my eyes and started to count down from 30. I did that until the noises stopped. I thought it was safe enough to open my eyes again. I was wrong. 

What I saw above me was black roots stretched across the ceiling, red leaves scattered across each one. They were moving together like an entanglement of limbs, slowly taking shape into something. 

All I could do was stare when they finally formed into a rough imitation of Meadows, her wooden body glued to the ceiling above me. 

Nothing in those hollow sockets.

Her mouth of black tree bark split open into a gaping maw. I tried to scream when a thick black ooze came pouring out from her. It casted across my face like a mask, blinding me in pitch black. 

I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

Then with what almost sounded like the snap of a finger, I was somewhere else. I stood in the middle of St. Elizabeth’s Church, where in front of me three coffins were laid. Their caskets open. 

Elle and the boys didn’t look dead the way I had found them, they didn’t have their heads bludgeoned in by the back of a hammer and their bodies weren’t defiled by the sharp edge of a screwdriver. 

They looked peaceful. 

Like they had gone to sleep. 

Then I realized their lips were moving. 

All three of them whispered, “Grow with us. Grow with us. Grow with us.” as thorny veins crept up their necks.

I don’t remember waking up, but when I came to, I was slamming my head against the floor. 

I didn’t sleep again after that. 

How easy it was for the already fragile pillars of my mind to come crumbling down.

The longest the human body can go without sleep is typically about three to four days, I had gone for eight.

That week was spent huddled in my apartment. No eating, no showering, no shaving. I ignored every call, every knock. I was a thunderstorm of bad feelings. My thoughts were being tossed between sadness, numbness, fear, and a rage so intense it made me want to take it out on the next person I saw. 

Maybe I could kill two birds with one stone by suicide-through-cop. 

But on the eighth day, all came to reason. I finally “understood” what was happening. 

Something else was at play here.

I was staring at my reflection in the bathroom, trying to recognize myself through bloodshot eyes and a wiry beard, when I heard a rattling sound coming from the kitchen. I had been hearing things already, a knocking, someone whispering, and the only way to make those noises stop was to go check where they were coming from, where I would always find nothing. 

That’s what I figured the rattling was, another trick my rotting psyche was playing on me, but when I walked into the kitchen I saw something waiting for me. 

Growing out from the kitchen sink drain was a thick root. 

That same black wood and red leaves sprouting from it, except this time I knew I wasn’t dreaming. It was reaching out to me like it knew exactly which corner I would turn from. It looked like a gnarled hand, with its long wooden fingers curled up, holding something. 

I felt lightheaded when I saw that it was Elle’s favorite mug. The one I had left behind.

I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. I had been telling myself that the tree was just a symbol of my misery, only being present in my dreams because it was the first new thing that came into my life after it had been destroyed. Now I could only wish for it to be that simple. 

It was here. 

It had found me. 

It wanted me to come home. 

When I took a step closer, the thorny hand let go of the mug, letting it smash to the ground, then it just as quickly slithered down the drain.

I bought myself an axe.

While I was driving back home that night, I still wasn’t sure what to think. Hell, what was I even expecting? A fight with a monster? The tree, whether an imitation or not, was only wood just the same. But now I knew that whatever pulled the strings was alive, and existed beyond my backyard. 

The way it used Elle’s mug to beckon me back home would have only been done by something conscious.

It knew my pain and was actively using it against me.

If whatever it was really is alive, and if it really knew how to manipulate my emotions, maybe I could show that I wasn’t going to stand for it any longer. 

I was going to cut down what I knew was real. 

I was done being a victim.

The house was still as vacant as the day I left it. I’d hauled most of it to the dump. Everything in my apartment had been new and untouched by memory. I remember even telling the real estate agent the property might as well be destroyed. Who would want to live here, knowing what happened? They got back to me weeks later and told me (a little too excitedly) that they had a promising visitor, who turned out to be a YouTuber making a documentary on the oh so infamous Archmouth. Of course they were.

I was clutching my axe like a piece of wood floating at sea when I stepped through the front door. I didn’t think it at the time, but I wonder how close I resembled Judah when he breached my home. I wonder if he felt my sense of dread. That instinct in our minds that tells us that we don’t belong there.

As I slowly stepped into the kitchen, I was hit by red. From outside the back window, a glowing, nearly blinding red light was pouring inside. I rubbed my eyes as I stepped closer to the window, squinting to get a better look. 

It was the tree, except now it was taller. Much taller. 

The last time I had seen it in person it was eye-level, but now it was the size of the house. It was still so very skinny, like a good push would be enough to knock it all down. Its leaves were the source of this red light, each one glowing like a neon bulb swaying gently in the night breeze. 

It was beautiful. It was terrible. I stole my breath and stepped outside.

I approached it slowly like a tamer in a lion’s cage. There was no turning back now. I knew what had to be done. When I stood under its red glow, I could hear the sound of buzzing coming from inside its trunk. Like it was filled with bees.

My skin crawled.

No more time to waste.

I pulled my axe back and swung the hardest I ever had in my life.

The moment the blade hit the bark, everything went black.

Darkness.

For a moment, I thought I was dead, but then I heard the sound of my own heart beating out of my chest. I reached out before I could think, my hands clumsily searching the dark to feel around for anything. Then my hand brushed against a thorn, then some wood, and then something sticky. I was boxed in at all sides. I tried to stand up, but wherever I was, I couldn’t fully extend my legs. I was trapped. Bent. Stuck in a crouch. 

Cocooned. 

I started to panic and cried out for help, flailing around like an animal caught in a trap. No use. The wood swallowed my voice entirely. Then I felt the rubber grip of my axe.

Thank fuck.

I instantly lifted it up and started to hack around aimlessly, chipping at the thorny wood bit by bit until a sliver of dull red light started to pour in. Then another. And another. 

I screamed as I swung the axe around until an opening finally gave way, spilling out of a wooden shell face-first into the dust.

When I looked up, I yet again thought I had died.

This was Hell. It had to have been.

An endless forest of dark skeletal trees sprawled around me, their branches like claws as they reached up to a voided sky. Thousands of red leaves glowed on them, fluttering upwards like gravity in reverse. They swayed without wind, creaking as they grinded together in an almost sensual rhythm. They were dancing with one another.

I laid on a single dirt path, the only piece of ground that wasn’t covered in sharp thorns. It stretched outward, winding further into the staggering trees. Something scuttled and ducked through the woods.

I stumbled onto my feet and walked forward. My axe was my lifeline. It was all I could do.

The air was hot. Thick. I could barely breathe the more I ventured into the ceaseless path. It reeked of something rotten, the smell was suffocating me. In my dizziness, I barely noticed when I stepped on a bloodstained pillow.

The remains of a pillow fort rested on a branch above me. Blood dripped down.

I kept walking.

The trees kept offering.

My medical degree. Elle’s wedding dress. A family photo.

When I closed my eyes to power through, I started to hear the whispering. Multiple voices.

“You weren’t there.” “You should have died.” “Daddy? I’m scared.” “Grow with us.”

In the split second I opened my eyes I saw one of the whisperers before it dodged behind a tree.

It looked like a scarecrow.

I heard it before I saw it. Something wet squelched in the distance in a pulsating flow. I was nearing its red glow at the end of the trail where nothing except a wall of thorns remained. A decayed mass of flesh stuck out, the thorns wrapped around it like barbed wire as it throbbed hideously.

I lifted up my axe, but before I could bring it down, I froze. I watched as it began to take shape.

Just like how it had been with Meadows, the body formed was a poor mimicry of wood. But it was unmistakable.

I recognized those gaunt and tall limbs, now made of rotted wood.

I recognized that gangly black matted hair, now made of thorns.

I recognized that sunken face, now carved. It had stared back at me in court.

The Rock-a-Bye Man.

He lifted his right arm, his wooden hand a morph between fingers and a hammer.

“Outsider”

We lurched forward at the same time. Me screaming. Him dead silent. I brought my axe down over and over in attempts at a desperate strike, but he was too fast. He dodged and moved in jerky, unnatural spasms. He was toying with me, letting me tire myself out before he swung and struck with a screwdriver for a hand, stabbing into my thigh. The wood that pierced into my flesh was freezing cold. I didn’t have the time to cry in pain, he had already brought his hammer hand around to slam across my chest. I fell back onto a bed of thorns, digging through my shirt and into my skin. I stared up at the starless black sky as I listened to the dull footsteps of my fate approach. My axe was trapped beside me, entangled in the veins.

There would be no one to find me.

He hovered over me with that expressionless wooden face that almost rivaled the one of flesh I knew well. Then he brought his hammer down on my ribs. Again and again and again and again.

Is this how they had felt? Was it just as slow and painful? Were they as quiet as I was? I thought it was meant to stop hurting at some point. Did it stop hurting for them? Was it the recoil that knocked the gun out of Elle’s hand? I thought we had worked on that. Did my babies cry out for me when the monster under the bed finally came out? I told them I’d keep them safe forever. Would I have made a difference that night? Could I have stopped him? Would I have died too?

Was I already dead?

I screamed with the last of my breath as I stretched my hand through the thorns to grab my axe, bringing it up in time to block the hammer about to slam into my face, and pushed the monster off with my foot. The blade of the axe dragged across his arm, splintering it, black liquid seeping out.

Something howled in pain. Not him. Something further into the woods. I didn’t care. I kept swinging.

He struggled to keep up, I was charged with an adrenaline that could lift boulders.

I was alive, and he was not.

Finally, I cleanly hacked into his wooden ribs, the tar pouring out. He faltered with the axe blade snug inside his side, but still tried to fight, his arms swinging in motion with the trees around us that writhed wildly. The world was screaming in pain. The whispers came back.

“Let go.” “Come back.” “Lie down.”

But I didn’t.

Eventually enough of its black blood had drained out, and it fell to its knees. I cried as I brought my axe down across its neck while it remained knelt, like a warrior accepting its execution, taking its head clean off.

I kept hacking at the wooden corpse. Weeping. The trees stilled. The leaves dimmed. I collapsed.

I saw something beautiful that I can’t remember, and fell asleep.

I woke up to the sound of Ben crying. He was screaming my name under flashing red and blue lights. The sun was rising, and as the paramedics hoisted me up on a gurney, I realized where I was.

Cardinal’s Nest.

I could only hear the sound of the flowing creek.

There had been a wellness check at my apartment. When they didn’t find me, they were concerned. When they found my car parked outside my old home, they became terrified. A search party soon followed, and they soon found me lying right under the tallest and steepest hill in the park, where if one would fall from they’d be lucky to survive.

That’s where they thought my injuries came from.

And I admit, I also let them think it was a suicide attempt

How could I explain what had happened?

I was placed in psychiatric care, where for the first time in forever, I slept comfortably.

That was five months ago.

Today is June 8th, 2025, it is 6:20 AM, and I am now living far away from Archmouth, Pennsylvania.

It’s been fun settling back into the hustle and bustle of city life. Los Angeles is unlike any other place I’ve been before. Kind of a shithole, sure, but it's got sunshine and a weird sort of character. My place is small, but cozy. In a couple days, I get my California state medical license.

It took a lot to convince my therapists and friends that I was ready to leave. But eventually, they saw it. I was the Toby they remembered.

By the time I moved out, I was already halfway out the door at work. They just didn’t know how to say it. I don’t think they ever would. They were too good.

If anyone from Archmouth is reading this. I love you.

Please leave.

And you, an outsider like me, thank you.

Don’t go to Archmouth.

It is your choice to believe me, but I know what I saw.

There’s evil there as real as the trees and dirt below.

Before I left Archmouth, I did go back to that house. I had to see it for myself that I had cut down the tree. I didn’t. Instead what I saw was a hole surrounded by a patch of dead grass. I peered down into its abyss.

Down the drain it had gone again.

I was scared, not of whatever it was that lurked here, but of what would happen next. What would happen to me? Was it really as simple as to keep going? Was I running or being chased to the next chapter? These were my consuming thoughts. A repetition of anxieties at least once a day. I was having those same feelings while walking away from the house for that final time.

A chorus of singing birds was what stopped me in my tracks.

I looked behind me, and atop the house’s roof, three red cardinals sat perched. Chirping away.

I stood for a minute, taking in nature’s beautiful song, and then watched as they each took flight with a low dive off the house, sweeping back into the air in time with each other in a way only they could communicate, before disappearing into the trees.

I still hurt. But I am alive. That is all that could possibly matter.

I climbed back into my car, started the engine, and took the road leading to tomorrow.

I laughed between a choked sob.

And let myself cry.
