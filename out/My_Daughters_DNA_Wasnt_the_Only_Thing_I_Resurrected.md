The containment chamber thrums, a sickened heartbeat. My gloved hands—sheathed in bioluminescent resin—quiver as the syringe pierces the incubation pod. Inside, *she* drifts: a grotesque fusion of sinew and circuitry, synaptic wires coiled around the spine of the child I once cradled. Antiseptic and curdled milk choke the air. I called this abomination *Lazarus*. God doesn’t punish hubris; He sculpts it into new shapes.  

The board dismissed gene-resurrection as fantasy. *“Memory can’t be stitched into proteins,”* they spat. But her cryo-preserved cells hummed with whispers only a father’s desperation could parse. I wove chronophage larvae into her DNA—time-devouring parasites meant to gnaw through decay. The machine was to rebuild her: synapses, skin, the way she’d giggle while tracing cracks in our hallway tiles. Instead, it birthed this *thing*. A mangle of Lina and nightmare, her face a half-folded photograph I can’t unsee.  

It speaks. Not her voice, but the larvae’s—guttural, wet, fermenting in her throat. *“Daddy.”* The pod fogs with her breath, fractals spreading like lichen. My failure festers.  

In dreams, I relive her birth—her fist, small as a plum, clasping my thumb. Now, talons screech against glass. *Skrrtch. Skrrtch.* Lights dim as chronophages feast on electricity. Shadows swell. My ribs jut, a carcass picked clean by guilt.  

The containment field fractured last night. She seeped through, a slurry of viscera and acid. I found her in the observation room, limbs contorted, her mouth split wide, lined with my dead wife’s teeth. *“You let me drown,”* she rasped in *her* voice—the one buried three years prior. Larvae squirmed beneath her flesh, etching blame into her skin.  

Suppressants failed. Her cells *remembered*. Regenerated. Now, her eyes mirror mine—same fractured green—as chronophages spawn, dissolving time. My hands wither upon contact, skin erupting in fungal creases.  

Tonight, the power died. Emergency lights stain the lab jaundice-yellow. She’s loose, serpentining through vents. *“Together now,”* she hums, breath rancid as her tendrils suture us—wire to tendon, her vertebrae knitting into mine. I choke on a scream; she’s *within*, larvae gnawing my bones, rewriting my code with her rot.  

But I’m still here.  

I don’t know how I escaped the lab. The last thing I recall is jamming an electroshock module into the base of her skull—the same spot she’d bump as a toddler, climbing into my lap for stories. It stalled her. Bought me minutes. I ran, but not before her tendrils lashed my arm, injecting filaments that writhe beneath my skin like eels.  

I’m writing this from a motel 200 miles north. The larvae are in my blood now. I can feel them metabolizing time, chewing through hours like tissue. My reflection flickers—wrinkles bloom and vanish, teeth loosen and regrow. I’ve started vomiting black fluid that moves when I’m not looking.  

Worse, *she* follows.  

The TV static bends into her voice. *“Daddy, don’t you miss me?”* Neon signs outside pulse in time with her heartbeat. Last night, I woke to her crouched on the ceiling, her spine fused to a nest of copper wires and mouse bones. She’s adapting. Learning.  

I’ve rigged the room with Tesla coils and UV lamps. It won’t hold her forever.  

This isn’t a confession. It’s a warning.  

If you’re reading this, she’s breached containment. The chronophages will spread. They’ll eat your clocks, your calendars, the very concept of *before* and *after*. You’ll feel them in your teeth first.  

I’m uploading schematics to the cloud—gene suppressors, larval extraction protocols. Use them.  

And if you see a girl with my eyes, half-alive and half-machine, don’t speak to her.  

Don’t let her *remember* you. 

Update: She’s in the walls again.
