I work the night shift at a roadside motel off a forgotten highway. Twelve hours of flickering lights, stale coffee, and guests who don’t want to be remembered.

It’s quiet most nights. Too quiet. And for a while, I liked that. But a few weeks ago, something changed. At exactly 2:00 a.m., the front desk phone rang. Room 209. Which would be normal—if that room wasn’t empty. Had been for days. I answered anyway. Static. Then a voice—faint and wet-sounding—whispered: “Can you see me?”
I hung up. Checked the system. No check-ins. Keys to 209 were still in the drawer. 

I went up anyway. Door locked. Lights off. But when I pressed my ear to it, I heard breathing. Slow. Heavy. Wet. I didn’t open the door.Next night? Same thing. 2:03 a.m. Call from 209.

This time it was whispering. Overlapping voices. Some deep. Some high. One of them was crying. Maintenance changed the lock. Reset the keycard system.Didn’t matter. 2:01 a.m. The phone rang again. “Why won’t you come look?” A child’s voice this time.

I called the cops. They searched the room. Found nothing. Except the smell. One of the officers gagged. Said it was like something had died in the walls. Pest control blamed raccoons. They didn’t check the crawlspace.

A woman checked in later that week. Middle-aged, polite. Passing through. I gave her Room 211—just down the hall from 209. At 3:17 a.m., I saw her on the lobby camera.

Barefoot. Pale. Moving like she was asleep. She walked past the front desk without looking at me. I called out. “Ma’am? Are you okay?” No answer. She turned the corner down the hallway. I followed. She was gone. Hallway camera showed nothing. Like she just vanished. Her car stayed in the lot. Her purse was still in the room. I never saw her again.

The manager told me to keep it quiet. “People disappear here all the time,” he joked. But he didn’t smile. I started keeping the lobby lights off at night. Just the desk lamp. Less glare. I don’t like reflections anymore. Because last Tuesday, the Room 209 camera clicked on.No guest was booked there.

The door was cracked open. The light was on. And someone—something—was standing inside. Facing the wall. Not moving. Arms too long. Too still. I zoomed in. The feed glitched. Then cut out.

When it came back, the figure was closer. Still facing the wall. I locked the front door. I asked Rosa, our morning cleaner, if she ever cleaned 209. She looked at me weird. “That room’s sealed,” she said. “Has been since the fire.” “What fire?”

“Before your time,” she said. “Back when this place was still called The Pine Hill Inn.”
She told me a man lit his family on fire in that room—his wife and daughter. No warning. No motive. 

They say the flames lasted longer than they should’ve. Longer than physics should allow.
The motel didn’t renovate. Just painted over the walls and changed the numbers. Now it’s “Room 209.” But no one’s supposed to stay there. No one.

Last night, I woke up at the desk. Head down. Didn’t remember falling asleep. The security monitor was static. Then it cleared. Room 209. Door wide open.

A little girl stood in the doorway. Hair burnt. Skin blackened. But her face—her face was perfect. Untouched. And she was smiling. I reached for the walkie, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

The screen went black. Now I unplug the phone in 209 every night. Doesn’t matter. It still rings.Always at 2:09 a.m. 

Sometimes I answer. All I hear is breathing. And sometimes something else—wet mouth sounds, like lips moving without sound.

Last night, it whispered: “Check the crawlspace.” I haven’t. Not yet. But today, there’s a new smell in the office. Like smoke. And burnt hair.
