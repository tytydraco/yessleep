7 pm, I had just left my countryside home in Wimberley Texas when my phone began to buzz.

Hello? I answered slightly annoyed, hey Mark it's Jullie from work. Yes, I know who you are Jullie what is it, I said sounding more annoyed than when I picked up the phone. Well, I was calling to remind you that when you get to North Carolina I need you to pick up my brother from the airport his flight changed, and I did not want you sitting there at an airport for hours.

Ok well that's fine and all Jullie but when dose your brother get in now?

Well, he won't be getting there until 1 am. Angry I slammed my phone into the center console. 1 AM Jullie are you kidding me I yelled into the phone. What happened to 11 pm tomorrow, I know I'm sorry he had missed his deadline and had to switch flights. Ok Jullie tell Austin I will see him tomorrow morning 1 am sharp.

Ok goodnight, Mark be safe, uh huh I replied ending the call in a huff. God this girl I tell you she will be the death of me I just know it.

I was only 6 hours into my 19 hour+ drive when my gas light came on. Luckily for me however there was a gas station sign indicating there was a station 2 miles up the road. I sighed heavily and pulled off the highway onto a dimly lit exit ramp that seemed to go on forever. Luckily just as I ran out of gas and the car was sputtering, I seen the lights of the mobile station. I was the only car in the lot apart from one other, so this meant fast service I thought to myself.

I walked into the station "ding dong" the bell rang as I pushed open the front door to the poorly lit Mobil station. The cashier acne riddled kid who looked to be no older than 20 looked up from his magazine and spoke with a raspy tone can I help you? Yeah 50 on 2 regular, okay? the kid looked at me with an annoyed look in his eye, is that all he muttered out. Yep, just the gas and some directions for the fastest way to get back on the interstate. He looked up at me and smiled a smile that I will never forget, his teeth were stained yellow and were cracked from years of not taking care of them.

Yeah, I can give you some directions where you trying to go partner? well, I have to get to North Carolina before tomorrow I said frowning. North Carolina you say? I know a way, but you won't want to take it.

And why is that? well, people on that stretch see a lot of weird things. Oh yeah like what? I said looking quite amused, they say there's something out there many people don't use that stretch anymore. Look kid I don't- I was cut off by the sound of the door being pushed open. Everything ok in here? yeah everything's fine sheriff.

Is old Scott telling you about highway 11 and how scary it is. I looked at the sheriff I'm just trying to find the fastest way to get me down to North Carolina. Ok well truth be told there's nothing wrong with that highway and it can defiantly get you their it cuts right through North Carolina.

What you want to do is head out here onto the main road take it for about 4 miles and when you see a sign for Carson Ave and Union Street turn right onto Carson. Take it for an additional mile and it will connect you onto highway 11.

I thanked the sheriff paid for my gas and was on my way. Before I knew it Carson Ave came up quick and I soon found myself on a long dark stretch of road. I was 13 miles into this highway when I saw a lady in the middle of the road.

I slammed on my breaks violently swapping lanes before coming to a stop in the middle of the highway. I looked up to say something along the lines of are you fucking kidding me, when I realized she was gone. Flashing red and blues filled my car as I put it back in drive and I was forced to pull it back over to the side of the road.

A mid 20's to late 30's African American male walked up to my window. What the hell were you doing he yelled violently at me. Deputy Cole with the Bridge water Sheriff's office highway division license and registration do you know why I stopped you? I saw you back there cross lanes with no directional and in a violent manor what are you trying to do cause an accident.  And are you blind did you not see the lady in white run in front of my car as I was going 65!!!?

And deputy isn't bridge water 13 to 15 miles back that way? I asked getting my license and registration out of my glove box. I looked back at him to hand him my info and screamed in horror as seen he now had no eyes and was now halfway through my driver side window.

I squeezed my eyes shut only to re-open them and see nobody was there the cop and the car he was driving was just gone. I took a second to collect myself before saying out loud what the fuck is going on around here. It was a good 20 minutes before I turned my car back on and drove back onto the dark highway.

I drove without incident for another 7 to 8 miles when I realized as if this night wasn't bad enough already, I been passing the same exit sign for about 3 miles now. Exit 3-A shit I thought to myself no way that could be the same exit there's just no way. I drove another mile and again Exit 3-A 1 mile what the hell I said to myself.

At this point I'm truly terrified feeling my blood pressure rise and the car temperature get hotter as I passed the sign again. And then I had an idea without thinking I crossed the medium into the opposite lane. Surely, I can't pass the sign on the other side of where it's meant to be right? I asked myself.

I was wrong there on my right like clockwork upcoming exit 3-A. Panic set in by now and I could only imagine how much more awaited me on this old highway.

And just then as if I was in a cliche horror movie my car stops abruptly sputtering losing power and then dyeing right in the middle of the highway. Oh, great now what I thought to myself, there on the other side of the fog came a sign a new sign that read North Carolina exit 1-D 2-A 4-C.

Oh, great I thought to myself how am I going to get there with a dead car. Lights filled my car as I said this, oh shit not another weird ass event no please no more. "Tap Tap Tap" is what I heard on my window as my face rested in my hands.

Hey do you need some help I looked up to see a tow truck driver standing at my car. OMG yes please I muttered out. Within minutes my car started with a nice hum and the car was working again. I thanked the man and pulled back on to the highway where I realized that whole time, I was stuck in that hell loop 3 days had passed.

I made it to North Carolina soon after and when I reached the closest town, I was never more happy to hear the "ding ding ding ding" of my phone 300 messages 50 miss calls. It was all from Jullie where are you? hello? did you die? Thanks for never showing, etc.

I eventually explained everything to her and made it back home we are on better terms today and as for when it was time to go back home well let's just say I took a different way.

When I got back home, I did some research on what happened to me and a search on the deputy I saw that night as well as anything else I saw. The search led me to an article published June 8th, 1994, by bridge water daily chronical it stated, "Bridge water deputy Simon Cole a 20 year veteran of the department was shot and killed late last night on highway 11 at mile marker 3-A. Other deputies arrived on scene to only describe the scene as unexplainable and purely disturbing. Deputy Cole had both his eyes removed by a knife Sheriff waters said and the hunt is still on for the suspect."

A chill went down my spine when I read this. I could not believe what I was reading that deputy died 25 years ago how did I see him that night. I continued to scan the article and noticed a sub article listed at the bottom of this one. "Bridge Water sheriff's office responds to old highway 11 for a suspect in the homicide case of deputy Cole being hit by a car on mile marker 3-A."

It all made since now what I seen that night was nothing more than my mind playing tricks had to be right? "Woman claims ghost of deputy stops her at mile marker 3-A he has no eyes. Yesterday evening Bridge Water sheriff's office investigated a report made at their north precinct of a woman being stopped by someone resembling a sheriff's deputy so far they have no leads."

Knowing I was not the only one was very interesting to me. However, I want no part of what awaits me if I ever go back. So, when you're driving through Bridge Water VA never and I mean never take highway 11.
