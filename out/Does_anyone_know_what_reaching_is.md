When people talk about my sister, they always start the same way. “It’s such a shame,” they say. “She had so much potential.” They think it’s comforting, as if potential is some kind of protection — like the mere suggestion that a person could have done great things keeps their memory safe from what actually happened. I hate that word. I hate it because it sounds like an excuse people make when they don’t want to face the truth that we all waste something. Everyone throws away time, talent, love, purpose — whatever their particular currency is — and the idea that some people “had potential” while others didn’t is a lie we tell ourselves to feel safer. It’s a shield. It lets you look at someone else’s wreckage and pretend you’re immune to it. That word, potential, feels like a kindness but it’s really a quiet form of distance. My sister had potential too.

She wasn’t just bright — she was brilliant in the kind of way that made people uncomfortable. She’d studied physics and metaphysical science, the kind of dual interest that made her both fascinating and impossible to categorize. She said she wanted to understand “the fabric between realities,” which sounded like poetic nonsense when we were kids. 

Later, I realized she meant it literally. She believed consciousness was an instrument — that the mind could perceive and even touch things outside the measurable world. It was her obsession, and, I guess, her undoing. When she died, everyone said it was the heroin. That was easier to understand than whatever she’d actually been chasing.

Cleaning out her apartment felt like trespassing. Everything was still in place, right down to the half-drunk cup of coffee on the counter. I kept thinking she’d walk in and ask what I was doing there. Most of her notebooks were full of formulas and diagrams, notes about wave functions and energy fields that went over my head. 

But one small black diary stood out. 

No formulas. No numbers. Just words — strange, lyrical fragments, and something that looked like rules. The first page said, “Reaching — an experiment in expanded perception.”

At first, I thought it was some sort of guided meditation, maybe something she’d written to help her come down from a high. But the more I read, the less it felt like that. There were instructions that sounded simple enough, but the phrasing bothered me. 

“To begin the First Reach,” one line said, “close your eyes until the dark starts moving. Keep your attention still — it will try to divide.” Another said, “When you feel the hum, don’t flinch. It isn’t outside.” There were references to “layers of contact,” and something called “the Fold,” which she described as the place awareness goes when it stops pretending to be alone.

I didn’t understand it, but I couldn’t stop reading. The entries became increasingly erratic near the end. One said, “Third Reach — something answered. I think I saw what’s after.” Another was just, “Don’t trust the echo.” And then nothing. A week later, she was gone.

I told myself it didn’t mean anything, that it was just more of her mystical rambling. But I couldn’t let it go. I thought about her sitting there, trying this “experiment,” eyes closed, breathing slow, believing she was peeling back the edge of reality. I thought about how much I’d judged her, how easy it was to say she’d wasted her life. Maybe she hadn’t wasted it at all. Maybe she’d found something no one else had the nerve to touch.

Two nights ago, I sat down in my room with the diary open in front of me and decided to try the First Reach. I don’t know what I was hoping for — closure, maybe, or some sign she’d been right. The instructions were simple enough: sit in total darkness, close your eyes, and wait until the dark starts moving. I didn’t know what that meant, but after a while, I started to understand. There’s a point where the black behind your eyelids stops feeling flat. It deepens, like it has weight. I tried to keep my breathing steady. After a few minutes, I felt something like a vibration behind my skull — a faint humming that wasn’t sound but sensation.

The book said not to flinch. So I didn’t.

And then, in the dark, I saw something — not an image, exactly, but a structure. Like distance folding in on itself. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it the way you feel your way through a dark room. 

Something in me reached back. For a split second, it felt like my thoughts had edges, like I could touch the space behind them. And then everything stopped. The hum vanished. My ears rang in its absence.

I turned on the light and just sat there, breathing hard. Nothing else happened that night.
But ever since, I can’t stop noticing that the dark doesn’t look the same anymore.

I used to think darkness was just absence — the default state of a room without light. Now it feels like an active thing, a presence that presses back. When I turn the lights off, I feel watched, but not by eyes. It’s more like the dark itself is aware of me. 

The edges of things seem too sharp. Shadows don’t merge cleanly anymore; they cling to corners like they’re reluctant to let go. The first few nights, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that hum waiting for me, just beneath thought, the same faint vibration I’d felt that night. It doesn’t happen when I’m awake in daylight. It’s only when I let myself drift toward sleep, when the world starts dissolving around the edges, that I sense it again — patient, steady, almost familiar.

I told myself I was imagining it. Grief does strange things to the mind, and I’d been thinking about her too much. But then, last night, I dreamt of her. Not the way I used to dream of people — blurred, symbolic, half-memory — but vivid, solid. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands folded, looking at me like she’d been waiting for me to wake up. 

The room behind her wasn’t hers, though. It was endless. The walls stretched too far, then curved, like the space itself was bending inward. When I asked her where we were, she just said, “You shouldn’t have reached.” Then her voice deepened, splitting like an echo that didn’t follow the sound. I woke up gasping, the word echo still ringing in my head.

The diary was open on my desk this morning. I know I didn’t leave it that way. The page had changed — it was the same handwriting, but there was an extra line beneath her old note about the Third Reach. It said, “The first is observation. The second is correspondence. Don’t confuse them.” I don’t know if I wrote it in some half-conscious state, or if it was always there and I just missed it. But it doesn’t look fresh. The ink’s faded, like it’s been there for years.

I’ve been thinking about what “correspondence” could mean. In her notes, she wrote about consciousness as a mirror — not the way we see things, but the way things see back. Maybe that’s what the Reach does: it opens the channel both ways. You look into it, and it looks into you. Maybe that’s what she meant when she wrote about “the Fold,” about awareness stopping its act of pretending to be alone. Maybe that’s why she didn’t stop after the first or second.

I’m not ready to try again, but I can feel it calling. That’s the only word that fits — calling. It’s not a voice, it’s not even sound, it’s a pull. Like some part of me recognizes the shape of what I touched and wants to finish it. I keep thinking about her final entry: “Third Reach — something answered.” I used to read that as a warning. Lately, it feels more like an invitation.
