In a study published in the *Journal of Forensic Sciences*, it was estimated that former cult members have a suicide rate up to six times higher than that of the general population. Growing up in the slums of New York City, my parents became among the 2.5 to 5 million Americans who have joined a cult, leaving only my mother and me to survive.

**Background**

This cult, known as the School of Polygamy, operates globally through smaller, covert groups. They maintain a website dedicated to their radical polygamous beliefs, complete with a login page for members to connect. Access to the inner circle, the “Patriarchs” and their wives, is achieved through connections with other members.

**Cult practices**

You may be familiar with polygamy, but the depths of this cult's practices are far more disturbing than one might imagine. Their doctrine, over a thousand pages long, mixes common cult behaviors with truly horrific rules:

**The Polygamist Codex**

1.     **Absolute Devotion:** Members are required to show unwavering loyalty to the Patriarchs, prioritizing this devotion above all personal relationships, including those with family outside the community.

614. **Punishment for Non-Compliance:** Violations of the rules result in disciplinary measures as deemed fit by the Patriarchs, including isolation, re-education sessions, and other corrective actions.

Having grown up in this social arena, I want to emphasize the statement: *“other corrective actions.”* Because what the Patriarchs deem worthy corrective punishments are something straight out of a nightmare: beatings, child labor and starvation are on the light side of punishments. On the darker: prostitution, sexual humiliation in front of other members, and violent intimidation methods. There is little to no regard for age or consent, which means that pedophilia and rape are not uncommon—but among the members, it never gets referred to as such.

**Personal account**

The most frightening memory that still keeps me up at night is my parents leaving me alone with a Patriarch after having violated “the rule of secrecy and obedience” when I shared some of my knowledge with a middle school classmate. The Patriarch used scissors on me as a corrective instrument, believing they could *“cut off the bad faith”.* As he proceeded to drag the sharp edge across my naked upper body, he made loud snapping noises before deciding to cut off chunks of my hair. After this incident, I never spoke a word to anyone outside of the cult about our beliefs.

I want to enforce that despite everything, I do believe my parents were good people who were misled. I think they have struggled with naivete and an unhealthy view of independence that this group of people knew to take advantage of. One of the most common preaches is that those who succumb to the radical polygamous beliefs will gain the strongest, most secure form of independence by allowing sexual prowess and the breeding of children to be free, non-judgmental and a “group project”; they must gain ultimate power and control in their life by letting go of societal expectations and setting themselves free to explore sexual and romantic relations as separate lifestyles within a social security net.

**Key Differences Between the School of Polygamy and Traditional Polygamy**

The School of Polygamy differs from normal polygamy in that it operates with extreme control and hierarchy, where the leaders impose abusive practices and manipulate members through fear. Normal polygamy involves consensual agreements between adults, whereas the School of Polygamy exploits and coerces its members, often disregarding consent and using severe punishment to maintain power.

Moreover, many members are often new to the concept and initially unaware of the cult’s true nature when they join. There are grey areas where members adhere to the doctrine but do not engage in the most radical behaviors. From the outside, their practices might resemble traditional polygamy, but within the larger context, they contribute to the cult’s expansion as passive participants.

**The Reality of Exploitation**

The cult’s promises of freedom and independence through polygamous relationships are a facade. In reality, the Patriarchs and their favored wives enjoy unparalleled power and control, while the rest of the members are exploited. As the inner circle, Patriarchs and their wives are viewed as exemplary, meaning these same people travel the world and breed hundreds to thousands of children within other families, spreading their genes widely and essentially, the other families become institutions while the only ones who are completely free are the Patriarchs and their wives. The wives, by the way, are just as involved. Patriarchs are estimated to have between 500 to 2,000 children each, and their wives bear between 6 to 10 children—typically from different fathers. This practice not only poses a biological threat due to inbreeding both within the cult and outside of it but also inflicts severe psychological trauma on the victims.

As I said at the beginning, only my mother has made it out alive. She was eventually selected to become a wife of a Patriarch. My father, devastated by her travelling around to meet with other men, have their children and marry someone else, was given an ultimatum: to accept it as was or leave the cult. He chose to leave with me, but the loss and grief overwhelmed him, leading to his suicide. I was left alone at 17, with no family or friends.

**Call to action**

This happened six years ago. I don’t know for how long the cult has been operating, only that it has lasted my lifetime of 23 years. I am sharing this story now because the world must know about the School of Polygamy. Despite its global reach and the influence of its members, it remains largely under the radar. The members range from vulnerable, average people, to the most powerful ones whose influence is noticeable in the media, although “The School of Polygamy” is never mentioned. They *know* it will cause controversy and possibly legal battles due to their corrective methods and chances of inbreeding. The punishments I’ve described are based on my own experiences and those of others I’ve known. There may be even darker stories out there.

It’s time to speak up and take action against such organizations. The world must be made aware of the exploitation, abuse, and manipulation occurring within the School of Polygamy and similar groups.
