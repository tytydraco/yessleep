“After careful consideration of our current workload, your schedule has been altered for the week. Thank you.”

I stared blankly at the email on the screen.

“— Sent from my iPhone.”

What an asshole.

I sighed and slumped back against the wall, sliding the phone into my pocket. “I hate it when they do this.”

“You’ll get used to it,” said the man next to me—a guy named Steve with a beard and a red hoodie. I shrugged and nodded.

The warehouse was mostly empty, and we all sat around, bored out of our minds. It wasn't like there was a whole lot going on, anyway. The warehouse was a pretty quiet place. Everyone was waiting to go home for the day, but a couple of late packages were holding us up.

“Your turn, man.”

I turned toward the voice. It was Steve, sitting at a table and motioning toward a deck of cards. I leaned forward and peeked over his shoulder. 

I took a step toward the table.

And then, everything went black.

I was disoriented for a moment.

This, I should mention, was not an uncommon occurrence; the maintenance guys rarely did their share of work when it came to the electrical systems. We each let out an annoyed sigh.

“Give it a second,” Steve said.

Sure enough, the backup generators kicked in a moment later and the building lit up once more. We shifted in our seats.

“Alright, go on.”

The lights flickered off again and the generators died down. We all looked around, waiting for something to happen. 

“Damn maintenance again,” an older man named Jerry sighed. “Well, then, guess we have to do their job again.”

“I’ll stay here,” said a man named Mike sitting at the opposite end of the table, “doesn't make too much sense for all four of us to go.”

Jerry nodded and stood up. Steve and I sighed heavily and rose to our feet as well. There really wasn’t anything better to do, we supposed. We took a flashlight from a bag and walked down the aisle, shining it along the boxes on either side.

We reached a metal door at the end of the aisle. Jerry opened it and led the way down the hall, with the rest of us following behind him until we made it to a small door on the left.

“Anyone got the key?” Steve asked.

“One of these ought to do it,” I said. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a large keychain. 

Just then, a loud crash sounded from the warehouse. We all turned simultaneously. It sounded like a box of product had just fallen over.

“Sounded like it came from Mike’s sector. Poor bastard’s gonna be here ‘till twelve cleaning that up,” Steve chuckled.  

I went through about four keys before one finally clicked, and we pushed the metal door open. The space inside was entirely dark. Jerry scanned the space with his flashlight.

We walked inside and approached the generator. I stood back and so did Steve; Jerry had probably fixed a dozen of these by now. We thought it best to let him do his thing.

He seemed to pause for a moment, then tilted his head. “Well… that’s strange.”

Steve and I exchanged a glance, then looked back at the old man.

“Well?” Steve said.

“It’s not broken,” Jerry turned toward us and paused for a moment. We stood in silence. 

“It’s just turned off,” Jerry chuckled, then his chuckle died down. “Who’d switch off the backup power?”

“Huh, weird,” Steve shrugged.

“Yeah, well, it’s nothing,” Jerry said. He turned back to face the generator. “I’ll turn it back on, then we figure it out, yeah?”

Jerry reached for the lever attached to the generator.

“Stop.”

My heart stopped for just one, brief second. We all turned to face the voice. 

“Jesus! Mike, the fuck are you doing?” Jerry jumped back.

Mike was standing in the doorway, illuminated by Jerry’s flashlight. My heart went back to normal as soon as I saw him. He had really managed to scare me.

I imagined the shadow at the doorway—Mike— would start laughing at any moment, and I could already see that Jerry wasn’t going to be happy about it. The old man wasn’t usually one for practical jokes.

“You’re not funny, man; I thought you were staying behind,” Steve crossed his arms, and I chuckled. But Mike didn’t answer. We stood in silence for a moment, the flashlight lighting up Mike's features. He seemed emotionless, almost blank. 

“Real scary, jackass. Can we turn the generator on now?” Jerry wasn’t having it, and turned to the generator.

“Can we keep the lights off?” Mike whispered. It was a hushed, plain whisper. Something about it felt wrong.

Jerry turned around again, and I saw a concerned expression on his face.

“Something wrong, Mike?”

Mike didn’t answer immediately, and his shadow stared back at us.

“Mike?” Jerry asked again.

“Keep it off, please,” Mike said. 

Mike’s voice was a whisper—barely audible—and something seemed entirely wrong about it, but I couldn’t quite place it. 

The situation was slowly starting to feel uneasy. I turned away from Jerry and Mike to look at Steve, who was still behind me. As I suspected, Steve was growing uncomfortable as well. He took a step back, and he slumped against the wall. 

It was almost as if my brain had realized that something didn’t make sense, yet I hadn’t fully become conscious of it. Steve, however, seemed to have the answer.

He tapped on my shoulder and I turned to face him. I could hardly see his face in the dim light, and yet, clearly, there was an uneasy expression on it. 

“Look…” he whispered to me, “his mouth.”

I tilted my head, unsure what he meant. 

Just then, Jerry spoke up. 

“Is there a reason why I can’t turn on the light?”

I turned to face him, but before I did, Steve whispered to me. 

“His mouth, it’s closed.”

“I don't want you to see,” Mike whispered in the doorway.

The blood froze in my veins; that was it—Steve was right; Mike was speaking, yet his mouth hadn’t opened.

“Wait…” I said, maybe too loud. 

Mike slowly turned his head, staring blankly into my eyes. It was a dead, cold gaze, and something about it made the air around us freeze. It was at that moment that I noticed how pale his face was, and how light his body had seemed the entire time. 

He was looking at me, but it didn't feel like it. I felt as if he were looking over my shoulder, or staring through my body. 

And then, without warning, his body went limp and he slumped forward, falling to the floor like a doll. 

“Let me fix it, then—”

His voice continued from behind him.

My face went pale.

The light failed to illuminate beyond the room. The space behind Mike’s body was entirely dark. It was there that the voice had come from—Mike's voice was speaking from beyond the doorway.

“Jerry,” I whispered, “there’s something back there. Turn on the light, now.”

Jerry was frozen, but snapped away and nodded. He lifted his hand and placed it on the generator.

Nothing crossed the threshold. I am sure of it. And yet, Jerry still gasped and the flashing fell to the floor.

“Wait—stop,” he whispered at first, then a panic settled in, and a muffled voice cried out. “Stop!”

“Jerry!” I screamed.

“Please—” a wet, tearing noise stopped him abruptly and a low gurgle replaced his voice. There was a brief moment of silence. Nothing fell to the floor. He was still standing. 

My eyes widened suddenly and I took a few steps back. Steve did the same. 

The flashlight lay on the floor, pointing toward us and barely illuminating the room. Nothing could be seen behind the flashlight. The dark, enclosed nature of the room made it impossible to make anything out.

A soft, repetitive tapping sound could be heard coming from the corner. It started out frequent and fast, but the pause between taps slowly grew longer. Something shifted. 

“Please don't… turn on the lights.” 

A voice sounded from behind the flashlight. 

“Who are you?” I asked, taking another step back.

“Is something wrong?” The voice answered, barely audible.

In what felt like an instant, I felt the room grow unbearably cold. 

The voice—It was Jerry. No, it couldn’t have been Jerry; it sounded like him, but it was too soft. It didn’t make sense. 

We stood in silence with nothing to break the suffocating air that was settling. Whatever was in the corner—Jerry, or what had Jerry’s voice—had almost seemed to disappear. I wondered whether it was even still there, but the gentle tapping repeated itself. 

Something stepped in front of the flashlight. 

It stepped directly in front of the beam and its leg covered the light. I made out the form of a shoe, but everything else was hidden. 

“We can go back,” the same whispering voice—Jerry's voice—returned. “We can still work in the dark, together.”

It took another slow, awkward step forward. The leg seemed numb, weightless, almost like a puppet. It landed its step but the foot failed to stiffen upon landing, and its ankle bent to the side. 

“What do you want?” I asked, my voice trembling. 

“Will you speak to me… If I look like you?” the voice seemed to distort for a second, almost like an old DVD player coming across a scratch in the disk. It sent a shiver across my body. Something about it seemed foreign.

The figure stepped into the light. The features were vague and blurred, but its form was entirely familiar.

It was impossible to mistake Jerry’s appearance. His clothes, the shape of his body… there was no doubt in my mind that it was Jerry. 

I lifted my eyes to meet him in the face, but the second I did, my stomach dropped. I let out a gasp—something in between shock and disgust. I felt like vomiting, but I could only stand and stare in disbelief. 

“Something is wrong?” The voice whispered. 

His mouth didn’t move. No; there was nothing to move at all. 

The blood dripped onto the metal floor, tapping gently against it. It was an awful, repetitive sound that seemed at once muted and magnified—failing to reverberate through the room as if the walls were soundproof, yet it pounded against my skull. The rhythm of the tapping was perfectly stable.

His shirt was saturated and heavy with blood, and a large pool was quickly forming at his feet. There was nothing—absolutely nothing—to even suggest that he was alive. His head slumped down and his arms were limp at his sides. His eyes were obscured; I could feel their lifeless, empty quality. And his mouth—I didn’t see his mouth. 

There was only a deep, thick stream of red running down the space where his mouth should have been; all I could make out was a gaping hole of flesh. The light made the blood look like tar; it was dark and thick, almost black. His nose, his mouth, his chin, all of it was gone; only loose, hanging pieces of torn flesh, and the black splotch of blood, could be seen. 

I tried desperately to distract myself—to look away or think of anything else—but just as I thought I would drift off, and find that I had been dreaming…

Tap. 

With every drop of blood that fell from the wound, I was brought back to reality. I tried to stop the drops—to hold them in the air with my mind—to freeze time so that I wouldn't have to hear another rhythmic, repetitive tap on the metal floor. It was useless. My body had accustomed itself to the rhythm of the drops. Whenever it was time for a drop to hit the metal, I anticipated the sound. 

Tap…

I waited for the next one.

Tap…

I knew another drop would fall soon.

…

I anticipated the sound, but it didn’t come. 

My body was thrown out of the rhythm, and the silence created a void. 

…

“My mouth is open, now.”

Tap.

I had nearly forgotten about the figure in front of me. Now that I was out of my trance, I saw him in the murky, shadowy light. 

I saw more of things which made my stomach feel heavy and sick: white teeth still intact, reflecting what little light there was, spontaneously attached to the flesh itself. There were scratches on his face and neck, too—some superficial, others splitting his flesh and revealing black voids as the light failed to reach the inside of the wounds. I was too shocked to react.

I saw something else unusual. His shirt wrinkled and the cloth accumulated toward his shoulders, and his body seemed light, almost as if he were floating. It seemed as if he was being held up by the shoulders. 

“Please, stop,” Steve spoke from behind me. I had almost forgotten that Steve was still behind me, watching the same scene. I was grateful for his voice; it made me stop thinking about the body for a moment. Still, it was only a moment.  

“Is something wrong, still?” The voice reacted immediately. The sound was hushed, but it was still clear. Its enunciation was perfect. 

“Yes! All of it!” Steve finally broke. “Nobody… nobody can talk without a jaw! Nobody can speak without a throat! Leave us alone! Turn around and stop this!”

The room fell quiet again. It gave me a chance to hear the dripping of the blood onto the floor, slower now. Its cadence was lost, the rhythm now unpredictable. The thing—whatever it was—didn’t answer. 

Tap, tap.

—Tap.

The blood struck the metal floor at random intervals.

Tap-tap.

On cue with the last drop of blood, Jerry’s corpse went limp. He fell to the ground with a thud, face first. Blood splattered on my boots.

“Turn around?” The voice continued.

The voice was still behind him. Of course it was—I already knew that. It had always been behind him. Steve was right; you need a mouth to speak… a throat, too. Lips. A tongue. There are many things that allow humans to speak. I saw none of those things on Jerry's body.

I think we both realized what was supposed to follow, even before it happened. 

Steve screamed. 

Before I could even react, a wet snap sounded from the space behind me. I covered my mouth with my hand, stopping myself from making a sound. 

I fell to my knees, still facing the other direction. I couldn’t bring myself to turn around. Jerry and Mike lay in front of me, and I knew Steve was still standing behind me. I covered my face with my palms.  

I wanted to cover my ears, too; I knew exactly what I would hear next. I didn't want to hear Steve's voice.

“What…” 

My hands moved to my ears, but it was not enough.

“...What is wrong?” Steve's voice sounded from behind me. This time it was different; it sounded as if Steve were speaking through a bad radio. His voice was warped. I wanted to cry.

This couldn’t be happening—none of it made sense. I couldn’t think straight and I wasn’t sure I even wanted to make the effort. To be honest, I just wanted it all to be over. 

“Turn around, he said. But…” The voice distorted as if a radio had lost its signal. I almost expected to hear static. “...you are still afraid.” The voice had no emotion whatsoever. It was completely monotonous—there was no feeling. 

I exhaled slowly, and a tear ran down my cheek. 

“You cry,” it whispered.

A silence followed.

“I am hurting you?”

I couldn't stand it. I was confused. Its question—at least I thought it was a question—was so direct, and yet it spoke so plainly that I couldn't grasp what it had attempted to say.

“Yes… you are,” I finally said.

A moment of silence.

Steve was released. He landed next to me on the metal floor, his body lying on its front. I turned to look at him.

For that exact second, my heart seemed to stop beating. I was too shocked to think. 

Steve's neck was bruised and deformed—broken. Although his stomach faced the floor, his head defied the direction of his body…

Steve's head had rotated enough to face the ceiling. His eyes met mine. 

“I see, then.”

For the first time, I noticed a touch of emotion in the whisper—almost like it suddenly understood, like a child realizing it had done something wrong.

The lights suddenly flickered on. 

I looked around suddenly, but all I could see were the lifeless bodies of my coworkers and the deep pool of blood that had formed where Jerry lay. There was no sign of the voice. 

I turned around. Still, there was nothing. 

To this day I don't know what happened. I can't comprehend what it was or why it had killed my coworkers that day, or why it had suddenly vanished. In truth, I am still entirely confused.
 
All I know is that, if ever you encounter what I just described, do what I did… let it know that it is hurting you. 

Maybe… and it almost makes sense, it couldn't comprehend what it was doing.
