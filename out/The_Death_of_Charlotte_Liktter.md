The events that led to, and happened after, Charlie's death made no headlines. There was no mention of what transpired anywhere, despite the teams of doctors that pooled around her body to attempt to understand and cure what was happening to her in the prolonged agony that was her dying days, and that all those there were witness to. No entries in medical journals, or obituaries. If not for the information  that I am about to share with you, it would simply be an unnoticed footnote, which is something that I cannot accept.



On Monday the 9th, me and Charlie were doing nothing more than walking around, having a stroll, until, for no apparent reason, she collapsed. From one instant to the next she fell to the floor, for what would be the last time that I remember her being conscious, and what would soon prove to be an unexplainable hell constrained within the walls of that hospital.



Within minutes emergency services had been called, and shortly thereafter, the setting of the ordeal, the closest hospital, was my home. It is at this point I should begin to explain the starting stages of Charlotte's condition. She was, to the best of our knowledge, unconscious, though her eyes remained open, and all her other bodily functions, her breathing, heart beat and the like, continued to work without a hitch. No response could be drawn out of her. She simply existed, a body in Charlotte's form, sustaining itself but refusing to interact with the outside world. And while this is the state that she would start in, her symptoms would only grow more bizarre as time went on.



As we, myself and Charlie's close family, were relegated to waiting in the lobby just outside her hospital room, things very quickly began to escalate. The first element to note was the apparent multiplication of doctors filtering in and out of her room, accompanied by a strange opaqueness as to why they were there in such numbers. No one was willing to let us know why this cavalcade had appeared, or what it was they were treating or attempting to treat. Instead the horde of people in lab coats. Instead they would briefly empty the room to let us see how Charlotte was going with no notes on what had happened in between, while all we saw was her staring blankly at the ceiling, immobile save the slight heaving of her chest as drew in breath. As night grew near, with more and more interventions with no clarity on the situation, we were ushered out of the hospital, despite repeatedly asking for clarification on what was going on and was was to happen next.



The next morning we were greeted to the same to the same scene. we were posted outside her room as a team of doctors. And yet again the same, despite our probing, still no information was divulged to us, her relatives and closest friends. Instead all we could do was exchange glances as we waited. I remember Lydia, Charlie's sister, looking at me with this impossible to place look behind her eyes. It was as if she was searching for words but those words were struggling to emerge, not because she didn't know them, but because they didn't exist. Meanwhile I was growing more and anxious. There was something rather off putting by the lack of communication, and the almost blas√© attitude that the staff had despite the carnival of doctors entering and exiting without a single word being uttered to us. Even amongst themselves, the instant those doors opened or closed, no words were spoken, or glances exchanged, other than the banalities of the day to day. As if they were bored office workers whose biggest concern whether or not the coffee machine needed to be refilled.



Eventually we were let back into the room. On the surface a bystander might not have noticed any change. There was no medical equipment left about nor papers left in the room. It was as if nothing had changed. That is except subtle differences in Charlie. Still in that unblinking yet somehow breathing state, there was... Something off about it in a way that only those close to her would know to recognize. Her complexion had turned subtly milky and translucent. The blood in her veins ever so slightly too visible, the tint of it a darker, almost purple hue. Nothing that a stranger would notice, but just enough for us to realize that something was wrong on a baser, more intuitive level. Then only a few moments later, after attempting to reach out and make sense of it all, we were yet again forced out by the army of lab coats, forced to wait in the silence that defined our stay.



So we waited. All we were waiting and hoping for was some kind of answer. As Lydia started to fall asleep, and as people filtered in and out of Charlie's room, I grew impatient. The unbearable far too clean smell of the hospital, the white hallways and even whiter lights, the staff keeping us in the dark over the details... the wait was the catalyst for the frustration to grow. Seconds sliding into minutes and after that into hours, unchanging bar the never ending stream of people. Eventually Charlie's family had to leave for the night, they couldn't remain waiting in this limbo, and refused to subject Lydia to it. But I stayed. Clocks ticked, people came and went, and at some point the fatigue got to me. I woke up from the chair, it was late enough that even the streetlamps outside had stopped lighting the way. No one had thought to wake me up. And in this strange state, I did the only thing seemed to make sense. Check up on Charlie.

There was no one preventing me from entering the room. No sign precluding me from doing so. The door was unlocked. Though this time as I entered I immediately felt something profoundly wrong. Despite the hours having passed, the lights were blinding. A smell emanated from the room; before even comprehending what I was seeing, an instinctive queasiness grabbed hold of me. I felt sick to my stomach, struggling against the overwhelming urge to wretch. As my eyes adjusted to the light, the most obvious thing was the piles of medical equipment that had materialized. Syringes and blades of all description littered the room, gleaming from off of the lights. Machines, the utility of which I couldn't even begin to guess, coursing with fluids of all different colors and consistencies, all of which obscured my view of Charlie. Though that was probably for the best. 



Instead of a motionless body, I was faced with a commotion of movement.  An unending twitching of limbs, darting eyes and a frothing mouth, filled with a dark liquid. Though ichor might be more accurate term. Her body was strapped tightly to the bed, heaving and snapping, and the complexion that I had previously noticed had transformed into a bizarre opal like glass. Whereas previously there was the hint of her blood flowing to close to the skin, here it was visibly surging, the white of her bones barely visible underneath. Perhaps most distressing was the sound. The rattle of the bed as her body struggled against its restraints, the suffocating sound of her body, trying, and failing, to breathe as an ever increasing pool of that dark substance oozed from her mouth. And as her eyes darted to and fro, for the slightest moment they managed to lock themselves with mine in a look that defies attempting description. There was simultaneously something simultaneously profoundly human in the look of understanding behind those eyes, yet somehow also something profoundly feral, incapable of understanding beyond pure agony and distress. What was in front of me was simultaneously the person I knew and something purely alien to me. The effect was paralyzing, as I was incapable to reconcile what I was seeing, my fight or flight response broken between the impossible in between. 



Within fractions of a second things worsened. The wrestling against the constraints grew increasingly violent, where it was tied down starting to swelter and tear, the same dark ichor seeping out, and strange pus forming. Her body contorting, writhing, began to break in on itself, the walls between flesh and bone stretched thin, with the ever growing sound of cracking and dripping.



What happened afterwards is difficult to remember. I remember her body lurching and gasping for air, and the sound of a strong snap. The smell, which had been worsening throughout those brief moments, grew to an impossible level, my lungs filling themselves with something fetid, vision fading. I remember the sound  of a wet thud, but anything after that is too hazy to recall.



After that, the waking up was odd. I was most definitely not in the same part of the hospital as I had began, which was the first sign that something had really happened and I hadn't simply had a nightmare. I was face to face with the room of a older man suffering from cancer, his family having arrived at the crack of dawn. My stomach was empty and an odd smell lingered in my mouth. A quick trip to the bathroom and my shirt was marked by black stains, which I've yet to manage to remove. Returning to Charlie's room it was now locked and the lights were off.And thus I waited



The cavalcade of doctors returned, as did Charlie's family, sans Lydia. They were more picky than ever in letting us in the room, and though her state had returned to what it had previously been, no real progress was made. I attempted to reproduce my experience, but it never materialized over the next few days. More days passed, and eventually she passed away, the stated reason suspiciously vague. Though every now and again I run into Lydia, who gives me that same bizarre look.
