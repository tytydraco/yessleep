This story is about how I believe I almost became a victim of human trafficking while visiting a friend in college at Ohio State University. I am currently 30 year, but this story happened when I was 20. 

I had just wrapped up my sophomore year of college at another university I attended in Ohio and some of my friends were staying on campus at OSU for the summer. I went home for the summer and a few weeks before July 4th, a Monday that year, they texted me that I should come down to Columbus and spend the weekend and Monday with them for the holiday. I won't use their real names, but I had 3 friends in total I will call Adam, Joe, and Scott. I was a simple common business major looking to get into investment banking. I am the guarded, smart, but the most outgoing one of the group. I am also known to let my guard down and relax when I think the situation calls for it and I turn my brain off and can get crazy. And that is exactly what I wanted to do during this trip. Adam was a criminal justice major whose parents basically forced him into college and he hated it. He was a free spirit kind, but also sort of a womanizer. None of us talk to him anymore in modern day cause we slowly realized he really isn't a very nice person later in life. Joe, a zoology major, was basically your typical college almost alcoholic. Super friendly and helpful, but not very smart. Finally Scott, an arts major of some sort to do with drawing. Very weird and philosophical compared to the rest of us, but he oddly fit in with us because he was very charismatic and could talk about and relate to almost anything with others. Which is basically how we became friends in high school. 

I was lucky enough for my bosses at my grocery store summer job to allow me to take the whole weekend and Monday/Tuesday off, though I promised to do extra time for them the following week to make up. So Friday evening I headed down and planned to chill in my room at The Blackwell Inn on campus I booked. I didn't plan on seeing my friends until the next day because I knew I would be tired after the long drive. It was reasonably close to off campus near my friend's house, while still being on campus. Unfortunately they had no room for me to crash in their tiny off campus house, but I had no problem with that. I liked fancy hotels anyway so it was a good excuse to spend those few days in one.

We spent the next few days catching up on how college was going, girlfriends, typical life things since we didn't talk or hang out like we used to in high school. They showed me around campus, even though I had seen it before, but it was still nice. For the weekend we spent some time downtown and in the Short North areas. My friends told me the real party though was going to be on Monday. After busy days we mostly just hung around and drank a bit and played video games and planned to go full on, on actual July 4th. 

I honestly didn't even know what the plan was at the time for Monday. I was sort of just going with the flow. But Sunday night I asked them what we were going to do. Adam told me the plan was to go to one of his buddy's frat houses who was throwing a massive July 4th party. That got me very excited as at the time my friends did not know but I was realizing I think I might be gay (they now know and don't care in modern day) and this was a great chance to potentially meet guys. 

July 4th we just lazed around mostly all day until around 9pm came around and headed out to the frat house. It was a bit of a walk, around 20 minutes, but it was on East 15th Street. We got there and it was starting to liven up but not quite raging yet. Adam introduced me to his friends he knew at the frat house (Joe and Scott already knew them) and we started off with simple beer pong and some light drinking games, the usual. As it got to be about 11pm the house was really starting to fill up with all types, friends of friends, sorority girls, cousins and siblings of frat members, etc. People were starting to get more drunk and crazy naturally, and I was pretty tipsy at that point. 

I decided to take a few minutes to myself and found a bathroom on the second floor of the house unoccupied. I just went through my phone and responded to some messages and splashed some water on my face to sorta refresh myself a little. I opened the door to head back down to my friends and as soon as I opened the door I almost ran into a guy about my age. I apologized quickly and so did he. Awkwardly I introduced myself because I realized he was really attractive and he laughed and did the same back. He said he needed to use the restroom badly so I let him in and just forgot about it mostly and went downstairs. 

My friends starting to get pretty drunk were all spread out doing various things. I decided to go make myself a drink. Instead of cheap beer like many college houses had this was clearly a more wealthy frat and they actually had a proper bar with tons and some pledge was working it and made me a rum and coke. As he handed me my drink the guy I introduced myself to walked up next to me and asked for a drink I don't remember now. And he looked over and said hey again. I forgot to mention but he introduced himself as Seth, though looking back I don't think that was his real name and I will likely never know. As we did some light talking after his drink was made and I was feeling the effects of the alcohol more and more slowly but surely (the frat was pouring heavy) I could feel myself really being into Seth. We went around the party and played some games together and talked with various random people I don't remember at all nowadays. He finally told me more about himself and how he was a part of the frat just finishing his second year like me and said he wanted to take me up to his room cause he had something to show me. I knew he didn't really have anything to show me and I think he had feelings for me like I did him.

As I expected it was just a chance for us to start making out. That was my first time ever making out with a guy and I knew it was for me. As corny as it is, it was around midnight and fireworks were going off outside college kids were firing off probably illegally. I was so happy but also so drunk after more drinks I had during our games/hanging out. Suddenly I heard Joe yelling up the stairs for me and panicked to be found out we broke our kisses and stood up before he found us. He walked in and just told me they hadn't seen me in awhile and got worried. I just said I made a friend. Joe had never seen Seth before but introduced himself all the same. I found it a little odd at the time Joe never knew Seth. Even if Adam was the one friends with guys in the frat and Joe just knew at least most of them by affiliation, it was weird he at least wouldn't have seen him before. Especially since he wasn't a new pledge or anything. But neither of our drunk minds were thinking clearly and this was mostly more in hindsight. 

I went downstairs with Joe and Seth joined us. For the next few hours we just did more typical partying.  Around 2am I was exhausted and still very drunk. I went and found my 3 friends and told them I was gonna walk back to my hotel. I could've used an Uber at the time but it was only a 20ish minute walk and I just spent a lot of money on my hotel and food/drinks/shopping all weekend and I wasn't so gone that I couldn't walk. Campus/off campus near the campus were generally very safe even that late at night because still many are out partying and enjoying night life, especially on a holiday. I also said goodbye to Seth and gave him my phone number so we could talk more later.

I made my way back no problem. Being drunk made the walk oddly fast. I got into my room and immediately laid down. I realized my head was spinning and that I should probably eat something and drink water before I went to bed. I placed a delivery order for some pizza as many places were open very late near campus. It surprisingly came pretty quickly. In the midst of eating I heard a knock at the door. The pizza guy just left not long ago so I figured maybe he forgot something. I asked out who's there and a voice sang out "me." I recognized the voice as Seth. I asked him what he is doing here while realizing I just know I never told him my room even if I may have possibly slipped where I was staying. Though I wasn't sure. He claimed that I did in fact tell him and he was hoping we could "hang out" more in private. Even though I was very into him it was extremely late and I was still very hungry/thirsty and wanted to sleep. I let him in reluctantly but immediately told him we wouldn't be doing anything sexual. We could just watch some TV and share pizza and hang and then after an hour or so I was gonna go to bed. While mostly I ate and watched TV with him he slipped his arm around me and I figured it couldn't hurt if he wanted to cuddle me a bit. 

After a few minutes of this all of a sudden I felt a prick in my arm as if he pinched me and I said "ow wtf Seth." I didn't even bother to look at what he did. He just said sorry my bad. Though I was sobering up I was still a bit out of it. Very shortly I realized I started to feel like everything was beginning to spin and my senses were failing me. I got up as quick as I could and Seth tried to rip me back and kept trying to put something over my mouth to muffle my screams for help. I was able to just barely fight him enough to get to the door and open it up and scream for help as he finally fully got me back in the room I believe and I passed out not remembering anything from there. I woke up hours later in a hospital bed. Eventually the nurse came in and told me everything is alright. She took some basic vitals and told me the cops need to speak with me. I was extremely confused and scared and what happened was slowly coming back to me.

The cops explained to me what happened after I passed out. Concerned hotel guests heard my final scream from the open door and some called the front desk and some 911. When they got there I was passed out blocking the open door. They found a used syringe dropped in the room which contained the substance used to sedate me. That was obviously the prick I felt. They asked for my account of the weekend/holiday and night. Examination of me found no signs of sexual assault or anything other than the needle he used. Seth was gone by the time they got there and no one knew where he was or even truly who he was. The cops told me they were going to investigate. I recovered and as I did my friends came to visit after. I told them everything. Adam asked the entire frat and the frat brothers even asked those they knew. No one knew this Seth person, nor were they a part of the frat. 

Following this I went home and resumed life. Even today I have trauma about staying in hotels alone and have a general distrust of men romantically that I have slowly worked on over the years with a psychologist. I hope that ne day I will fully be over it. 

The last information I ever got from the cops investigating the matter was about what they think the intentions of "Seth" were and information leading up to/following his attack. Upon review of camera footage on campus/the hotel they found that Seth did trail me back to the hotel staying back a ways. He used crowds in various areas also to sort of blend in behind me and covered his face and self up partially in case I turned back. Because of it, it ended up being difficult to further investigate his identity. Finger prints and other prints from the room and on things like the syringe failed to locate matches. Seth found my room once I got in the hotel because they found during the party at some point he installed something on my phone (likely while I was drunk without me knowing) to track it and all calls. He followed the pizza man to my floor and found my room seeing where he went. The case is sadly long cold now. But the last detail of why they think Seth planned on trafficking me and not just sexually assaulting me. They found right outside my door a very large suitcase on camera footage and near a side exit of the hotel a car that sat with an open trunk that parked roughly around the time I was leaving the party and waited (whoever drove the car hid the plates in advance sadly). When Seth ran after I screamed openly in the hallway on footage he got to the car and they left extremely quickly. They think Seth's plan was to pack my body in the large suitcase and put me in the trunk and drive off. This is not confirmed but I also believe this theory to be true. 

Please be weary of strangers if you got to the end of this story.
