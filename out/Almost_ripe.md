I knew I was dreaming before I opened my eyes.

Not because of anything obvious—no floating furniture or melting clocks. It was the silence.
Dream-silence is different. It’s heavier, like the air is listening.

When I sat up, I was in my apartment hallway. Same peeling wallpaper. Same flickering bathroom light. Same lemon-cleaner smell my landlord uses to hide the mold.

But it felt… staged.
Like the whole place was holding perfectly still, pretending to be normal.

I took one step.

The whisper came immediately.

“Don’t wake up.”

It floated from somewhere behind me—soft, almost affectionate—but it crawled straight up my spine. I turned around slowly.

Nothing.

I decided I wasn’t sticking around to see what made that voice. I reached the end of the hallway, grabbed the doorknob, and pulled.

And walked straight into my childhood bedroom.

My rocket-ship bedsheets were still tucked in the same crooked way. My old nightlight glowed weakly in the corner—though I remember throwing it away years ago. My dresser still had the dent from the night I thought a monster lived under it.

Funny thing.

There was something under it now.

At first it looked like spilled ink, spreading across the floor. Then it rose—slowly—unfolding in jerky, impossible angles. A shape that shouldn’t stand. Arms bending the wrong way. Its face was a smooth, black void, like someone had erased its features with a smear of charcoal.

But behind that blackness, something moved.
Something pressed against the surface of its skin from the inside.

It tilted its head like it was studying me.

“Almost ripe.”

My lungs stopped working. I backed into the wall, shaking so hard my teeth clicked.

That whisper wasn’t a sound. It was a feeling—cold fingers brushing through the inside of my skull.

It wasn’t here to kill me.

It was here to eat what lives in my mind. My memories, dreams, fears—whatever makes me “me.” The thought hit me like ice.

I ran.
Through the door. Back into the hallway.

Except it was no longer my hallway.

It stretched on forever—too long, too narrow, ceiling pressed low like it wanted to crush me. Doors were repeated, copied, pasted. The lights flickered like a dying pulse.

I started running, pushing through thick dream-air. The lights blinked out—just for half a second.

When they came back on, the Dream Eater was closer.

Another blink—closer.

Another—right behind me.

I didn’t look until the hallway ended in a dead end.

I turned.

The thing had grown a mouth.

Not a normal mouth. It split its face open from one side to the other, filled with teeth that looked like broken mirror shards—each one reflecting a tiny, warped version of my face. Spiraling infinitely back into darkness.

“You taste like fear.”

It lunged. I threw myself sideways and—

Fell.

No floor. No hallway. Just a sudden drop.

I landed on carpet.

My carpet.

My living room—but wrong. Everything was copied with tiny mistakes. A picture frame facing the wrong way. My couch in a color I never owned. The clock ticking backward.

Dream version stuff.

A deep vibration shook the room—like the world was breathing.

I ducked behind the couch, trying not to sob.

Then the front door creaked open.

Footsteps. Slow. Familiar.

I peeked out.

It was me.

But drained. Older. Hollow eyes, cracked lips, moving like sleepwalking. Their jaw had a hairline fracture running down one side, like porcelain splitting.

They spoke without turning their head.

“It already ate me once.”

Their voice was papery, brittle.

I shook my head. “No—no, that’s not—”

They turned fully. The crack along their jaw widened.

“It keeps us like leftovers.”

The Dream Eater slid through the doorway behind them, its hand resting on their shoulder like it owned them.

I bolted for the kitchen.

Drawers. Knives. Perfect.

I grabbed one—but the blade melted, dripping like wax.

Of course. Dream logic.

The Dream Eater’s voice slid across the room:

“You cannot fight me in a world I hold.”

But something sparked inside me.
A tiny, desperate thought:

It’s my dream too.

I closed my eyes, imagined the knife becoming real—sharp, solid, cold.

When I opened them, the metal gleamed.

The Dream Eater froze for the first time.

I attacked.

The blade sliced through its arm—if that writhing shadow could be called an arm—and the creature let out a scream that wasn’t sound but a pressure in my bones. The room warped, bending sideways, ceiling cracking open to a sky that wasn’t a sky at all.

I ran.
Straight for the front door.

It stretched away from me—

I imagined it close.

It snapped back.

I grabbed the handle—

—and woke up.

Or I thought I did.

I was in my real bed. Real morning light. Real air.

I exhaled, shaky.

Safe.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand.

Before my fingers touched it, a whisper rose from beneath my mattress:

“Wake up properly, this time.”

The world froze.

I slowly turned the phone toward me, using the black screen as a mirror.

The face staring back wasn’t mine.

And the mouth—my mouth—opened into a wide, dark slit.

“Almost ripe.”
