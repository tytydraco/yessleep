It's been a few days fellow readers and a lot has been happening. It's the daytime right now and I find things are so much more clear in the daytime. 

I've gone to bed early the past few nights, I was tired of all the foggy thinking. Besides, I came up with a plan and nothing is better than a good few nights of rest, when you have work to do.

I want to thank those who had shown worry and concern for me and all their suggestions. I look back at my previous two posts and can't help but chuckle a bit, I realize now how silly I was being. Why was I fighting the very thing that was going to get my wife back for me? Does a lottery winner try to return their prize? 

Enough of that though, let me catch you up on the past few days.

After finding that my wife was newly engaged, I talked and talked to the ring. It never talked back, of course, it's just a ring, but it really helps to say things out loud, especially when you're trying to put a plan together.

I took a few days off of work and went to a local jewelry dealer and bought a small piece. The goal wasn't the piece itself, of course, simply the container and packaging that the piece came in. They even offered to gift wrap it, which was sweet of them. I asked if I could get the supplies, as I wanted to wrap it myself at home. It's a very special gift for a very special someone, after all. The best gifts always have a personal touch to them.  

I took the packaging home and laid it out on the table. I had a nice ring box from the local jeweler, a business card from their store and the gift wrapping supplies they so kindly offered. I spun the ring around my finger a few times and found that it came off with ease this time. Looking over the previous few days, I suspect I must have had high blood pressure or some other reason that the ring was so difficult to come off. Awful silly of me to make such a fuss about it, wouldn't you agree? It made the most beautiful sound of metal on wood, as it hit the table. The sound was much louder than expected though, almost as if the ring had a hidden weight around it, forcing it to drop at a speed and heft unfitting of its small size.

I placed the ring into the box and placed it into the wrapping. I worked with great care. The pieces, folded ever so nicely over the box. My hands moved side to side, tucking all the little corners and edging, ensuring that the perfect gift had the perfect presentation. I tied the bow onto the box and sat the business card in front of me. A nice message for a nice gift.

"Jack, please accept this men's ring as a celebration of your engagement, a gift from your local jeweler. Please try on ASAP as we'd be happy to resize it for you!"

A message short, to the point, and with purpose. All he had to do was try on the ring, for but a moment. The ring would take care of the rest.

I slid the card into the bow and placed it neatly on my counter. Usually I'd have a drink to celebrate such an occasion, but you might say I'm high on life lately, I haven't felt this good in quite a long time. To think that I'll get my wife back and the ring will be with an owner more suited to its aesthetic, what could a drink and the numbing of my mind offer in place of that?

I turned off my desk lamp and went off to sleep. A clear conscience works better than any medicine, anyone can tell you that, dear reader.

The next day I sat with some coffee, waiting around for the right time to deliver the gift. I had to wait until they were gone, as I would not want to be seen delivering the item, that would make quite a mess, a silly mess! I waited around, scrolled on Social Media and checked on their stories from time to time, looking for a clear sign that their home was empty. Lucky for me, Jack was so kind to post he and his bride-to-be at a local hot spot, enjoying lunch with the love of his life. The. Love. Of. My. Life. No matter, that would all be solved soon enough, soon enough.

I drove around the block a few times, waiting for a good opportunity to deliver the freshly boxed ring. I pulled the curb, grabbed the box, hopped up the steps and nestled it in the entryway and scampered back to my car. The whole process couldn't have taken longer than 15 seconds. I dare say reader, my smile was so wide that I looked quite maniacal. I've been smiling so so much the past few days. 

Social media is such a beautiful tool for the modern man, have I ever mentioned that to you? It wasn't all that many hours later until I saw a post from Jack, thanking the local boutique for their gift. I'm sure the boutique would be confused, but I also imagined that their confusion wouldn't deter them from some free publicity. They had their own busy lives. Besides, they wouldn't see the message until work the next day and everything I needed would happen that very night, if luck was my way. I've felt very lucky lately.

Shortly following his message, was a picture of his hand with a ring on it. It was strange though, reader, the ring...was not the ring I had come to know. The dark black had changed to a deep azure; The golden flecks had turned to dark crystals. I had assumed that the ring would find its way to his hand and that he would have some excuse to tell my wife, as to why it looked so similar...but this was an unexpected boon. The ring was the ring, I could feel it on my insides, in my soul. It was the same...just different. Like a parent looking at their twins in different clothing. Different sides of the same coin. It just felt right.

That brings us to today. I'm back on my couch and working on my laptop. I feel...a bit unwell. Almost like an addict after a multi-day bender. I think I feel good about this, but I still feel...strange. 

I haven't studied my hand since I removed the ring. There is a very dark circle around my ring finger. The skin is not sensitive to touch and I can smell an a slight, acrid odor. That's probably normal though, I had the ring on for a few years, nothing too out of the ordinary. Nothing worth fussing about, anyway.

But I know everything I did was right. The ring is on Jack now. The ring took my life, my wife, everything from me. Jack doesn't deserve my wife, my life. The ring will do to him what it did to me. My wife will come back to me now, the ring promised me. All I have to do is wait. Wait and be patient. I need some tylenol though. Maybe a drink or two. I just need to rest a bit and give it time. My wife is coming back. I can picture her in the doorway. We shared this house once, we shared a life once. I haven't done anything wrong, I am just fixing what was already wrong. I am returning things to how they should be. Jack shouldn't have ever met my wife. She should have always been with me.

I doubt I will have any more updates to share. I thank you for going along this journey with me as long as you have, but there is no cause for worry or concern. Just imagine me, in bliss, with my marriage restored and all the good things back in my life. That is all you have to imagine; I don't have to come here and spell it out for you. Paradise, essentially, bliss and merriment, abundant joy, you get the picture. 

I'm thirsty though. Where did I set that drink.
