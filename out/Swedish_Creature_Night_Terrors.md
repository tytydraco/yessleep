I didn’t really believe in internet horror stories, but this experience has changed my mind.

I live in Sweden. And in the summer people who owns one most often goes to live in a summer cottage here. It’s a part of the Swedish summer. Anyways, my family bought a new cottage, since our last one got too expensive to pay for. I have been here for about 5 days, and so far it’s been very nice and calming to be here. We spend our days going to the beach, tanning, overall having a lot of fun. But tonight something happened that made my spine shiver.

I was doing my regular routine for the night, brushing my teeth, changing, and then I went to sleep. I laid down in my bed, closed my eyes, then I fell asleep. Later I woke up, it was about 3:40 am? And I felt thirsty. I went up the stairs (My room is in the basement), took a cup out of the cupboard, filled it up, drank it, filled it up again, and walked back to my room. I put my cup down, and tried to go to sleep again. It didn’t really work, so I just ended up scrolling on my phone. I was laying there in bed, when I suddenly heard a noise outside my door. It sounded like claws walking out there.I was confused, since my dog sleeps in my brothers (locked) room. I own a labradoodle, so he isn’t aggressive  most of the time. That’s why I knew this wasn’t him. These steps were not gentle. That sounded like a person. I was too much of a scaredy-cat to go and check, but I didn’t want to go up and lock my door either. So I just laid there, waiting for the noises to stop, completely quiet and not even wanting to fall asleep anymore. I waited until it was 6:30am. That’s when I finally started making noise. I was kinda spooked about the night, but I thought it had to be either my dad or my brother.

Later during the day I was talking with my dad and I said something along the lines of:
-Been walking a lot down in the basement, huh? He looked at me and said he was sound asleep. I asked my brother and he said no too. None of them have ever sleepwalked.

Later, I was walking my dog in the forest, and he was eating grass and I was taking in the forest. Then I heard an ear piercing shriek from about maybe 300meters away? (328 yards) and my dog reacted strongly. He looked at the direction of the sound, and just started barking like he was dying. I dashed out of there like a speeding bullet. You’re maybe thinking that it’s an animal, or maybe just some crack addict, but no. This felt too loud to be a voice, and too human to be natural. It was a piercing shriek. It sounded kind of like a deeper Aztec death whistle. My point is, that was not an animal, but definitely not a human.



Just to clear it up, none of this could have a dream, I felt wide awake, and I even have videos that I liked saved on my phone. I give a follow up if any more stuff happens.
