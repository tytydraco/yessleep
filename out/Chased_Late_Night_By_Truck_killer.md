Iâ€™ll never forget that night. It was late, maybe around 11:30 PM, and I was driving alone on a backroad, heading home after visiting my parents. The highway was eerily empty, the kind of quiet that makes you feel like the world has paused and youâ€™re the only one left.

Iâ€™m no stranger to long drives, but this one was different. The darkness felt oppressive, like it was pressing against my car windows. My headlights barely illuminated the road ahead, and the winding curves made me feel like I was driving deeper into the unknown.

Thatâ€™s when I saw itâ€”a massive truck, an old, beat-up rig with a rusted cab, parked on the side of the road. Its headlights were off, but as I drove past, they flickered on, almost blinding me in my rearview mirror. I felt my stomach tighten.

At first, I thought it was just a coincidence when the truck pulled onto the road behind me. But then it started getting closer. Too close. Its high beams lit up the inside of my car, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.

I tried to stay calm. Maybe the driver was just in a hurry or didnâ€™t realize how close they were. I gently pressed on the gas to put some distance between us. But the truck sped up too, matching my pace.

Something wasnâ€™t right.

I changed lanes. So did the truck. I slowed down. The truck slowed too. My pulse was racing now. My hands gripped the wheel so tight my knuckles turned white.

When I reached for my phone to call someoneâ€”anyoneâ€”I realized I had barely any signal. Thatâ€™s when the truck roared its engine, the sound echoing through the empty night, and swerved toward my car.

I panicked and hit the gas, the car surging forward as I tried to outrun it. But the truck was relentless. Its grill loomed large in my mirror, getting closer and closer as if it was trying to ram me off the road.

My breath was shallow, my chest tight. Every instinct in me screamed to keep driving, to not stop for anything. The road stretched on endlessly, no signs of a town or even a gas station. Just darkness.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I saw a faint glow in the distanceâ€”lights. A security checkpoint! My only hope. I pressed the horn repeatedly, flashing my lights as I sped toward it. The truck stayed on my tail, relentless.

The security guards must have seen me coming because they rushed out, shining their flashlights at the truck behind me. That was when it suddenly slowed down. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the truck backing up, its headlights fading into the darkness.

I skidded to a stop at the checkpoint, jumped out of my car, and ran toward the guards, trembling and trying to explain what had happened. They tried to chase the truck, but it was gone.

The next morning, I filed a police report. Thatâ€™s when I learned the truth. The truck belonged to a man theyâ€™d been investigating for monthsâ€”a suspected serial killer who targeted women driving alone at night. He would force their cars off the road, take them into his truckâ€™s cab, and... God, I donâ€™t even want to say it. Heâ€™d assault them, kill them, and dump their bodies deep in the forests.

They never caught him.

To this day, I still feel his headlights in my rearview mirror, the weight of his presence chasing me through the dark. And sometimes, when Iâ€™m driving late at night, I canâ€™t help but wonderâ€”what if heâ€™s still out there? Waiting.
