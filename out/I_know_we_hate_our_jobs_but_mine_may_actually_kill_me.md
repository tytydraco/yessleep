I sometimes think about how work shifts used to be, back when they were just 10, 12, maybe 14 hours long. People would complain about those shifts, but in comparison, they were living the dream. They had breaks, restrooms, cubicles—little luxuries we never knew. Oh, boo hoo. With your comfortable schedules and cushy conditions. I wonder if they ever realized how easy they had it.

I work 164 hours a week, and that’s just the beginning of it. My shift never ends, not really. We’re given 30 minutes of sleep each day and an hour on Sundays. That’s it. No real rest, no real comfort. We don’t have homes anymore, just one 5-foot by 3-foot mat that doubles as our workspace, living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It’s all we get, and it’s barely enough to lie down in, let alone live.

The company recently rolled out a new rack system to maximize efficiency. Workers are strapped to it, with only their heads and hands free, the arms forced to be extended for hours on end. During rest periods, we’re laid down automatically, but it’s not a true respite. Instead, we’re shocked awake, jolted from a half-sleep to get back to work. They believe the shocks make us more alert and productive, a cruel twist on the notion of rest. It’s designed to push us harder, faster, making sure every second is utilized to its fullest, regardless of how exhausted we are.

I can’t remember the taste of food anymore. Water, sure—we get that. But food? I struggled to recall the names the things I ate as a child. Now, nutrients are pumped directly into our stomachs through an NG tube. The nutrition team comes by once a day, but they’re not here to nurture or care—they're here to monitor. They take our vitals, draw blood, and adjust our feeding programs with the cold precision of scientists tinkering with their experiments. 

For relief, there’s a long pipe with a toilet seat attached, and it’s connected to the sewage system. We’re supposed to stay seated on it at all times, except when we’re sleeping. No matter what, you can’t stop working, even when you need to use the toilet. If production stops for more than 45 seconds, you’re terminated. And I don’t mean you’re just let go. You’re killed on the spot, replaced by one of the 20,000 people waiting to take your place. They’ll be ready even before your body is cleaned off the factory floor.

The factories are where hope goes to die. People go mad, and some of them act out. They kill other workers, or they end their own lives. Caffeine is a relic of the past; now, stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine are the norm. If you can’t keep up, you’re done.

Today, one of my coworkers, a woman whose name I don’t even know, managed to tear herself from the rack system. She fought against the restraints, her movements frantic and desperate. Her face was twisted with a the raw determination of a trapped animal .

With a violent lurch, she freed herself, tearing and bloodying her flesh as the straps and buckles came away from the frame of the rack. She stumbled, disoriented but driven by a singular purpose. Her eyes were wild as she lurched toward the meat grinder, her every step an act of defiance against the nightmare we’re all trapped in.

The sight was a grotesque spectacle. Her body, still strapped into the remnants of the rack, was thrown with a brutal force into the grinding maw. There was a sickening crunch as her flesh met the machine, and the grinder whirred to life. Clothes, skin, everything was shredded and mixed into a slurry.

The press was relentless, churning out burger-shaped patties from the macabre blend of human remains and clothing. I continued packing the patties, layer by layer on sheets of wax paper, my hands moving on autopilot. The tainted patties went in too; nothing is wasted here, not even the ones with bits of fabric and strands of hair clinging to them. I tried not to look too closely, but I could see remnants of her—the frayed edge of a shirt cuff, a sliver of a nametag, a small button that had somehow survived the grinding. Her shoes were tossed in the corner, streaked with fark and sticky blood.

I can’t help but wonder if this is what awaits us all—each of us destined to be chewed up and swallowed by this relentless machine, our bodies and identities erased in the endless search for more. 

As I stand here, my hands moving mechanically, I feel my eyes growing heavier with each passing moment. My fingers fumble, and two patties slip from my grasp—one falls to the floor with a dull, wet thud. Did I stop? I can't remember. My gaze drifts upward from the fallen patty, catching sight of my supervisor. She’s staring at me, her finger pointed sternly toward the massive, red timer looming above us all.

46 seconds.
