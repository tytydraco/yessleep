I’m sitting home alone. My parents are out visiting friends, and at first, everything seems normal.  
It’s just another quiet evening — one of those nights where you don’t expect anything to happen.

I’ve got my headphones on, playing a video game, enjoying the rare silence that fills the house.  
But behind that silence… there’s something else.  
Something I’ve known since I was a kid.

Footsteps.  
Soft creaking.  
The sound of wood bending — as if someone is walking across the old floorboards.

I’ve heard it for as long as I can remember.  
As a kid, I would lie awake at night, blanket pulled up to my chin, staring at the ceiling while the boards above me groaned.

My parents always said the same thing.  
“It’s just the house settling.”  
“You have too much imagination.”

Eventually, I stopped telling them.  
But I never forgot.

The footsteps never stopped.  
Sometimes I wouldn’t hear them for days — then suddenly, two or three heavy steps above me, slow and deliberate, like someone pacing on the attic floor.

There were times I convinced myself it was nothing.  
Other times… I was sure I wasn’t alone up there.

Tonight, the feeling is stronger than ever.  
Maybe because the house is too quiet.  
No voices. No TV. No hallway light.

Just me — and that uneasy feeling that the house is *alive.*

I turn off the game.  
The music fades, and now there’s only the low ringing in my ears — the kind that comes when everything else is too still.

Then I hear it.

**Krrrk.**

A deep, heavy creak, right above my room.

I freeze.  
I tell myself it’s nothing.  
But then it comes again.

Once.  
Twice.  
A third time.

Slow. Rhythmic. *Footsteps.*

My pulse is pounding.  
I push my chair back quietly and listen.  
The sound stops.

The attic is right above me — empty except for a few boxes, an old desk, and some clothes.  
There’s a small hatch in the hallway ceiling with a pull-down ladder.  
No one ever goes up there.

I keep telling myself it’s just the wood expanding.  
But then — I hear it again.  
Not directly above me this time, but moving.

Someone is walking.

I can feel the weight of each step in my chest.  
A faint scraping sound follows, like something being dragged.

I want to get away from it.  
So I decide to go downstairs, grab something to eat, distract myself.

But as soon as I reach the stairs, I hear it again.

**Footsteps.**  
Above me.  
Slow. Heavy.

And then I see it — just for a split second — a shadow moving across the gap of the attic hatch.

I freeze.  
Every muscle in my body locks up.

For a moment, everything is silent.  
Then instinct kicks in.

I bolt.  
Down the stairs, through the hallway, straight to the front door. My hands are shaking as I fumble with the keys. The metal slips once, twice—  
Finally, the lock turns.

Cold air hits my face.  
I’m outside.

I grab my phone and call my parents.  
My voice is shaking so hard I can barely speak. I tell them someone’s in the house.

It feels like forever before they arrive — ten, maybe fifteen minutes.  
I spend every one of them staring at the dark windows, waiting for something to move.

And then… I swear I see it.  
A figure, just barely visible behind the curtain upstairs.

When the police finally arrive with my parents, blue lights flash across the walls.  
I run to them, desperate to stay outside.

The officers listen, calm but serious. They decide to check the house immediately.

Room by room.  
Closets.  
Basement.  
Bathrooms.

Nothing.  
Everything is locked. No signs of a break-in.

I start to think maybe I *am* crazy — until one of the officers points up.

“There’s another hatch up there, isn’t there?”

He means the small opening to the crawl space — above the attic, a narrow gap between the ceiling and the roof.  
We never use it.  
You need a ladder to reach it, and there’s nothing up there but dust and old boxes.

The officer grabs his flashlight and climbs up carefully.  
Seconds later, he calls down:

“…We’ve got something.”

My mom gasps. My stomach drops.

They don’t let me come up, but I see their faces when they look inside.  
The officer’s voice is tense when he comes back down.

“There’s a mattress up there,” he says.  
“Food wrappers, empty cans. Someone’s been living there.”

I feel dizzy. My throat tightens.

He continues, slower now.  
“There’s also a vent. It’s open — or it was. The cover’s loose, and some of the screws are missing. Someone removed them and put them back.”

It takes me a second to understand.

Someone was living *above me.*  
For days.  
Maybe weeks.

Watching. Listening.

The police search the space again. They find footprints in the dust — bare feet, faint but real.  
They take pictures, samples, evidence.

My dad recognizes an old wardrobe we stored up there years ago. It’s standing right in front of the vent.  
One of the officers shines his light at it.

“From here,” he says quietly, “someone could’ve crawled into the air ducts. They lead down into the attic… and maybe farther.”

My knees feel weak.  
Every sound I ever heard — the footsteps, the knocking, the creaks — it all makes sense now.

He wasn’t just in the attic.  
He could move through the walls.

The officers tell us to stay somewhere else for the night.  
But I know I’ll never step inside that house again.

We move out the next day.  
My parents don’t talk about it, and I stop asking.

But sometimes, at night, when I lie in my new room…  
I hear it again.

That faint, rhythmic creaking.  
Like someone walking.  
Above me.

And every time, I think of the vent.  
The missing screws.  
The footsteps.

And I wonder if he ever really left...
