Hi. Um... my name is Liz, and I think I'm a werewolf. I mean, I... am...

Probably. 

Me thinking maybe not is because I hope I am not. I am just a fifteen year old girl, trying to find her way in life! But...

Okay...

I AM a werewolf. There's no denying it after what happened last night. 

Let me explain. I've had a lot of paranormal stuff happen in my life... like, how I can see what humans cannot. Once, there was a bunch of spiders following a girl around in the third grade. I tried to tell her, but no one else saw anything abnormal and called me crazy. I have come to understand that the spiders follow people that live in fear. Because they *are* the fear. 

Ravens fly over the heads of people that have depression. A snake will follow someone who is living with a lot of peer pressure or temptations surrounding them. People who are greiving...

Well, actually they have a cute dog that follows them around listening to them. It's quite cute, actually. 

But that's all besides the point. Last night, I had a very hard day at school. Someone had called me a jerk for tapping on their shoulder to ask them a question (like, what?), I tripped in the middle of everyone in the hallway and was laughed at, and failed my math test. All a horrible day in high school. 

Well, when I got home, my mom asked the one question I had willed her not to ask. "How was your day, honey?" I sighed as anger boiled up inside of me. I was not in the mood to be asked questions. I looked over my shoulder. A rat of anger. Typical. Rats of anger were confusing to me at first, but rats infest stuff, and anger infests your mind. Fun comparison, huh?

"Mom, I just want to be left alone right now, okay?" I looked over my shoulder. Another rat. Their beady eyes laughed at me, and their bodies, so thin that they looked skeletal, seemed ready to nibble my flesh. 

"But honey, if something happened, please tell me." 

"Mom!" 

Then, of course Dad had to walk into the room. 

"Hey, Elizabeth. Whats the matter." 

"Nothing, Dad. And it's just *Liz*." I replied, my tone increasing. 

My parents would not let up.

"Obviously something's wrong!" 

"You can talk to us!" 

(Parents out there, I do not mean in any ways to offend you. But sometimes a girl's gotta process some stuff BEFORE being talked to.)

 I couldn't take it any longer. 

"Will you shut up?!?! Gosh, I HATE yall!" 

I realized what I had said and slapped a hand over my mouth, tears welling up in my eyes, while my parents looked like they had been hit with a baseball bat and then punched in the gut. 

The swarm of rats that had been at my feet scuttled away, their work done. 

I went to bed that night with the comforter up to my chin, thinking guiltily of what I had done. 

*Whoosh!* 

Oh no. Not this guy... my nightly visitor. 

At first, I had been terrified of him. A tall, skinny man with a shrunken head and cracked, charcoal colored skin. Slimy goop dripping from his sides, all occompanied by a ominous, deep voice. *His* job was to make me feel worse about myself. 

"Haha! Look what you've done, Liz. Your parents will never love you again. You're a bad person. I could just eat you, and maybe then you'll feel better because you won't have to worry about life anymore. Because you won't have one. Not only that, but you have no friends, and you're dumb. You failed your test AND-" 

Yes. That's death. The voice in your head that makes people commit suicide and feel as if their life has no meaning. Please don't give into that psychopath. 

"Shut up, Death." I said in a barely audible whimper. "I don't need this right now." 

But you know, sometimes seeing these things isn't all that bad. 

"Angel, come." I said, patting my lap. Just then, a cat, glowing a brilliant white, like snow, hopped onto my lap and curled up. She yowled at Death, who shrunk back into a corner, proceeding to longingly stare at me and probably daydreaming of my corpse rotting in a coffin and falling apart. 

"You are not a bad person. But you are not perfect. No one is perfect, Liz. You are a good person, you are a good person, you are a good person..." 

I couldn't sleep, even though Angel's chant always worked. Without realizing it, I pushed her away. Slowly, she faded from sight. "Liz, no! Bring me back, let me come back, open the door..." 

And she was gone. It was me and Death again. He stood up in his corner, a wicked smile stretched across his face. "Try being good... WHEN YOURE A WOLF!" 

I blacked out. 

..................

I woke up at exactly 12:00 am. I felt like I needed to barf. Death was gone, but Angel wasn't back either, so I was probably stuck with Puddle at the moment. That lukewarm stupidity who made you all not-figured-out and usually tried to push you back to Death. As an answer to my half-question, I heard his frog legs bouncing behind me. He did nothing, said nothing, just followed me around being annoying. 

I couldn't stand, so I crawled over to the light switch. And when I turned it on... to my horror...

I had paws. 

Light gray paws with sharp black claws. I scrambled over to the body-length mirror and saw my full form. 

A smooth gray coat covered my entire body. I had glowing blue eyes, a broad chest with a fluffy, silky ruff, and a full, warm tail. I was pretty tall, and my ears pinned against my head as I looked at my wet nose and long muzzle and sharp whites in disgust. 

A whine escaped my throat and I clambered down the wooden stairs, causing quite the ruckus, enough to break my parents from a deep sleep. 

Uh-oh. 

"What was that?" My mom cried from upstairs. I needed to hide, but where? I was now a 500 pound gray wolf, so hiding would not come easy. I needed to run. I tried fitting myself through the old dog door that our deceased mini poodle used to have, but I was nowhere near the size of a mini poodle. I was trapped. 

My parents came downstairs and turned on the lights. My mom screamed at me while my dad waved his hands and yelled at me while he pulled out a knife from the knife wrack and grabbed his phone, ready to call the police, or animal control. 

My tail went in between my legs and I whined, pleading for him to understand that I was no threat. I went belly-low to the floor, anxiously thumping my tail and shooting them puppy eyes. My dad remained unchanged, but my mom saw. She saw me. 

"Alfred, wait!" She said, yanking the phone from his hand. "Liz, is that you?" 

I thumped my tail, once, and whined a little. 

"Alfred, look. That's... well, that's Liz." 

My dad finally saw and carefully set the knife on the counter. "Liz, come here," he said, gesturing me over. 

I wagged my tail high and trotted over, letting my instincts take the reigns as I licked both of their faces and nuzzled close to them. 

They let me sleep at the foot of their bed, and Angel even returned. I woke up human again right there at seven o'clock, with my parents smiling down at me. I was a little embarrassed, but we discussed everything, as if to make sure it was true. I said sorry for what I had said the other night, and they forgave me and we hugged it out. I even told them what I needed to about school! 

Angel was with me all day. Death didn't even appear tonight. But still, unfortuantatly, as we're nearing midnight, Angel is looking at me approvingly as I feel nauseous. I think it's happening again...

"Good werewolf." Says Angel. 

I feel like one.
