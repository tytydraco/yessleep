I’ve always found myself to be a great hiker, unlike all my friends who jump at a snapping twig. On this particular day, my friends didn’t want to come. Said they’re going to a concerts and also needed to borrow my phone charger for the trip so I gladly gave him my charger, I didn’t mind as I find hiking alone not as anxious trips, but as calming strolls.

I grab all my hiking gear including my bear spray. I walked along the trail as I usually do, but a couple feet away from me I see a rotting corpse of a wolf with all its organs spilled out. I assume it was just a bear attack, so I dragged the body off the trail and continued

I called my friends to see how they were doing at the concert. They said they were having a great time and he thanked me for the charger. On my hiking trips, I set up markers on the trees to keep track of how many miles I’ve traveled so I don’t go out too far.

The sun is starting to set, so before I have to set up camp, I look for any signs of predators around  to make sure I have a safe campground. I finally set my finale marker and get ready to set up my camp.

I set up my tent and put together a fire. As I’m about to put together a smore, I remember my friend said I should put chocolate syrup on it. I’m about to reach into my bag to pull out the bottle, when I see a black bear staring dead in my direction.

 I was about to get my bear spray when the bear is mouthing sounds, like a dog who wants to go outside. It looked like it had seen a ghost, usually black bears are really aggressive, I don’t know what to make of it. I assumed that this was what killed that wolf, but I would soon realize how wrong I was. I suddenly hear a shattering screech startling the bear. But before it can run away, it’s tackled by a tall and skinny creature. I got a good look at the creature’s back side, long and slim legs, no arms, and an almost burnt look to its skin. Also, its spine was sticking out.

I jump up from my chair and run as fast as I can as I hear the bears cry for help, my survival instinct tells me to climb up a tree.
I started to look for a suitable tree. I see a big branch that could support my weight. 

I got up the tree and tried to call 911. They answer and I start to tell them what happened when my phone dies. It’s watching me, I know it, the bears screams stopped a while ago, and that thing started to scream a horrifying sound that tortured my ears. It will get me soon enough, help isn’t coming. I’m not safe.
