My mother told me I was … “sensitive”. She was too, and my grandmother and aunt as well. And probably a long line of women before them. I bet several of my ancestors had been burned as witches. It occurs to me that you might not understand what I mean by “significant pause sensitive”—some call it having a sixth sense, or second sight. My mother always knew  when the phone was about to ring, or that visitors were going to arrive. After someone threw a rock through her greenhouse in the middle of the night, my grandmother marched over to a neighbour’s house where—to everyone’s surprise—the neighbour’s generally well-behaved teen son admitted that yes, it was him. She knew, because she’d seen it in a dream.

For me, I learned at an early age that I could feel what other people felt if I touched them, and sometimes I’d get glimpses of memories attached to objects or people. In hindsight, that wasn’t the worst that could’ve happened.

Mom left her full-time job when I was 8 or 9 to focus on her writing. Her keen understanding of human nature made her a quite popular author, and soon she started to divide her life between writing and us, her family. She’d rent a house for six months or so, somewhere secluded, and just write. Me, my younger brother Yngve and my father would come join her during summer vacations and then go back home for the last couple of months. 

The summer I turned 15, her writing escape was an old farm at the end of a road that wound through the forest, and while the fields around it were still tilled, sown and harvested, most of the time the only sounds were the birds in the forest that corralled us inside. The house was nice enough, but mom wanted us to be outside more than anything, so that she could write without us disturbing her, so my brother (10 at the time) and I would explore the forest and sometimes not come home until late, since the bright summer nights had late sunsets and early sunrises, especially as north as the farm was.

It was Yngve who found the trail originally. A small path, worn into the forest floor, with sturdy moss growing on it and lingonberry and blueberry bushes growing next to it. I realised how old it was when I tripped on a root and my bare hand touched the path. It knew me, and greeted me like an old friend, and I could feel generations upon generations following the path. Our ancestors, though I don’t think mom knew anything about that. Maybe I should’ve told her. Maybe I tried, and she just waved me away with a “mm, that’s nice dear”. But while Yngve seemed unaffected, I knew from touching the trail that led to the tarn that if I followed it, I could not turn away.

I still did. Not that day—we already had to get back home before dinner—but the next day after breakfast I set out. Yngve came with me, of course, though for him I think it was more of an adventure. He was much more like our father, a practical and down-to-earth man who didn’t believe in superstitions. I’m pretty sure half the reason mom fell for him is because he would just laugh off any talk about being sensitive. Which is why she never talked to me about it when he was around.

The forest felt different as we started on the path. No wind, and while it was warm and sunny away from the trees, under the canopies of pines and firs, oaks and birches, it was dark as twilight. Yngve slipped his hand into mine as we found the path again, following the trail. It was on a light downwards slope, spiralling through the forest while something watched us. Yngve squeezed my hand.

“Lina … I want to go back? Can we do that?” He looked around, looking spooked in a way that I’d never seen. The hairs on my neck rose at a sudden chilling insight. He could. I couldn’t. I plastered a smile on, nodding to him.

“Of course. Come, I’ll walk you back, okay?” Squeezing his hand lightly in return, pretending I didn’t feel the gaze resting on us. Waiting. Biding. He wet his lips, watching me for a moment as we walked back up the spiral.

“What … what about you?” I couldn’t lie to him, and it’s not like he wouldn’t have figured it out about five minutes after we parted ways.

“You can go play by the house, I’ll catch up with you later, okay?” Giving his hand another comforting squeeze. “Nothing’s going to happen, okay? I just want to see where the trail leads. Remember what grandpa told us, about the paths that our ancestors walked so often that the ground formed a natural road. They went to church, or to the shore, or to their neighbours.” I tried to sound as cheerful as I could, and after a moment Yngve nodded.

“Okay. But if you’re not home before dinner I’m telling mom.”

“You do so.” I kissed the top of his head, letting go of his hand as we stepped out into the sun again. I blinked a little as the brightness was overwhelming, watching as Yngve jogged towards the house.

And then I let the darkness of the forest swallow me again. The air was different. Instead of silently watching, I could hear the wind run through the branches of the trees, murmuring and muttering to itself. I knew in my soul that Yngve hadn’t been supposed to come with me. That this wasn’t for him. It was for me, alone.

As the trail of my ancestors spiralled downwards, I paused for a moment to remove my sandals. The path was packed soil and soft moss, and with each step I became aware of who else was travelling with me. Barefoot, like I was, stumbling along the path to the tarn. Fear. Anxiety. Eagerness to please. The emotions filling me weren’t my own, and while there was nothing I could see or even hear, I sensed them. All of them.

Through the ages, just like I had told Yngve, they had walked this path.  My mouth flooded with the taste of iron as the roar of people soared in my ears, my own heartbeat loud as a drum. Twigs and branches reached out for me, touching my shoulders, running mossy fingers through my hair and murmuring in a language that felt familiar but unknown. 

I wanted to stop, or even to put my shoes back on to not feel the memories of millennia, but it was too late. Even slowing down, I felt the rush of the wind pushing at my back, forcing me forward, until the forest opened to reveal the tarn, nestled among bushes and arching trees.

At first it seemed like my foreboding had been nothing but imagination. The sun glittered in the crystal clear water, and I even heard birds twittering in the trees beyond it. A grove of trees dipped their roots and branches into the water, with alder and willows and some I didn’t recognise. I took a few steps closer.

Sharp pain hit me as I stepped on something. I knelt down, and touching the triangular piece of iron—almost embedded into the ground—visions flooded my senses and memories. The sky darkened as if someone had drawn a veil over the sun and hidden both it and the summer sky behind a deathly shroud. The stench of fire filled my nose, and I heard people yelling all around me. They pushed me, rushed past me, and then I saw them. A woman whose hair had gone silver with age, arms tied behind her, and several men with spears tipped with iron forcing her into the lake. They watched as she flailed, stopping her from getting out. And right before she died, this ghostly vision from I don’t know how long ago, locked eyes with me. I know she did, and I could feel that piercing gaze of her ice blue eyes through the time.

I scrambled back, losing contact with the spear tip as I fell. The vision was gone and the sun was again shining brightly above me. Somehow, that didn’t make me feel better, as the colours around me were uncannily saturated. I was pulled to my feet, arms and legs limp like a marionette. One step. Two steps. I couldn’t stop myself from walking to the edge of the pond. Three steps. I tried to pull back, away from this trance, but even the chilly water on my bare legs as I felt mire under my feet did little to bring back control over my limbs. Ahead of me the water roiled and grass floated like hair just beneath the surface, with bone white roots twisting and turning around me.

She rose out of the water, with her hair unkempt around her shoulders and her once blue eyes now a void of water and depth. Skeletal vines wrapped around my ankles and kept me in place, and even closing my eyes the apparition floated nearer. She smelled, surprisingly, not of decaying flesh or death, but of the ancient waters that flowed through the veins of my ancestral lands.

“Iselin.” Her voice was soft, like a wisp of smoke, as she spoke my name and while I knew we didn’t—couldn’t—have a shared language, I understood her perfectly when she continued. “You came here, as you were called.” Wet fingers brushing over my forehead as I trembled in a chill belied by the warm summer sun. “No longer will you only feel. You will see.” Dizzy I felt the taste of iron in my mouth as my heart pounded in my chest, the susurrus of blood filling my ears and drowning out everything else.

When I came back to consciousness, I was laying just outside the forest. At first I thought that I’d just had a weird dream or hallucination … until I realised my feet were wet, my sandals were next to me, and around my neck an iron pendant on a chain. Groaning, I sat up, my head swimming with pain. What had she meant? My fingers traced the front of the pendant, which had a rune of some kind.

A movement in the corner of my eye caught my attention. A woman, strangely familiar. She was wearing a red and white tie-dyed dress with some kind of fringe or something at the bottom. I closed my eyes a moment as the dizziness and pain overcame me, and when I opened them again she was closer. Much closer. My limbs felt heavy and I tried to make sense of what I saw. I recognised her, my cousin. The pattern on the dress wasn’t tie-dyed … it was blood-spattered. She had disappeared when I was twelve. There was no fringe. She was wearing a tattered nightgown, torn and stained. Petrified, I heard myself whimpering as the apparition came closer. She gave me a wan smile, holding out her hand to me.

“I’m glad someone can finally see me. Please. Find me?” She was translucent, with matted hair covered in blood and soil, but she didn’t seem a threat. At least not to me. I trembled as I hesitatingly took her hand, expecting it to be incorporeal. 

It was worse.

A cold shiver rippled over me, from where my fingers touched hers, but I couldn’t pull away as the sensation jittered over my skin and echoed into my mind. I remembered the fight. Her shouting husband. The suitcase with things thrown into it as he grabbed at her wrists, and tears streaming down her cheeks as she fought back. Then, blood. It splattered into the packed clothes, over the crocheted lace bed covers and crumbled papers with official-looking language. Again and again, until the light faded and all the memories were tinged gray, like an old movie. I could see her body on the floor, and somehow knew that the memories were her ghost’s. Her husband wrapped her remains in sheets and plastic, carrying her into the car and driving off. I made note of every landmark, with the location of her unmarked grave burned into my heart. If I could just find that forest, I knew I would find her.
