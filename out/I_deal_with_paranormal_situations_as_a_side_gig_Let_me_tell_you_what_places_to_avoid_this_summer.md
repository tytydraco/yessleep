Okay, let’s get a few questions out of the way.  
  
Number one: Who are you?  
  
My name is Sean Harrington. My given birth name is a closely kept secret. Security risk. I deal with the supernatural. Investigating leads, banishing evil, that kind of shit. Well, technically, I only do it part time. Mostly, I’m a collector. I have a pretty respectable stash of mystery items where I live, things that their previous owners couldn’t explain.   
Occasionally, though, I have to get more active. I hear about something that people just can’t figure out the cause of, I pack my bags and my guns and head out to the site, and I deal with the problem. Usually, whatever it is, it can be brought to a stop by talking the issue out, but if it can’t, I keep a special stash of cadmium-infused bullets on me (1 away from silver on the periodic table, and significantly cheaper). It’s not any less risky than just dealing with animals, and it usually doesn’t conflict with my day job. No, I won’t tell you where I work. Security risk.  
  
Number two: You know about supernatural stuff? Can you introduce me to the secret world like in Harry Potter/Vampire: The Masquerade/Twilight (fuck those books)?  
  
It doesn’t work like that. There’s no one unifying supernatural world government. Most supernatural events are highly localized, and the knowledge of them never spreads beyond the group that initially experienced them. I’ve been in this field for years and I don’t have a clue about 80% of the rules that govern this part of reality. That’s not just a me problem, either.   
You can spend your life studying the wendigos of Alaska and have no idea what to do when a cursed idol from Indonesia starts glowing and speaking in tongues. I once worked with a family who had been forced to pay tribute to an ancient eagle god for 90 years, and they didn’t even know that they lived 100 yards away from the entrance to a burrowful of friendly mole people. Supernatural knowledge is localized, specialized, and typically case-by-case, and anyone who tells you that they have it figured out is trying to sell you something.  
  
Question three: Is there a point to all this?  
  
Picture a public pool. Sun, kids playing, fat old ladiesin inner tubes, popsicles, childhood memories, all sorts of people without a care in the world. Now picture a monster in it.  
You don’t see the monster. No one can, except for a weird haze when the light hits it. It’s not invisible, but it’s colorless to the point of transparency. It can’t leave the water yet, but it’s supple enough to avoid unwanted contact with air or humans.  
Picture a girl swimming in the deep end for the first time. 8 years old, tan skin, blonde, blue-and-pink flowerprint bathing suit. She feels a sharp pain in her leg, like a set of jagged teeth clenching in. Her guardians are momentarily distracted, and her head is underwater. She tries to cry out, but the monster yanks her just deep enough underwater so that it doesn’t look unnatural.   
Picture the little girl being mummified in an instant, her hands like bundles of twigs, her body freezing mid-struggle, her skin like the peel of a sun-dried fruit, her limbs as stiff as matchsticks. Her body is only visible for a fraction of a second before the tan of her skin and the yellow of her hair, then the vibrant pinks and sky blues of her outfit, are sucked out and into the monster, leaving the dead girl as see-through as her killer.  
In a chlorine pool, the body will dissolve enough to be unrecognizable within 48 hours, and the clothes will remain unseen at the bottom until they’re caught by a skimmer or sucked into a pipe. In any other water, the opposite is true.   
Most of the drained color will settle in the monster’s stomach, digesting into a faint inkblot of dark brown. But some of it will swirl and spread throughout its skin, creating an iridescent outline. Now, rather than a faint see-through haze, the monster will appear as a vague blob of shapeless color. Visible, but not enough to draw attention in a crowded pool.   
The next victim is an old man in an inner tube, with dark brown skin, bright green trunks, and steel gray hair. Pulled out of the tube like a rock in the nozzle of a vacuum, flash-mummified, turned transparent. While the neutral colors of his skin and hair are dragged into the stomach of the beast and digested, the color from his swimsuit adds to his killer’s form and definition. Its appendages are distinguishable from its torso now, coiling and writhing in the water.  
At this point, the little girl’s parents have begun to panic, and the lifeguards are searching the pool. The third victim gets just enough of a glimpse of the monster to start fleeing, breaking the surface with a flurry of splashes and yelping before being dragged down and devoured. With that, the monster becomes visible enough that most poolgoers can see at least its general shape, and the lifeguards frantically order everyone to evacuate the water.  
Panic ensues, as the hot, confused crowd stumbles over themselves to obey orders. Most of them will leave the pool area entirely, saved by a mix of mob mentality, primal instincts, and proactive lifeguards. The monster utilizes this chaos to pick off one or two more victims, targeting the slow, disabled, and confused who can’t flee the water as fast as the rest of the crowd.  
This is when I’m called in (you’d be surprised how many businesses have my number in case of “miscellaneous emergency”). I arrive to shell-shocked lifeguards and swimmers huddling as far away from the water as possible, families distraught at the loss of their loved ones, and a monster in the water, mostly if not fully visible by now thanks to the colors of its victims.  
These monsters, if they could stand upright on land, would be at least twice as tall as your average Joe or Joanne, and that’s not counting the long, wormlike necks that hold up their toothless leech-mouths and snaillike eyestalks. Their upper torsos are freakishly humanlike, save for the 3 boneless arms that hold up their starfish-like claws.  
Trailing behind them in lieu of legs are jellyfish-like tentacles which pulse and ripple as they move. The pool emptied of victims, the monsters invariably begin mouthing along the deep end for any hues to be found in the specks of detritus left behind. Chromativores, I call them. Color eaters. Responsible for massacres at 10 different American public pools, reservoirs, and similar institutions since I started this "hobby".  
At the first sign of resistance, the spineless bastards (pun intended) will squeeze through a pipe into the sewers. It’s not actually that hard to track them to the nearest canal, creek, or retention basin. Once I find them, I snare them with a net and hit them with a fishing harpoon that I got off of a Nauruan spider-person. Don’t ask.   
For how dangerous they are, chromativores are easy to kill if you know how. Just pierce their skin on the neck, and they deflate like a balloon. It would be beautiful to watch the colors leak out of them, if I didn’t know who those colors originally belonged to.  
From there, it’s a simple matter of alerting the police. Most police departments have at least one member who’s experienced a monstrous case before, and it’s depressingly easy for them to pin the deaths on a human mass shooter or something of the sort. That’s as far as I go. I just deal with the threats- I’ve never been the type you’d want as a grief counselor.  
  
4) So why are you telling us this?   
  
To warn you, nothing more complex than that, and to get some of the weight of dealing with these fucks off of my shoulders. In the 20 years that I’ve had this “hobby”, chromativore attacks have consistently been my least favorite situation to respond to, and I don’t think they’re going away anytime soon. For the first 16 of those years, I only had to kill 4 chromativores. Since the start of 2020, I’ve had to take out 6.  
The paranoid half of me thinks that this might be a full-scale invasion spurred on by a dark master, like you’d see in a movie, but the rational half has another theory, and I think I like that one less.  
It’s no secret that the planet’s getting warmer, and heat does strange things to the supernatural. As areas get hotter, water becomes more valuable, and species mundane and otherwise travel farther and farther to find the necessities of life. If the earth keeps heating up at this rate, how many more monsters will we have to share our waters with?  
Just don’t swim in public pools, people, at least not the ones near reservoirs and swamps. It’s not worth it.

Sorry to depress you like that. Finding this sub was pretty damn eye-opening, and I’d hate not to share some of my experiences. If anyone has any questions about my hobby, I’d be happy to answer…
