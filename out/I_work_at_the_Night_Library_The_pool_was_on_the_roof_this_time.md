Okay, I’m gonna level with you. Focusing on [current events](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cd37yf/i_work_at_the_night_library_the_coffee_pot_tried/) is just getting a little too fucking heavy. I’m no closer to answers than I was a month ago, none of us can sleep through a full night without waking up shaking and drenched in sweat, and there are some new downright bizarre phenomena cropping up that I just don’t have it in me to allot my energy to at the moment.

So, for today’s installment (and then *also* for the next one) I’m gonna tell you another good ol’ fun-for-the-whole-family pool story. Yep, you heard that right—welcome to our first bonafide two-parter. 

This was quite a while ago. My measure of time is all off by a year now, but I feel fairly confident in chalking it up to post-first pool story, pre-ouija board fiasco—so however long ago that’s been now.

It was a weird, rare night, in that Matt was out. Not an unheard of occurrence, but it’s fairly anomalous, and it certainly puts the rest of us on slightly higher alert.

Obviously, he always tells us to call him at the first sign of some shit going down and to use our best judgment to determine whether it’s serious enough to lock up and head out. Better safe than sorry and all that. The night in question was no exception to the rule.

Overall, though, things were mostly quiet. Alice was in, as was I, as was Wiley. We do a lot of congregating, but we do a lot of work, too, and this night, we were all in our respective areas, doing our respective jobs. 

I was in my not-office mending a finicky Shakespeare anthology, Alice was watching the desk while working on cataloging a truckload of new donations, and Wiley was replacing several lightbulbs that had all decided to call it quits after our most recent power outage (this one due to a flash-flood). 

It was calm to an almost uncharacteristic degree. There was a relatively steady flow of patrons in and out of the building—I could hear Alice greeting them and wishing them a good evening—but as far as anomalous activity, there was none.

It does happen, on rare occasion, that we make it through a full night without any goings on, but there’s almost always at least the odd disembodied voice or two. 

We should’ve known better than to trust a meteor shower.

See, there’s just something about natural anomalies. Not just the ones that knock our power out, either, although those are clearly included. Blizzards, thunderstorms, hail and tornados and earthquakes and all your run-of-the-mill destructive shit, sure. But the things of beauty, too. Rainbows. Eclipses, lunar or solar. And you think full moons hit emergency rooms hard? Try this fucking place.

It was just that a meteor shower wasn’t one we’d dealt with before. Does that mean we shouldn’t have known better? Fuck no. Obviously not. But perhaps our collective greatest fault is that we still have some semblance of hope.

Wiley wanted to look at it from the roof. Kid never fucking wants to do *anything*, and they were set to climb up and camp out alone. I couldn’t *not* entertain such an innocent, youthful whim. 

Our roof access doesn’t have stairs—just a ladder—so Alice couldn’t accompany us, which I felt shitty about, but she assured me it was perfectly fine with her. 

“The world decided I didn’t need functional legs so I could never be peer pressured into leaving the ground,” she quipped. “I’m not into heights. But y’all have fun up there. Somebody needs to be here for the patrons anyway.”

Fair and fair. So Wiley and I gathered up an armful of blankets and one of Matt’s trusty camping lanterns and headed out to scale the building. 

Wiley went up ahead of me. That was my first mistake. 

Really, they aren’t *that* much younger than I am. Maybe four or five years, and I’m too close to thirty for comfort now. But there’s something about them, even as far as they’ve come, that makes it impossible for me not to do everything in my power to protect them. I think Matt feels the same way. Maybe most of us do.

Anyway, that’s why I immediately started cursing myself when they reached the top of the ladder, pulled their way up and over the ledge of the roof, and said, “...Whoa.”

My second mistake was not immediately telling them to turn around and start climbing right the fuck back down. 

I knew *exactly* what that tone of voice meant. But something in me just kicked into hyperdrive and I…had to see it. Whatever it was, I had to see it for myself.

“Don’t move,” I said, and then, “What is it?”

But by that point, I was at the top, too. I hoisted myself over the ledge and was met with…

…Water.

It was everywhere. Extending in every direction. There was no edge in sight—not even a horizon line. Just vast, dark water as far as the eye could see.

“Okay. This is not—let’s go.”

“Yeah,” Wiley agreed, a little breathless.

I’m sure you’ll be downright shocked to learn that, when we turned around, the ladder was gone. 

The edge of the rooftop was, too.

The thing that surprised me, really, was that it wasn’t as though we were standing on some sort of island. We were somehow *in* the water all of a sudden, up to our waists, neither of us having taken a single step. 

“Fucking…shit. Jesus. Adam?”

“We’re fine,” was my default response, because my anxiety override kicks in like a motherfucker as soon as someone else is more openly afraid than I am. “It’s okay, let’s just—let’s think for a second. Maybe it’s just, like, an illusion or something.”

“Okay,” Wiley said. “Maybe we should…try moving?”

“Yeah. Yeah, we’ll bump the ledge and then we can just feel for the ladder. Good idea.”

Wiley and I shared a look, wordlessly nodding to one another, and stepped forward in unison.

Maybe I misspoke before, when I said we weren’t on a platform. It was just that our platform wasn’t *above* the water. Now, though, there was nothing.

It felt, almost, like the stomach-turning sensation of missing a step walking up a staircase. The only difference was that there was no moment-too-late connection. 

We plummeted. 

There wasn’t any difference in temperature beneath the surface, which was, in a way, more disorienting than the water itself. The mental recalibration that typically comes with plunging into a cool lake or, adversely, a heated pool wasn’t allotted an opportunity to take place. It felt, for most intents and purposes, the same as being in the air, just that I couldn’t breathe. 

It was heavy, too. The weightlessness water tends to embody was null; I immediately abandoned everything I’d been carrying, clawing my way upward frantically enough that it would’ve been mortifying, I’m sure, had anyone witnessed it.

Wiley resurfaced at the same moment I did—empty handed as well, I noted—coughing a little but not to the extent that I was worried they were choking. “Next idea?” they asked, pushing their wet hair back from their face, dark, damp lashes obscuring their eyes. 

“Let’s get back on the…” I started, but trailed off when I raised my head.

A couple hundred yards out from us, there was a ship. It was a dark, hulking thing, with tattered sails and something indistinguishable affixed to the bow, glittering and glinting in the moonlight. 

Wiley spun around to face it, drifting back slightly when their gaze landed parallel to mine. “What the *fuck* is that?” they demanded, legs kicking haphazardly beneath the water to keep them in place. 

“Maybe it’s…good,” I said. I knew better than that and I knew Wiley did, too, but I said it anyway. “Maybe someone will help.”

They didn’t even humor me with a response to that bullshit. 

Now, at this point in the story, maybe you’re thinking being suddenly surrounded by water and watching as an ominous ship approached us with absolutely nowhere to go and no way to escape doesn’t feel quite enough like imminent condemnation. To which I say to you: not to worry. Because the next realization we came to was that the platform we’d been standing on previously had suddenly ceased to exist. 

“Shit,” Wiley said. “Shit, shit, shit. Adam.”

“I know,” I said. “It’s fine. We’re fine. We just—we’re gonna—follow me.”

I don’t know. I don’t know *what* the fuck possessed me to swim *toward* the Obvious Death Ship. I guess just that there wasn’t anything else save for open water *anywhere* so it essentially felt like our options were paddle around until we were exhausted and drown or face a quicker, simpler demise. 

“You better have a fucking plan, bro,” Wiley intoned from behind me, which I chivalrously pretended not to hear, because I did not, in fact, have a fucking plan.

The closer we drew to the vessel, the more unbelievably monstrous it appeared to become. It loomed above us, casting a shadow over everything in its direct path, and the sinking in my stomach *almost* convinced me to turn around. Almost.

But then something curled around my ankle. It was slick and strong, and there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that whatever it was could’ve pulled me under and eaten me alive in a fraction of a second. 

Luckily for me, it wasn’t interested. It let go as quickly as it had latched on, almost as though it was simply using me as a handrail to move itself along. Still, though, the knowledge that it was there was all the motivation I needed to push forward ever faster. I didn’t say anything—didn’t want to add more fuel to Wiley’s panicked fire—just picked up my pace and swam up to their side.

“There’s a ladder,” they informed me, raising a hand and pointing toward the back half of the ship. 

Indeed, there was a ladder. It was a tattered, worn thing, comprised of old, fraying rope and rotting, untreated wooden boards, but it looked composed enough that I figured we could likely make it up if we were swift.

“Bet,” I said. “Let’s go.”

 We went. 

Up close, the ladder appeared even shoddier than it had when we’d first seen it. I reached out of the water and wrapped my fingers around the rope at the bottom, giving it a hearty tug. To my slight surprise, it held fast. 

“I think we’re good,” I told Wiley. “I’ll go up first and tell you what I see.”

“Be careful,” they said, but didn’t protest, just backed up enough for me to get the leverage I needed to hoist myself onto the bottom board.

I climbed warily, overly conscious of every creak of the wood bowing beneath my weight, every groan of the fibers of rope under my hands, but made it without incident to the top. 

Once there, I grabbed onto the ship’s edge, lifting my gaze to take in whatever lie before me.

It was…nothing. I mean, it was a ship, obviously. But there wasn’t anything on board. No apparent crew nor cargo nor even a captain manning the helm. Granted, I couldn’t see *perfectly,* but the moon shone brightly enough that I was fairly confident in my observation that the deck was devoid of anything but its own shiplap floor. 

“Hello?” I called, because I wasn’t about to beckon Wiley up if some fucked shit was going to pop out of nowhere the second we made a sound. 

Nothing responded. Nothing moved. The ship rocked gently on the impossible water, as silent and vacant as it had been a moment before.

“Good?” Wiley questioned nervously from below me. 

“Yeah,” I told them, easing myself off the ladder and down into the confines of the vessel. “Come on.”

They did so tenuously but still more swiftly than I had, climbing aboard and landing next to me with a dampened *thunk.* 

We allowed ourselves the briefest of moments to catch our breath, silently rejoicing in the small win that was having found solace from the pool itself. Not that we had any idea what to do or where to go from here, but at the very least, we weren’t drowning.

“Okay,” I said, clearing the unease from my throat. “I don’t know what good trying to steer this thing would do us—there’s nothing but water no matter where we go. But maybe there’s something here somewhere that’ll help us figure out how to get back. So I think we just…start looking around?”

Wiley nodded. “Cool. Split halves, front and back?”

*Nooo, Adam, don’t split up! Never split up!* I know. I can literally *hear* you screaming it at me. And actually, for once in my life, I *considered* that something might be a *horrible* fucking idea before acting on it. 

But then I saw something. 

As I turned back to respond, Wiley’s eyes shimmered, dancing in the moonlight.

They were silver and mercurial, with no pupils or whites in sight.

Whatever had come back up from underwater, it was not my coworker. 

I swallowed, forcing my expression to remain as neutral as I was able and praying whatever was standing in front of me didn’t notice I’d caught on. My entire body was instantaneously covered in chills, in a way that I understood to have the same purpose as a dog’s hackles rising. “Sounds good,” I said. “I’ll take the front.”

I headed in the opposite direction of the thing wearing Wiley’s face (at a pace that I hoped didn’t appear hurried but one that would remove me in a timely manner from the vicinity) and didn’t stop until I’d reached the front of the ship, breathing heavily and attempting to slow my reeling mind.

I didn’t know what to tackle first. I didn’t know where Wiley was, or if they were anywhere—if they were even still *alive.* I didn’t know what my next move should be. I didn’t know what I was looking for or where I might find it. 

It’s rare that I feel utterly hopeless, to the degree that I genuinely contemplate just sitting down and giving up, but in this instance, I thought long and hard about how easy it would be to succumb. I’d let the unthinkable happen. Wiley was gone. No one else had been here with them—there was no one else to blame. Just me. Only me.

…You’ll be glad to know that the self-pity didn’t last long. Embarrassing, honestly.

If I was the only one here, it meant I was the only shot they had at making it out alive. Our version of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ had always been ‘alive until proven dead’ and I wasn’t about to turn my back on the insane streak of luck we’d had up until this point. Not a single one of our lives had been lost, and we’d been in the midst of some absolute shitstorms. There was no reason to believe that right now, tonight, was an outlier. I couldn’t lie down like a sick dog and wonder if Wiley was still out there somewhere, suffering until the bitter, bloody end. I had to find them. By whatever means necessary, as long as it took, I *had* to find them. 

I pushed off the railing before me and spun on my heel, eyes flitting back and forth to assess my options as efficiently as possible, and after a moment, I registered that fitted flush against the large front mast, there was a door.

It was only a sliver, thin and not particularly extraordinary in height, but there was a handle carved roughly into its right side and a set of rust-riddled hinges on its left. 

I took about half a second to weigh my options and then reached for it, curling my fingers around the handle and giving it a generous tug.

The hinges, unsurprisingly, complained, but not loudly and not for long. The door gave way with little resistance, and opened up to my worst fucking nightmare.

A set of stairs, descending into blackness.

I mean, I guess if I’m being fair, my first pool encounter had featured a staircase leading *to* the pool rather than away from it, but I didn’t feel like there could possibly be good news awaiting me below deck of a ship where I’d just encountered a fucking mimic. 

Still, though, there was a niggling insistence in my brain (not [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/118i7iq/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_think_im_finally/) kind, come on) that it was my only lead on finding Wiley if they were, in fact, somewhere on board. So I cast one last glance over my shoulder and stepped into the dark, letting the door fall closed behind me.

It smelled different, instantly, from the open air above. Mustier, which was to be expected, but also almost sweet somehow. I tried, unsuccessfully, to shove my true-crime-podcast-addled brain’s helpful reminder that the scent of human death is said to be sweet into a mental lockbox and put my hand to the wall, easing tentatively down to the second step. 

The visibility wasn’t just low—it was practically zero. If you’ve ever been on a cave tour and had a guide cut the lights and instruct you to lift your hand to your face to demonstrate the complete absence of light, it was nearly that intense. The placing of both feet on each concurrent stair was an arduous, calculated process, but finally, after approximately one (1) century, I reached flat ground. I still couldn’t see, and there was no definitive way to tell whether I was standing on the floor or just a landing without thoroughly feeling out the space around me, so I reluctantly departed from the wall, scooting my feet in small, tentative motions and keeping both arms partially outstretched before me. 

After a (l o n g) moment, I determined that either this was the world’s largest landing or I’d made it all the way down. I had no idea whether I was in a singular, enormous room, or if there were individual cabins, or if I was about to run face-first into the grim fucking reaper.

And then I turned to my left.

There was a light.

It was so, so faint. Flickering. Barely discernible, its warm, gentle glow ever so shyly illuminating the cracks around what appeared to be another closed door.

Being the only visible thing in my line of sight, in any direction, it emitted the aura of both a beacon and an omen.

I headed towards it.

I was about half afraid I was stuck in a horror movie situation where no matter how long I walked it would never grow any closer, but fortunately, that didn’t seem to be the case. I actually gained on it more quickly than I felt I should have for the speed I was moving, but I wasn’t going to complain about reaching the end of the nothingness in commendable time. 

I ran my fingertips along the edge of the door and, sure enough, there was a carved-in handle, just like the last.

It opened just as effortlessly, and yellow candlelight rolled dimly out to greet me, lapping at my waterlogged clothes. 

“Please,” came a quiet, terrified voice from inside the room. “Please don’t. I don’t know what you want, or–or what you *are,* but *please* don’t—”

“...Wiley?”

Rather than calming, the voice’s state of alarm rose to a level bordering on full-blown panic as I took a step into the space. “*Please,”* the voice begged. There wasn’t anyone visible from my current vantage point, but I could hear it clearly enough to feel fairly confident that the person attached to it—the person who either had to be Wiley or yet another duplicate of them—was close. “Why are you *doing* this?”

This *was* a cabin, I thought, or perhaps a study of some sort, with a rotting wooden desk and a decaying leather chair both covered in a flurry of loose, browned book pages and a thick layer of dust. There were candles littering several surfaces, placed in what appeared not to be any intentional manner. Directly to my right, there was a shelf; its back faced me and the odd placement led me to imagine that it may have been employed to block the door at some time. 

It was also, I would have just about bet, the source of the voice. 

I nudged a couple of planks and a broken amber bottle out of the way with the toe of my shoe, rounding the shelf to find a crumpled, bloodied Wiley, restrained to the floor by a thick, coarse rope fixed expertly to a bolted tie and holding their bound hands up to shield their face.

“Jesus fuck,” I said. “What *happened* to you?”

Slowly, they lifted their head. “...Adam?”

Realization dawned on me, and I felt my stomach sink. “Look at me,” I told them. “Look at my eyes.”

They did, their own bloodshot and watery and inherently human, and I watched their shoulders deflate, the defense and terror draining from their form. “There’s someone…something…down here. Or, I guess it still is, anyway. I don’t know where it went, but I don’t wanna be here when it comes back.”

I nodded. “It look like me?”

Wiley nodded back. 

“Yeah, there’s one of you upstairs. Not real sure what we’re supposed to do about them, but one thing at a time. Let’s get you up from there.”

It was a struggle, disentangling Wiley from the heavy, abrasive leads coccooning their body, but we got there eventually, and throughout the entirety of the arduous process they gave me the rundown on how, when we’d parted from the solace of the platform, something had instantaneously latched onto them, dragging them down deeper and deeper until their ears popped and their head felt like it was going to explode. They said they’d been knocked out by the pressure, and that when they’d come to, already tied in place and coughing up lungfuls of water, “I” had been standing over them, wielding a large net hook and no mercy. 

“I knew it wasn’t *you,* obviously,” they said, “but I didn’t know where you actually were or if something had, like. Hijacked your body? I don’t know. Anyway, let’s get the fuck out of here.”

We grabbed a couple of candles (the majority had simply been melted into place atop whatever surface they’d adorned, but there was a small collection fitted into slightly-too-small brass holders) and got the fuck out. 

Being able to see so little in the space around us was almost more disorienting than the pitch darkness I’d been feeling my way through before. It felt as though we were in a fragile, wavering bubble of reality and nothing existed outside of it. 

“Wish I’d been awake coming down here,” Wiley remarked. “Guess I still wouldn’t have seen shit, though.”

“I could…*maybe* get us back upstairs?” I considered, with little to no confidence. “But I don’t really know what good it would do us. Nowhere to go. Maybe we just…look around down here for a bit? See if we can find anything useful?”

“Yeah, okay,” Wiley assented. “But we’ve gotta be quiet. I don’t want that thing to hear us.”

I certainly couldn’t argue with that. 

We wandered hesitantly through the dark, shielding the flames of our candles with cupped palms and praying we wouldn’t misstep. We made it some unsubstantiated quantity of time without incident, but softly, after seconds or minutes or hours, we heard a light rustling from the shadow veiled corridor to our right, and Wiley pulled me into the nearest open room in the opposite direction. 

Flattening our backs to the wall, we listened intently as footsteps echoed faintly behind us, cyclically growing closer and then further away again for several moments before disappearing altogether.

I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding and uncovered my candle, easing the door of the room to a gentle, silent close. The contents of this one were different from that of the last in that there practically *weren’t* any. It wasn’t just that it was tidier; there was a chest shoved against the wall nearest us and a leatherbound book of some sort lying in the center of the floor, but otherwise the space was vacant.

Wiley moved first, crouching next to the journal and lifting it from the ground, a cloud of dust rising in the wake of their breath. I knelt down beside them, offering my candlelight so they could discard theirs and open the cover. 

Beneath which there was a box. 

It was a plain, unadorned wooden rectangle, nestled into the carved-out central pages of the book, and we learned upon extracting it that there was no lock or latch, just a seam indicating the lid’s separation from the body. 

I don’t need to spell the whole situation out for you. There was a key in the box. The key opened, you guessed it: the chest. Inside the chest, there were piles of gold and jewels beyond your wildest imagination. We’re rich now. The end.

Nah, JK. But the key in the box *did* open the chest, in which there was, A) a pair of peeling, pleather driving gloves, and B)...

I felt my heart skip.

A bicycle chain.

I’m not going to get into the nuances of that right now, or maybe ever. But for the purposes of dramatic flair, just know that it was incredibly, pointedly relevant to me, on a level so personal it sucker punched the air straight out of my lungs.

“No,” Wiley said, staggering back a step. “Uh-uh. Nope.”

I put together, then, that the gloves must have been their ticket item. “It’s okay,” I said, on autopilot, because it *was not.* “There’s something—something’s carved into the bottom of this thing.” Pushing past the reaction every fiber of my being had to the sensation of the frigid metal against my skin, I shoved both the chain and the gloves to the side and could scarcely make out a host of crudely scrawled letters in the wavering light of my half-gone candle. 

“What is it?” Wiley asked, making no move to come nearer again.

“*Though your…hand…?* Heart. *Though your heart does pound and knees grow…weak,”* I deciphered slowly, “*Rid yourself by your…* That doesn’t make any sense. Shouldn’t it be *of*? It says ‘*rid yourself* by \*your fear’ and…\*something. *Drain the…clin…* No. *Drink. Drain the drink.”*

“*Rid yourself by your fear and drain the drink,”* Wiley repeated analytically. “The hell does that mean? Is this shit telling us to kill ourselves with the—oh. *Oh. Fuck.”*

I was not following. “...I’m not following,” I said. 

“It is.” Wiley returned to my side, squatting down and nudging me out of the way with their shoulder to peer warily into the trunk. “It’s telling us to kill ourselves, but not *these* selves. We’re supposed to use…\*those…\*to kill our fuckin’ doppelgangers, or whatever they are. That’s how we get rid of the water.”

“Oh,” I echoed. “Fuck.”

We marinated for a moment in silence before Wiley sighed, resigned, and lifted the gloves from the chest, closing their eyes and pulling the fabric snugly over their hands. “Let’s get to work.”
