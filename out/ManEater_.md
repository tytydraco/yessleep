Virat was from a wealthy family. He lived in a scenic and upscale residential area in South Delhi, India. He was 27 yeas old and had no goal in his life. He had no work experience and no love life. He spent all his time watching Netflix or playing video game or partying with his college friends. When AJ one of his college friends told him to come with him to visit his village for a week, Virat agreed. Virat thought it would be fun to experience rural life for a week.

They took a flight from Delhi to Bhubaneswar, capital of Odisha an eastern Indian state on the Bay of Bengal, known for its tribal cultures. They booked a cab from Bhubaneswar and started their journey to the village where AJ was born. AJ's village had a total population of 1,092 peoples. The village was near dense forest.

They reached the village at dusk AJ took Virat to his house which was a mud house(a dwelling made from mud and soil). Virat took some pictures of the surrounding and they ate roti with sabji which was prepared by AJ's family. Then they went to sleep.

During the night Virat couldn't sleep because of the mosquitoes. He was laying on the wooden bed trying his best to sleep when suddenly he heard something that sounded like a roar that was coming from a distance. Weirdly enough he felt really calm and fell asleep while listening to the roars.

The next day Virat told AJ about the roars that he had heard during the night and AJ told him that there were tigers in the nearby jungle. AJ reassured Virat that he had nothing to fear as the entire village was surrounded by solar-powered electric fence to safeguard paddy fields from elephants and other potential intruders. The solar fence operated by generating a mild electric pulse by tapping solar energy. This pulse serves as a deterrent, discouraging elephants and other animals from entering without causing any harm. 

During his second night Virat again couldn't fell asleep due to mosquitoes. Again he heard roars coming from the jungle and this time it was louder and much more soothing. He fell to deep sleep as the roars worked a like lullaby for him.

During his third night Virat was eagerly waiting for the roars and when the roars stared it was not only soothing but to his surprise he found out that he could understand the roars a little bit. Before falling ashleep he understood that the roars are of a young tiger.

During his fourth night Virat fell asleep long before the roars began and woke up after felling a jolt. He found himself at the edge of the village near the solar fence. He felt very weak and somehow made his way back to the village before dawn. The next day He had a high fever and was too weak to get up. AJ sat near him and told him a story.  AJ told Virat that the tiger was a nature sprite that protected the villagers from other tigers when the villagers ventured into the forest to collect essential resources for their daily lives, including food like fruits and vegetables, firewood for cooking, medicinal plants, building materials, and sometimes even to hunt animals for sustenance and in return the villagers had to sacrifice a man every six month. Virat wanted to get up and run away but he felt too weak to do so.

During his fifth night Virat tried to not to fall asleep but as soon as he heard the roars he felt sleepy and couldn't resist falling asleep. When he woke up he found himself on the other side of the solar fence deep within the forest. After some time he heard the roars again but he no longer felt afraid or weak. In fact he couldn't remember why he was so scared of the tiger in the first place. Virat started his journey following the roars and just after the dawn he found himself in front of a cave. As sun appeared in the sky Virat heard the deafening roar of the tiger coming from within the cave. Virat felt like he was born to be the tiger's meal and decide to entered the cave without any fear or worries.
