*October 3, 2024*

I had another nightmare that night—which knocked me straight out of sleep. Waking up in cold sweat with tears running down my face had become a new routine for me ever since moving back here. 

It was the same nightmare every night,. Of that day. It was a month before our high school graduation. It kept repeating like a broken loop. The sun shone brightly, like it was mocking us as we searched for her tirelessly in those woods. 

Nature dared to be beautiful on the day we put her to rest. Everything wasn’t fair. I lost the love of my life, and her parents would have to live on without their daughter.

About Lauren’s parents, they are still around. I talk with them occasionally, they were thrilled when we ran into each other in town and invited me and Penny over for dinner. 

Seventeen years since the last time we saw each other. Yet, they regarded me with as much warmth as if I had never left.

I reckoned that the years have not been kind to them since Lauren died.

It got me wondering if I should really have a talk with them about my ‘guest.’ But I’m not sure how’d they react, or if they’d even believe me.

Speaking of my guest. I tensed as my eyes scanned the surroundings of my bedroom. Usually, she’d be standing in the corner, her pupils shining an eerie red in the darkness, like a predator ready to pounce. But she would do nothing but stare.

No, she was nowhere to be found. I let go of a breath I didn’t know I was holding. The distant hum of the television and a set of voices downstairs caught my attention. My eyes furrowed at the time; 4:01 AM—too early for a Saturday.

Putting on my slippers, I made my way downstairs to the living room, thinking it was Penny watching cartoons. No, instead I found ‘Lauren,’ sitting on the couch, remote resting idly in her hand—if you can call it that anymore.

“Hey, Elliot!" She chirped. "Can you *believe* this? 17 years later and he *still* ain’t the pirate king yet! Total joke, right?” The skin on her chin wiggled as she laughed; it sounded like she was gurgling on blood. She gestured to the TV playing an episode of One Piece.

Her skin was parchment-thin and stretched tight over bone, with long tears where the flesh had split open like old leather, revealing bone and sinew that looked like old dusty threads. Soft cracks would pop from her body—bones grinding against each other, I believe they were still not used to their new state. Veins, blackened and dry, snaked across her deathly pale forearm like dead ivy. Her knuckles were swollen and discolored, joints stiff and corpse-gray. 

I feared what would happen if I didn’t respond. “Y-Yeah, it’s pretty wild,” that was the truth. 

I haven’t watched One Piece in a long time. I lost interest halfway through college. Yet, I still couldn’t believe that it was still going on for *that* long. “What episode are you on?”

“The one with the amazons! You know, when they all get blasted across the sky like pinballs for days? It’s hilarious,” she replied.

I hummed in response. She patted the space next to her on the couch.  Reluctantly, I took a seat.

My eyes would occasionally flick towards her. Even then, I still couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Sometimes I believed that I was stuck in a dream, that I probably got into an accident and I've been stuck in a coma ever since.

“Hey, uh…Lauren?”

She turned towards me. I avoided looking into her eyes.

“Yes, babe?”

I flinched.

I *hated* it when she called me that. Not because of the word, but because hearing it come from her now, like some grotesque echo of the past—it made my skin crawl.

“Well,” I struggled to find my voice. I wasn’t sure how she’d react to my question. “How are you back?”

I needed to know, to understand how this was possible. If she really is the Lauren I once loved.

She stayed silent for what felt like hours. Her eyes unblinking, not an ounce of expression on her face. I tensed—the hairs on the back of my neck slowly stood as I braced. My breath was locked in my throat, as if something held it in a vice.

“I have no freaking clue!” she announced animatedly. I thought I was gonna collapse due to the immense tension that built up for nothing.

“What do you mean?” I questioned further.

“Well, I don’t remember much. All I know is that I was in a different place before all this.”

I quirked an eyebrow, intrigued. What did she mean by that?

“Go on,” I said.

“I was dead, Elliot. Pretty sure I still am,” she gestured to the state of her body. Inhuman, rotted, monstrous. “Memory’s a bit faded since I woke up, but I was somewhere else. I'm having trouble remembering where I was, but it was really warm and cozy. Like, I can’t tell if I’m supposed to be here or not.” 

Her fingers twitched absently—**inside** her skull. I physically recoiled in horror as she casually pushed two rotting fingers through a gap in her scalp, digging into the soft, decayed tissue as if rifling through an old attic box.

“Then months ago, it felt like I woke up after a really long sleep. I was inside that coffin—didn’t really take me long to get out though,” she chuckled. “After that, I felt really hungry. Luckily, I found a deer nearby, and it was great. You’d be surprised how hard it is to get a bite in when your jaw keeps popping out, I wasn’t used to it back then.”

She giggled, the sound wet and crackling. 

“Doesn’t that hurt?”

“Hm?” She looked at me, confused. I pointed at the action she was doing—her hand still embedded in her head.

“Oh, this? No, not really. Nothing hurts anymore. I’m pretty sure all my nerves are rotten, I can’t really feel or taste anything—well, except blood.”

“B-Blood?” It came out more as a whimper than a question.

“Yeah, blood. For some reason, it’s the only thing I can taste.”

If she wasn’t a ghost, what the hell was she then?

A vampire?

I flinched as she ripped her hand from her head, sending pieces of flesh and blood in a gory fashion splattering on the floor.

“Ha! You should see the look on your face!” She threw her head back as she howled with laughter.  “ Don’t worry, it disappears after a minute or two." I wasn’t sure if she was referring to the debris of brain matter on my floor or the gaping hole in her own head.
