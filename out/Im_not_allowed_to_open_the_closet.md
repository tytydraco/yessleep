I'm not allowed to open the closet in my own house, now that might sound strange as hell but I've never actually been allowed to open the closet. For some context, I met a gorgeous woman on a dating sight in 2015 named Lilith.  She was about a year older then me (20) but seemed much younger for her age, she was uptight and often wore sexy red dresses to any night out and her black hair was often waving wildly in the small gusts of wind whenever we would hang out, she was always the optimistic, bubbly angel you would want to be with for the rest of your life. And so, like any sane 19 year old I was head over heals for her.

As the years went by are relationship flourished and after 3 years we got married. I had my own apartment on the outskirts of town and was quite happy there the whole time but then one horrible day my wife struck a question I wish now in hindsight I would deny. 

"So Ben... I've been thinking now that we're lovey dovey stupid couple... You know..." 
She said whilst caressing my shoulder and leaning towards my face for a classic kiss on the cheek.

Smitten and bitter I replied back, "of course anything you want sweetie!"

"Perfect!" She said as she took a step away from me. "Can we live in my house hunny.. it has a beautiful view and a second story- it will be fun living with you!!" 

"Yeah- yeah yeah of course Lilith! We can live in your house together!" I choked eagerly, what else could I have said? After all she is my wife so I continued with her plans and sold my house to move in with her. 

It's been a couple years now and everything's been great, her personality has still been bubbly and full of energy and I had been settled with nicely. But when I moved something strange did happen. But Because of my foolishness I assumed it was not serious or some kind of joke. 
Lilith sat me down on her living room sofa with a unusual disgruntled look, she stared at me and then hastily pointed to the closet in the middle of the hallway. 

"Ben, I need you to listen to me okay? I need to tell you something very important." 
She said some what fearfully. Of course I was expecting the worst... Like she cheated or betrayed me in some form. 

" that closet over there you must never open it under ANY circumstances ok? Also now that you live here you must never leave the bedroom after 12:00 without me? This is very important, do you understand?" 

I bobbed my head up and down a sigh of relive came from my mouth as I stood up and kissed her, I didn't understand fully. I wish I did, but just hearing her say she didn't betray me filled me with relief and briefly I forgot about that rule. 

Around a year passed and I was always quite curious about what she ment. Thinking about it made me shudder as I stared at the closet, I thought...

I stayed up until 11:50 watching TikTok as Lilith drifted to sleep next to me, a while passed and I started to feel a strong thirst in my throat. I remembered lilith really wanted me to not go outside the room after 12:00 but I looked down at her and her dreary eyes were fast asleep, and I didn't want to disturb her dreams. So I pulled the weighted blanket off my legs and set the phone on the mattress. I reached and carefully opened the door making sure it doesn't squeuk and wake up Lily. 

I start trotting towards the hallway and to the kitchen when suddenly I freezed in my tracks, ahead of me peering out from the closet was a grown shadow with Large white bulging eyes that watched me. I was going to try to carefully retreat upstairs and arm myself with clutter on the floor but it suddenly started running like a athlete at me. 

My feet started throbbing at the floor as I heard him behind running unearthly and then apuruptly stop. I used this to run into my bathroom and lock the door and hide under the sink. 

That was 5 minutes ago, my chest is currently throbbing from all the fucking exercises and pure shock mixed with confusion. I called the cops and they said they were on there way. I have been listening behind the door but it's all silence I'm praying for my wife and sanity. I'm currently writing this as it's all happening, my phone is at 20% and my thoughts are looming overwhelming in my head, I'm going to update you on what happens next if I can. I really hope everyone's ok, anyways I'm signing off send prayers please...
