I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. The knock came again—soft, like someone tapping a finger against the doorframe, teasing, testing. I lay there in the dark, too afraid to move, too afraid to close my eyes.

Each knock felt like it was chiseling away at my resolve, each one louder than the last. I was trapped in my own apartment, in my own head. The door wasn’t there, but *something* was.

And it was waiting for me.

I didn’t dare open my eyes, but I could feel it—the presence. The thing from the hallway, standing just beyond the threshold of my mind, lurking in the dark corners of the room. I knew it wasn’t just a figment of my imagination. It wasn’t just the fear talking. It was something else. Something real.

I grabbed my phone, desperate to do *something*. I opened the gallery and found the photo—the last picture I’d taken before running out of the apartment. I stared at the image, my breath catching in my throat.

The door was still there, but that wasn't what made my blood run cold. It was the thing standing just behind it, stretched so unnaturally thin, its limbs too long and jagged, like the twisted branches of a dead tree. Its face—no, *its smile*—was wide and horrifying, the kind of smile that didn't belong to any human being. It was more like a gaping wound.

But what really chilled me to the bone was its eyes—or rather, its *lack* of eyes. Just dark, endless sockets that seemed to pull in all light, all hope.

I blinked, the screen flickering. For just a split second, I thought I saw the thing’s mouth twitch, as if it had moved in the photo.

I scrambled out of bed, ignoring the cold sweat trickling down my spine. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat a warning. The knocking hadn’t stopped. It was louder now, rhythmic, almost *insistent*.

I shoved my phone into my pocket, stumbling toward the door. My mind screamed at me to run, to get out, but I couldn’t move. Every step felt heavier, the air thickening around me like I was walking through tar.

The door.

I could hear it now—the scrape of something dragging against wood. A low, grating sound, like claws on a chalkboard. Something was on the other side.

I *had* to open it.

My hand trembled as I reached for the knob, the cold metal biting into my skin. I turned it slowly, hesitantly, as if doing so too quickly might shatter whatever fragile barrier was holding me together.

The door creaked open.

Darkness spilled into the room.

Not the comforting, familiar dark of my bedroom, but something else. A darkness that felt alive, that seemed to *move* in on me. I stepped back, my breath catching in my throat.

And then I saw it.

The hallway.

That impossible, endless hallway stretching far beyond my apartment’s boundaries. The walls were lined with cracks, some so deep that they seemed to swallow the light. And at the end, at the very farthest point of the hallway, was something.

A figure.

Tall. Thin. Its limbs bent at impossible angles. Its skin was pale, stretched too tight over its bones, like the skin of a corpse left in the sun for too long. Its mouth was wide—too wide—spilling open with that same grotesque, gaping smile.

It stepped forward, its long, spindly legs dragging across the floor.

And then, it whispered.

"**Come closer.**"

I *should* have slammed the door shut. I *should* have turned and run, but I couldn’t. My legs wouldn’t move. My mind was paralyzed, locked in place by the weight of its gaze.

The knocking started again. No, not knocking. Scratching.

From behind me.

I spun around, my eyes wild, searching the room. I could feel it. Something was close. Too close.

There was no one there. But then—

I looked down.

My feet. They were no longer on the floor. No, I wasn’t standing. I was floating, being pulled toward the door. I could feel the tug of the hallway’s darkness, like it was reaching out for me, drawing me in.

The thing in the hallway stepped forward again, its limbs moving like long-forgotten nightmares, dragging itself toward me. The smile stretched wider, if that was even possible.

"**Come. Come and join us.**"

I could feel it now—something was inside my head, pressing against my thoughts, squeezing my mind like a vice. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

The door was wide open now. The hallway was right there, an endless void, stretching forward into oblivion.

And then, as if a switch had been flipped, I felt a jolt. The world around me tilted. My feet hit the ground again, but not where they should have.

I was no longer in my apartment.

I stood in the hallway, the door to my apartment gone. The walls around me seemed to pulse, breathing, shifting, as if the whole space was alive. The whispers filled my ears, louder now, a cacophony of voices that I couldn’t understand but somehow knew were calling to me.

I turned, trying to find my way out, but there was no escape. The hallway stretched endlessly, a labyrinth of shadows and whispers, and the thing was behind me now, its breath like cold wind against my neck.

“**You didn’t leave.**”

I didn’t have the strength to argue, to run. The thing reached out, its fingers stretching impossibly long, and I felt them wrap around my wrist.

"**It’s too late.**"

I felt it pull me deeper into the dark.

And that was when I understood.

The door had never been *just* a door.

It had always been a way in.

And now, I was a part of it.
