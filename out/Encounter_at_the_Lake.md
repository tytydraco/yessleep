My name is Kamesh; I am a police officer. I reside in a small town in south India. I am an inspector to be precise. Ours is a good-sized town; and we do see a fair bit of weird stuff time to time. I oversee a small police station situated towards the outskirts of the town and few small villages and hamlets fall under our station’s jurisdiction. We don’t often get calls from these places, but if we do, it would be about domestic violence and in very rare cases, theft of chicken. So, its all quiet and uneventful most of the time.

But one single incident during my time at the station was truly bizarre. There's  
this small village where the population is roughly five hundred and we got a call from one of the villagers, claiming that for the past few days, three cows went missing. First thing that came to my mind is that probably they wandered off into the fields, but the villager insisted that was not the case. So, I sent two of my constables to check it out. later, I got call from one of the constables, stating that they found nothing out of the ordinary but all the villagers were on high alert and they suspect an outsider to be behind the theft. I ordered them to stay there for two days and report back. After two days, he called and told me that something really weird is taking place and that two more cows have vanished, despite maintaining vigilance. So, the next morning, I got on my Enfield bike and drove to the village. It was 20-minute ride.

 Upon my arrival, the constables took me to an empty house which belongs to the brother of one of the villagers who resides in a city and the constables were provided the place, so I got there and we sat down for tea, and the constables started talking. Sir, something really weird is taking place here, we maintained vigil the whole 24 hours for 2 days but we did not find anyone or anything weird, but on the evening the maid told us that she saw the pistachio near the village lake. Pisachi is a female ghost in Indian folklore. “first, we were sceptical but once we reached the lake, we saw a blue mist hovering on the centre of the lake. There were no rains or any such mist around the lake save for the middle. I chuckled but assured them that we will get to the bottom of this. As night fall arrived, I went near the cow shed and took a look. I was approached by the shepherd. He told me that the cows are being kidnapped by the pisachi. I asked him if he is serious. So, the next day, I was sleeping and was awaken by a screaming noise. I woke up but the constables were fast asleep. 

I got out to check but found no one. But I decided to check out the lake. As I approached the lake, I saw a figure, I was surprised to see someone taking a dip in the dead of the night.

I inched closer and I realised that the lady was not swimming, but hovering in the air!

As I was trying to process the information, it suddenly spotted me. I panicked as it started to hover towards me. I jumped on my bike and sped off. I hastily woke the constables, and made it to the lake with them, only to find a quiet clear lake. I need not explain to the constables as they sensed the fear in my eyes. The very morning, I contacted the main temple of our town and the priest assured me that he would make the issue his top priority. After a week-long ritual held at the village with many offerings made at the lake, the cow theft has finally come to an end. I am not a sceptic when it comes to myths, but after this incident, now I am a strong believer of the spiritual side of the world.
