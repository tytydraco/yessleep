The world has embraced a remarkable level of futurism today, I must say. With just a mobile application, we can accomplish nearly anything remotely. Everything is just a tap away, accessible at our fingertips or with a simple click of a mouse.

I never considered myself a tech enthusiast, but I never encountered any issues with technology. Until that fateful day.

Freshly graduated from college, I eagerly anticipated commencing my career in journalism. I landed a job at one of the newspaper companies in town. While it wasn't renowned, it was better than having no job at all. As part of the recruitment process, I was assigned the task of finding the most captivating news story for the company to publish the following day. Specializing in crime-related news, the company sought out the macabre for its content.

Unfortunately, luck seemed to have abandoned me that day.

To start, the word processing software on my laptop was corrupted, and I couldn't locate the installation CD anywhere.

Frustrating.

Consequently, I had to search the internet for an open-source word processing application and install it hastily.

With time running out at 8 pm, I clicked on the first link that appeared in my search engine, downloaded the software, and promptly installed it. I didn't bother reading any of the information displayed during the installation process.

I mindlessly clicked *"Next," "Next," "Next,"* and finally, *"Done."*

Just as everyone does.

It wasn't until after double-clicking the application's icon to open it that I noticed its name on the splash screen. While waiting for the interface to load, I read the app's name displayed on the screen.

*"God's Finger."*

*"Isn't that an overly dramatic name for a word-processing application?"* I pondered, reaching into my bag to retrieve my camera and recorder, which contained all the data pertaining to the news I intended to propose to the company the next day.

Strangely enough, I extended my hand into the bag but could sense the coldness of the floor in my room. I couldn't grasp my camera or recorder.

Curiosity getting the better of me, I peered inside the bag and let out a distressed scream.

The contents of my bag had been tampered with. It seemed that someone had slit the bottom while I was on the train, possibly attempting to steal whatever I had stored inside. Despite the train being crowded, I had carelessly placed my bag on my back instead of keeping it in front of me.

Frustrated and angry, I slammed my laptop shut. All the intricate details of the news story were stored on my camera and recorder, now lost forever. With no time to search for another news piece to report, I opened my laptop out of sheer stress. I stared at the blank page of the word-processing application for a while before I began typing.

Honestly, I couldn't recall what I typed at that moment.

Whenever I was stressed, I tended to type out random thoughts that crossed my mind. I closed my laptop and went to sleep.

The following day, as I woke up and opened my laptop, I found it still on, displaying the page of the word processing application. I read what I had written the previous night and couldn't help but giggle.

I had written a fictional story about a train accident. Two trains collided with each other, filled with morbid details, including the victims' names, locations, witnesses, and even alleging that the accident had been premeditated based on evidence found by the police. It involved a political element, described down to the smallest details.

It would have been an astounding news story if it had actually happened. Unfortunately, it was purely a product of my imagination.

You know what? Maybe I should consider a career as a novelist rather than a journalist.

As I transferred my laptop and belongings into another backpack, I turned on the TV to check if there were any interesting news reports. Surprisingly, there was one. The news was reporting an actual train accident where two trains had collided with each other.

*"What a coincidence,"* I thought, giving my full attention to the news.

The more I followed the news, the more unsettled I became.

Every detail reported by the news matched exactly what I had randomly typed the night before. It was uncanny, as if the events were playing out exactly as I had described.

EVERY detail was an exact match!

However, not all the details had been revealed yet.

Or perhaps, not yet?

I couldn't comprehend my thoughts at that moment. I immediately rushed to the office and handed over the story I had crafted as a mere rant the previous night, claiming it as my own news report. To my surprise, the company's manager received it with enthusiasm, as no one else in the company had information about the accident at that point.

Before I knew it, all the details I had written on that page were proving to be true, much sooner than I had anticipated.

I may sound crazy, but could it be possible that the application had the power to make whatever was written on it come true?

As absurd as it sounded, I couldn't come up with any other explanation. However, I had one way to test it: by writing another story. This time, it had to be even more bizarre, more macabre. The details needed to describe something that was difficult, or even better, impossible to happen in real life.

What would it be?

As I switched between TV channels, a thought flashed in my mind.

I opened the so-called *God's Finger* word processing application and began writing a story about an extraterrestrial spaceship crashing into one of the biggest military bases on Earth.

The premise itself was already insane and devoid of logic.

Then, I added a few additional details that made it even more outlandish. When I finished, I closed the laptop and went to sleep.

You know, usually, when I tested my theories and they proved to be true, I felt a sense of satisfaction.

But not this time.

The following morning, I switched on my TV, and horror washed over me. The news report stated that an elliptical extraterrestrial spaceship had crashed into one of the biggest military bases on Earth.

No further information was available about the ship or the extent of damage to the military base’s building. The military forces were attempting to gain access to the ship but had not succeeded yet.

I couldn't control myself.

Right after hearing the news, I opened the application and continued writing intricate details about both the spaceship and the military base’s building. When I finished, I closed my laptop and immediately rushed to the newspaper’s office.

Once again, the "news" I had reported garnered immense attention and recognition. In no time, I got promoted. I had a flourishing career, money, attention from girls, and the best part: I received an award!

All thanks to that magical word-processing application!

Every night, I crafted morbid and insane stories to report the next day to my manager. Each story surpassed the previous one in terms of its sheer insanity and morbidity. I started feeling as if the universe was on my side.

Whatever I wrote, it came true, no matter how bizarre.

Everything seemed to be going fine, until one day, my perspective shifted.

The newspaper company I worked for focused on crime, accidents, and strange news. So, naturally, that's what I wrote about: crime, accidents, and strange news.

However, when I wrote about crime and accidents, there had to be victims.

Dead victims. And a lot of them.

That's when I began to ponder. Did that mean I was responsible for killing those victims?

But then, a thought crossed my mind. What if I wrote a positive story? Like worldwide economic improvement or global health advancements? I knew that kind of "news" wouldn't get me anywhere at the office, but at least I could restore some balance. I wrote bad news for the sake of my career and money, and I would write good news for the betterment of the world.

Yes, I truly believed I should.

And so, I did.

I wrote "news" reporting economic improvement, down to the smallest details. All I had to do was wait for it to come true. I waited for a day, but nothing happened. Two days, three days, and still nothing. A week passed, and the "good news" I had written remained unrealized.

Not even a sliver of it came true.

Curiosity got the better of me. I wrote another piece of bad news, reporting a catastrophic airplane crash. Two planes collided in the sky and exploded. I even specified the location to be near my apartment.

Guess what? Less than two hours later, I witnessed two airplanes crashing and exploding right from my apartment balcony.

I wrote good news, and nothing happened even after a week. Yet, when I wrote bad, horrific news, it came true in a matter of hours.

Was the word-processing app playing favorites, only making bad news come true and ignoring the good?

But why?

This app began to consume me, in one way or another. I felt as though I couldn't go a single day without writing another piece of bad news. Something compelled me to write. Was it an unknown force, or was it simply the dark side of my own nature?

Regardless, after nights of contemplation, I made the decision to uninstall the app, for good. I may not have been an angel, but I firmly believed that profiting from making disasters come true was inherently wrong.

And so, there I was, right-clicking on the app's icon on my desktop, and selecting the uninstall option.

To my astonishment, a pop-up appeared on my laptop screen after I selected the uninstall option. At the top of the pop-up, the app's logo, presented in a regular font, displayed the name of the app: *"God's Finger."*

Beneath the app's logo, the following text appeared:

 

*"Are you sure you want to uninstall this app?*

*We strongly believe you didn't read the entire installation agreement when you installed this app. Just like everybody else.*

*Would you like to read it?*

 

*(Read) (No, proceed with uninstallation)"*

 

Given everything I had experienced, I was genuinely curious about the contents of the installation agreement. Thus, I clicked the 'Read' button. Another pop-up appeared on the screen. If it hadn't been for the numerous unsettling encounters with this app over the past few months, I might have assumed that the message in the pop-up was merely a joke. A cruel joke.

I had been through far too much to dismiss it as a joke.

The message in the pop-up taught me a hard lesson: **read attentively before agreeing and proceeding.**

Here is the message that appeared in the pop-up screen:

 

*"Installation Agreement*

*By clicking 'Next,' you agree to this installation agreement.*

*God's Finger is an open-source word office application created by Satan, the ruler of hell. The primary purpose of God's Finger is to facilitate Satan's works. However, it also aids humans who require its services. Some humans enjoy playing God (or playing Satan) by determining the fate of others. They may kill another person for trivial and whimsical reasons.*

*Now, no need to worry! With this app on your devices, you can harm and kill anyone you despise without concern for time and borders. You can even create your own personalized disasters!*

*And the best part? No law enforcement agency would ever be able to trace you.*

*This app is free for humans to install and use. However, there is a cost associated with uninstallation. The payment for this cost will be directly withdrawn from you, similar to a credit card payment.*

*Fear not, we do not take money from you. We have no interest in that. We are interested in your life. Every uninstallation will cost you ten years of your life. Rest assured, we will claim it from you instantaneously after the uninstallation process is completed.*

*Furthermore, the 'uninstallation' includes everything necessary to remove the app from your devices, which means destroying your devices into pieces.*

*If you understand, please proceed with caution.*

 

*(Uninstall) (Cancel)*

 

*P.S.: We are currently developing a mobile app. Soon, you will be able to create your own disasters with just the touch of your finger! Yay!"*
