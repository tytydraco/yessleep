lets start with the beginning right? 
well im a nurse i just got a new job 
in this cute little town

 its a good well known hospital around here
 which im happy about cause my old job sucked big time

 a nusing job is not for the weak hearted
 its a you work yourself to dead kinda job 

ohh well thats what i would describe it as so my first day had a good start new colleagues are great 
patients are not a pain in the ass

 boss is layd back what more 
can a gall ask for right

 well my second day was 
a plot twist i was working the late shift 

with my coworker kim 
kim was fine but 

she was that namaste girl
she is always calm always 

good mannerd always follwing 
the rules kind of girl 

i did not see her most of the shift 
cause she was taking care of room 1

 thats where the patient layed who had cancer he was fighting for his life 

but always stayed positive i 
admire that at most 

I was sitting at the nursing office
 where i was doing some paper work

''flick flick'' the lights turn on and off 
as i stare in to the long empty dark hallway 
across from me 

Weird...?  i thought to myself it 
must of been a electricity problem 

As i continue with my paper work 
a hard slam at the end 

of the hall struck my ears 
i jumed out of my chair and ran 

to the emergency cabin 
that had a flashligt 
hello? hello is somone there ?

 no awnser only the
 heart monitor i hear coming 

from each room 
as i slowly walk up the the hallway
 i flash my light at every room

 i pass by ''Kim stop fooling
 around im too tired for this bullshit'' 

i thought to my self why 
whould kim do this thats not like her at all 
to pull a prank on me 

as i walk to the end of 
the hallway all went cold 

I could hear the cold stillness
 that was haunting the air room 6 

where a patient layed who 
had lungcancer 

was all a sunden having a epilepsy attack 
my second instinct was to help him 

but my eyes coulnt keep off what was 
all around me at the table next to the patient 

was a note wich stated welcome to club 666 
my heart droped and my breath held itself in

 like a sharp knives slowly i hear kim's voice 
getting louder and louder untill 

i hear it clearly anna.. Anna...
 what are you doing? 

the paitient heart is getting weaker 
i have to do a cpr 

Anna for god sakes help me
 as i snap out of it i run to the patient ''Peeeeep''

 time of death 6am 
wtf Anna you better 

give a clear explanation for this or our jobs will be both on the line 

i...i..i just froze i don't know 
what happend ?

afther a long morning 
of my new angry boss screaming at me

 i got send home 
i was still shaking from
 the thing.... that place....

 i mean was it even real 
or was i hallucinating

 i have finally gone mad i thought 
to my self i took a shower and went to bed 

cause i was exhausted
 i woke up around 4 pm 

and had some dinner afther that 
i took my leptop to see my email

 i hope i dont get a mail from
 my angry boss 
shit spoke too soon letssee 

how much damage i have done?
 oh well thats positive?.... 

well i see i still got to keep this job afther all
 but do i really want to

 go back there afther you know... 
all that
