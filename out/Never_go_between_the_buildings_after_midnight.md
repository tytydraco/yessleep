For some background I'm a 18 year old student and live in Eastern Europe, for privacy reasons i won't specify the country... That being said this night at about 1 30am i had to do some homework which i had stupidly forgotten. Before starting it i wanted to go to the corner store for a monster energy drink to get myself thru the night.
When i stepped out of my apartment building the cold winter wind hit me like a brick to the face giving me all the more reason to hurry, i didn't wanna take the main round so i took a shot cut between the apartment blocks.After walking for about five minutes i was happy to finally reach the last corner to the store, i sped up at the thought of a warm store and finally getting my fix of caffeine.


To my dismay when i turned the corner i didn't see the much anticipated store entrance, all i saw was one of the many old playgrounds and another few rows of the soviet era apartments.I have lived here for the better part of the last 5 years and laughed at myself for taking a wrong turn,that laugher stopped  when i turned around to go back only to be met with a cold stone wall in my face , I stood there trying to process what i was seeing ,how could it be i had just came around the that very same direction.The confusion in me was overwhelmed with fear when i heard a screech which sounded like a bad imitation of a human scream no more than 30 meters behind me.
Looking back i saw somethings decrepit shadow starting to peak around one of the corners the buildings ,this was more than enough reason for me to hurry behind the closest car on the road infront my heart pounding as i sit on the ground listening to the thing coming closer to where hid i didn't dare peak.For the first time in my life i prayed god for whatever was approaching to change path. As it drew closer the ground shook at the shere weight of the being, pleads of help started to fill my ears.That fucking thing was trying to speak like a human but its low and distorted tone wasn't fooling me i knew it was trying to bait whoever could hear it to come closer, after what felt like hours but was probably two minutes it begun going the same way it came from judging by its heavy meaty steps and unwavering cries.



I sat there, my mind racing thinking about what i had just crossed paths with, i was scared shitless at the thought of it coming back so i slowly lifted my head over the hood of the old bmw i was cowering behind to take in my surroundings. All was clear and there was no sign of whatever the fuck that thing was, i calmed myself over the next few minutes and assessed everything coming the logical conclusion that i must be going insane, disappearing corners, hellish creatures non of it was making sense,the fact that my surroundings were dead silent didn't help my nerves.I put my hand in my left pocket to grab my phone and upon turning it on i was not surprising to see that there was no signal only further fucking with my head on the reason behind all this.
Staying behind this shity car wasn't helping so i started walking the opposite way that thing went hoping our paths won't cross again.


I wandered between the blocks of apartments hoping to find some familiar place but it was to no avail, in frustration i sat down on a bench near me again trying to see if i had signal,when i opened my phone the time said 1 42 am i knew i had been walking around this fucked place for atleast an hour and there was no way not even a minute has passed.


This place was weird as not a single window was shining with light and there was a complete lack of doors or entrances to any of the buildings if it wasn't for the moon and the dim street lamps i wouldn't be able to see anything. I continued to roam the alleys and roads hoping to find and exit to this god forsaken realm.


At this point more than 24h have passed since i entered this place and my phone battery has long since died not like it was of much use with that stuck clock it had.I don't seem to get hungry or tired here its like the laws in our world don't apply.
I was loosing hope after the countless hours of walking until i saw it, a table in the middle of a grass  path i hadn't seen something like it so i approached it hoping it would help me end this nightmare.
When i reached it i saw a small envelope sitting neatly on it, my curiosity had taken the better of and i opened it only to find a folded piece of paper,unravelling it i saw it was a picture of a man standing next to a table looking at something in his hand. I could feel myself becoming pale as i realised what i was actually looking at, i started shaking while trying to turn around to see what was the maker of this photo.


My blood ran cold as i looked at the massive figure which had to be atleast 4 meters tall i could see its grotesque face smiling with excitement as it lookes right at me with those hollow eyes and shit faced grin, it would have looked funny if it didn't have more rows of teeth than i could count, it screeched as it stormed towards me with spider like movement, my body started moving before i could process the thing coming towards me i was running  with speed i didn't know i was capable of achieving i ran and ran between the blocks as it slowly gained on me and my body was reaching its limits i was to tunnel visioned to see the dark red light eminenting from every window of every building around me. I turned corner after corner trying to shake of the creature my mind blank from fear my heart pumping like never before, i could see the allays getting tighter and tighter to the point i couldn't run anymore and had to squeeze thru to move at all .
Its long bonny hands reached for me only stopping centimetres from my as it couldn't get its massive body to go any further into the small opening, the end in sight i let all the air out of my lungs and squeezed my body with all my remaining strength thru the opening to freedom.


I layed on the ground gasping for air frantically looking back to see the wall slowly closing and the face of the thing burning with rage at it shut completely.With the last bit of strength in my body i turn around to see the shining sign of the corner store entrance as i pass out on the ground.


I wake up after hearing one of the store employees calling out to me in a concerned tone, he asks if im alright and if i need help all i could mutter out was

*what's the time*

*1 43am* he replied 

I lay now on my bed after asking the guy to get me a taxi,thinking about what happened to me i know i can't tell this to my friends and family as they would  just think im loosing my mind but i have to share it to someone every time i close my eyes i can see that damm smile and those fucking endless windows please to whoever reads this post stay at home during the night and never go between the alleys as there might not be a way back....
