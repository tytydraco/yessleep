I wasn’t a typical child. Despite the thousand questions I had growing up, I was too obedient to insist on them. While other kids had their why phases, I, though naturally curious, was content to hear “because I said so.” So I didn’t question the rules and followed them as law. I couldn’t open the window because they said so, and so I didn’t. But the questions I didn’t ask fought with the theories and stories I made up in my mind.

When my younger brother, Luis, entered his "why" phase, I found myself having to explain something I didn’t even know. So I replied with the most plausible theories: to keep mosquitoes out, to stop someone from trying to break in, so no madman would be staring at us through binoculars.

But Luis, since our parents weren’t as strict with him as they were with me, didn’t settle for mere theoretical explanations. He wanted to learn firsthand.
*“What if the house catches fire and we need to jump out the window?”* he once asked our father. *“Can’t we open it then?”*
My father put his spoon down in his bowl of soup and let out a long sigh.
*“You must never open it. Don’t worry about the house catching fire — it won’t.”*
Luis kept insisting, but my father ordered him to finish his soup and go to bed.

Luis’s questions deepened mine, but I didn’t dare ask. If my brother got a harsh word for undesirable behavior, I’d get a slap — or worse.

One day, I went to a sleepover at a friend’s house. I was 14 then; Luis was 10. When I returned the next morning, Luis was acting strange. He didn’t initiate conversation, and answered any questions with one or two words. I remember it was a Sunday, and he spent a long time lying on the laundry room floor. After a lot of insistence on my part, he finally said he was tired but didn’t want to go back to our room alone.

But that night, our mother forced him to sleep there. I told him he didn’t need to worry, because I’d be in the bed beside him. That’s when he really spoke for the first time that day.
*“Can I tell you a secret?”* he whispered.
I nodded.
*“I opened the window yesterday,”* he confessed, looking down at his thighs, slouched in a way that was unusual for him.

My curiosity overcame the fear and obedience I had toward our parents. I leaned in toward my brother, barely able to hide my excitement at uncovering the mystery.
*“What happened?”* I asked — probably too loud and too fast.
He took a while to answer.
*“Nothing really happened. I mean, it did and it didn’t. Because I didn’t see anything, but I felt my heart pounding hard and I got so cold I thought I was going to die...”*
*“That sounds like anxiety,”* I said.
*“But it’s not just that,”* he insisted. *“I think there’s someone... something in here. I think I let it in.”*
*“Let who in?”*
*“I don’t know. But it’s here. It’s in here with us.”*
*“You don’t believe in ghosts, do you?”* I asked, unable to hide my skeptical disappointment.
*“I don’t know. But they whisper when we’re almost asleep. I don’t know what they want. But they’re speaking into my ear.”*

I told Luis to relax, that he was just feeling guilty for disobeying our parents and was making up nightmares in his head. He didn’t believe me, but he laid down, though his eyes stayed wide open. I went to sleep.

But just as I was about to drift off, I heard a whisper — unintelligible. I turned, imagining I’d find Luis standing beside the bed. But I saw his shape on the other side of the room, lying down, motionless.

I told myself I was just scared because of Luis’s fear. I turned to the side and tried to sleep again.

I woke up gasping, choking, desperate for air that was too rough to calm my lungs. I heard the voices again, tangled, incomprehensible. The hairs on my body stood on end.

What if Luis was right? What if something did come in through the window? What if that’s what our parents were trying to keep out?

From that moment on, our childhood became increasingly strange, filled with events that always bordered on the supernatural but still left me unsure. We were constantly hearing things we were in the room, only being able to understand one or two words of the whispering, never enough for anything to make sense. We'd see silhouettes, feel suddenly could in the summer, hear scratching or footsteps... All that could be attributed to our anxious imaginations.

We never told our parents about opening the window. That'd only get us into further trouble. I kept telling Luis that there was nothing *really* hurting us, so we should suck it up and live with it. But sometimes even our parents would comment on how scared we looked, how stressed we were. Still, they'd sound more annoyed them concerned.

Sometimes, when we were too scared to stay in that room, we'd sleep on the living room floor. I'd had to get up before my parents, though, as I was scared they'd be suspicious if they saw us sleeping there. We'd jump on any opportunity to not sleep on that room, and we'd often spend our vacations with our grandparents, mostly to avoid whatever was sleeping with us, but also because our grandparents home didn't have many rules to follow, and we could act our age without getting in trouble.

When Luis was 13 and I was 17, he went to his first sleep over alone and I had to sleep in that room by myself for the first time. I thought I was old enough not to give into anxiety, I thought I had to put on brave face, so I did the opposite of what any resonable person would do: I decided to watch an horror movie by myself in that room.

At first, it was kinda working. I could blame the anxiety on the movie, I could convince myself that our room was just a regular room, no hauntings, no, none of that existed. It was kinda freeing in a way.

Then the window slammed itself open, despite the lock being in place as always. The noise made me recoil, covering my head with my arms. But when I realised what happened, I jumped to the window to close it again. As I was trying to get my breathing steady, my mom opened the door and asked me what the hell I was doing.

"I'm sorry" I said, even more nervous "I dropped my physics book".

That was enough to convice her to leave. I couldn't sleep that night at all. I spent hours pacing around the room, fear and anger growing inside me. It was almost 2AM when I laid down with my phone, watching several guided meditations on youtube, none of which was working. When my eyes began to close I heard the whispering, but this time it was clearer: *her fault ... trapped here ... let me out ... kill her...*

I jumped out of bed, shivering, sweating cold, and started pacing around again. I was convinced I was going to lose my mind that night. But when morning came, I left the room and forced myself to act normal. As normal as I could. I never told anyone what I thought I heard, not even Luis.

Anxiety and fear followed us until we moved out. I still have questions I can’t bring myself to ask. And now, Luis doesn’t ask questions anymore either.

In fact, we never talk about it.
But sometimes I feel like I’m going to lose my mind if I don’t find out what was in that room — and what came in through that window. And most importantly: why it was there in the first place.
