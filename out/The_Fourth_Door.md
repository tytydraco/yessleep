I know this forum is usually used by authors trying out their writing chops on ghost stories, but I just wanted to tell you about the most bizarre, true experience of my life. It had slipped to the back of my mind for many years, but recent events have brought it back to my attention, mainly the disappearance of one of my old friends, whose identity I’m choosing to keep anonymous. I hope that by telling this story, someone will be able to shed some light on the subject.

It started when I was about ten or eleven years old. I was hanging out with two of my friends and we often had to get creative with how we spent our pastime because of how small our town was.  It was October and one of my friends had the great idea of trying out ghost hunting, which for the most part, turned out to be a lot of fun. We built our own little equipment for detecting paranormal activity and would try using it in the woods or just in my backyard. 

I remember that on one particular day, there was a heavy overcast and the wind blew hard on all the trees, which then had been stripped of most of their leaves. We thought it was the perfect weather for ghost hunting, so we decided to be more adventurous. There was an old farmhouse that lay abandoned on the side of a crossroad, untouched for at least twenty years. In school, all of us had heard about this strange place. There were rumors and whispers floating around the playground of the restless spirits that wandered there in the night. Some went so far as to suggest a witch who made a deal with the devil was now living there. An old bully of mine claimed that one time, through the clouded windows, he could see dark figures dancing in the upper rooms. That’s the only time I’ve ever seen him be afraid of anything. Needles to say, the house had become an infamous folk story, one that captured our imaginations and drew us in on that fateful Autumn evening. 

We didn’t have to be careful about sneaking in, since the nearest neighbor was about a mile away. When we entered the house, we were pretty much met with what we expected to see. Most of the furniture was gone, there was graffiti on all the walls, beer cans strewn all about, and there was also a dense smell of mildew that lingered in the air. Usually, we were full of energy when we did these little investigations, but not this time. I think we all felt a sort of heaviness, but I assumed it was just from the mold. We carefully explored each room, making sure we never strayed too from each other. The natural light did little to illuminate the house so we had to mostly rely on our flashlights. 

In one room there was a dirty mattress laying on the floor; probably being used by a squatter. At the time, we were too young to realize how dangerous it would be if a stranger was in the house with us, but we were also too afraid to consider the thought. 

I remember one of my friends (I’ll call him Tom) was particularly unwilling to go upstairs, though he tried very hard to mask his hesitation. When I made my way up those splintery steps it felt like a dumbbell had been placed in my chest. The feeling was only made worse by the damp, moldy air that stained my mouth and nose. There was considerable water damage in the house but none of its ceiling had caved in, so the hallway in which we stood was almost completely dark. There were three doors in this hallway that all had the same flakey, white paint and rusted door knobs. However, our eyes were drawn to the end of the hallway where the fourth door stood, painted in a bright red finish with an black, iron handle instead of a knob. We all began to dare each other to open the door, but none of us were brave enough to go near it. 

We finally decided to play rock paper scissors and Tom lost. He motioned toward the door very slowly, with the beams of his flashlight jittering from his shaky hand. Every step felt like it took a minute but neither of us dared to say anything, as if  the door, or whatever was behind it, had kept us spellbound. When Tom finally put his hand on the doorknob I could tell we were all holding our breaths. What happened next, I still can’t fully explain. 

The piercing silence was broken just as Tom put his hand on the door handle. The entire  house shook with a force that was so strong it made my knees buckle. It sounded like a bomb went off  just above our heads and it was genuinely surprising that the whole house didn’t collapse at that moment. 

The next minute was a blur, as we nearly fell over each other trying to get back down the stairs, and though I probably only imagined it, I could’ve I heard the hastened steps of someone behind us, running barefoot. 

We quickly hopped on our bikes and peddled to my house as fast as we could. I remember that after the shock had worn off, the whole thing actually seemed kind of fun. We finally had a good story about the fabled house that we could tell around the playground. We were the only ones brave enough to actually step inside. We were the only ones who went near that dreaded fourth door. Tom, however, didn’t seem to share our enthusiasm. Even the next day, he seemed pretty shaken. He was the same the day after that, and the day after that. When I asked Tom what was wrong, he said he was having nightmares. It got to the point where he would have to skip school because he was getting so little sleep. The nightmares would go on to plague Tom for all of his high school years. He was eventually diagnosed with Insomnia and started seeing a therapist, which did help a little, but the nightmares never fully went away. He described these dreams as being wildly incoherent and feverish. Every night brought a new kind of horror, but the one thing present in all of his dreams was the door, the red door, the fourth door that stood at the end of that old, lonely hall. 

Before anyone asks, I'm not going to disclose where this house is. I don't want to be responsible for people trespassing or vandalizing. The only reason why I’m sharing this is because Tom has been officially pronounced missing for three weeks. A long time ago, he went to college while my other friend (I’ll call him Evin) and I went to the same trade school. Over time, both of us began to grow apart from Tom, though we still met up every few months to catch up on things. When Tom stopped answering our calls, we thought he was just ghosting us, but then I received a call from a number I didn’t recognize. It was his sister. She asked if I’d seen Tom recently but I told her I hadn’t spoken to him in months. Evin took the whole thing particularly hard, and he’s been doing a lot of digging to try and find out what could’ve happened. Last night, he texted me something odd. Keep in mind, this might just be a twisted joke or the delusion that comes as a consequence of grieving but he sent me a picture of a very strange piece of paper. Evin said he found it back when we were kids at the old farmhouse, but he never showed it to anyone because he didn’t want to fuel Tom's nightmares. If anyone out there knows what language this is, or what it could mean, please let me know.
