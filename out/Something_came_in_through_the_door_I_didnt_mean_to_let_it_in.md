It always starts the same way.

I open my eyes, but nothing else moves. I'm awake, or close enough to believe it— but my chest is pinned down by something heavy and everything is syrupy and thick, like swimming in a vat of wet cement.

Every night, the room looks exactly as it should, except... something’s off.The light from the streetlamp outside doesn’t reach the corners anymore. Shadows hang low like spider webs in an abandoned villa. I can see the hallway from my pillow, and I always wish I couldn’t.

That’s where it waits. 

At first, it’s just a sliver of something— like a pale hand resting on the frame, or a chin dipping just past the corner. Then, the eyes. Two beady, gleaming orbs. Too big. Too round. Too dark. Not like a person’s. Like something trying to pass as one.

They don’t blink.

They just watch.

And the smile— thin, waxy, like it was carved into its face with a scalpel. Not joy. Not malice. Just... intent. The more I notice it, the closer it gets.

I try to scream, to bolt upright, but my body responds like it’s buried under sludge.Every attempt to move is a drowning. Sometimes I can wiggle a toe. That’s all. But even that small flicker feels like salvation. I’ve learned to latch onto it, fight like hell for that little spark of control. Because if I can’t move... it can.

My fiancé says I sleep like a corpse. Quiet. Still. Peaceful. He’s never seen me twitch, never heard me call out, never been woken by a single noise. While he breathes beside me, unaware, I’m screaming in my own skin, trying to claw my way out. And that thing stands just beyond the threshold, watching me sink.

I work as a senior OR nurse. I’m used to control. To sterility. To certainty.The operating room is the most ordered place in the world. 
But lately, even there, things have started... slipping.
It started subtly. A patient under anaesthesia muttered something just before drifting out.

"Don’t let it follow."

It chilled me, but I brushed it off. The drugs, I told myself. That edge-of-consciousness place where minds fire unpredictably. But then she never woke up.

No cardiac event. No stroke. Nothing. Just... gone. Brain dead. Like something took her while she slept. 

Then came the others. One patient coded mid-surgery for no clear reason. We brought him back, but when he woke up, he refused to close his eyes. He screamed anytime the lights dimmed.

"It was watching. It climbed inside. It smiled."

They called it post-operative delirium. But I knew better. Because I’d seen the smile.

Six patients, all under my care. Some died. Some woke up wrong.The most recent one wouldn’t stop sobbing. Said his dreams weren’t his anymore.

That thing—it learned from me. It found a way through.It found our minds open.

Anaesthesia is a door. The body goes limp. The mind goes dim. And in that space between, there’s a crack.

And cracks let things through. 

It doesn’t kill.That’s not what it wants.

It infects.

Last night, I saw it again. The hallway door was wide open. It wasn’t peeking anymore. It was inside the room. Standing at the foot of my bed, tilted slightly sideways, as if trying to understand how to stand like a person. The skin of its face looked wrong in the moonlight—stretched too thin, a mask soaked in milk. Those eyes, those round, glossy buttons, locked on mine, unblinking. I couldn’t move. Not even my toes this time.

I’m losing time. I thought I woke up this morning and brushed my teeth, but I found the toothbrush still dry. I remember setting up my tray in the OR, but everything was still in its packaging.
One of my coworkers asked if I was okay because I zoned out during surgery. She said I was just... staring. Smiling.

I don’t remember smiling.

I don't remember most of today.

I think it’s in me now. Slowly corrupting what’s real. It wants to blur the line until I can’t tell what’s waking and what’s not. 

That’s the game. That’s the torture. You’re not supposed to die. You’re supposed to lose your mind trying to wake up.Every time I blink, I see those eyes just beyond the edge of vision. I close a drawer and find it open again. I hear a voice whispering just behind me, but there’s never anyone there.

Sleep is no longer a relief. Being awake no longer feels safe.
Because I’m not sure I ever am.

Please believe me: don’t trust the waking world.Check your mirrors twice. Look away from dark hallways. And whatever you do—when you feel your limbs go heavy and the air turns thick—don’t look at the corner of your room.

That’s where it begins.

And once it knows you’ve seen it,

It never leaves.
