My old ex I dated for 3 months found me on this app again saying...."glad to see you're still healthy" and then sent 3+ messages I havent opened yet why the hell is he talking to me
I didn't respond to his break up text lol we were long distance and now I blocked him again. he broke up w me through text  and I didnt even read or open it.
We were long distance, and his intense interest in me felt way too good to be true. He supposedly had a tough background and has been working full-time at Delta for the past 2 years. His hobbies included exercising and reading novels. He was been attentive and respectful, but he was love bombing me. He hadnt been with a woman in over 2 years. According to him.... Despite my chaotic household situation, he offered  financial help and talked about visiting me, though I've declined because we hardly knew each other.



He didn't pressure me and always complimented....me showering me in them and offered support. He talked about a future together but respected my boundaries until a certain point. He hated any interaction I had with males especially at my job which i couldnt avoid and would make snide remarks everytime he heard it. video called often, and he enjoyed gifting me things. Even when I declined numerous times. Despite low social media presence, he seemed too perfect, making me anxious about being manipulated
When I told him I didn't want anything sexual, he initially understood but later said I "unintentionally" led him on. Despite knowing I didnt want anything sexual. He didn't  want me to work if we did live together, insisting on providing for me. He ended things via text right after talking about having a child and moving in together. And days before, threw up the gifts he gave me despite me telling him countless times that they weren't necessary. I blocked him after not reading his breakup text. So im not sure the details of what he said. I'm confused about why he reached out again after 1) not hearing from me the first time, I practically ghosted him because I didn't respond to his breakup texts and 2) because it's been months since...ðŸ’€

Now he's found me again,.....how can ensure he won't try again? I already blocked him, though he has managed to figure out where I live, i figured hed get the message after i didnt respond to the breakup text initially  and blocked his number and Instagram. He still seems to be finding forms of communication. Should I be worried, would if he escalates? Does he seem like he would? His behavior is creepy snd unsettling its giving Joe from YOU. Lots of people will brush off my experience and not take it seriously because it may seem miniscule and harmless but things like this need to be watched out for, noted and heard of in case things escalate. Its not unrealistic to think he would/could show up on person and go to more extreme lengths. Also please don't direct me to the police, they half ass their job all the time with cases like this, I already tried and my local department said it wasn't a "top priority case" so I need to be aware that it may not be pursued please advice?
