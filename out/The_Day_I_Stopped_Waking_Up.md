It’s funny how life feels like a series of perfectly synchronized moments, one day blending into the next. That’s how I used to think about my life. Every day was the same, and that was fine with me. I was comfortable in my routine—wake up, get ready for work, head to the office, grab lunch at the same diner, and come home to unwind in front of the TV before falling asleep again. It was simple. Predictable. 

I remember waking up one morning with the same familiar feeling: the warmth of my bed, the smell of coffee brewing in the kitchen, the soft hum of the old refrigerator. I stretched lazily, rubbed my eyes, and glanced at the clock. It was 7:30 AM. I wasn’t late, but I didn’t have much time to waste. I dragged myself out of bed, got ready like I always did, and trudged out of my apartment. The world was its usual blur of gray and steel, people rushing from one place to another. I got into my car and drove to work, stopping at the same red lights, taking the same turns. Nothing was unusual.

The office was just as it always was, a dull expanse of cubicles and fluorescent lighting. I sat at my desk, ran through my emails, and dealt with the same mundane tasks. Everything felt routine. But… something felt off, too, though I couldn’t quite place my finger on it. I tried to shake the feeling, chalking it up to stress. 

Lunchtime came, and I went to the diner just a few blocks away. The waitress, Karen, smiled at me as she set my usual—black coffee and a burger, medium rare. I smiled back and settled into the booth, trying to enjoy the moment of calm. But when I looked around the diner, I noticed that people weren’t looking at me the same way they usually did. They didn’t greet me with their usual warmth. No one waved hello or acknowledged me at all. I brushed it off as nothing. Maybe they were busy.

But the sensation lingered. Something about the air felt thinner, almost suffocating. The diner, despite being full of people, felt strangely empty. I paid for my meal, left a tip, and returned to work, the feeling gnawing at me like a cold ache in the pit of my stomach.

The following days were more of the same—familiar faces, familiar places, but an unsettling silence that seemed to seep into every corner of my life. I started hearing things. A whisper here, a footstep there, something faint, like I was being followed. But every time I turned around, there was nothing. People would brush past me, but I’d catch glimpses of them staring at me, their eyes wide, unblinking, yet empty. It didn’t make sense. *Why did it feel like no one was really looking at me?*

I tried to ignore it. After all, I had a job to do. I couldn’t afford to get caught up in these strange thoughts. But then, one evening, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

I was heading home, just like every other night. The city lights flickered and buzzed as I walked down the sidewalk, and that strange, persistent feeling of being watched crawled up my spine. I glanced around and saw him. A man in a black coat, standing motionless on the corner of the street, holding an umbrella even though there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. He was staring directly at me, his face shadowed under the brim of his hat. 

I felt an odd chill sweep through me, but I didn’t stop walking. I kept moving, pretending not to notice. I reached the next block, but when I looked back, he was gone. I didn’t hear him move, didn’t see him take a step. It was as though he had simply vanished. But it didn’t make sense. Where could he have gone in the split second I looked away?

I didn’t sleep well that night. My mind kept replaying the encounter, the feeling of being watched, the way his presence seemed to linger even after he was gone. The next morning, I got up like I always did, but something was different.

My phone buzzed with a message from Claire, my best friend. She’d texted me the night before, but I didn’t see it until now. 

*“Are you okay? We need to talk.”*

I felt a pang of confusion. Claire and I had just spoken the night before. I’d texted her about work, about a project I was struggling with. I didn’t think there was anything to talk about. 

I replied, *“Yeah, I’m fine. What’s going on?”* 

But she didn’t respond. Not immediately. I thought about calling her, but something stopped me. It wasn’t like Claire to ignore me. 

Later that day, at the office, I noticed something even stranger. I walked by the new guy, Greg, who had joined the team just a week ago. He was sitting at his desk, typing away, but when I walked past, he glanced up at me. And then, he did something that made my blood freeze. 

He didn’t smile. He didn’t wave. He didn’t even greet me. He simply stared, his eyes blank and unblinking, like he had no idea who I was.

I stopped in my tracks, a knot tightening in my stomach. “Hey, Greg,” I said, forcing a smile. “How’s it going?”

His response was… off. “Yeah. You’re Mike, right?” 

I nodded, confused. “Yeah, Mike. You okay?”

He looked at me for a long moment before speaking again. “Yeah. Just fine.”

I continued on, feeling a growing unease. What was going on with him? Why did I feel like I was slipping through the cracks of reality? 

That night, I decided to check my phone again. Claire still hadn’t responded to my text. Instead, I found an unread message. This one was from her, but the time stamp was… strange. 

*“Mike, please, listen. You need to remember. You’ve been dead for months. I’ve been trying to help you move on, but you keep waking up like it’s normal. You’re not alive anymore. Please. Please wake up.”*

I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. I read the message again, my hands trembling. 

I tried calling her, but the line went straight to voicemail. My mind was reeling. Dead? What the hell was she talking about?

The next morning, I woke up again. Same as usual. Coffee brewing. Sunlight filtering through my window. I dragged myself out of bed, but something felt wrong. As I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, something caught my eye. My reflection. It wasn’t quite right. My face seemed hollow, my skin paler than I remembered. My eyes, usually bright, were dull and empty. 

It hit me like a punch to the gut. *I’m not real.* 

I stumbled back from the mirror, heart pounding, my breath coming in sharp gasps. I could feel the weight of my own existence slipping through my fingers like sand. The doorbell rang. 

I opened it, and there she was—Claire. Her face was pale, drawn tight with worry. She reached out and touched my arm, but her touch felt *cold*. 

"Mike... I’ve been trying to tell you," she whispered, her voice shaking. "You never woke up from that night. The accident. You're stuck in a loop."

I tried to speak, but the words caught in my throat. 

“Everyone’s been trying to get you to move on, Mike. But you just keep living, thinking you're alive. You never woke up. You’re dead.”

The weight of her words settled in my chest. My body felt numb, and for the first time, I understood. This life I had been living, this routine, was all a lie. I hadn’t been waking up each morning. I had never woken up. 

I was trapped in a never-ending cycle, pretending to live, when I was already gone.
