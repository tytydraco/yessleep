The summer before we were to set off for college, Beatriz asked us to go with her to take care of some relative's farm during the week of July 27th - August 3rd. Her aunt and uncle were going on vacation to visit the Washington Monument and had asked B to watch the place. Because they had a fairly expansive swathe of land and a herd of cattle, B's aunt and uncle said she could take a few friends to help out. So "a few friends" consisted of myself, Samantha (also called Sam), and Sam's boyfriend Joey (also called Jackass, though that's only in my head). Joey had a smart mouth I longed to rid of a few teeth while Sam was sweet and shy and I have no fucking clue how a twatwaffle like Joey reeled her in. Though we were all the same age, Beatriz was our definite ring-leader. A big sister to Sam, a buffer between Joey and I, my closest friend. She acted as the official "adult" of our group. Like, making reservations at restaurants and shit, she did all that.



Beatriz's aunt and uncle would fund the trip there (a whopping thirteen-hour drive from Seligman, AZ) and pay us each $100. Considering Sam had the best paying job at $8.50 an hour this seemed like an exorbitant amount of money, all to do what we would be doing in our own little dust bowl anyway. Beatriz was giddy, saying we just needed a pack for the trip. "Y'all just be sure to pack some heavy britches too," She laughed in an exaggerated Southern accent, "it's still gonna get colder than a witches titty in a brass brassiere during them Te-jas nights. You'll done freeze yer balls off." I wasn't too worried about that though, as long as I stocked up on cigarettes before we hit the road (the legal purchasing/smoking age was 18 in Arizona) I would be just fine.



\*\*\*



It was decided we would pile into B's shitty little 2010 Ford Focus, the most reliable mode of transportation among us, and head out early in the morning. So, there B and I were at 4:00 AM waiting for Sam and Joey. Both of us were farm kids-- used to waking up early and slogging it out to take care of the chores. As for the other two of our little group, well, early birds they were not. B said to give them a few minutes before blowing their phones up. When I moved to put my bags in the trunk though, B freaked out and ran up to me with her hands waving wildly.



"Nope no no wait wait Conner. Wait."



"What," I said, "You got a dead body in there?" then, quieter "if you need help with disposal, I've got some places I ain't filled yet."



B laughed and seemed embarrassed. Unusual for her. "Nah, man. I just ah- well. Your stuff won't really... fit." She popped the trunk.



Despite her outwardly lackadaisical attitude, Beatriz was a bit of a prepper. Did I mention she was the ring-leader of our group? Well, she was also kinda the mom. Floss sticks, hair bands, phone chargers, Chick-Fil-A sauce packets: all in her purse. You got a headache? B's got a verifiable pharmacy in the second pocket, take your pick of Tylenol (Extra-Strength for Flu), TUMS, Vitamin C gummies, Acetaminophen, Midol, the whole sha-bang. Her car was the exact same. Man, there was a lot of shit in the trunk.



Just what I could see: two blankets, jumper cables, 24-pack of water, umbrella, gas can, several miscellaneous bags of old take-out and two large suitcases. A container of Planter's Peanuts was shoved in the rear corner, though when I shook them there was only the jingle of a fuck-ton of change. Box full of CDs.



"When I said I cleaned my car out I mayyyyyy have just shoved everything into the trunk."



"B, honey," I said. "I love you but what in the actual fuck."



"Hey!" The embarrassment had turned to mock indignation, "Bitch, I've seen your room! You can't say shit when you can't see the floor."



"So you keep a gas can just in your car?" I drawled, eyeing the bright red container with suspicion, wondering if *this* was the reason B didn’t like me smoking in her car.



"Nah, man," B replied. "The roads we're going, people break down all the time 'cause there may not be a gas station for a hundred miles or whatever. Uncle Bobby has a dozen stories of coming across people stranded out on the highway, one guy even died from, like, dehydration or shit. We ain't gonna be one of those sorry bastards, so I... prepared."



I looked her in the eyes and said very seriously, "I appreciate you looking out for us B. Truly, you are saving our lives."



She crossed her arms, trying to look put out but the slight grin on her face undermined it, "Don't you mock me Connor Maddox!"



"Why, I would never."



"You're doing it now!"



"No I ain't. I am a southern gentleman, and I would never dream of treating a lady as such."



"I am saving your lives."



"Course you are B."



"Never mind, I'm leaving your sorry ass right here. Actually, get on in and I'll toss you out on the pavement going sixty."



"Seriously, where I gotta put my bags, B?"



"Back seat, left side dumbass."



As I put my bags in the back, B added, "Uh, I don't want Sam to lose her shit and back out, but I figured you'd wanna know, since you're gonna be in the front." She went over to the dash, "Dad was worried about us goin' so far all on our lonesome and he insisted I bring this." She opened the dash drawer to show a pistol crammed in with old insurance cards and a car manual.



"Jeez-us B, your dad think we're going to war rather than just his brother's house? What about just some fucking pepper spray or a- a pocketknife?"



B shrugged, "He said, like, for gas stations and convenience stores and shit. If some shady fucker comes up to bother any of us, we can say we gotta gun in the car and mean it. It ain't loaded, if it makes you feel better, though I didn't tell dad that," She laughed, "Bullets are in the center console."



Just then, Sam's car pulled in the drive with the headlights blinding both of us. Two silhouettes got out. B put a finger to her lips and closed the dash.



"'Sup fuckers!" Oh joy, Joey. Guess Sam didn't dump his ass the night before. Shame.



"Hi, Joey." B said, much more chipper than my "Hey" that only vaguely covered the "why the fuck are you here?" attitude I permanently felt when Joey was around. B once confided in me she didn't really like Joey either, but Sam did so she put up a saint-like effort to make him feel somewhat welcome.



"Heaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhy guys," Sam said groggily behind him, wrapped in a quilt, jaws cracking in a massive yawn. "I don't mean to rush, but can we get on the road? I'm gonna take like, a six-hour nap."



"Sure," B agreed, "Let's mosey."



\*\*\*



The trip was uneventful. Sam didn't immediately get that nap, as we were jittery with nerves and excitement and chattered non-stop during the beginning. When the conversation petered off B replaced it with blasting music and rolling down the windows to alleviate the stuffy interior. We got outta range of local radio stations pretty quickly, so I was in charge of keeping up a steady rotation of CDs. We stopped four times, though while the group got snacks, bought trinkets, and took a piss, I was sucking down three or four cigarettes hoping to tide myself over until the next stop.



We drove through Wynne at 7:00 PM that same day.



Wynne is a town in Irion County off a desolate FM road that itself is *just* off Highway 67. Considering it a "town" was a bit of a stretch, though, as Wynne only consisted of a community center, three churches, a liquor store, and a helipad (closest ambulance would take an hour-and-a-half to arrive) along one street. It only had a population of 52, didn't have its own zip code (using the zip of Noelke, TX) and wasn't a dot on any map. All-in-all an uninteresting little scrub ball, but it wasn't *our* uninteresting little scrub ball so by default 10/10 better than Seligman. B’s aunt and uncle lived on a stretch of twenty-five acres a little over twenty miles out of Wynne, so it was another 30 minutes before we got to the Martinez's. Their house was very isolated, we only saw about half-a-dozen others on the way there, and they were all set far back onto huge swathes of land of their own.



\*\*\*



We met Beatriz's aunt and uncle: Robert and Maria Martinez; a plump, grinning couple. Mr. Martinez quickly dismissed the whole "Mr. Martinez" business, insisting "call me Mexican Bob!". Joey confidently shook his hand and said "Good to meet you Bob" while Sam meekly waved beside him. I was uncomfortable with the abrupt drop in formality towards what were, essentially, strangers, awkwardly replying "uh, alright... Bob." He slapped my back and laughed heartily before taking us on a tour. He was enthusiastic and gesticulating as he showed us the house  (built in 1962, real maple hardwood, four bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths) and the barn  (sat in the middle of 52 acres, built in 2002, 1750 square feet, Dutch doors on the stalls). Then, he introduced us to the cows: eighteen heifers who all came running to the fence when they saw us walking up, hoping for grapefruit or other goodies. Bob rattled off some of the notable ones: Dolly, Molly, Polly, Holly, Lolly, Jolly -- you get the idea. Though I couldn't really tell you which was which as all the cows were black. Only Holly was pregnant and round as a barrel while Dolly had splotches of white on her face. 



Mr. Martinez-- Bob was very proud of his property, and he ought to have been. The place was beautiful, and the Martinez's had clearly put their heart and soul into the place. It made my chest swell with pride that he trusted us to look after it while they were gone. Despite only having known them for about half an hour, I wanted to show them that they had made a good choice to entrust us with this task. That we weren't some stupid kids who would trash the house, do drugs and abuse the responsibility they were given.



We chatted for a bit longer after the tour. Bob went over the chores that had to be done on the property: cows milked at roughly 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM every day, fed at 8:00 AM. Fill the feed truck with 1,100 lbs feed (or leave the grain silo latch open for about 45 seconds to get the right amount). Check the herd for barbed wire lacerations and other wounds. Holly wasn't expected to pop for another two months, just keep an eye on her. Overall, the routine was one I was familiar with. Though Bob was careful to warn us that there had been a rash of livestock killings in the area all along Highway 67-- they figured a mountain lion had wandered up from Mexico and was enjoying the big, slow pickings livestock provided. He assured us that mountain lions rarely attacked humans, and we should have no trouble. Either way, he cautioned, be aware of our surroundings and if we were really worried, we could carry the fully loaded pump-action shotgun that was kept in the coat closet. Sam and Joey's eyes grew wide as dinner plates when Bob mentioned "6:00AM" and their mouths dropped to the (real maple hardwood) floors at "mountain lion". Additionally, there was their cat, Amari, (a cute little tuxedo who followed at our heels the entire time) who was indoor-outdoor and a good mouser. We just had to be sure the food and water were filled and scoop her litter box every two-three days.



Maria was eager to get going, hauling suitcases to their truck and having to haul her husband, who talked the entire way out the door, by his earlobes. I figured it had been years since she got a vacation. I sympathized. Be it Christmas morning or tornados or the second coming of Jesus-H-Christ, the cows had to be fed. There was not a lot of time for days off.



\*\*\*



The first day was the roughest: Sam got up after hitting "snooze" only twice, her hair doing an excellent job at defying gravity (insert some Wicked reference here, sigh). She woke Joey by flicking him in the forehead, to which he collectively flipped the room the bird and rolled back over. By then B and I had gotten dressed and trodden outside to begin, familiar with this song and dance. The ladies too were used to this old routine of Father Time's, even if Bob and Maria weren't the one's doing it. They were prancing in their stalls, eager for a feed but knowing the milking's got to be done before.



Sam and Joey had joined us shortly afterwards, Joey still in his flannel pants. I was worried Sam, who was the most unfamiliar with the farm-lifestyle, wouldn't even touch the ladies utters. I was silently impressed when she didn't cower and grimly got to work. Beatriz showed her how to position her hands and, later, seeing her hesitantly pulling at Holly's(?) utters, I assured her she wouldn't hurt them and she more confidently started again. Joey, on the other hand, kept his hands in his pockets and refused to touch the old girlies. I quickly lost my patience with him snapping "Joey, the fuck did'ja think we were gonna do here?" Beatriz was quick to smooth things over, suggesting Joey grab a pitchfork and sift out the overnight feces that had accumulated in the bedding. When he wrinkled his nose and refused this too, she suggested breakfast and finally Joey slogged back into the house. I dreaded the burned toast and rubbery eggs that awaited us but was relieved Joey had gone.



Sam was embarrassed, her pale face beet red "Sorry about him... I told him to be on his best behavior but..."



"You don't worry about him Sammy," B waved a hand, "No harm, no foul. He's being useful--"



Barely, I thought, but didn't say.



"--and as long as--



Sam interrupted B, suddenly seeming on the verge of tears and in a rush stammered "He's really nice, he is. To me. And I know he can be an asshole about stuff and I know you guys don't like him and I was hoping him coming along would maybe show that he's not that bad but--" 



Before Sam could continue the heifer, she was tending became agitated, stamping in the pen and bellowing. Even when the animal calmed, no one spoke for a long moment.



"Sam," B said seriously, "all that matters is that you like him. We want you to be happy."



I was quick to agree. The tears had freaked me out. Sam was always quiet and rarely let us know when anything was amiss. I was desperately not wanting her to be upset. "Look, Sam, you're right. I don't like Joey. I kinda have to resist the urge to punch his lights out whenever I'm in his mere presence." Okay Conner, not fucking helping, reel it back "But... B is also right. We want you to be happy. I want you to be happy. And if he makes you happy... well, I guess he can stick around."



"I don't want you guys to resent me," Sam whispered, "for... for bringing him around."



B earnestly, "Sammy, we would never."



Trying to lighten the situation, I added, "Sam, you're the angel outta this whole fucking group of sinners. We wouldn't ever grudge you for anything. Just... if he does ever hurt you in anyway, even if he just buys spicy mustard rather than normal fucking mustard and it pisses you off, you let me know. And I will kick his ball into his throat."



It was poor work, a stale and unimaginative attempt at a joke, but it worked. Sam laughed.



\*\*\*



On the evening of July 29th, the second day, was when we should have packed up our shit and run like Donkey Kong. Hindsight's a bitch, huh? Dolly had very quickly become Sam's favorite. She was the first at the fence not only wanting feed, but also pets. She'd nudge her head against your hand wanting more attention, like Amarai, if only two-hundred times bigger. She even followed Sam along the row when she didn't have anything to eat. All of that's to say, Sam had gotten comfortable quickly on the property. I guess it was the big fluorescent lights that lit up the distance between the house and barn and our unconcerned attitude that made her willing to go out around the house and barn at night alone. After the evening milking and feed had been finished, Sam had stayed a few minutes after, patting Dolly on the head as she munched.



When we heard the crazed bellowing of an entire herd in a panic all the way from the house, we all sprinted to the barn.



Inside was an absolute circus. The cows were stamping and kicking up dust in their stalls. In the middle of the chaos was Sam, it was so loud in there I couldn't hear her, but I could see she was crying. I tried to ask what happened, but Sam yelled:



"There's something outside!" She said, "It-- it freaked them all out and it sounded big. Was it the mountain lion? Is it here? And we don't have the gun! None of you brought the shotgun?" She sounded hysterical, "Oh God, we gotta-- we gotta--."



Joey shook her gently, trying to get her to focus back to the moment, "Sam, Sam, we didn't see or hear anything."



"Nothing?" She sobbed, "*Nothing*? It was going *BAM BAM BAM* against the paneling and growling." She smacked her hand against the barn door for emphasis, which got the cows in another tizzy. "It was scratching, trying to get in."



"It was probably a coyote, a couple of them runnin' around." B said gently.



"Are you sure?"



"Positive."



We went back to the house, Sam insisted on all of us holding hands and sprinting across the yard. I was the last one to go inside, but when I turned around and looked into the darkness that's all I saw. Darkness.



For Sam's peace of mind, it was decided we would carry the shotgun whenever we went outside. I thought this was a bit ridiculous, I genuinely didn’t think we of all people would be the one’s accosted by the “mountain lion” prancing around, but I went along with it. Afterall, what could it hurt? Besides anything that messed with us, I guess.



Sam didn't go out alone, again.
