In the depths of darkness, where fear takes hold and the mind plays tricks, there exists a tale of a chilling encounter that would haunt even the bravest of souls and an experience that would shatter the psyche of any mortal. That tale was my own, I share it with you now having spent countless hours reading the same tales in this forum and hope someone will be able to help. My name is Adam and have lived in Cental Arkansas pretty much my whole life. I feel no need to change this information rather if you don’t hear from me again then I guess you could call this my last testament. This took place almost a month ago to the day, I had just gotten home from spending some time with my little brother and my nephew. I had always believed in the paranormal as well as being deeply spiritual, having studied every kind of spiritual teaching I could from all parts of the world. Though I had never experienced anything to this magnitude.
 
 I have stayed with my grandmother ever since my grandfather and uncle both passed away. I know some people have mixed thoughts about that, but I couldn’t care less. I pulled in front of the house and got out. My grandmothers minivan sitting under the awning where it always sits. Walking up to the door was the first time I got the feeling something wasn’t right. There were no lights on inside, normally at least the living room is lit up with my grandmother sitting in her chair watching T.V. Maybe she was in the shower, I thought as I made my way inside. As soon as I stepped inside that thought was pushed to the very back of my mind. Every light was off, it was cold but not just a chill. This is the kind of cold you only find in desolate, empty, and dangerous places. A cold I had never felt before and hope never to again.  Alone in the house, I ascended the stairs, unaware of the terror that awaited. As I reached the top, my heart skipped a beat, at the end of the hall, stood a towering figure, cloaked in shadow. Frozen in place, my mind raced, unable to understand the sight before me.
 
You have no idea the amount of fear that grabs ahold of you being alone experiencing something unknown that you have no way of comprehending. The shadow figure, with an eerie grace, began to move closer, its form becoming clearer with each step. Panic gripped me tightly, my fight or flight nonexistent. What in the actual fuck, like seriously. All I could do was stand there, paralyzed, as a fear I have never known coursed through my being, threatening to consume my sanity. A bone-chilling whisper filled the air, echoing through the desolate house. The voice seemed to emanate from the depths of the shadow figure itself, weaving its way into my mind with sinister intent. Its words were incomprehensible, a twisted mélange of ancient tongues, clicks, and hissing that sent shivers down my spine. As the figure drew nearer, its features slowly materialized, revealing a gaunt and twisted visage. Its eyes, devoid of any humanity, gleamed an icy shade of blue, piercing through the darkness with an otherworldly glow. Jagged, elongated fingers extended from its spindly limbs, reaching out for me longingly.

An almost visible aura surrounded the figure, exuding a malefic energy that corrupted the very air I struggled to breathe. It was as if the very essence of evil had taken form, its presence suffusing the environment, suffocating any hope that remained. I desperately longed to escape, to flee from this nightmare, but my body remained rooted to the spot, as if bound by an unseen force. Fuck this, this can't be real I thought, I know this shit happens but not someone like me. 

All  thought abandoned me, replaced by a primal instinct to survive. I pleaded universe, to any divine entity that would listen, praying for deliverance from this unspeakable horror. But my pleas fell on deaf ears as the figure closed in, suddenly silence was deafeningly loud in my ears.

A gust of wind swept across the hallway, slamming the still open front door, extinguishing the feeble light that had permeated the area. Darkness cradled me, wrapping around my body like a tangible entity. In the abyss, I could sense the figure's impending presence, its loathsome breath brushing against my face, as I tried to shrink in on myself. I am fucked its over.Time ceased to have meaning as the figure finally stood before me, I could feel its gaze bore into my very soul, devouring any remnants of courage or hope that remained. The air grew heavy with anticipation, as if the world itself held its breath, waiting for the impending doom that hung in the balance.

With a chilling whisper, the figure finally spoke, its voice a haunting symphony of despair but also something else I couldn’t place at the time. "I'm truly sorry for what you will experience," it hissed, with nothing but sincerity and understanding on its ghastly countenance as if it felt bad about whatever was in store for me. Just as soon as I was sure this lifetime was over for me, it was gone. Literally one second I'm looking right into its eyes and the next nothing. All the lights are on, there's sound coming from the t.v. in the living room. What do you want for supper my grandmother called. Obviously she hadn't experienced anything similar to what I had. Ok it owned a consciousness, and not just the evil of an unknown world that I first imagined. Questions raced through my mind, but answers eluded them. What was this entity? A spirit? A demon? Something far more sinister from the depths of a Lovecraftian nightmare? 

Was it even real? Did I truly see such a terrifying apparition? Doubt gnawed at my sanity, but the lingering fear in my heart spoke volumes. I was not alone in the house; something supernatural had crossed my path. With no plan in place, I grappled with the overwhelming uncertainty of how to protect myself from an entity so enigmatic and powerful. The fear of the unknown gripped me tightly, I felt vulnerable and exposed. In the aftermath of this haunting encounter, I was changed. The memory of that shadow figure continues to haunt my thoughts, a constant reminder of the existence of forces beyond comprehension.
 For in the realm of the supernatural, where shadows dance and nightmares take form, the line between reality and the unknown blurs. And in the face of such horrors, all one can do is confront their fears, seek solace in the light, and hope to never again be left alone with the terrors that lurk in the darkness. If only I could be so lucky. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Does anyone have any ideas and what did it mean? Help Please? I don’t know how I know, if it's some divine intuition or a gift of foresight but I know that it will be back. I've been feeling that otherworldly cold at odd times, i nearly gag and dry heave from the anxiety it's never for very long but it's becoming more frequent. It won't be long, I've been salting my home and property. I've been using holy water, had it blessed, even had a native American shaman come to do a ritual. He told me there is nothing that he can do, somethings are to tightly wound in destiny's grasp. That's all he would tell me, like what kind of cryptic shit is that?
