idk if this section is for creepy pastas or real shit but this is real shit.  


So ive been looking for actual advice on this, as the internet just suggest sleep demons are a hallucination. This we know is false demons are real but I need help with the dream I guess? I need any info I can get.  
So here's what happened, a sleep demon a lady slender and sickly looking in a white dress with black hair show up half way threw a semi normal dream and she attempts to.. I don't know paralyze me?  
and at first it works and I'm filled with horror (but here's the thing I'm an army vet specialized in recon aka LRS and gorilla warfare as well as a top of my class high threat private contractor. I say this because fear and me go way back). but while I'm sitting there heart pounding eyes wild... I kind of loved it, I was so exhilarated it felt like I finally had an enemy worth persuading.  
  
Yes I'm a merc but I'm a soldier of god I never take any jobs for rich F\*\*\*\*ers, I primarily focus on slavery and sex traffickers, you know the real bad guys. Now I should mention that I've been training since I was 10 a poor kid in foster care I decided to dedicate my life to hunting evil so to speak. So when I say I "finally found an enemy worth perusing" it was like it all clicked I was going to destroy this demon!  
  
After the first time I get mad/happy idk, pissed that she would dare try this on me but thrilled to hunt, and I started to wiggle toes and fingers and finally stood up, I started to look for her and found her in another part of the house and ran up and started yelling at her, she jumps and attacks me I freeze and fall to the ground. Now I'm really mad I don't even need to wiggles I just wake up and stand up (in my dream still) and I'm in some dorm for a collage and I can hear her up stairs like this resonating noise and I mad dash to her up the stair threw the hall, I find the door and kick it open and she is on top of some one else. So I attack her, bolt strait for her and dive for her... she drops me again.  
  
I wake up same place (in the same room) and she's now in a different part of the dorms so I pursue her and follow the noise but now its like I could idk sense her or something and I'm on her like white on rice, blast threw the door and she's attacking some one else on all fours hunched over another person so I go to attack her and she drops me yet again, But this time I saw fear I saw her flinch and now its F\*\*\*\*ing game on, I wake up in an apartment complex and I hear the noise I know at this point I'm full on hunting her and I'm LOVING IT!. This is going to sound weird but it was this primal predator to pry response I know she was evil and I know I was going to destroy her, over an over we did this for hrs. and I got closer and closer to whooping her ass, several different places 20 or 30 different people in there rooms and I gaining on her ass.  
  
I could tell she was losing her mind because she put me down and waited and when I woke up she screamed in my face and put me down again she did this three times while I'm just wildly grinning at her, I can tell she knows I'm going to rip her apart. I wake up again in a condo building idk how I know I just do, but I'm mad dashing to her screaming and I know she hears me. I get into the room (again over some one) and she try's to get away. I grab her, we fight and smash into stuff around the room as she's on me trying to put me down and I'm not budging, we break threw a wardrobe and I see her scurry as I'm dropped one last time.  
  
Then I wake up in my room totally normal with this overwhelming sense of happiness and pride. I pray all the time and tell god ill fight demon in his great army for all of eternity if he will have me. And this felt like I got my chance to idk "try out" lol put in a resume so to speak. my dreams have been weird since, but nothing as clear and vivid as the first.  
  
My buddy and his mom (others who know demons exist) think that I attached my self to her going dream to dream saving people and while I whole heartedly feel this is true I just want to know some other opinions. Now I find my self hoping her or another tries again, I know now that I'm equip and ready to fight them I might sound weird but I feels like I'm supposed to, saying god and Jesus name did almost nothing but make it wench. Any suggestions, What do yall think?
