There’s a doll in my closet, and I don’t know what to do with it.

I moved with my parents to this small, old farm house only a day ago. I can’t say I wanted to move, in fact I highly protested against it. Going from the big city to a small town of a little under five hundred people and one school? It was cliche, but also as much of a drag as you’d figure it was.

Annoyed, I agreed to make the most of the move as long as I got the biggest space in the home: the attic.

In terms of space, and storage, I couldn’t have asked for anywhere better. It was like my own mini-apartment, large with enough room to have my own little “apartment” set up. I wasted no time unpacking everything, and making myself at home.

It was fine until I opened the closet. It wasn’t a big closet, just small enough to be inconspicuous. But not big enough for me to fit myself, or many of my belongings in there. But I found it had a resident of its own quite quickly.

To my surprise, it wasn’t dirty or old. In fact, it looked brand new: a little girl with two blonde pigtails and a painted on smile. She looked brightly up at me and seemed harmless enough that I told myself we would have to get a hold of the previous owners to see if their daughter had lost a toy.

But of course, moving is hectic, and by the time I put myself down to bed for the night I’d all but forgotten about it. Until the scratching started. It was quiet at first, but the louder it became, the more disturbed I was. My first and most logical fear, of course, was rats. But in the darkness of the room I quietly notated that I could see none of the small buggers around.

I’d been sitting up in bed a full minute when the giggling started. It was low at first, but as I sat petrified I could hear it becoming louder. More defined. It sounded like a small child, or at least it did at first. The louder it became, the deeper and raspier it did too.

I could tell it was coming from the closet.

Assuming a faulty doll was the culprit, I threw it open groggily. But as I peered inside… I found nothing. No doll. No sign it had ever been there. As the giggling continued my eyes turned to notice five long scratches along the door that sent a shiver down my spine.

This morning, I tried to tell my parents - tried to make any sense of it. But their answer stumps and terrifies me:

“Jacob, the attic doesn’t have a closet.”

Tonight, I sit on my bed staring at the closet door only I seem to see. As it creeks open, and the giggling begins, there’s nothing sweet or innocent about it.
