I've not slept in 3 days, and something is waiting for me...

It all started May 8th when I got home, I felt something was off so I went to check if everything was alright, spoiler, it wasn't. All the lights were on (I need to mention I was coming back from work and I was *sure* I'd turned everything off) and it clearly freaked me out because I live alone and I had previously double-checked if everything was off before heading to work.

I chose to ignore it, I figured it must be some electrical problem so I decided to hop on my bed to watch some Netflix series (highly recommend The Flash - if you like the comics you'll love it) and didn't think much of it. 

Hours passed, 0:21 AM, footsteps downstairs (my house has two floors, this will be important later) so clearly I didn't go down (horror movie characters are stupid, bleh, obviously, I thought I was getting robbed so it wasn't safe to go down).

I turned off my room’s lights and stayed silent. Some minutes had passed and I figured I'd go down. As I was heading down the stairs, I heard something fall downstairs. I ran back to my room, locked the door as quick as possible but nothing came, so I just sat there quietly with my phone for a while.

# MAY 9TH

I went to work unrested and had the worst fucking day of my life, I felt like something was watching me, even the air in my own house felt strange, dense. I associated it with the sleep deprivation and ignored the fact I felt something behind me, watching every move I did.

At night, I got up to sleep, tired and destroyed... but it didn't end there. When I was getting my bed ready to sleep I felt how something opened my room's door and got the lights on, I shut the door as fast as I could and stayed up watching some Netflix (again, but I needed to stay awake). Time passed by and I needed to grab an energy drink, I was thirsty as fuck and I needed some energy to stay up. 

That's when I saw it, meanwhile I was heading down I saw IT, the thing that had been watching me all day, the one that hasn’t let me rest since the day before and the one that has messed up my sleep. IT was black, pure black, it didn't have a mouth or a nose but somehow I could notice his expression. At least it had eyes with a big black iris that gave me chills. Its gaze was fixated on me, like it could see through me (but that's impossible, isn't it?). I ran back as fast as I could again, scared, it didn't even try to get me, it knew I would eventually come down in the night... 

# MAY 10TH

Today I called in sick to work and I've been up all day with zero rest, it's almost 7pm but i've kept my room's windows closed (The sunlight is hurting me due to my lack of sleep). The last time I got out of my room I couldn't believe it, there was something covering all the first floor, it seemed to be dark, as if it were the middle of the night. I know it is waiting for me, it wants me to come down, it wants to end me.

But why?, why me? I've been a good person my whole life, I work from 12pm to 8pm (I work in a 24/7 retail store) and I haven't done anything bad to anyone, so... why?

I'll give an update tomorrow, I want to rest, so i'll try to sleep now :) (If i don't post anything from now expect the worst, i'm probably dead).

Oh, and I got this pic to get y'all to have an idea of what I saw that night: [https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fcreepy%2Fcomments%2F18tfohw%2Fis\_there\_a\_bracken\_in\_my\_house%2F&psig=AOvVaw0-adkAwnhqLqcUHktU4PVZ&ust=1747004792330000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKjC7ZOCmo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fcreepy%2Fcomments%2F18tfohw%2Fis_there_a_bracken_in_my_house%2F&psig=AOvVaw0-adkAwnhqLqcUHktU4PVZ&ust=1747004792330000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKjC7ZOCmo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ)
