Living in the southwest, I’ve never batted an eye at triple digit temperatures during the summer months. It’s hot and it’s sticky and it’s annoying, but it could be worse. At least it’s not humid.

My parents are well-off enough to own a pool in the backyard. It’s not the most extravagant thing ever, but it’s cool and it’s free. I spent a lot of my summer days, even after I’d moved out, in that pool. My parents both worked boring office jobs that kept them inside for the summer, so I’d have the pool to myself most days. I had a key to get in, so I’d drive the short distance from my apartment to my childhood home to go swimming. 

Summer nights were a bit different. I’d spend most of those nights wrapped up on my couch playing video games or watching TV. I was a total homebody. 

Early into June, I was already beginning to get bored with my evenings. I had to stop going to my parents’ pool for a while due to some "odd seismic activity" that led the city to post on Facebook that any basements or in-ground structures would be considered dangerous until the activity had stopped. I’d been spending all of my days as I had spent my nights—alone in my apartment. I wanted to mix things up, even if just for one night. It was with this thought that I doom-scrolled on Instagram. It was the usual stuff. Reels that the OPs would never live down, posts seeking to remind my gay ass about Pride Month, and what have you. I think it was between the twenty minute mark and six hour mark that I came across an ad.

"Beat the Heat! 24 Hour Swimming Pool Now Open in [REDACTED], NM!"

This piqued my interest. I could do what I did during the day but at night instead? Hell yeah! 

When it began to get real dark, around 9:30 or so, I put on some swim trunks and an old tropical patterned shirt I had laying around and went to the address on the ad. I was hoping it wouldn’t be too crowded. I consider myself decently sociable, but I’m an introvert at heart.

I didn’t make it there until about 11 PM. I ended up getting a bite and driving around for a little bit to really ensure it wouldn’t be too busy when I got there. Although it could be kind of ominous at times, I did love a good drive around my small town. Everything outside is pure, barren New Mexico wasteland, but I think it’s pretty nice.

When I got to the pool, I awkwardly got out of my car and surveyed my surroundings. It looked almost like somebody had cut the pool out of some hot California motel in the 60s and put it into 2025. There was only a small building that I assumed was some sort of office or snack bar that had a bright neon sign that said "24-Hour Pool". It was only at this point that I realized it was weird the pool didn’t actually have a real name. I didn’t let that bother me too much as I opened the gate, which was only up to my waist in height. The fence was almost disturbingly short.

I found an empty chair and set my bag down. There was no pay to enter. Anybody could waltz right in, which made the whole thing just a bit more unnerving. 

There was a woman of about thirty with her mid-teens kid there, a lifeguard who looked just a bit miserable, and some awkward looking middle aged guy. I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only one not in the water. Even the lifeguard’s station was partially submerged. 

For some reason, my gut was telling me not to get in the water. The color changing lights were alluring, sure, but something was telling me I really didn’t want to get in.

So I sat awkwardly.

Over the course of the next half an hour, people started to pile in. All sorts. As the volume of people began to increase, so to did my weird feeling about the place. Nobody was saying a word. They all just got in the pool and swam, like they were hypnotized by the lights. At this point, I was just staying to people watch.

As midnight drew closer, the lifeguard began to check her watch more frequently. At about 11:50, she finally looked up at me.

"Why don’t you come on in, dude? The water is nice!" she asked.

I came up with an excuse quick. "Oh, you know, the seismic shit they were talkin' about. I think better safe than sorry. I’m just here to do some people watchin'."

"Awww, that’s a bunch of bullcrap. Come on in!" she responded.

"I really think I’m good—"

"Come on in, Beau! The water is so warm!"

I paused. I’d never seen this girl before in my life, so how did she know my name? "How the fuck do you know who I—"

"Beau, come onnnn! Just come swim with us!" she begged. "You haven’t even LIVED until you’ve gotten in."

There was something that felt almost pre-programmed about her pleas. Like one of those Build-a-Bears that talks when you squeeze its paw. 

I decided that it was time to go home. "Yeah, no, I’m out," I said as I stood up and grabbed my bag. She had now defaulted to just repeating "Beau, come on in!" like the refrain of a song. I just smiled politely as I opened the gate and got in my car. 

I felt the ground shake a little as I began to reverse. Not in the car moving over loose gravel way, but in the ground is having a fucking fit way.

I pulled out of the parking lot and began my drive back home. The ground kept shaking more aggressively. I looked in my rear view mirror as I drove.

With a roar from the ground, I watched as some giant, serpentine or earthworm… thing emerged from the ground around the pool. I only got to see a portion of it, but its head rose probably a hundred feet in the air as it swallowed the pool and everyone in it whole. It retreated back into the chasm its appearance had created, and everything was gone. No pool, no building behind the pool, not even a parking lot. Everyone within that fence and their cars were just gone. 

I didn’t want to wait for it to come out from under the road and eat me, too. I sped until I reached my apartment complex. I’d never been more thankful that the town wasn’t big enough to have many patrollers at night.

I raced up into my apartment laughing and crying at the terror and absurdity of my night. I violently, madly tore out of my swim trunks and shirt and ran straight to bed as soon as I got inside.

I know other people tend to have trouble sleeping after traumatic experiences, but it wasn’t the case for me, not this time. I slept like I was in a coma. 

I woke up like I did every other summer morning. My alarm went off, and I saw the texts from my mother below it asking if I’d felt the earthquake last night. I didn’t respond yet.

I walked into the living room, my bag’s contents spilled by the front door and my clothes from the night prior strewn about on the path I’d taken to my room. I didn’t even bother with the bare minimum of putting my boxers on, I just sat on my couch and looked back at my phone. With shaky fingers, I searched up the latest news on my phone.

"Thirteen People Go Missing in [REDACTED], NM Following Earthquake"

That was the final confirmation for me. I shook my head. I was sad for those people, sure, but I was almost ecstatic that it was fourteen. That my name and picture wasn’t on the news channel’s website next to the ones who were eaten.

I drew a bath for myself, though I had to psych myself up to get in after the previous night. Luckily, there was no giant worm to swallow me whole. I sat in there for a good while and just let myself process it all.

Now that I’ve affirmed to myself that it was all real, I’m wondering why I survived. Why didn’t I end up in a trance like the others? I don’t think I’ll ever know, and something tells me it won’t be too long before I stop caring why whatever prey-luring techniques were at play didn’t work on me. I’m just happy to still be here.
