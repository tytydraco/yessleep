Neo-Hippie? Too formal.   
  
Tree hugger? No, doesn’t capture the whole scene.  
  
Beatnik? Too Jack Kerouac and don’t get me started on that asshole.   
  
You know the people I’m talking about. The ones who think carrying a small piece of granite in your pocket will ‘re-align your chakra’ and ward off ‘negative energy’.   
  
Everyone knows a couple of em’. They’ll hear you complaining of back pain one day and without hesitation (and despite the fact that 85% of these people are nurse practitioners), they’ll tell you to stick a piece of topaz up your ass and sleep with an emerald under your tongue. What do you call these people?  
  
Crystal people? Sounds like a 4th grade sci-fi story.  
  
Starbucks Shaman? Getting closer to something here, but not quite…  
  
Whatever they are called, I dated one a few years ago – Mia. I met her on the back porch of a house party we were at and we shared a cigarette. During a lull in the conversation, she stared out into the wooded backyard and with a straight face asked me, “Do you think the trees are angry with us?”

That’s when I knew she was dumb enough to sleep with me.   
  
She was cute and bubbly and incredibly sweet. Sure, she always carried around a pocket full of rocks like a 3rd grader and would leave her little gemstones hidden around my apartment in an effort to bewitch me, but I didn’t consider the relationship to be that serious, we were just having fun and finding a polished sunstone in my Britta filter wasn’t a dealbreaker, so we kept dating.  
  
About 3 months into the relationship, she asked to me to tag along with her on a road trip to meet up at a campground with a bunch of her other neo-hippie, earth goddess, crystal-witch friends. I had banked a lot of time off at work and needed a vacation so I said, fuck it and we went.  
  
We took my beat up, 15-year-old, champagne gold Toyota highlander. I was driving, Mia was sitting shotgun and in the backseat were two of Mia’s friends, a girl named Lily and her boyfriend Rick. I was so incredibly thankful for Rick. Like me, he was a crystal-skeptic. I realized this when, at a roadside rest stop, Lily handed him a piece of cloudy quartz and said, “So you don’t get car sick”. Rick’s eyes rolled so hard I thought for half a second that he was having a seizure. He tucked the rock in his pocket and got back in the car.   
  
We were just 2 hours out from our final destination and the car was silent. Lily and Rick both asleep in each other arms in the backseat and Mia was sitting shotgun listening to something with her airpods.   
  
“Whatcha listening to?” I nudged her to get her attention.  
  
“Oh, nothing”   
  
She always said that. Every single time she had her airpods in and I asked that question I would get a ‘nothing’ or ‘not much’ or sometimes simply ‘podcast’ in return. I always figured she was just embarrassed by her music choices. Knowing her and Lily it was probably Mongolian Throat Singing or a 3-hour loop of whale noises or Jared Leto narrating Eat Pray Love, so I didn’t press the issue, although it did make me a bit sad she felt she couldn’t open up to me. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but I really liked her.  
  
We stopped for our final gas station break before arriving at the campground.   
  
“Last stop!” I shouted, startling Lily and Rick awake in the backseat, “If you want snacks or drinks or gotta piss, this is your last chance”   
  
Everyone got out of the car and filed into the gas station while I pumped gas into my old SUV. I noticed Mia had left her phone and airpods laying in the passenger seat and felt a little curious so I ducked down under the windshield and popped the airpods in and hit the play button on her phones lock screen. I wasn’t expecting what I heard.  
  
My head filled with whispers. It was a cacophony of 20 or 50 different voices all whispering over each other, completely unintelligible, different voices rising and lowering their pitch at different intervals. It made me feel schizophrenic.  
  
I pulled the airpods out of my head and finished pumping the gas. I wished I had never gotten curious.   
  
Mia, Lily and Rick came out of the gas station and piled back into the car. Mia put her airpods back in and I watched her face go blank.   
  
The final 2 hours passed in relative silence. The roads took us higher into the mountains and eventually the paved roads turned to dirt. The car filled again with conversation as one-by-one everyone lost signal on their cellphones. We were officially in the middle of nowhere.   
  
We arrived at the campsite at dusk and hurried to pitch our tent before the darkness of the night enveloped us. As soon as Rick and I got our tents erected, our respective girlfriends both hurried through the canvas flaps to arrange their little rocks and gemstones within as to channel the proper healing vibrations or whatever the fuck. While they were doing this, Rick and I grabbed some beers from the cooler.   
  
“So, how many crystals you got on you right now bud?” Rick asked with a smile.   
  
“Five,” I said, “you?”   
  
“Those are rookie numbers my guy,” He said shaking his head, “I got nine.” He undid top button on his shirt and revealed a small pouch hanging around his neck. “She got sick of me losing them.”  
  
I cracked open a beer, “The things we do for love”   
  
“For hairy pussy”  
  
We both laughed.   
  
Since we got in so late the night before and didn’t get a chance to really scope out the campsite, Mia and I took a walk around the area the next morning.   
  
This place was a bohemian paradise. 20 to 30 hippies populated the surrounding forests, braiding each other’s hair, dancing in drum circles and painting rocks. A few of them were enjoying a breakfast of rice cakes and sunflower seeds. A number of them just kinda sat there staring off into space. The entire campsite smelled of weed, which was fine with me.   
  
In the center of the massive campsite stood a ring of standing stones. It looked like a much smaller and less impressive Stonehenge. Upon seeing these standing stones Mia ran to them and embraced the closest stone in a bear hug.   
  
“Mike come over,” She called over to me, “This is amazing you can literally feel the energy coming off the earth.”   
  
I walked over and put a hand on the standing stone, “Yup, pretty incredible Mia,” I had gotten so good at letting the hippie bullshit wash right over me.   
  
Mia fumbled with her fanny pack and pulled out a handful of colored rocks and mineral, “This is the perfect place to charge my crystals.” She started placing her handfuls of crystals on several of the standing stones.   
  
As I was watching Mia scramble around touching all the stones and inspect her little crystals, I felt a hand on my shoulder.   
  
I turned around and let out a surprised, “Jesus Christ!” as I was face-to-face with an older, couple probably in their 60’s who were both completely naked.  
  
“I’m sorry, you just startled me,” I apologized.   
  
Before I knew it, the naked couple was upon me. I was in the middle of a very much unwanted and not-asked-for group hug.   
  
“It’s ok, we’re sorry for sneaking up on you,” the man whispered into my ear, "Jesus was the first Shaman, you know?" I was very aware that this man's dick was smashed on my right hip.  
  
“You’re so tense,” the woman said to me as she backed out of the hug but kept her hands on my shoulders. “This will be a well-deserved weekend of healing for you, I hope. My name is Selene, and these are my campgrounds,” She took a hand from my shoulder and placed it on the chest of the naked man next to her, “This is Neil, my partner.”   
  
Just then, Mia walked up. Thank God.   
  
Mia, Selene and River talked for a while about crystals and energies and vibrations and a whole bunch of silly shit I don’t really understand, but I did pick up a few things – Selene and Neil had owned the property for decades and twice a year have gatherings on the land with a bunch of other neo-hippies. Mia had found Selene online and secured a spot for us and Lily and Rick. Hooray.   
  
Mia and I walked back to our campsite where Rick and Lily were already eating breakfast.   
  
“Y’all find anything interesting?” Rick asked in between bites of his scrambled eggs.   
  
“Lily, they have the MOST amazing Moongate, you NEED to go charge your crystals ASAP,” Mia gushed.   
As much as I hated all of this bullshit, it was nice to see her having so much fun. Still, our next weekend getaway would definitely be my pick. It would probably be a casino in Biloxi.   
  
“Ohmygod,” Lily could barely contain herself, “This place is amazing!”  
  
“That’s pretty cool!” Rick exclaimed, “Lily, go check it out and I’ll clean up breakfast.”  
  
The girls grabbed their bags of rocks and ran off down the dirt path towards the standing stones.   
  
Now that the girls were gone Rick leaned in towards me and said, “Just a heads-up buddy – I wouldn’t go barefoot around here. Seems like there’s a general aversion to feminine hygiene products in these parts and I’ve seen more than a few ladies leaving snail trails.”   
  
It was a pretty relaxing day. Rick and I mostly hung out and talked, drank some beers and took naps in our hammocks. The girls came back around lunch and goaded us into doing a group yoga thing with another dozen hippies. Rick was totally right about the feminine hygiene thing.   
  
That night as we made dinner the girls were saying how excited they were for the first big ‘ritual’ of the weekend. Apparently, each night at midnight, there would be a mass ‘ritual’ at the standing stones, culminating on the third night which takes place not only under a full moon, but also on the spring equinox, a combination which only happens every 19 years or so.  
  
Again, not my scene, but Mia was excited, so I was excited for her.   
  
A shortly before midnight our little group headed for the standing stones.   
  
We arrived at the ritual grounds to find nearly everyone already there. A few dozen new-age hippies stood in a circle around the stones, all dressed in their Sunday best – tie-dyes, Phish t-shirts, boho headbands and ankle length skirts. Selene and Neil were in the middle of the circle standing on either side of the central standing stone, they were still naked, of course.   
  
A few minutes before midnight Selene made some announcements about “returning to the earth” and the “power of the moon” and then launched into a relatively lengthy diatribe about honeybees, colony collapse disorder and how we needed not only stop picking flowers, but plant more of them. Hearing this, several women around the stone circle sheepishly removed flower crowns from their heads.  
  
A cloud that had been parked in front of the moon floated away and the mass of new-age hippies was bathed in a pale blue moonlight.   
  
Selene raised her voice again, “You should have been listening to the mantras that I have emailed you all. Its time for the ritual to begin.” She clapped her hands twice and the woods erupted in whispers.   
I looked around and saw each and every one of the flowerchildren around me were all whispering, eyes closed. Rick and I looked at each other and shrugged.   
  
The whispering grew louder and with it the hippies started moving to it, shaking their hips to an unheard rhythm, clapping their hands to a silent beat.   
  
I noticed then what I was hearing was the strange whispers I had heard on Mia’s phone the previous day. All the hippies were doing it, not only that, but the voices seemed to be carried and swirled by the wind itself into something new.   
  
Selene started wailing and writhing in the center of it all. Grabbing at her chest as if in pain. The energy around the circle intensified and a sense of anticipation hung in the air. Selene then without warning bashed her face into the ancient weathered stone that stood in the center of the ritual. She pulled her head back, and bashed it again. I heard a sick *snap* as her nose broke.  
  
I made a move to rush into stop her from doing it again, but Rick grabbed my arm. I turned to him to tell him off, but before I could utter a word there was a series of quick, blinding flashes. It was as if the moon itself became a strobe light for just a quarter of a second. A wave of shocked gasps emanated from the crowds; the chanting stopped. There were 3 seconds of complete silence. Then panic.  
  
A quiet murmur quickly grew into shouts, then screams of outright terror. Selene started shouting again, “SILENCE! ALL OF YOU! QUIET!”   
  
The shrieking stopped, although whimpering and the short, choppy breaths of those who were crying could still be heard.   
  
“We must not panic,” Selene said in a soothing voice, “Our friends are now part of the natural world in a different form. We must respect this transformation and try to understand its purpose.”   
  
What the fuck was she talking about? Our friends? I thought everyone was freaking out about that weird moon-flicker, I had no idea what had actually happened.   
  
“This isn’t a cause for panic or fear or grief,” Selene continued as blood ran from her broken nose, “This is a call for celebration, for they have been chosen. Charge your crystals under the moon tonight, greater tests await us tomorrow!”   
  
With that, she turned and headed back into the forest, Neil following closely behind.   
  
The hippies immediately broke into a cacophony of sobs and quiet murmuring. I noticed they all flocked into 4 distinct groups and formed their own circles. It reminded me of seeing a fight in high school and a ring of spectators would immediately form.   
  
Mia grabbed my hand and pulled me into a tight hug, “D-did you see that?” She asked.   
  
“Yeah, the moon flashed or something, it was wild.”   
  
“No, the people,” She sounded like she was fighting back tears, “did you see what happened to the people?”   
  
“What?” I had no idea what she was talking about. Selene had said some similar shit and I still felt like despite being in the damn ritual I had missed the whole fucking thing, “What people?”   
  
Mia pointed a shaking hand towards one of the semi-circles of spectators that were whispering among themselves.   
  
I walked over and pushed my way through the crowd. They were looking at plants. Human shaped plants. Thick roots grew up out of the ground in two distinct ‘legs’ then branched and tangled around each other forming a torso, two vine-wrapped limbs jutted out from each side forming arms and a tangle of leafy wood made a head on top of it all. The entirety of each ‘plant person’ was leafy and covered in flowers.   
  
One girl sat on her butt in the mud, her hand was holding the ‘hand’ of one of the plants. I knelt down next to her and asked her what happened.   
  
“I don’t know,” She said, “I was holding my boyfriend’s hand, then there was a flash, and he was gone. Now I can’t move, and I just want to go find him,” she started sobbing more heavily, “I’m scared.”   
  
I looked at her hand and noticed she wasn’t ‘holding’ her boyfriend’s hand. The wood of his 'hand' had actually grown over and around her hand. She wasn’t going to get out of this without cutting off her used to be her boyfriend’s ‘arm’.  
  
I told her it would be okay and made a move to snap the 'arm' that restrained her. Before I could snap it, a dozen hands had grabbed me and pulled me off, shouting and cursing at me for attempting to defile what they saw as a miracle.  
I shrugged and I walked back to camp with Mia. We didn’t sleep much that night.
