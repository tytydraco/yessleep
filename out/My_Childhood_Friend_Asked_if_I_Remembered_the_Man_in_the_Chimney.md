It was late autumn, and a heavy downpour raged outside. I was sitting on the couch, watching an old film that was meant to help me escape the chaos of daily life. The rain drumming on the windows created a monotonous, soothing backdrop. The warmth of the apartment and the soft hum of the film slowly lulled me into a state of blissful relaxation. Suddenly, however, my moment of peace was interrupted by the sound of my phone ringing. I glanced at the screen and saw a name I hadn't seen in years—Henry.

- "Hello?" I answered hesitantly, wondering what could have prompted him to call now.

- "Hi, Tom. It's me, Henry. We haven't seen each other in a long time. Do you have a moment to meet up?" His voice carried an unsettling tone, something that made my heart race.

- "Of course, Henry. Is something wrong?" I asked, trying to hide my surprise.

- "This isn't a conversation for the phone," he said, his voice filled with concern.

Something in Henry's voice told me this wasn't just about catching up on old times.

We arranged to meet at a small café that we both remembered from our youth. It was a place we frequently visited before our paths diverged. I waited there, watching the raindrops fall, until I finally saw him entering.

Henry looked different from how I remembered him—pale, with deeply set eyes, and something unsettling in his movements. We sat across from each other, and I ordered coffee, trying to control my thoughts.

- "What's going on, Henry? You look like you've seen a ghost," I said with a slight smile that quickly faded when I saw his expression.

- "Tom, I need to tell you something. Something that's been tormenting me all this time," he began, his voice trembling.

- "Do you remember the man in the chimney?"

I knew this would be a difficult conversation. I felt a cold shiver running down my spine, and my heart began to beat faster.

Everyone has events in their life that remain etched in memory forever, like stone carvings. For me, such a memory was the summer camp I attended with my best friend Henry when we were eleven. It was a time of carefree laughter and fun, but those days also hid something dark, something related to an old wooden cabin in the middle of the forest. The cabin had a high, gloomy chimney that still haunts my dreams. It was many years ago. Henry and I were excited about the prospect of two weeks of adventures, away from everyday life. The camp was deep in the woods, in a place where civilization seemed to have forgotten about its existence. The cabin we were to stay in was old, surrounded by a mysterious aura. At the end of the cabin was a chimney that seemed out of place at first glance—like a relic from the past. Inside, the cabin seemed cozy, with two beds on either side, but something caught my attention—doors in the middle of the room. I approached and opened them with a creak. For a moment, the doors revealed a fireplace that looked as if it hadn't been used in years. Confused, I closed the doors and resolved not to open them for the rest of the camp. The days passed with us exploring the area, swimming in the lake, and sitting by the campfire in the evening. The cabin was charming by day, but at night, when darkness fell, it turned into something entirely different. Shadows danced on the walls, and the wind whistled through the gaps, creating strange, unsettling sounds. During those times, Henry and I would lie quietly in our beds, listening to the sounds of the night and trying to fall asleep.

One night, I suddenly woke up, feeling that something was wrong. At first, I thought it was just a nightmare that had disturbed me. I lay in bed, listening. Everything seemed normal until I suddenly heard a faint tapping. I got up and looked around, trying to locate the source of the sound. The noise was coming from behind the doors, from the chimney. I froze, my heart pounding. Slowly, I opened the doors and looked at the fireplace, and I saw something that made my hair stand on end. In the moonlight coming through the window, I saw a thin, pale hand emerging from the darkness. I held my breath, unable to believe my eyes. The hand moved slowly, as if searching for something in the darkness, then suddenly retreated, disappearing into the depths of the chimney.

"Henry, wake up," I whispered, gently shaking my friend. Henry opened his eyes, looking at me in confusion.

"What’s wrong?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.

"I saw something in the chimney," I replied, pointing to the spot where I had just seen the hand. Henry looked at me skeptically but got up and approached the fireplace.

"There's nothing here, Tom," he said after a moment, peering inside. "Maybe you just had a bad dream."

But I knew what I had seen. That night, I couldn't sleep, listening and staring at the chimney. The following days were spent as usual—playing, hiking, and telling stories by the campfire. But at night, I was always on edge, fearing that what I had seen would return.

On the last night of camp, when everyone was asleep, I heard something even more terrifying. It was a whisper, soft and barely audible, as if someone was speaking to me from the depths of the chimney. I moved closer, and the voice became clearer. I pressed my ear to the door and then I heard it.

"Don't peek." I froze with fear, my mind screamed at me to run, but my legs wouldn't move. Henry eventually woke from his restless sleep, interrupted by my unsettling sounds. He got out of bed, his movements full of irritation. His sleepy eyes looked at me with frustration, and his posture was tense. "Tom, what are you doing in the middle of the night?" he asked, his voice showing annoyance. I couldn’t respond, just staring at those cursed doors.

At that moment, the whispers ceased, replaced by scraping sounds coming from inside the chimney.

"Look, Tom, it’s just your imagination. You'll see that there’s nothing there," Henry said, approaching the chimney doors, holding a flashlight that barely illuminated the darkness inside. He opened the door to the room with the fireplace, and an immediate cold draft filled the room. Henry entered the room and shone the flashlight into the chimney. Henry stood still for a few seconds, his eyes wide open, and his face was as pale as paper.

His breathing became rapid and shallow, and his body trembled with fear. I saw his hands starting to shake, and the flashlight barely held in his grasp.

It seemed his mind couldn’t process what he saw. Suddenly, Henry ran out of the room. But before the doors of the room with the fireplace could be slammed shut, I felt something cold and sinister brush past. Before Henry closed the door, I saw a hand emerging from the darkness of the chimney. The hand was shockingly pale and emaciated, with long, terrifying claws that seemed to cut through the darkness.

Henry spent the rest of the night huddled in a corner of the cabin.

I never told anyone about what happened that night. As far as I know, Henry did the same, although we hadn't agreed to keep it a secret. I never learned exactly what happened that night, but I knew who knew the truth—Henry, who had called me this evening. After we finished school, our paths diverged, and I hadn’t seen my friend for many long years. Until tonight.

- "Do you remember that dreadful evening? That’s when our lives changed forever, especially mine, when that evening I shone the flashlight into the chimney and saw..."

- "What did you see?" I asked, concerned.

- "I saw a humanoid, emaciated figure with black eye sockets. It was rushing towards me. There was really something there, you understand? I know your nightmare probably ended that night, but mine just began. Ever since, I hear whispers and scraping sounds coming from the chimney at night, but for some reason, only I hear them."

I was probably the only person who didn’t think he was crazy. I was there with him, I saw that dreadful hand.

- "I’m going to that old cabin in the woods tomorrow. I can't stand it anymore, I need to end it."

It occurred to me that I was probably seeing Henry for the last time. He got up from the table without a word and left the café.

However, a few days later, I started hearing scratching sounds in the chimney...
