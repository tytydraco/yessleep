I thought that if anyone could help us figure this out, it would be Madam Morrigan. I planned to take Ethan with me to see her the next day. But from the night we had that discussion, we hit trouble.

It was like the Hollow Lady knew we were up to something.

My contractions started up again, and at 37+6 the hospital weren’t willing to stop them. “Slow labour,” they said. One centimetre dilated, if anyone’s interested. The contractions weren’t regular, so they sent me home with the usual advice: stay comfortable, stay calm, and rest.

That morning, I lay in bed, gritting my teeth through a particularly strong contraction, pleading with Ethan. “You can choose, honestly. I promise I won’t veto any of your choices.”

“Cara…” His voice was soft, almost breaking. “I’m sorry. I can’t give him a name.”

“Ahhh—please,” I groaned through the pain. “At least for his headstone.”

Ethan let go of my hand, kissed my forehead, and left without a word. I listened to the click of the front door as he stepped out into the chilly air.

My heart sank. I had never felt so alone.

A faint waft of patchouli lingered in the air, drifting up as if carried by the door closing downstairs.

“Oh, fuck off,” I winced, rolling onto my side. “He’s not here yet, you old bitch.”

The bedroom door slammed.

I sobbed myself to sleep.

\*

 I’m not sure what woke me. Maybe the rays of afternoon sunlight burning through my eyelids. Maybe the gentle tapping of Jerry on the glass. Probably the overpowering smell of incense, and the voice that sounded far too loud in the silence.

“I see we’ve changed profession?”

Madam Morrigan was in my bedroom, her long grey hair pulled back under a purple headscarf, the gold coin trim jingling with every movement. Ethan stood behind her, wearing a shy, nervous smile. Jessie waved to me from his hip.

I let out a shaky laugh. He wasn’t leaving me. He was bringing her to me.

“What?” I croaked, straining to sit up. Ethan jogged to my side, arranging the cushions behind my back. “We’re going to fix this,” he whispered.

“A detective! You’ve spotted the loophole in the spell,” Morrigan said, her bangles chiming as she gestured toward the window. “Do you mind?”

She pushed it open, letting Jerry hop inside. He fluttered to her shoulder as she went on, calm as if this were any ordinary house call.

“I’m sorry, Cara. I am bound by laws higher than I. I cannot interfere with bargains or bets on either side…” She paused, the crow shifting on her shoulder as her lips curved in the faintest smile. “…unless the one caught in the bargain sees the way through themselves.”

My stomach tightened. “So, there is a way out?”

Her bangles chimed as she spread her hands. “Not out. No. More… through. Or parallel.”

“What?” Ethan and I said at the same time.

Morrigan chuckled softly. “A deal is a deal and must be fulfilled. But the payment for a deal requires a second. And a bargain made with chains already in place is no bargain at all. Luckily, a boon cannot be un-given once promised… only balanced.”

I blinked at her. “Am I having a stroke?” I muttered to Ethan. “Can you do that again in English… please?”

Morrigan arched an eyebrow. “Did I stutter?”

“I think I have it,” Ethan said suddenly. “You were right! Because you didn’t agree willingly, she can’t take the new baby. And what’s the other bit?” He looked at Morrigan hopefully.

She folded her hands. “If you make a deal with a shopkeeper, you take an item in exchange for money.”

We both nodded slowly.

“But what happens if you have no money to give?”

“You have to give the item back…” Ethan trailed off, colour draining from his face.

“Jessie?” I whispered.

“But—” Morrigan cut in, her bangles chiming, “the spirit world is not bound by consumer law. Once a boon has been granted, it cannot be taken away.”

“She tried to take Jessie when…” My throat tightened.

“She was tormenting you,” Morrigan said flatly. “She is bound by laws just as any other. However, there are no rules against causing you absolute misery. It is… in a sense, her vocation.”

“She got what she wanted because of that,” Ethan muttered.

“And that,” Morrigan finished, “is where the problem lies.”

Her expression didn’t shift, but her tone carried the weight of a gavel. “That was… naughty.”

We stared at her.

“She cannot take your baby as payment. But payment still must be made.”

Morrigan’s bangles clinked as she sat in my rocking chair. She pulled a heavy book from her satchel and laid it across her lap.

 “There is a ritual. Old words, older symbols. You will need salt, flame, and her name spoken against her. It will call out her mistake, force her to face it. And once a spirit is confronted with its own broken law, it cannot take what it has no claim to.”

“That’s it?” Ethan asked, barely daring to believe.

“That’s it,” Morrigan said smoothly, though the crow on her shoulder gave a low, uneasy caw.

I let out a shaky laugh of relief, pressing a hand to my belly as the baby rolled beneath my ribs. “Then we’ll do it. Whatever it takes.”

Morrigan smiled, but her eyes stayed shadowed.

We could scrape something together for payment. She could have everything, the house, the money, my wedding ring. as long as my kids were safe.

“What now?” Ethan asked.

“Erm—” I cut off with a cry as a wave of pain ripped through me, stealing the air from my lungs.

“Whatever it is, we don’t have long” I clawed the covers back from my legs. The sheets beneath me were soaked through, spreading warm across the mattress.

“My waters have broken.”

“Fantastic!” Madam Morrigan chimed, almost gleeful. “I work better under pressure.”

She moved toward her satchel, as if this was nothing more than a business appointment. Ethan hovered uselessly beside me; panic etched across his face.

Neither of us noticed the shadow that crossed her expression for a fraction of a second — the truth she hadn’t spoken. That in the end, the Hollow Lady’s bargains always came down to the same currency.

A life for a life.

Ethan helped me down the crooked basement steps as pain came thick and fast.

“I can’t do it!” I cried as my legs buckled beneath me.

“Yes, you can, my dear. Women have been doing this for centuries, in worse places than this no less.”

Madam Morrigan patted a thin throw blanket she had laid inside a wide circle of salt. “Come. Sit. We will be with you.”

Ethan helped me step carefully over the salt and eased me down. The ice-cold concrete seeped through the throw and into my bones.

“Get… Jessie…” I gasped through clenched teeth.

Ethan returned a few moments later with our baby girl, settling her inside the circle with her tablet. She looked around briefly, then glued her eyes back to Peppa Pig, oblivious to the shadows creeping at the edges.

As Madam Morrigan lit the last of the black candles, Ethan switched off the light and stepped into the circle. The basement seemed to fold in on itself, shadows gathering thick against the walls.

“I can feel it, Ethan. He’s gonna come soon!” I panted, the pressure in my pelvis unbearable.

Morrigan sat cross-legged with her book, Ignoring my cries, she looked around with theatrical precision.

“Okay. All present, and correct? No pets, cats, dogs, hamsters you’re particularly fond of still out there, no?”

Another groan tore out of me. I couldn’t even muster a glare.

She clapped her hands. “Excellent. Then let us begin.”

Madam Morrigan lowered her head, eyes skimming the book as she touched each candle flame in turn. The basement filled with the thick, cloying scent of patchouli, heavier than before, crawling into the back of my throat.

I struggled to breathe.

The shadows around the circle shifted. They weren’t still anymore. They slid along the walls, stretching, dragging, as if something unseen was pacing just beyond the salt.

Jessie’s tablet flickered. Peppa Pig warped into static for a heartbeat before snapping back, her tiny giggle sounding cracked and wrong. Jessie didn’t notice. She never looked up.

Another contraction ripped through me. My fingers clawed into Ethan’s arm. “She’s here,” I whispered, voice raw with terror.

Madam Morrigan didn’t look up. “Good. Let her listen.”

She quickly scrawled the last of the words into the book and then, began to read.

Constance Arthur, hear these words,

Chains once forged are now disturbed.

You gave the boon but sought for more,

You hurt the child behind the door.

A chain must clasp by willing hand,

Freely given, freely planned.

But fear was used, and threats were made,

Thus law is broken, oath betrayed.

Salt to bind and flame to see,

We name your fault, we set it free.

Your bargain stands but twisted, torn.

You cannot claim this child once born.

The last words left Madam Morrigan’s lips, her voice rising sharp and clear above the hum of the tablet.

Salt hissed on the floor, the flames rose, as a shadow stretched across the wall in front of us. It swelled and grew, long-limbed, head bent wrong, dragging itself higher until it loomed over the circle.

Jessie’s tablet died with a crackle, plunging her into silence. She didn’t cry, just stared wide-eyed at the shape that towered above us.

A bolt of pain tore through me, I cried out, clutching Ethan’s arm. The first sting of the baby’s head burned low between my hips.

“Hurry, he’s coming” I groaned trying and failing to stay the urge to push.

Madam Morrigan rose to her feet, the crow shifting on her shoulder as the shadow loomed taller.

“Do not interfere, woman,” Constance rasped, hollow and low. The voice shook the salt line like a wind through broken glass. “This is not your concern.”

“You make it my concern when you falter on your own oath, Constance,” Morrigan replied calmly, her eyes never leaving the shadow’s warped silhouette.

The shadow grew taller, stretching grotesquely as it pressed against the salt boundary. The line hissed, grains scattering as though under invisible claws.

Jessie whimpered, her eyes darting from the tablet’s black screen to the looming shape above us. Her little hands clutched the edge of the throw, knuckles white.

Ethan moved closer, torn between me and his daughter, shielding her with his arm though the gesture was laughably small against the enormity of the thing beyond the circle.

Madam Morrigan’s bangles chimed softly as she lifted her hands. “Hold steady. She cannot breach it without consent.”

I let out a pained cry as the baby’s head crowned further. “I can’t hold it!” I bellowed through gritted teeth.

The shadow pressed harder against the salt, writhing until its head nearly brushed the ceiling. The hiss of burning grains filled the room, and Jessie’s whimper rose into a frightened cry.

Then she spoke to me. Softer. Everywhere at once.

“Cara…”

My breath caught. My whole body seized with the contraction, the burn of the baby’s head splitting me open.

“You suffer needlessly,” Constance rasped. “Let me ease it. One word, and the pain will end. One word, and the child will not suffer. He will serve his rightful place at my side, unburdened by life, forever.”

I looked at her. You need to understand, I was in so much pain. I was so tired.

Then Ethan’s voice tore through. “No!” he barked, clutching my hand. “Don’t listen to her.”

The shadow bent closer, its warped outline dragging long across the walls. Her voice returned, low and threatening.

“You cannot keep what was promised. You cannot keep him.”

“He was never promised, Constance.” Madam Morrigan’s voice cut through, sharp as a slap. She sounded like she was scolding a child.

With one last push, he was out, caught just in time by Ethan. His cries pierced the air, fierce and alive. Ethan tore off his jumper, wrapping him up before laying him against my chest.

The shadow pressed harder, the salt line sizzling and sparking, flecks landing in the candle flames and turning them a violent orange.

“Constance Arthur of Corvus Vale, granter of wishes and keeper of oaths, you may not enter!” Morrigan barked.

The baby wailed in my arms.

“I am owed!” Constance bellowed back, her voice shaking the window frames, dust falling from the beams above.

“You are not owed him!” Morrigan’s voice thundered back.

An invisible wind picked up in the room, fluttering the pages in Morrigan’s open book, the candles struggled to stay alight, and the salt started to stir, threatening to break the circle.

“Noise and shadows cost her nothing. Do not mistake theatre for power." Madam Morrigan said reassuringly.

“What do we do?” Ethan pleaded, “we can’t stay here forever!” he finished, his voice breaking.

“She needs payment,” Morrigan said evenly. “You have found a way through, but the deal still demands its due.”

“She can have anything,” Ethan said quickly, desperation shaking every word.

“Anything,” I echoed weakly, clutching the baby tighter.

Morrigan looked at us both with eyes that seemed older than the house itself. Her voice was low, solemn, final.

“The payment must be equal to what it was meant to be.”

My stomach turned cold. Ethan stared at her, unblinking.

“What do you mean?” I whispered.

Her bangles chimed as she folded her hands. “A life, Cara. For a life.”

Ethan remained silent while I whispered a whimpering, “No.”

He moved in a numb state, lifting Jessie into his arms. He buried his face in her hair, kissed her cheek, then gently set her back down.

Sliding close, he wrapped himself around me, kissing the top of my head while he stroked the baby’s tiny hand. His eyes opened, and time seemed to slow around us. For a moment, we were suspended together in a place I wished I could have stayed forever.

“He looks like me,” Ethan said with a soft smile. His panic from moments before was gone, replaced by a calm that terrified me.

“He does,” I whispered back.

“Will you call him Daniel? After my dad?” His voice was steady, even as he pushed himself to his feet.

I froze, my heart seizing. “No—” I clawed at his arm, refusing to let him move. But I couldn’t stand. The cord still tethered me to the baby, and I was too weak.

Ethan pulled free with gentle strength, turning toward Madam Morrigan.

She inclined her head knowingly, solemnly. “It began with a father’s promise. It ends with a father’s sacrifice.”

He nodded once and faced the Hollow Lady. The shadow bent low, its warped head lowering until it was level with his.

“Who will pay?” the Hollow Lady asked, her voice hollow and low.

“I will,” Ethan said. Calm. Certain.

“Don’t leave me!” I screamed until my throat was raw, but it was too late.

Ethan looked over his shoulder and whispered,

“I’ll always be with you, I promise.” He smiled softly and stepped from the circle.

Nothing happened for a moment. Then the Hollow Lady whispered, low and final:

“I accept.”

Ethan’s body dropped to the floor.

The candles snuffed out, plunging the basement into suffocating darkness, The air calmed, and the blanket of patchouli faded, time seemed to stretch for eternity as I wailed in grief and fear.

A click overhead, and Madam Morrigan was illuminated once more as she flicked on the bare lightbulb.

Jessie crawled across the circle toward Ethan’s lifeless body. She tugged at his hair, waiting for the laugh, the smile, the arms that never came. When nothing happened, she turned back to me, eyes wide and wet, and let out a panicked cry that shattered my heart.

I sobbed on the floor, clutching the baby he had tried so desperately not to have. “Please,” I begged, “please try CPR, call an ambulance, do something—”

Morrigan’s voice was soft, but immovable. “If the deal is reversed, she will come for another. Let it be, Cara. I am sorry.”

She lifted Jessie into her arms. The child stilled almost instantly, pressing her wet face into the crook of Morrigan’s neck.

“Hush now, little one,” she murmured, her bangles chiming faintly. “Grief is loud, but love whispers on. Remember him not in silence, but in every laugh, every light, every breath you take.”

Madam Morrigan set Jessie down gently. The child blinked, picked up her now-working tablet, and resumed Peppa Pig as if nothing had happened, small giggles rising under the hum of the overhead light.

From her bag, Morrigan drew a slender knife with a handle worn smooth by age. She crouched before me, her bangles chiming softly as she worked. With calm precision she helped deliver the placenta, then cut the cord that tethered me to the tiny, wailing boy in my arms.

My tears blurred everything. “She took him from me,” I whispered hoarsely. “She took Ethan. I swear, I’ll—”

“Revenge?” Morrigan’s tone was cool, unreadable. “Revenge is only another chain, Cara. You have enough binding you already.”

She reached out and I let her take the baby, too exhausted to resist. She cradled him against her chest, her sharp eyes softening just slightly as she studied his face.

“Daniel,” she murmured, almost to herself. “One day, you will understand what was taken. And the Hollow Lady will know your name.”

She kissed his forehead and placed him back in my arms, her expression unreadable.

\*

I did ring the ambulance, on Madam Morrigan’s instruction. I waited until there was no chance, he could be revived. She cleaned up the salt, the candles, every trace of what had really happened before she left. so, it could all be staged as a tragic accident.

The official story is simple. I went into labour in the basement. I was too weak to climb the stairs. The stress made him collapse.

The coroner’s report says Ethan’s heart just stopped. A rare condition. A hidden abnormal rhythm that can strike without warning. A genetic defect, they said. Something that could be passed down. Something that could mean Daniel or Jessie is at risk too.

But I know better. There is no risk. Not from that.

It’s been exactly six weeks, three days, and thirteen hours since Ethan sacrificed his life to save Daniel. But I don’t think he’s left us.

You see, every morning since I returned home from the hospital, Jerry perches himself on my window. The thing is that His feathers look slightly duller than the gleaming white of the new crow he brought with him.

And I know. Ethan kept his [promise.](https://youtu.be/QXJ0PcmOd_E)
