I always thought it was just a quirky rule. Something my parents made up to keep us kids in check. Don’t open the closet door past midnight. Don’t ever touch it if it’s cracked open. Never respond if you hear someone calling your name from inside. Simple stuff. But now, after everything that’s happened, I realize how wrong I was to think it was just some childish nonsense.

I was only seven when I first heard the rules, sitting at the kitchen table, watching my mom and dad as they spoke in hushed tones, their faces shadowed with a seriousness I’d never seen before. They weren’t arguing, but there was a tension between them, something unspoken. My older brother, Sean, was the one who listened. I was too young to understand, too naïve to see the fear that gripped them. I thought it was just another one of those weird “house rules” adults make up—like no running in the house or always saying please and thank you. As long as I did what they asked, I figured I was safe.

The closet was in the hallway, just across from my bedroom door. It was an old-fashioned closet—big, wooden, with a cracked door and a faint smell of mothballs and dust. Nothing special about it. I didn’t think it would become the source of so many nightmares. But as I grew older, I started to notice things—little things that made my skin crawl, that made me wonder if my parents were hiding something, something about the closet that they’d never told me. 

Here are the rules:

---

### 1. **Never open the closet door past midnight.**  

This one was simple enough, and I never thought twice about it. Why would I even want to open the closet door at that hour? But then came a hot summer night when I was about ten. The air was thick, suffocating, and I woke up thirsty. The house was silent, and I didn’t want to disturb anyone, so I slipped out of bed and padded down the hall barefoot to the kitchen. I passed the closet on my way, and the faintest sliver of light seeped through the crack in the door. It wasn’t unusual; I must have forgotten to close it earlier. I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle, and then I noticed it—how deep the shadow seemed. It looked unnatural, like something inside was pulling the darkness in. My curiosity got the better of me.

I reached out and pushed the door just slightly open, a tiny crack. That’s when I heard it.

A whisper. Soft, barely audible at first. My heart skipped a beat. “Come closer…”

I froze. The voice didn’t come from outside the closet. It was coming from inside, from the very depths of the dark space beyond the door. I stepped back, but my legs felt heavy, like I was rooted to the spot. I strained my eyes to look inside. There was nothing there. Just the usual clutter of clothes, shoes, and old boxes, but the voice—*it was there.*

“Don’t be afraid. Come inside…”

The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. My pulse raced, and I slammed the door shut, stumbling backward. I ran back to my room, heart pounding in my chest, my mind racing to explain it away. It must have been my imagination, I told myself, but I could never forget that voice. It stayed with me, lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow I couldn’t shake.

### 2. **If the door is cracked open, do not touch it.**

At first, this rule seemed like an extension of the first one. If I wasn’t supposed to open the door past midnight, I certainly wasn’t supposed to touch it if it was already cracked open. I obeyed this rule for years, mostly out of fear of what would happen if I didn’t. But, as I grew older, my skepticism grew too. I started to question everything. *Maybe it’s just a closet*, I thought. *Maybe there’s nothing to be afraid of.* I started to relax, to forget about the strange feeling that lingered whenever I walked by the door.

That’s when it happened again. One night, when I was fourteen, I woke up in the middle of the night. I’d been tossing and turning, my mind racing with random thoughts, when I noticed something odd. The closet door was cracked open, just enough to let a sliver of darkness spill out. My first instinct was to turn around and ignore it, but curiosity got the best of me. I inched toward the door, my fingers twitching. It would be harmless, right? I mean, it was just a door. Nothing would happen. But then, I remembered the rule. 

I stopped in my tracks, my breath caught in my throat. I didn’t reach out. I didn’t touch it. I stood frozen, feeling the cold air coming from the crack, and something inside me screamed to walk away, to forget what I was thinking. But it was already too late. The whisper came again, soft but insistent. 

“Come closer…”

The door creaked louder now, like it was slowly pulling me in. My feet were moving before I even realized it. I took one hesitant step, then another. I was *almost* close enough to touch it when the voice stopped. The silence that followed was suffocating. I turned on my heel and ran back to my bed, pulling the covers over my head, praying it was just a bad dream.

### 3. **If you hear someone call your name from inside, do not respond.**

I always followed this rule, or at least I thought I did. It was one of the most terrifying rules, and the thought of breaking it never crossed my mind. The voice from the closet was strange enough. But when I was sixteen, it happened again—except this time, it was different. I was home alone that night, my parents out for dinner and Sean away at college. The house was quiet, almost unnervingly so. 

I lay in bed, my mind a swirl of random thoughts, unable to fall asleep. And then I heard it. A voice. Soft. Familiar. My name.

“Claire…”

I froze. It wasn’t like before. It wasn’t a whisper, but a call—a beckoning, like someone calling me from another room. I tried to tell myself it was just the house settling, or maybe I’d heard it from outside. But it was *so clear*. My heart pounded in my chest as I sat up. The voice came again, calm and soothing.

“Claire, come here…”

I was terrified. My body was paralyzed with fear, but my mind was screaming for me to respond. It sounded like my mom. *Maybe it really is her,* I thought. *Maybe she needs me.* But then the rules hit me like a wave. I couldn’t respond. I shouldn’t. 

I squeezed my eyes shut and clutched the blankets, willing myself to ignore the voice. Slowly, it faded away, but the weight of it stayed, pressing down on my chest, suffocating me.

### 4. **Never, under any circumstances, let the closet light go out.**

This was the rule I never understood. Until one night when I was fourteen, I had been up late reading. The soft glow from the closet light was my only source of illumination in the otherwise dark room. I hadn’t even noticed it flickering at first. But then, the light dimmed, sputtered, and went out completely. 

I stared at the closet, my heart beginning to race. It was so much darker now. The coldness crept in, thick and suffocating, and I could hear something—*dragging*. A slow, deliberate sound, like something heavy was moving across the floor. It wasn’t just a rustling. No, this was different. The sound was deliberate, dragging, like something was reaching out from within.

I reached for the light switch, my fingers trembling. But before I could flip it back on, something cold and dry wrapped around my wrist. I jerked my arm away, gasping for breath, and just as quickly as it had gone out, the light flickered back on. But the dragging sound stopped. 

I was alone. There was nothing there. Just my reflection staring back at me from the mirror on the closet door.

### 5. **If the closet door opens on its own, leave the room immediately.**

This was the final rule, the one I thought I could never break. I had followed all the others, kept my distance, kept the door closed. But then, one night when I was seventeen, it happened. The door creaked open on its own, slowly, as if some invisible force was pushing it. The darkness inside seemed to spill out, creeping along the walls like smoke. I stood there, frozen, unable to move.

And then I saw it.

A figure. It stood just inside the closet, shrouded in shadow. Its face was obscured, but I could see its eyes—burning, glowing red, like they were tearing through the darkness. It spoke in a voice that sounded like a thousand whispers at once.

“I’ve been waiting for you…”

I ran. I ran as fast as I could, but it followed me. It followed me in ways I didn’t understand, in ways I couldn’t escape. 

I never broke the rules again. But it didn’t matter. The thing in the closet wasn’t bound by rules anymore. And now, even though I’ve locked that closet door, even though I’ve moved out and left the house, I can still hear it calling me. 

I know it’s waiting. It’s waiting for me to come back.
