I always thought it was just a quirky rule. Something my parents made up to keep us kids in check. Don’t open the closet door past midnight. Don’t ever touch it if it’s cracked open. Never respond if you hear someone calling your name from inside. Simple stuff. But now, after everything that’s happened, I realize how wrong I was to think it was just some childish nonsense.

I was seven when I first heard the rules, sitting at the kitchen table, watching my mom and dad as they spoke in hushed tones. I didn’t think much of it at the time. My older brother, Sean, was the one who listened. I just figured it was another one of those weird “house rules” that you follow without questioning because that’s what adults said. 

The closet was in the hallway, just across from my bedroom door. It was a normal, old-fashioned closet—nothing special about it. But as I grew older, I noticed things. Little things that made my skin crawl. 

The first rule was easy to follow. *Never open the closet door past midnight.* Of course, I didn’t. I didn’t even think about it. Why would I open it? But then, on a particularly hot summer night, I woke up thirsty, the kind of night where the air is sticky and thick. I tiptoed down the hall, careful not to wake anyone, and passed the closet.

The door was slightly ajar. I remember standing there for a long time, staring at the crack of dark space between the door and the frame. The shadow inside seemed deeper than usual, almost unnatural. Something tugged at me to open it, just to peek inside. I don’t know what it was. Maybe curiosity. Maybe the heat. But I pushed the door a little further.

That’s when I heard it.

A whisper. Soft, at first, barely audible. Then louder. 

“Come closer…”

My blood ran cold. I couldn’t breathe. The whisper was coming from inside the closet. But when I looked inside, there was nothing there. The space was empty, just clothes hanging, shoes on the floor, but that voice—*it was there.*

“Don’t be afraid. Come inside.”

I slammed the door shut and backed away, heart pounding. I ran back to my room, curled under the covers, and prayed it was just my imagination. But I couldn’t forget it. That voice. It stayed with me, lingering in the back of my mind.

The second rule was *if the door is cracked open, do not touch it.* For a while, I followed that one. I didn’t want to risk making the same mistake again. But over time, the fear began to fade. I got older, started to question everything. Maybe it wasn’t such a big deal after all. Maybe the closet was just a closet.

That’s when the third rule hit me hard. *If you hear someone call your name from inside, do not respond.* I had no reason to disbelieve this rule, so I followed it, keeping my distance. But then, one night, something strange happened.

It was close to midnight, I was alone in the house. My parents had gone to bed, and Sean was away at college. I couldn’t sleep. My mind wouldn’t shut off. I kept hearing a faint sound, like someone was talking in the house. I pulled the covers over my head, trying to ignore it, but then... I heard it.

A voice. Soft, calm. My name. 

“Claire.”

My heart skipped a beat. It was coming from the closet.

“Claire, come here…”

I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe. The voice was so familiar. So... comforting. But I remembered the rule. I couldn’t respond. I *shouldn’t* respond. I squeezed my eyes shut and covered my ears. 

The voice faded, but the weight of it lingered.

The fourth rule was simple but terrifying. *Never, under any circumstances, let the closet light go out.* I never understood why it was such a big deal until one night when I was fourteen. I’d been going to bed late, reading under the dim light from the closet bulb. I hadn’t even realized it had flickered, not until it went out completely.

I froze. The room felt darker, colder, and I swore I could hear the faint sound of movement coming from inside. It wasn’t like a rustle or a shuffle. No. It was a *dragging* sound, slow, deliberate, like something was slithering in the dark.

I reached for the light switch, but before I could turn it back on, I felt it—a hand, cold and dry, grabbing my wrist. I pulled away, my breath catching in my throat, and the light flickered back on, illuminating the closet again. But there was nothing there. Just my reflection in the mirror on the closet door. 

I told myself it was a fluke, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t. Something had touched me.

The last rule was the one I thought I could never break: *If the closet door opens on its own, leave the room immediately.*

But there came a night when I was seventeen, and the door opened on its own. I didn’t leave. I should have. But I stood there, frozen, as the door creaked open, the darkness inside spilling out like smoke. I couldn’t move. I was rooted to the spot. 

Then I saw it.

A figure, standing just inside the closet, its face obscured by shadow. But I could see the eyes—glowing, red, like they were burning through the darkness. I could hear the whisper again, louder, like it was right behind me. 

“I’ve been waiting for you.”

I ran. I ran faster than I ever had in my life, but I couldn’t escape the feeling. It followed me, crawling inside my mind, never leaving me. 

I didn’t break the rules again. But it didn’t matter. The thing in the closet wasn’t bound by rules anymore. And now, even though I’ve locked that closet door, even though I’ve moved out and left the house, I can still hear it calling me. 

I know it’s waiting. It’s waiting for me to come back.
