To start this I’ve always attracted, well I don’t know how to say this… but maybe paranormal inclined women. My first girlfriend was of Eastern European descent and claimed that she came from a long line of witches. We dated for a little short of a year. During this time I developed chronic sleep paralysis, sometimes it felt like it went on for days on end but on average I’d say I would have these episodes 3-4 times a week. To make things even more creepy I would sometimes wake up with long scratch marks scaling my whole entire back. I even went to see a somnologist at one point due to me being in my final years of schooling, and these chronic episodes were spiralling me. I would’ve never thought or guessed that she was the cause of the episodes till we broke up. I was heartbroken at first, she was the first woman I had ever loved. But then came a wave of tranquility that I hadn’t felt in close to a year. 

It had stopped. I don’t know fucking how but it had stopped. It didn’t fade out progressively over time, it had just stopped. 

Now fast forward to today, it’s been close to 4 years since my last relationship, I’ve had multiple flings in between but I had trouble finding someone i felt like I truly clicked with. Well… that was until I met the girl I’m currently seeing. I’ll refer to her as ‘V’ for the sake of this post. Myself and V had actually gone through our whole primary and high schooling together, but never spoke to each other, not even once. I was quite popular in high school and she was one of the idk “quite kids” always had plenty of friends around but now I that I think about it I don’t really remember seeing her talk much at all back then. I have always thought she was very pretty though, she’s very pale and has long natural dark hair that contrasts really nicely with her skin. Well 3 months ago I ran into V at a local bar, we started talking and exchanged phone numbers. 

At first things went really well… and i guess they still are but idk this whole situation has just left me confused and a bit freaked out to be honest. As amazing as V is she’s definitely not without her own set of baggage, she hasn’t really given me any details but she’s obviously gone through something extremely traumatic in her past. This first became very evident to me when we started sharing a bed, she has constant night terrors, you can tell very easily when she’s having one because she’ll start groaning and death gripping whatever she can get in her hand, usually my arm or the bed sheets. Well that brings us to my current dilemma, the night that made me want to create this post. I just want somebody to know what happened. I don’t really want to talk to my friends about it, as we have mutuals and I don’t want people thinking she’s some crazy lady strangling dudes in their sleep haha. 

Well this said night I was little spoon, not the usual for me but what man doesn’t love a little pampering. While I was sleeping I had this sudden sensation that I was drowning, very similar to having that one dream where you fall and wake up, but ya know underwater. My eyes shot open and I felt it, fingers digging deep into my throat. I ripped her hand away waking her up instantly. It really upset her and as someone who had chronic sleep paralysis in the past I understand how it feels, dreams are supposed be a place to escape reality, and I knew how it felt to feel like your dreams are taking control of your real life. 

We’ve only talked about the incident once since, but even then it’s not like much was actually said. I still don’t know what she dreams about. Maybe it’s better that way.
