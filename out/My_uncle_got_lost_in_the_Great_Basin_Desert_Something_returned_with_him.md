Uncle Felix was always the kindest man. He'd bring me and my little brother, Scotty, a present every time he visited - always interesting things, a rope necklace with what he claimed was a dinosaur knuckle hanging from it, a real pearl he'd found on one of his many overseas trips, and who could forget the taxidermied rat dressed in a tuxedo that mother threw out.

He had a square jaw, a bald head and a loud laugh. Always a slap on the back for father, a kiss on the cheek for mother, and Aunt Cal would follow him in beaming with a Tupperware container of pasta or lasagne.

Uncle Felix was the sort of overly friendly uncle that would merit a raised eyebrow if mentioned. It was always seen as creepy for an uncle to love his niece and nephew, but Felix and Cal had no children of their own and they were more like second parents to me.

The news that Felix and Cal were taking a trip to the Great Basin Desert was no surprise to me - they were always off somewhere. In fact, I did not know until they had left. But once their week-long trip turned into two, then three, the missing posters began to sag in the rain and the police report went stale.

Two weeks ago, Mother and Father were about to prepare us for the news that Felix and Cal might never return, a fact I had already accepted but Scotty had not, when the phone rang. Father sighed and got up to answer it. His voice turned from disbelieving to relief then worry. He took the phone upstairs to his study, where he continued to talk in a hushed whisper. Scotty, Mother and I all sat at the kitchen table, waiting for news of what was happening.

Father called Mother to come up after about half an hour had passed. I could hear raised voices.

When they came down, Father herded Scotty and I into the kitchen for a "family meeting". He sat us down with a very serious look on his face.

'Uncle Felix has returned from the desert. He was found wandering in Alaska, disoriented and lost. Auntie Cal has not been found yet. Felix has been in hospital for three days, and he'll remain there for two. After that, he'll be coming to stay with us for a while.'

Scotty and I were happy Felix was back and would be staying here, but the loss of Cal was a shock. Scotty began to cry. I held him.

'The desert was not kind to Uncle Felix. You are *not* to ask him *any* questions about what happened there. Mentioning Auntie Cal around him is strictly forbidden. Do you understand me?'

We nodded. We had never seen our father like this, so urgent and snappy.

'Felix has a small scar on his face now. You are not to ask him about this either. And if you start seeing anything, if anything changes, you tell me. *Do you understand me.*'

The night before Felix was going to arrive, I was eavesdropping on Mother and Father, arguing in hushed voices in their room. What else was I to do? They refused to give me any more details.

'I *told* you, this is a bad idea. We are putting our children in danger.'

'He is my *brother*, Kate. We take him in no matter what.'

'He got lost in the Great Basin, and ended up in *Alaska*. Something terrible happened, and to bring Felix here is dangerous. What if we get displaced too? You should have taught Lee and Scotty about this, about what *happens* to people in your family.'

'This is *over.* It is settled. I know how to be more careful than Felix. If something arrives with him, if something tries to displace us, I will stop it.'

'Did your dad teach you that? The crazy one who tried to fight them? He got marked, just like Felix. And then they came for him, him and you and Felix.'

'Do *not* bring dad into this.'

Father's voice had a hollow danger in it that ended the argument. I crept back to my room. For the first time, I did not feel entirely safe. Not at all. That argument was proof that my parents may not be able to protect me and Scotty. I was afraid.

Scotty and I watched out of my window the next morning, waiting for Felix's car. A few passed our house that looked similar to his, but my nervous excitement fizzled out as they kept on driving. Until, at last, a taxi pulled up and a tall, broad-shouldered man with the hood pulled up on his sweater climbed out.

Scotty and I fought over who would be first to greet him. Father broke us up, and answered the door. Felix stepped inside, and I rushed to hug him, but stopped when I saw his face.

A *small* scar? Father had to be joking. The entire left side of Uncle Felix's handsome face was burnt. His left eye was missing. His ear was gone. And worst by far, the scar had melted his cheek to the bone, so that his teeth were exposed, twisting the left side of his mouth into a permanent, mangled grin. The flesh surrounding it was a raw pink, tight and shiny.

Scotty gave him a trembling hug, as did I. It was still kind old uncle Felix, even though he was scarred. Even though he did not hug us back, or crack a joke about Father's thinning hair, or even smile.

Dinner was eaten quietly. We brushed our teeth. We went to bed at the time we were supposed to. Something was wrong, something I couldn't fix. Uncle Felix's eyes were hollow, his breathing slow. A terrible sadness hung around him, a darkness that blocked out light.

I cried that night. It felt as though I had lost Felix as well as Cal, even though he was here. I tried to close my eyes and go to sleep, but something woke me.

It was only a slight disturbance, nothing more, but my eyes snapped wide open. I sat up in bed, and stayed like that for some time. I needed fresh air, I decided. My window jammed, and while I stood there trying to rattle it open, I glanced outside.

Something was there, just beyond the treeline of the forest that stretched for miles behind my town. It  was almost invisible, crouching in the rippled moonlight filtering through the trees. I could only see half of it, the trunk of an oak tree almost obscuring it. I caught a glimpse of a pale shoulder and a flash of black feathers. 

  It wasn't looking at me, its vision instead fixed on the patio. I hadn't noticed, but Uncle Felix sat there, lounging in a deck chair, a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth. He didn't see me. He was staring back at the thing, defiance in his remaining eye. What was he doing?

  The patio door flung open, and Father rushed outside. He grabbed Uncle Felix by the shoulders and shook him. He was yelling something I couldn't hear. Father hurried him inside, casting a fearful glance towards the forest where the creature was now gone.

  Father's instructions the next morning were clear: Do not leave the house. Under *any* circumstances. Scotty didn't understand why, Mother sat in stony resolution and Uncle Felix looked annoyed. 

  It turned out, we didn't need to leave the house. The thing found us anyways.

  I woke with a jerk in the middle of the night. Whatever had woken me was still there. I could feel it, a presence that scraped against my mind. My closet door was ajar, the horrible cliche I had seen too many times in horror movies. I didn't want to look, but I had to.

  It was crouched half inside my closet, moonlight from the open window glinting off its puffy, pale skin. It was swollen, bloated, like it had been soaked in water. Moulting black feathers were stuck in its shoulders, like the creature was made of clay and someone had poked them roughly in, leaving spaces in between. Two black eyes bulged like tumours from its face.

  It waved at me. A sick, sour taste spread up my throat. I raised my hand hesitantly, before changing my mind. Its pulpy features twisted into a frown.

  I was about to call for Father or Mother, but Uncle Felix opened my door. The creature's face lit up with a gleeful grin when it saw him. Felix walked calmly into my room, picked me up and slung me over his shoulder, and walked out. I did not struggle, nor did I ask what was happening. I trusted Uncle.

  The second we were out into the passage, Uncle Felix sprinted. He ran with me out the front door - at this point I began to scream - and threw me roughly into the backseat of Mother's car, where Scotty sat also, tears running down his cheeks. Felix ran back into the house, leaving the car door open. I slammed it shut.

  'Did you see it too?' Scotty's voice wavered. All I could do was sit in silence. I was also crying.

  Mother shoved me into the middle seat, then sat beside me. Father drove, and Uncle Felix tore at his nails in the passenger seat. Father's gun rested in his lap.

  When we ran out of gas, it was nearly two a.m. Father recited every swearword he knew, Mother dug her nails into her arm until it bled, and Felix rested his head on his knees.

  'You are not to leave the car,' Felix hissed at us. 'I will handle this.'

  '*You* were marked by it. You leave this car, you won't come back.' Father sounded so angry that I feared the gun lying in his lap would come into use.

  The worst thing that could have happened next promptly happened. Scotty, poor terrified Scotty, flung his door open and ran into the night.

  What I did next made our situation much worse. But what else was I to do when my eight-year-old brother was out there alone? I ran after Scotty.

  The darkness was disturbingly thick, like clouds of swirling tar. I screamed for Scotty, over and over again. A faint howl was my only response.

  My throat was raw, a stitch in my side doubled me over and my lungs felt fit to explode when I came across Scotty. He was lying on the ground, his arms covering his head, and above him, hundreds of birds, all black - crows, ravens, blackbirds, starlings - dive-bombed him. Their shrill caws tore the night in two, their beaks and claws cutting into Scotty as they dived at him. There were so many that it was as if the darkness had come alive, a shrieking, whirling cloud of feathers.

  I tried to run to him, to help, but the birds drew me back. My arms bled where they had clawed me. And then I saw it. In a gap between two wings, in the centre of the swirling cloud of black, a single white bird hovered. Where its wings met its body, there were black feathers. Its eyes were black too, shiny like glass. They were fixed on the darkness behind me, where Uncle Felix skidded to a halt. His scar made the left side of his face look ghostly in the low light.

  'Come for me.' Felix's voice sounded so broken, so sad.

  The white bird dived for him, the screaming black flock following close behind. Felix ran.

  I went to Scotty, who lay whimpering, bleeding from hundreds of puncture marks where the birds had attacked him. I heard running footsteps. It was Father, who picked Scotty and I up and tore back to the car. He bundled us into the backseat.

  'Kate!'

  Mother was loading the shotgun, walking back the way we had come. The darkness yawned around her, swallowing her like a greedy mouth.

  'Stay there,' was all she said to us.

  Ten minutes passed. Fifteen. We sat in the backseat, Father in the front. We stayed deathly silent. I had so many questions, but they were stillborn as I changed my mind each time I opened my mouth. I heard a shot, then another. 

  After twenty minutes had gone by, something shifted in the darkness. It was Mother, a grim expression on her face. Blood trickled from her nose. A bird hung from her hand by its feet, a gaping, ragged hole in its chest. Red blood was tarred across its white feathers.

  Mother threw the shotgun into Father's lap. She slammed the bird down onto the dashboard.

  I'll sleep in my own bed for the remainder of tonight. I write this at my window, watching the bonfire Mother and Father have lit. They're burning the white bird's body, and Uncle Felix's things too. 

  Scotty sits beside me. The birds cut his arms and chest up pretty bad, but they didn't get his face or neck. He's upset that his favourite shirt got torn up. I'm upset that Uncle Felix won't be coming back.

  My closet door is shut, in case you were wondering. Scotty's favourite toy, a stuffed raven, the last gift Uncle Felix gave him, is being burnt too. He doesn't want it in his room.

  Father has promised to tell me more about what happened. Scotty will know too, when he is old enough. I'll edit this if I get the chance.
