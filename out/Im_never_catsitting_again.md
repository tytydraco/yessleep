After college, I had an existential crisis. I was 23 or 24 and had no idea what to do with my life. The high expectations of my parents made me insecure as hell, turning me into a lonely recluse. I lived in my room and the only real friends I had were a collection of potheads who frequented the same dealer. It is not surprising then that when Carl came knocking, I initially refused his request. Carl was one of the guys I occasionally hung around with in the shitty apartment that my dealer had claimed as the office for his unlawful business enterprise. We smoked a bit, talked about movies and played video games. It was an unspoken part of the deal that you also had to be the dealer’s friend or pretend to be, anyway. We all kind of got along but nobody liked Carl. He could say the most batshit insane things in such a decisive way that he would take over every conversation, even though we were talking about other stuff. He liked to bring up conspiracy theories mixed with vague shit about occult history and satanism. He always acted so goddamn smug, as if he knew more than we did. Whenever he opened his mouth, he would spoil every conversation with that nihilistic crap of his, pretending that he knew our True Masters and that soon a reckoning would come and how ancient texts revealed the true meaning of life within life. The last time I met him at our dealer’s place, I could not help but make a joke about him, being the messiah or something like that. The others had laughed and Carl left, quite embarrassed. 

So imagine my surprise when the king of truth and demons called me up one day, asking me to babysit his cat. I first thought he was joking but he repeated the question. ‘I’m serious. I’m on a camping trip and Beelzebub needs to get fed. I’m only asking you because you seem like a chill dude and honestly? The other guys are sheeple. You speak for yourself. I wouldn’t trust them to wipe their own asses. So yeah, I’ll pay you fifty bucks if you stay at my house for one night and feed my cat.’ 

I quickly thought of an excuse, said goodbye and put down the phone. What can I say? I didn’t like it when Carl was around so why would I ever go to his house and watch his cat?

A day later I called him back. My dad had given me his speech about adulthood and responsibility for the sixth time that week and while he did not say it, it sounded like a threat. ‘Earn money or we will disown you’ That’s what I heard. So in order not to get kicked out of my own house I decided to watch his stupid cat for a night and get paid in the process. He sounded relieved when I called him back. Carl provided me with some instructions for his cat and told me where I could find the keys to the house. 

A week later I drove up to his place. He never mentioned he lived out in the woods. His house was a small 1 story wooden cottage out in the middle of nowhere. I found the keys, opened the door and was greeted by the most ugly creature in all of human existence. Beelzebub was too pretty a name for this cat because holy shit, even Satan would not allow this cat in the filthy pits of hell. The animal looked like a walking lump of mold on which Carl had manually pasted his pubic hairs with superglue. Its eyes stared at me like the cat was permanently staring into the abyss and brought forth a chorus of dying soldiers in the trenches, praying to God to let them die. And the smell. Oh god, the smell. This cannot be put into words. I can’t think of any gross adjectives or filthy metaphors to describe the foul stink that this creature produced. All I can say was that I vomited three times in under ten seconds. After I had cleaned up after myself, I decided it would be best to just give Beelzebub his food now so I didn’t have to interact with him again. Carl had put some cat food on the table. I threw the food into the feeding bowl as if it were a grenade and bolted to the living room. While the cat devoured his food, my eyes fell on a thank you note Carl had left on the fridge. 

Hey man

thank you for watching Beelzebub for the weekend. Really means a lot to me. 

Satan loves you bro

See you, 

Carl

I remember thinking maybe Carl wasn’t such a dick after all. I sat down on the couch to watch some Netflix. Halfway into a Seinfeld episode, I had already watched a thousand times I fell asleep. I woke up when the walls came alive. 

Yes, the fucking walls came alive. I don’t even know where to begin. I was awakened by Beelzebub making a weird noise. I opened my eyes and saw the walls moving as if they were made out of slime or some shit. When I watched the walls, it wasn’t slime at all. The wooden walls had turned into skin. Yes, Carl‘s house was suddenly made out of skin as if someone made the cottage after they flayed a dude. At first, I thought I was dreaming but then Beelzebub’s stench hit me and welcomed me to the real world. I vomited for the fourth time that night. That’s when I noticed the floor. The floor was also skin. I watched as the large canvas of skin beneath me sucked up my vomit. Just slurped it down until it wasn't there anymore. That is when I decided to abandon Carl’s house. Fuck the money and fuck the cat.

I ran towards the front door but the house would not let me escape. The skin texture began to stretch out and take the shape of arms with hands, grasping for me. Hands everywhere, in all shapes and sizes. Trying to duck under a sweeping arm, I stumbled over Beelzebub, who hissed like the devil’s own personal devil. That’s when I thought of a plan to survive this wicked bullshit. While the hands were already pulling at my clothes and embracing me in a firm grasp, I picked up Beelzebub and threw her to the other side of the room. It was a bold move. If I had made the wrong decision, then my last action before being killed by the house made of skin would be a lame attempt at the world record for cat throwing with the world’s ugliest cat. Luckily, that was not the case. Beelzebub wooshed through the air and landed on his feet. For a few seconds, it looked at me as if it was proud to have survived my throw. Then arms came out of the wall and grabbed the cat in a chokehold. Luckily, this meant that the wall let go of me and focused all of its limbs on poor Beelzebub. The cat started to produce some high shrieking noises. I ran to the front door and before I went out, I caught a glimpse of the cat being absorbed into the walls. It looked like the arms were pushing the cat into the wall while the animal simultaneously began to transform into a living blob of skin. It wriggled and screamed and scratched. All in vain. Before I closed the door behind me, I looked one last time. No cat in sight. Only a house of skin. 

I ran to my car and drove back home. Now I don’t know what to do.  Haven’t heard anything from Carl yet and I’m afraid to go to my dealer in case I encounter him there. Should I call the police or something? Has anyone ever seen something similar?
