The pay wasn't bad but the smell of the place was rancid. A harsh mix of dog food, stale air and a touch of hot dog breath. I had to clean the stalls and work the front desk, begging people to take the animals home. I had that job for about 2 months, my roommate was so proud of me it was actually pretty sweet. Things changed however back at home, Buddy wouldn't bark. He wouldn't speak anymore. He would just lumber about the place causing the wooden floorboards to groan under his weight.

I wasn't finished with Buddy though, after paying back my debts I found myself once again at the local bottle shop. Just another visit, I promise. This time however I needed to make a detour. Grabbing 3 bottles of Absolut and placing them into my bag, I made my way out of the luminescent store. I hated the bottle shop, it was like my old job with a cubicle. A place you'd always force your way into with a tough time getting out.

So ever since I worked at the pound, I always had this deep itch. A deep obsession with this theory, and that night was the night I would succumb to my desires. I had built enough cash for a few more weeks at the apartment with some more bottles to boot, getting fired really wasn't much of an issue. Besides, I'd have more time on my hands, more time for Buddy.

Under the yellow glow next to the side gate of the pound, I gently placed my bag to the ground. I was very conscious not to be too harsh, I didn't want the bottles in there to break as a result of my tools. Snapping the lock with my bolt cutters I opened the whining gate bringing my supplies in. there were 3 cameras on my way into the holding room for the animals, I didn't care I was gonna get caught. Most of the dogs were sleeping so it was pretty quiet. There were about 22 cages, each containing dogs of different size, stature and breed. So many variables, this will be perfect. Folding my legs onto the ground I zipped down the bag and got a bottle of Absolut, my old stereo and my boxset of the audible Oxford Dictionary. *Let the experiment begin.*

“You want some? Huh? Cmooonn it's good for you.” I was swinging my bottle left and right in front of an old Border Collie Labradour cross. Its chocolate eyes were that of a void like nature. Taking out my notepad I jotted down some notes. ‘Labradoor Bordr ColLy crosS Is not GOod,’ sober me would have to figure that one out later. I rested my head against the wire cage, “You know I was gonna put you down right? What? You got nothing to say? Okay okaaayyy,” I took another swig, “nooooo I wasn't, you thought for a second though don't lie to me.” I turned up the stereo.

“Formula, formulae or formulas. Noun. A group of letters, numbers, and symbols which stand for a mathematical or scientific rule.” The deadpan voice from the speaker echoed through the hallway, causing an eruption of barks and growls. Now the sound was too loud, headache inducing. *Must've turned it too far up again,* I brought it back to a low hush, some nice background noise for the occasion.

“ROUGH ROUGH!”

“What's that? I should give you some? I already gave you some buddy you didn't want it!”

“Buddy yeah right Buddy, why can he speak but you cant, you're a dog. Come on, please speak.”

“ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH!” Its nose was buried by its small paws.

“Who am I kidding, you can't speak for shit.” There's my cue, the dog was a failed experiment, time to head home. “No I can't spend the rest of my bottles on you, my further studies lie on Buddy, salut my furry friend.” 

I tucked my Absolute back into my bag, the bottles joined together in a clinking sound and I zipped up the bag carefully. Looking up I heard the jingle of the front door. This was followed by a few high pitched yelps, they mostly dissipated as footsteps swung around the front desk with sounds of swinging keys.

“Whose in here hello?” Shit my boss. He must have a silent alarm in here. Opening the door to the all I was in he shone a flashlight on me in my pile, halfway from getting up.

“Oh uhhhh hello there,” *Shit how do I get out of this,* “Hey look ill pay for the gate I'm sorry.”

“What are you doing here at midnight?” When I got up he saw my bottle, about half done.

“Okay look man I can explain.” That was when the flood gates opened, I told him everything. I told him about my roommate, my alcoholism and the fact my dog tells me to kill my roommate but only when I drink. I even told him why I was there in the first place, all through a flurry of drunken speech. I couldn't see my boss’s face, he was still shining that light, blinding me from seeing his expression.

“I'm calling the cops.” He said with a soft tone.

“Please don't I have more work to-” I stopped in my trail of speech as I could see my ex boss lowering his flashlight, his face was unforgettable. You know the one, the one of disgust mixed with prolonged disappointment.

“Get out.”

The journey back to my apartment was quicker on the way back, streetlights blurred as I booked it down the middle of the street. I would say it was about 20 minutes before I was back to the base floor of my apartment. If I wasn't wanted for breaking and entering, I would've loved to look at the street a little longer. The red corolla parked slightly on the curb, the reflective nature of the puddles pooling. I thought it was odd that there were no stars out.

Slowly opening the front apartment door I saw Buddy seated on the couch. He looked as if he was my therapist. “*How are you mate, doing okay? Why don't you sit on the chair and tell me about this dog problem of yours?”* Of course the dog wasn't talking, he would soon however. Dragging a wooden chair over and sitting adjacent to Buddy, I cracked the next bottle of Absolut open.

“Hey Buddy we talk again.” I slurred, Buddy remained stationary. “What not got anything to say man? It's been monthhss let's catch up a bit.”

“Kill your roommate.”

“You're still going on about this? Still no I won't do it.”

“Kill your roommate tonight, it must happen.”

“First some answers Buddy, why were you read-”

“The police will arrive at your premises in 10 minutes in order to prosecute you for your previous actions. Throw your third bottle of liquor at your roommate.”

“How do you-”

“He will fall to the floor breaking parietal bone which will induce brain bleed. Death will occur usually within 3 to 4 minutes so you should perform this action-”

“NO! I SAY NO! I WON'T DO IT!” I wiped the spit from my face. 

“Kill your roommate or you will suffer the most dire of consequences.”

“I know what you are now, you are a BAD dog, you're bad for me!” Buddy remained unphased, “You used to be a good boy! What happened, why did you change?!”

“If you follow me you will be a king of kings, defy me and you will live in eternal darkness, with the rest.”

I had my jaw wide open, there was truly no time for discussion. I had the choice that would determine the rest of my life. The beady chocolate eyes of Buddy remained unblinking, paused until my next answer. Reaching into my duffel bag I grabbed the extra bottle of the liquor, wielding my last two bottles in both hands. Buddy changed form. No longer was Buddy in his sedentary state, his two front paws propped his mass off of the couch. A low growl hummed out of him. Raising both bottles above my head I was prepared to give it all away, to let this evil vanquish. Buddy smacked its paws onto the creaky floor once more, letting a fierce bark out. He began to charge, teeth bared, thick drops of saliva stuck to his neck like pale worms. 

He was about 2 meters away from me when he launched at me. As his left paw connected with my right shoulder, I slammed both bottles of glass down onto Buddy’s forehead. I then felt the full weight of Buddy as we both slammed into the tv behind us. I was winded, bad. I heard a deep rolling pop as my shoulder exited from its socket, it laid lagging behind my body as it slooped onto the floor. A deep fire burned as 221 pounds of weight pushed it further and further away from the socket. I was screaming with gritted teeth. Buddy rolled over, off my left shoulder, feeling the weight release off of me. *Steady breaths in and out.* I was choking on air, uncalculated motions of my lungs prevailed, wild frantic breaths. Air was entering but not filtering, I caught myself from falling to my right with a sturdy hand and I stayed there. *In and out*. When I caught my breath, I looked over to see Buddy regaining motion. First his head lolled up facing the corner, with the underside of his paw still trapped under his belly. He dragged his paw out from his frame and slammed it into the wooden floorboards. Buddy’s head swung up and down like was nodding at a statement the corner made. He turned his head at me, fragments of glass stuck to Buddy’s forehead. A thick drizzle of blood flowed down between his eyes, mixing in with the froth surrounding his snarl. The eyes were still dark but with a hint of red, his eyes were stinging.

When Buddy raised himself from the floor, I cowered backwards, attempting to grab anything else I could throw. Buddy stumbled around the back of the couch, hiding from my sight.

“HEY! Get out of here! The dog! Get out!” I yelled out. My roommate was already around the corner.

“What the hell is going on?!” His thin hands grabbed onto the side of the breakfast bar. Craning his neck behind the couch, he slowly began to walk backwards. I could now see Buddy’s head appear on the right of the couch, about a few meters away from him. When Buddy fastened his pace from a stumble to a gallop, my roommate sprinted for the door, swinging it nearly off its hinges. Buddy was gaining fast, my roommate raised up his leg and sent a swift foot into the direction of Buddy’s snout. Buddy opened his jaw, disappearing the foot into the mouth. A scream followed as my roommate yanked his foot away. His right foot was filtered through Buddy’s sharp fangs. Deep rivers of red emanated out of his foot right up to the top of his ankle. His foot sat in a weird position in comparison to the rest of his leg, his heel connecting for a second with the base of his calf, swinging effortlessly. The next and last thing I saw of my roommate alive was him letting go of the door, hobbling out into the hallway outside the apartment. Rumbling erupted from the floor as Buddy launched into a hot pursuit.

I don't know in what order, but I heard screams mixed with thuds and growls. I was planted. The liquor in my system was still prevalent but was fading quick. A harsh reality was washing over me. I needed to get up, to help. Flames licked the left side of my top half as my arm swung like a pendulum clock. Limping my way into the hallway I turned to face a stained row of doors. The only light present being the moonlight sifting through the back window at the end of the hall. 

*Growl, rip, thud.*

*Thud, rip growl.*

*Rip thud thud.*

The dog had my roommate in his jaws. Buddy’s fangs seeped into the side of his torso effortlessly. My roommate's head and limbs were knocking on the sides of the walls. Back and forward over and over again. Sharp angles of bone stuck out from all appendages, making Buddy's job of carrying him even easier. Buddy turned his head around to face me, my roommate's temple dragged along the right wall as the dog forcefully turned around, his chew toy still in his jaws.

I was sniffling. I was tired. I was walking towards that thing I once called my Buddy. 

The dog was standing firm, territorial. I leaned on the side of the wall and just watched the sight for what felt like minutes. I whispered through a raspy breath.

“Go.”

The dog swung his body around, and my roommate's head hit the wall with a crack on the left wall in a whip-like manner. The hall shook as the dog began to gallop away. The change in motion caused me to slump down into a pile on the floor. Squinting at an irregular angle, I saw the dog with his prey launch himself through the window at the end of the hall. My roommates head and feet gave way on either side of the window, causing a synchronized snapping sound, complimenting the sound of glass breaking. The shattering glass seemed to freeze midair, reflecting pale moonlight like a macabre disco ball.

*Silence* 

I was alerted back into the action with the sound of a siren and an earth shattering crash. A metallic howl pierced its way out from the opening in the window made by the dog. It took me a while to reach the window, by then I completely lost the effects of alcohol so it was only pain that resided within me. My shoulder felt irreparable and I must've twisted my ankle in an odd fashion when I hit that corner. Either way I made it to the window. My limbs were illuminated in a fierce pale light as I rested over the base of the window, cutting my arms in the process on the jagged breakage of the glass.

The dog was inanimate, sideways on top of a red Corolla, a mangled mess of exposed bone and shards of glass. The dog's jaw was wide open, a pool of red drool was dripping out. My roommate was face down about a metre to the left of the smashed car, his innards pooling in the shadows. A large crater wrapped around the dog. The headlights of the vehicle were flashing sporadically, screaming for attention. The howling siren from the car echoed through the block, combining with the sounds of police sirens. Exhaling, the steam from my breath greying out the scene. I found the stars. There they were sprinkled around the scene, shards from the window reflecting moonlight.

Commotion from the street became muffled as I turned away. Hobbling back into my apartment I seated myself on the couch. It smelled like dog. I turned my head into the kitchen. Sitting alone was a spilt tin bowl of water and a torn collar.
