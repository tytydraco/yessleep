I (30F) and my Fiance (32M) have been together for a little over two years. Some people might think that our relationship has moved fast, but when you know you know. I met Dustin at a Christmas party; he was a coworker of one of my friends and we hit it off right away. We went on our first official date a few days later and once I slept over his place it seemed like I never really left. I think I fell in love with Dustin almost immediately. He’s the kind of guy that you’d think only exists in movies that are written by women. Kind, considerate, funny without punching down and handsome to boot. He had a good relationship with his parents, held down a steady job with decent income, and was always happy to stay in with me on Friday nights to binge watch our latest favorite show. It was only a few months after our one year anniversary that we seriously started talking about getting married and not much longer after that did he propose on my 30th birthday. Like I said, when you know you know. Now, I’m not so sure.

We’d been planning our wedding for about 6 months when I first started noticing things were different. Dustin had been the same as always, hard worker during the day and doting Fiance in the evening, cooking us dinner and pouring over every little detail about decor and catering with me. I think it was mid-winter because when I got up early in the morning like I usually do to empty my bladder the house felt a little chillier than normal. I could hear the old furnace hissing and creaking, heating our old home with the occasional pop and rattle of old machinery. I wrapped myself up in my bathrobe and wandered downstairs, bleary eyed and bothered by the unusual chill of the hardwood underneath my bare feet. When I got to the kitchen I noticed the back door of our house open. Not just slightly ajar, but wide open, cold New England air seeping into the kitchen and blurring the boundary between Inside and Outside.

A shiver ran down my spine, more so from the fear that someone had somehow broken into the place and was waiting somewhere in the darkness. I flipped the light switch quickly, feeling much more awake and alert. There was nothing, no footprints or misplaced items. No creeps hiding in the cabinets either (I had woken Dustin and made him check every single spot I could think of). He calmly assured me I must have forgotten to lock the door behind me when I’d taken out the garbage and that the wind blew it open before going back to bed. Dustin, ever so level headed, managed to fall back asleep within minutes. 

As I laid down beside him I curled in a little closer to the heat of his body, my mind threatening to wander into unable-to-sleep territory. As if his unconscious mind could sense this, Dustin reached out and pulled me closer to him like a kid grabbing his stuffed toy for comfort. It quickly put me at ease and I was able to drift not long after, feeling the steady rise and fall of breath in his chest. In the morning Dustin woke me up with a forehead kiss and asked if I wanted breakfast in bed. I remember thinking, God, what did I do to deserve such a good man?

It was only a few nights later that it happened again. This time as I rolled off the bed and shuffled toward our bedroom door I noticed that Dustin wasn’t in bed either. That itself wasn’t super weird, but notable since Dustin sleeps like the dead and almost never gets up in the middle of the night. Maybe I’m overthinking it but I'm a pretty light sleeper and I’ve never noticed him get up in the middle of the night since we started dating. I figured he must have had a lot more to drink before bed tonight than usual or perhaps he had an upset stomach and didn’t think much more of it. I’d almost forgotten that he was missing from our bed until I’d finished in the bathroom, made it back to bed, and had been trying to fall asleep for a minute or two. At that point It begun to dawn on me that he was still out of bed, and he couldn’t have been in the bathroom since we only had one in the house and I was just in it. I would have gone back to sleep but my mind started racing, my anxiety started getting the better of me. What if he was sick, or there had been some kind of emergency? What if he was sleepwalking and made his way somewhere unsafe? What if he was meeting up with someone in the middle of the night? I almost palmed my face and groaned, annoyed my brain would even consider presenting me with the idea that Dustin was cheating on me. Dustin was perfect. We were getting married in 5 months. It was probably nothing. My eyes darted from the ceiling fan to his bedside table, spotting his cell phone face-up and charging. That gave me some comfort, I remember thinking he wouldn’t be able to leave the house to cheat on me without taking his phone.

But if he wasn’t cheating on me, where the hell was he?

I got up again, cell phone flashlight in hand, and made my way out of our room. I called for him a few times in a quiet voice, half-remembering that if you wake a sleepwalking person that something bad might happen. I made my way downstairs, checking each room along the way only to find… nothing. I was about to turn back to double check the upstairs when I noticed the soft whistling sound of wind leaking into our home. When I shone my phone’s flashlight onto the door I found it open, again-- not open all the way, like it had been before, but like someone had pulled it closed lightly behind them without bothering to actually pull it. I almost forgot about Dustin at that moment, annoyed that the back door was open yet again, not only leaving us vulnerable but also letting precious hot air into the winter night. My palm against the door, ready to push it closed and lock the bolt when I froze-- Through the frosty pane set into the door I spotted a blur of pink and brown. I could feel my heartbeat leap into my throat and my muscles tense before my sleep-addled brain could catch up. Instead of pushing it shut I grabbed the doorknob and swung it open. 

Dustin was standing there, his back to me, shirtless skin dusky pink in the moonlight. Forgetting any half-truths I’d heard about sleepwalking I quickly reached out to him, my hands finding his shoulders freezing cold like he’d been standing there for hours.

“Dustin,” I remember saying. “What are you doing out here? It’s freezing.” He turned around in my grasp, his bare feet making crescent shapes in the light dusting of snow left on the back porch. He smiled at me, his eyes distant, almost as if he’d just woken up. I felt the tense of my muscles relax. He *was* sleepwalking, after all. And my waking hadn’t broken him either. Maybe the stress of the wedding or his job was weighing on him and his subconscious was trying to sort it out in the wrong ways. “Sarah,” he said quietly. “Let’s go back to bed.”

In the morning I asked him if he remembered last night, but he just shook his head and kissed me on the forehead. I made a mental note to double check the deadbolt before going to bed that night and mentioned it to Dustin as well. He agreed to do so, seeming completely unshaken by my recounting of the story, instead delving into discussion on which color his groomsmen should wear at the wedding- dark blue or gray?

I’m the first to admit that I’m not perfect, and while I’ve painted Dustin to be the best partner ever, I know that it’s not possible for human beings to be without flaws. Dustin forgets to brush his teeth before bed some nights, yells a little too loud for my liking when watching the Sunday night game, little things like that. Maybe it’s because my own fucked up family bullshit-- no, definitely because my own family bullshit— but I’ve never really been able to quiet the anxiety in my head that now and again rears its ugly head and asserts that Dustin is cheating on me. Stupid, I know, because Dustin has never done anything to suggest that he would and I trust him. But, I don’t know, I guess after seeing what my own parent’s went through there’s a part of me that knows that anything is possible and sometimes your brain will overlook the red flags because everything else seems so good. So, yes, I did go through his phone.

It had been a week or two since the sleepwalking incident. Things had been going well and I’d been double, even triple checking the backdoor before bed each night. Maybe because things were going so well the self-sabotage started to kick in. Dustin was in the shower and I was doom-scrolling in bed when I noticed his cell phone light up. It was on the bedside table, face up and charging so the notification caused the phone to illuminate his side of the room with a soft yellow glow. It was just a small glimmer out of the corner of my eye that faded away in moments. And then again. And again. Curiosity and dread took hold as I found myself leaning across the mattress, peering at his lock screen. A mobile game notification, a reminder to check the locks, a text from his family group message. Of course Dustin wasn’t cheating on me and I felt stupid for even considering it. I sat there for a few moments longer in stillness before reaching over and palming the cellphone. It was almost without thinking, just pure impulse, typing in his passcode and immediately skimming through his texts. Did his family hate me? Was he texting someone whose name was saved as something inconspicuous? Maybe he was messaging someone on Instagram? My mind went to the door being open, Dustin out there in the middle of the night. Was he meeting with someone? Was he sneaking out, and I caught him? 

Of course I didn’t find anything on Dustin’s phone. I think I’d already known I wasn’t going to find anything, but a part of me wanted to and that was what made me feel worst of all. I had already put the phone back in the same spot when Dustin got back from his shower. He had a towel wrapped loosely around his waist and one on his head, drying his would-be long locks wrapped up inside it. He was beautiful and good and the guilt was eating me alive, so I told him. I told him I had looked through his phone, and not just looked at it but really looked, reading texts and DMs and digging for something secret. 

Dustin looked disappointed, maybe a little hurt, but he was quick to accept my apology. I remember the knots in my stomach when he leaned over the bed and kissed me, cupping my face in his hands and saying, “Sarah, I love you, I want to marry you, I have nothing to hide. If you need to look at my phone, then look-- that’s why I gave you the passcode in the first place.” I felt dumb, guilty for ever distrusting him in the first place, and especially so after he had so easily forgiven me. Even now, writing this, I have to remind myself that he *was right*. He did give me the passcode, he wasn’t even upset, so why bother punishing myself over something already forgiven? The guilt started to lessen in the coming days as we resumed planning the wedding, busy with work and family and all the little things that preoccupy our minds between then and now.

I’d gotten home from work a bit early one evening and decided I wanted to give Dustin a nice surprise. He had been so reassuring and good to me with all the pre-wedding nerves and post-snooping guilt I was dealing with. I wasn’t completely sure what I wanted to do, but I knew that a good meal and a happy ending to the night was certainly well deserved. Even finding the back door unlocked didn’t dissuade me from my good mood, though I made a note to ask Dustin if we needed to change the locks since we continued to have this issue. Since he wasn’t home yet I decided to freshen up with a shower, eager to remind Dustin just how much I loved him.

I was doing my usual routine, listening to a podcast while shaving my legs, a deep conditioning treatment sitting on my scalp. I turned to place my razor back on the shelf when I saw a dark shape through the shower curtain. My fight-or-flight response kicked in, gluing me in place. I remember telling myself it was probably just my towels lumped together in a brain-tricking shape when suddenly the lights went out. I couldn’t help but yelp as darkness fell around me, leaving only the sounds of rushing water and podcast midroll. It was then that the bathroom door slammed shut, another scream escaping my lips. Beneath the noise of it all, including my now rapid breaths, I swear I heard something rush down the hall. Heavy footfalls. And then nothing. 

I snatched my phone, wet fingers slipping against the pause button and fumbling for the flashlight. Using it to ease my nerves rather than guide the way I quickly crossed the bathroom and found the light switch sitting in the off position. Was this some kind of weird prank? Or was someone in our home? “Dustin?” I called, wet feet leaving small puddles behind me as I wandered further from the shower. “That’s not fucking funny, Dustin!”

I’d made it to our bedroom when I felt someone wrap their arms around me, making me jump so hard I nearly left my own skin. I couldn’t so much as struggle before I heard him. “Sarah,” Dustin crooned in my ear. “I’ve missed you.” I nearly threw him off of me the way I turned around so fast, only to find him standing there with a small smile, work shirt and slacks damp from where he pressed against my still wet skin. 

“What the fuck was that about?” I demanded, feeling half wild. “You’ve never done shit like this before, you know I don’t like pranks. What the fuck?”  Dustin seemed taken aback.

“Babe, I just got home, what are you talking about?” The small smile on his face didn’t falter, though certainly didn’t express the same joy it had before getting reamed out by me. 

“The bathroom-- I was taking a shower and you turned off the lights. And slammed the door, too. What were you--” but he cut me off, his brows starting to furrow.

“Sarah, I just got home. Are you sure it wasn’t the wind shutting the door? A faulty electrical switch? You know the house is old.” I’m sure he could tell his excuses weren’t very convincing because he added, “If you’re scared I can check it out. Wait here, I’ll look around.” It was all he could do to prevent me from calling 911 right then and there.

I sat on the edge of our bed holding onto the edges of my towel tightly, letting the sheets beneath me absorb whatever moisture had been left on my legs. If it hadn’t been Dustin, then what turned off the lights? Could it really have been a faulty electrical switch? That didn’t explain that I’d seen something move. Heard something, *someone*, scurry away. Again I thought about calling the police but if it was really nothing, or if Dustin had been playing a prank on me, then what good would that do? Calling the cops on your Fiancé over a prank didn’t seem like a good idea at the time, and if it had been someone there really weren’t any places someone would be able to hide in our home. We had no crawl space, no false walls or roomy closets. It was then the guilt of snooping through his phone popped its ugly head back into my mind and all at once I put it from my mind. It probably *was* the wind or faulty electrical. It *was* an old house after all, and the locks had been so unreliable, who's to say it wasn’t just the doings of an old house? 

Dustin returned to the bedroom and placed another kiss on my damp forehead before leaning down to look me in the eyes. “Sarah,” he said. “No one’s in the house. All the doors are locked, and the only window open was the one in the bathroom. It was probably the wind, right?”

I nodded, a nervous laugh bubbling up from my chest as the thought occurred to me, “Or it was a ghost.” Dustin and I shared a love for scary movies as well as an unshakable practicality that convinced me that, while ghosts weren’t real, it would probably be cool if they were. Dustin shared my laugh and smoothed a hand over my wet hair, leaning over to kiss me again.

“Yes, a very horny ghost that wanted to see you naked.” Standing there over me, my protector, I felt my heart swell. Why wait until after dinner? I thought. He deserves his surprise now.

I invited my sister Alison to the house for dinner that week. While the shower incident had thoroughly spooked me Dustin had done a good job of settling my nerves. But still, I didn’t like being alone in the house after what had happened, so I’d invited Alison over when I knew that Dustin was going to be home late. I figured spending some time with my little sister would put me at ease, and we were due for some sibling time anyway. Alison brought potato salad and buns while I provided the burgers and drinks. That was the plan anyway, because when I went to grab the patties from the fridge I found them missing. Not only were the burgers gone, but the chicken I was going to defrost for next night’s dinner was missing too. 

Maybe some of you can explain how frozen meat just goes missing like that, but I’ll point out that this was not the first time I’d noticed food gone missing. Our fridge and freezer had been filled up with sale meat from last week's grocery shopping and it seemed like every couple days I would open the freezer and find something missing. A rack of ribs they’d sold for less than $2/lb. Two steaks they sold for $12 at the Chinese market down the street. A bag of chicken drumsticks I’d divided up the week before. When you live in a house with two people, frozen food is a staple as we don’t often need to cook large portions. Plus I planned out our dinners with Dustin every Sunday almost religiously. I knew what was in our freezer, what should be at least, and it’s not like a rack of ribs can just walk away. 

I called Dustin on the phone to ask if he knew what was going on. Maybe he’d had a coworker who was going through a hard time and needed some help with groceries? It felt like a reach, but I felt like I was losing my mind. Dustin did too, apparently, because with a little laugh he suggested that work and wedding planning was stressing me out so much I was forgetting what we’d bought and what we’d cooked. The ribs? *I thought we had those last week*. The steaks? *Never seen them*. Dustin was so calm, so sure, I found myself nodding along to his explanation. Of course I was stressed out, I probably forgot to even buy burgers in the first place. I apologized to Alison for the change of plans and ordered us takeout, boxing up the potato salad to enjoy another night. She didn’t care about dinner, but she did care about Dustin. She liked Dustin enough but she didn’t really love him; there were no grievances in particular, just an overprotective little sister that sees little value in the male species. 

“What does he mean ‘misplaced it’? How does someone even misplace meat? You’re, like, the most organized person I know.” She prodded me with her socked foot from across the couch, trying to stir a reaction from me. “Are you sure you wanna go through with this?”

“The wedding?” I scoffed “Yes, Alison, I’m fine. Dustin is right, the stress is just getting to me. You know he’s good for me, you can’t deny it.” She couldn’t really argue this. Dustin was the nicest guy I’d ever dated, and he never did or said anything nearly as fucked up as some of my exes.

“Let’s relax then,” she offered with a sigh, digging into the orange chicken sitting on her lap. “Wanna watch a scary movie?”

That night it happened again. I lazily reached out in front of me and grabbed my phone to check the time— 3:18 am. My bladder reminded me why I had woken up in the first place and I shifted slowly up and out of bed. Dustin was missing. Dread started to seep into my stomach, waking me from my blissful dreamlike state with a cold sweat. I paused, took a deep breath, and reminded me of what my therapist had told me. It’s almost never the worst case scenario. My brain is trying to trick me. I’m sure everything is fine. Semi-calmed, I got up and made my way down the hall. The bathroom door was closed and I could hear the faint sound of running water. 

There, I told myself, Dustin is just in the bathroom. Fine. While waiting for my turn I made my way downstairs, grabbed a glass of water, and double checked the locks. After relieving my bladder on the trip back upstairs I made my way back to the bedroom and curled back up in the warm sheets. Time passed slowly. I was almost asleep again when my brain had begun to register that Dustin still wasn’t in bed. And he couldn’t have been in the bathroom, since I’d just been in there. Maybe we passed each other without noticing? 

I peeked open my eyes, peering at his half of the bed. Empty. Water glass full. Phone charging. I laid back down. Seconds, maybe minutes passed, before I peeked again. Still nothing. I reached over, tapped his phone screen to check for notifications. Nothing, again. I laid down, defeated, repeating my new mantra “I’m sure it’s nothing, it’s almost never the worst case scenario, it’s nothing, it’s almost never--” Suddenly this strange feeling washed over my body, every hair standing on end. It was the kind of feeling you get when someone is watching you in public and you don’t see them but your body just *knows*. “It’s nothing,” I thought to myself, a little more forcefully. “It’s just your anxiety. It’s your brain, tricking you, It’s nothing.” I started whispering this out loud without intending to, trying to coax my body out of its rigid fear response. I squeezed my eyes shut and started counting my breaths, trying to find some sense of calm. It must have been the scary movie we watched, mixed with the stress and the nerves and everything going on. I was consciously trying to slow down and steady my shaking inhale when I noticed it. Another voice? No, not voice, but breath. As if Dustin were right beside me. Or under me. The nearly unmistakable rise and fall of breath, in through a whistling nose and out through pursed lips like my therapist had taught me to do when I was nervous. I held my breath for a moment, convinced it was my own breath, my own brain playing tricks on me. Still, the sound remained. Something loud and guttural screeched off in the far distance akin to that of a fisher cat breaking my thoughts. “It’s nothing,” I told myself. “It’s just an animal, it’s just a windy old house, it’s nothing.”

 I laid there for what felt like hours, fists balled around my blankets, focusing on keeping my eyelids shut tight. Somehow I managed to drift off.

In the morning Dustin was awake before I was. I remember him waking me with a soft hand on my shoulder and a kiss on the crown of my head. I melted into his touch before the memories of last night started to return to my waking mind, nearly jolting me awake. “Where were you last night?” I pointed at him, as if this gesture would heighten the threat of my accusatory statement. 

“Right here,” he said, patting the bed. His expression was so simple, so calm, it kind of made me feel angry.

“No, no you weren’t,” I countered. “You were gone, again! And you’re never out of bed like that.” He just shook his head at me, smiling but confused.

“What do you mean, Sarah?”

“I wake up to pee in the middle of the night all the time and you’re always sleeping and this is the third time you’ve just…disappeared! Were you outside again? Are you sleepwalking or something?” I remember my voice cracking here and Dustin reaching over to hand me his glass of water, which I thirstily emptied. While I gulped down the water Dustin offered his explanation: "Sarah, you had a bad dream, remember? I didn’t go anywhere. You woke up scared and talking about some nightmare and then you went back to sleep. I was only half awake myself so I don’t really know what it was about.”

I stared at him incredulously. “Dustin, no, I was not sleeping. I was wide awake, I got up out of bed to pee, you were in the bathroom…” I trailed off as his smile grew wider.“See, you remember where I was. I just went to use the bathroom after you did.”

“No, I was waiting--” He cut me off with his hand on my cheek, smoothing out the sleep from my left eye.

“Baby, Sarah, you look exhausted. All this wedding planning is driving you up the wall and you’re starting to get nightmares.” my nose wrinkled at the smell of his morning breath as he leaned in to kiss me. That was the end of the conversation.

I remember as he walked off to the bathroom his kiss lingered on my lips, smelling like raw meat.

This was around when Dustin suggested I stay with my sister for a little bit, get my mind off of the wedding planning. I didn’t think it was all that weird at the time, honestly I felt like it was a good idea. Alison always grounded me, knew what to say to make that anxious voice in my head shut up. And even though she didn’t love Dustin (nor any of our male species) she was reasonable and would be a good sounding board to talk to about everything that had been going on. Even now I feel weird saying that. Was *anything* going on? So Dustin had been out of bed a few times, doors were left unlocked. Aside from that time in the bathroom nothing else had haunted me. And there was that one night with the breathing, but that could be chalked up to anxiety, or even a nightmare like Dustin had said. But at that point, even after everything Dustin had done to calm my nerves, I still had doubts.

I spent the weekend with Alison and it was great. We went shopping, did some gardening, even visited our parents. It was only three days but when I left I felt different somehow. More whole, I suppose. My sleep was improving, I wasn’t waking up more than once to use the bathroom every other night or so, and I was able to fall asleep without having to watch Youtube to doze off. This generally remained the same when I got home. Things were good. Dustin and I continued planning the wedding, Alison came over for dinner some weeks, I even began to forget to double check the locks and come morning the back door would always be closed and safely bolted. Things progressed like this for several weeks, our wedding swiftly approaching. It was a little over a month before our wedding that it happened. The reason why I’m even writing this in the first place.

It was like clockwork. Bed at 10:30, wake up at 3-something, use the bathroom, go back to bed. This particular night was no different. Dustin and I were talking about the final details of our honeymoon we needed to decide on before bed. He read a little bit while I scrolled on my phone. When I got up to use the bathroom he was soundly asleep, facing away from me and sprawled out in a way you do when the weather starts getting warmer. He was in the same position when I got back to bed. It must have been 30, maybe 60 minutes after I’d fallen back asleep that I woke up again. It wasn’t unheard of that I’d wake up multiple times a night, but since getting my stress in check it hadn’t happened too often. I could feel soft breath tickling my nose, alerting me to Dustin’s presence before my eyes even opened. I remember feeling happy, thinking to myself how wonderful it would be to wake up to this man that I would love for the rest of my life. I was about to roll over when I decided to peek through my lashes at my sleeping beauty. Part of me wishes that I had just gone back to bed.

When I opened my eyes I found Dustin staring back at me. Fully awake, alert, wide eyed. He was laying there on his side, watching me with an unreadable expression in the dim pre-dawn light. “Dustin,” I whispered shakily. “You scared me. What are you doing?” I clocked the wet shine of teeth as he began to smile in the darkness, his hands reaching out to cup my face. When his fingers made contact they felt wet on my skin, slimy and smelling of raw meat.

“Shh,” he whispered through a Cheshire grin. A sound ripped through the silence from downstairs, first loud and heavy like bulky furniture tipping over, then a scream, and I wrenched myself out of bed before I could form a thought. I ran, literally ran from the bedroom, shouting into the emptiness of the house that anyone who had broken in should leave because I have a gun and I had called the cops-- only one of which was true, my phone pressed hard against my ear as I hurriedly reported what sounded like someone breaking into our house to the dispatch on the other end of the line. I remember waiting for the police to arrive in my locked car, too afraid to reenter the house, chewing on my bottom lip until it began to bleed. It was stupid- no, *I* was stupid, it was clear that everything that had been happening was starting to line up. Even without the space for it, someone had to have been sneaking into our home. Stealing our food, watching me in the shower. Why hadn’t I called the cops earlier? Tears pricked my eyes as I spoke to dispatch. 

Dustin hadn’t gotten out of bed.

By the time I had really processed this fact, trying to remember if he had run after me we were wrapping up with the police report. The female officer addressed us both, snapping me out of my reverie. She said that no one had been found inside our home and there was no evidence of a forced entry. There was a broken side table but she mentioned that the leg was broken and likely had snapped itself under the force of the stuff we’d piled high on top of it in preparation for the wedding. The officers suggested we get a security camera and, to ease our nerves, stated they would send someone over to watch the house in the early morning for the next week. The screaming was probably just a wild animal, like the fisher cat I’d heard before. I was only half paying attention because my brain had begun to register the feeling of Dustin standing beside me, his arm now lazily wrapped around my shoulders in a protective gesture.

“Sarah and I will be alright officers, thank you so much.” I remember him saying those exact words. I remember it because I thought, *will we be alright?* Didn’t we hear someone in our house? That scream, I don’t think I could forget it. And Dustin’s eyes…I glanced up at him as the police officer had turned to leave. “I can’t believe I slept through all that sound though,” he laughed. He laughed? 

“Dustin, what are you talking about? You were wide awake and you were staring at me. It was really creepy. Did you even get up when the intruder broke in? I didn’t see you get up.” I could feel my heart beat rising in my chest, the familiar tight squeeze of blood constricting in my skin.

“Sarah,” he smiled at me, squeezing his arm that had been wrapped around me. “Baby, I was dead asleep when the table broke. That’s when I woke up and I followed after you downstairs. I even checked out the house while you called the cops.”

“No, Dustin, you were awake and you were staring at me--”

“Sarah, that’s literally impossible. You know I sleep like the dead.”

I continued speaking as he replied, as if the words were rushing out of my mouth like running water. “No, you were staring at me. You were staring at me and smiling and you didn’t even blink and then someone broke into our house and you just laid there? You don’t even seem concerned. You told the cops we’d be fine, but someone was in our house, Dustin. What the fuck going on?”

“Baby,” he said. “I wasn’t awake.” he turned away from me, a lazy smile still hanging from his lips. I swear I saw the gristle of tendon stuck between his bottom teeth. “Let’s go inside. I’ll make us breakfast.” 



Edit: I’m writing this from Alison’s house. I’ve been here since the incident and I’m seriously considering canceling our wedding. Not only are we clearly being targeted by someone, Dustin just seems so relaxed about all of this? Am I over-reacting? I love Dustin, I know he loves me too, but I can’t stop thinking about his eyes that morning. And the smell of meat… I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the stress getting to my head. I must be going crazy. I think I’m going to call him today to see if we can talk it out.
