I didn’t believe in rules lists.

That’s the first thing you need to understand.

I’d read enough r/nosleep posts to know the pattern: isolated location, mysterious job, laminated sheet of “rules,” escalating consequences. Entertaining, sure—but clearly fictional. Real life didn’t work like that. Real danger didn’t announce itself with bullet points.

That belief is the only reason I’m still alive.

And it’s the reason three other people aren’t.

I took the job because I was desperate.

That’s another cliché, but clichés exist for a reason. I was two months behind on rent, my phone was disconnected, and my student loan servicer had started leaving voicemail messages that felt more like threats than reminders.

The listing was handwritten, taped to a corkboard at a gas station just off Highway 17.

NIGHT CARETAKER WANTED REMOTE PROPERTY NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED CASH PAID WEEKLY DO NOT CALL. ARRIVE BEFORE SUNSET.

There was an address written underneath, shaky but legible, and a date: October 3rd.

No company name. No contact number. No explanation.

I should have walked away.

Instead, I took a picture of the posting and drove home thinking about how “cash paid weekly” could solve almost all of my problems.


---

The property was farther out than I expected.

Cell service disappeared about fifteen minutes after I left the highway. The road narrowed, asphalt giving way to cracked concrete, then gravel. Trees crowded in from both sides, their branches arching overhead like ribs.

The GPS froze, then recalculated, then finally gave up altogether.

I followed the address manually, counting mile markers until even those vanished.

By the time I reached the property, the sun was already dipping low, the sky bruised purple and orange.

There was a gate.

Not a fancy one—just rusted iron bars welded together, hanging crooked on one hinge. A hand-painted sign was zip-tied to it:

CLOSE GATE BEHIND YOU

I drove through.

I wish I hadn’t.


---

The house was wrong.

That’s the only word that fits.

It wasn’t abandoned—too intact for that. But it wasn’t lived-in either. The windows were dark, reflective, like they were watching me instead of the other way around. The paint was an uneven off-white, flaking in long strips that reminded me of shedding skin.

No lights. No cars. No sound except the wind pushing through the trees.

I parked near the front steps and shut off the engine.

The silence was immediate and heavy, like the world had been muted.

That’s when I noticed the paper.

It was nailed to the front door.

Not taped. Not pinned.

Nailed.

Four rusted nails, one in each corner, punched straight through a thick sheet of yellowed paper.

I remember thinking, That’s dramatic.

I remember laughing.


---

The paper was titled simply:

RULES FOR NIGHT CARETAKER

There were twelve of them.

I didn’t read them right away.

That was my second mistake.

Instead, I knocked on the door.

No answer.

I knocked again, louder.

Still nothing.

The door wasn’t locked.

It creaked open just enough to reveal a dark hallway beyond. Cold air spilled out, carrying a smell I couldn’t place at first—something metallic, something old.

I stepped inside.

The door slammed shut behind me.


---

I jumped, heart hammering, but when I tried the handle it opened easily. No lock. No trick.

Just… a warning.

The interior was sparsely furnished: a wooden table, two chairs, a couch with threadbare cushions. No decorations. No photos. No signs that anyone had ever lived there—just existed.

On the table was an envelope.

My name was written on it.

That’s when I finally read the rules.


---

RULE 1

You are the only human allowed inside the house after sunset. If you hear footsteps, breathing, or voices that aren’t yours, do not investigate.

I frowned.

RULE 2

Lock all doors and windows before dark. If something knocks after sunset, no matter how familiar it sounds, do not answer.

I glanced back at the front door.

Unlocked.

The sun was almost gone.

RULE 3

At exactly 11:11 PM, the lights will flicker. Sit on the couch and do not move until they stop.

I checked my phone.

No signal. Battery at 34%.

RULE 4

If you smell iron, check your hands. If they are clean, you are safe. If they are not, wash them immediately and do not look at the mirror.

My stomach tightened.

Iron.

That was the smell.


---

There were more.

Rules about reflections. Rules about the basement door. Rules about something called “the Guest.”

By Rule 7, my hands were shaking.

By Rule 9, I was convinced this was either a prank or a test—some kind of hazing ritual for a job that probably involved scaring off trespassers.

By Rule 12, I wasn’t so sure.


---

RULE 12

If you believe the rules are fake, you will be proven wrong.

That one didn’t feel like a joke.


---

The envelope on the table contained cash.

Five hundred dollars.

And a note:

You will be paid again if you are still here in seven days. Follow the rules. Do not leave at night.

I sat down hard in one of the chairs.

The sun slipped fully below the horizon.

The house creaked.

And somewhere, deep inside the walls, something exhaled.


---

At 6:43 PM, something knocked on the front door.

Three slow, deliberate taps.

I froze.

I hadn’t locked it.

The handle turned.


---

I don’t remember moving.

One second I was sitting there, staring at the door, and the next I was lunging forward, slamming it shut, twisting the deadbolt just as the handle jerked violently from the other side.

The knocking stopped.

Then came the voice.

“Hey,” it said.

It sounded like my brother.

I hadn’t spoken to my brother in three years.

“Open up,” the voice continued, warm, familiar. “You’re being stupid. I know you’re in there.”

I backed away from the door, heart pounding so hard it hurt.

Rule 2.

No matter how familiar it sounds.

The voice sighed.

Then it whispered:

“You should’ve read the rules sooner.”

Something scratched down the length of the door.

Slowly.

Deliberately.

Like it was writing its own list.


---

At 11:11 PM, the lights flickered.

And I sat on the couch.

And I didn’t move.
