That night was like many others  before… a cool breeze coming off the ocean, embers from the campfire floating through the air like fireflies, the feeling of the warm sand between our toes, and the soothing sounds of the waves crashing. 

It was truly magical, well, at first it was. 

We were five newly graduated teenagers, enjoying our last midnight party at the beach… Tower Beach… or as we used to call it, “Shower Beach”, simply because it was the only beach within a fifty mile radius to have an actual shower facility on sight. 

Anyway, Tower Beach is named after the two fire control towers that sit about 30 yards from the shore line, built to defend the Delaware Bay and River, from a potential German attack during World War II, although no shots were ever fired. 

Now that we’ve had our little history lesson, let’s continue with the story, shall we?

Like I said, we were 5 older teenagers, enjoying one last get together at the beach, before heading off to college, joining the Armed Forces, or “selling our soul” to “The Man”, and becoming a working class dog. 

That’s a Rick Springfield reference, you know, that old 80’s Pop Star. 

No! Ok! Never mind. 

Where was I? I can’t remember shit! Getting old sucks! Um! Uh! Ok! Got it. 

Donna and Stacy were heading off to college in different states. Donna was suppose to start the next week, and Stacy the week after. 

They never made it. 

Jason had just signed up to be a Marine, as he filled out all the paperwork, did well on his practice ASVAB test, as well as his official ASVAB test, passed the physical, took his oath, passed his drug test, and was scheduled to report to MEPS in four days, then off to boot camp from there. 

He didn’t make it. 

Jordan and I were joining the overworked and underpaid work force. Jordan was supposed to start in the Meat Department at Food Lion on Route 8 the next Monday. 

He didn’t make it either. 

I got a job at ACE Hardware starting on the same day, and I’ve been there ever since. 

I was the only one who survived that night. 

It was Saturday, the first week in September, of the year 1986. 

I’m only remembering what happened now, because I just heard on the news, a little while ago, that the State just finished remodeling one of the Towers at Tower Beach, and it was now open to the public. 

The memory, well, the nightmare, of what happened that night, immediately came rushing back. 

It took me over 3 years, and a whole lot of “couch time”, to put it all behind me, and to let go of the guilt that had consumed me, for being the only survivor.

But, it looks like I’ll be calling my therapist again shortly. 

Damn News!…

Anyway, Jason had three-wayed Jordan and I, earlier that afternoon, and asked if we wanted to have one last get together at “Shower” Beach that night. 

I had nothing better to do, and Jordan said he didn’t feel like listening to his mom bitch about his long hair, and choice of music. 

He listened to Heavy Metal, hell, we all did. 

The girls listened to the poppy radio friendly stuff, while us guys listen to the underground non mainstream kick ass stuff. 

I still listen to it today… Metal Rules. 

Anyway, Jordan called Stacy, and I called Donna. They agreed as well. 

We had all been friends since 6th grade. We were all in the same class. 

One day the lights went out at school. 

Jason and I started telling ghost stories to each other, during the blackout, (we’d been friends since 3rd grade.) that’s when Jordan, Donna, and Stacy all joined in, and we’ve all been friends ever since… well, until that night…

That night… I lost all my friends. 

After several calls back and forth with each other, we decided to meet up at Jason’s house at 7 p.m., and take Jason’s van to the beach. 

I arrived about 6:50. Donna and Stacy were already there. Jordan showed up a little after 7, saying that his car wouldn’t start, and he had to borrow his mom’s station wagon. 

We all piled into Jason’s van, after he loaded up some large pieces of firewood, and some sticks from his yard. 

We loaded the beach chairs, the boom box, and the cassettes that the girls brought with them. 

We left his house around 7:10. 

We stopped off at Wawa and got some snacks, a bottle of lighter fluid, and some matches. 

Wawa is a convenient store, for those of you not from this area. 

We then hit Larry’s Liquor’s and got a bag of ice, one of those cheap styrofoam coolers, and a few cases of Keystone beer. (Courtesy of Jason’s fake ID.)

Man, that was the best tasting beer back in the day, and it was cheap. 

Anyway, we also got a 4 pack of wine coolers for Donna, (She wasn’t a big drinker, and agreed to be the designated driver, just in case.) 

Now, I know what you’re thinking, “Wine coolers are still alcohol.”, and you would be correct in that statement. 

But in all my time of knowing Donna, I had never seen her drink more than two, at the most, and that’s well below the alcohol level for it to be considered Drunk Driving. 

I put the ice in the cooler, put some beer, and the wine coolers in there, closed it up, and put it in the van. 

Anyway, we left Larry’s Liquors and headed to the beach about 8 o’clock. 

It usually started getting dark around 8:30ish, and would be almost fully dark by the time we made the hour long drive there. 

We were coming from Dover, in case some of you live in this state 

We arrived at the beach about 9, and I immediately sensed that something was wrong. 

There was no moon in the sky when I looked out one of the back windows, which was really weird, because there had been on the way down. 

The sky got real dark, as soon as we pulled into the spot in the woods, where we always parked the vehicle, or vehicles we were in, since the parking area was closed and blocked off by a large metal gate about 30 feet away from where we parked the van. 

The beach was accessible by a path that led through the trees. 

The only light around was from the two security lights shining dimly on the empty parking lot. 

We all then exited the van. 

“Isn’t it strange that the moon just disappeared, You Guys?”, I asked. 

They all looked up at the sky. 

“So what! It’s probably just behind some clouds or something, Man!”, Jason responded. 

“Yeah! That could be. But it happened all at once, like someone turned off a light switch, not gradual like it should have, if that was the case.”, I said in return. 

“Maybe it’s a fast moving cloud, Man. I don’t know. Who cares? Let’s party!”, he said. 

I just looked at him funny. 

“That is weird!”, Donna said looking at Stacy. 

“Yeah, it is!”, she said, agreeing with Donna. 

“Don’t worry, Stacy! I’ll protect you!”, Jordan chimed in, and tried to put his arm around Stacy’s shoulder. 

“You wish!”, Stacy replied snidely, pushing him away. 

You see, Jordan had the hots, Um! I mean… had feelings for Stacy ever since 7th grade, something about a dodgeball game and gym shorts, I don’t remember. 

But she always shot him down. 

“Are we just going to stand here, and talk about the damn moon, or are we going to rock out and PARTY!”, Jason said, screaming out “Party” singsongish at the end. 

“He’s right, Man! We came here to have fun. Let’s get this party started.”, Jordan said, grabbing the beach chairs, as Jason grabbed the firewood, the  sticks, and some old newspaper ads that were laying around in the van. 

I grabbed the cooler. 

Stacy grabbed the boom box, the lighter fluid, and the matches. 

Donna grabbed the handful of cassettes that she brought with her. 

We all then started up the path that led to the beach. 

Jason went first, then Donna, then Stacy, then Jordan, then me. 

The light from the parking lot giving way, as we moved through the trees, and into complete darkness. 

Jason stopped walking, put down the wood and sticks and said, “Wait here, you guys! I got a flashlight in the glovebox, I’ll be right back!”, then jetted past us, leaving us there, in complete darkness. 

Something rustled in the trees, scaring us all. 

Donna screamed a little, “What was that?”, she said nervously. 

“I don’t know!”, Jordan said, “But it sounded big!”

“Jason! Hurry the fuck up! It’s creepy out here!”, Stacy yelled. 


Suddenly, there was a low scratching sound, intensifying as it did, reaching almost a Fever pitch. A small beam of light then came from behind us, we all turned around. 

“Jason… Jason! Is that you?”, I asked. 

The light was moving sporadically, up and down, and all around. 

The light was getting brighter as it came closer. 

Since we were all holding things in our hands, except Donna, she had one hand free. She raised it ti shield her eyes from the light. The rest of us just squinted. 

Suddenly, there was a sinister laugh, which sounded muffled, making it even scarier. 

Stacy screamed. 

The light shot down quickly, then shot up to the sky. 

In the light was a face, which tilted slowly to the right. 

We all screamed. 

“Gotcha!”, the face said laughing, as the light was moved away. 

It was Jason, waving it around and holding the light underneath his chin, being the asshole that we knew he could be. 

“What the Fuck, Man!”, I yelled. 

You’re a fucking asshole!”, Donna said. 

“Dick!”, Stacy remarked. 

“You scared the shit out of me, Man. But that was a good one.”, Jordan said.

Stacy then punched him in the arm. 

“Ow!”, Jordan said, holding his arm and grimacing. 

“C’mon Guys, I couldn’t resist!”, Jason said. 

“Something moved in the trees while you were gone, it sounded big.”, Donna told Jason sharply. 

“It was probably a raccoon, or a squirrel, or something!”, he said dismissively. 

“It’s the “Something” that I’m worried about!”, Stacy replied. 

“C’mon Guys! We’ve done this a million times. Why are you all so scared now? It’s a party, so let’s PARTY!.”, Jason yelled. 

He put the back end of the flashlight in his mouth, picked up the wood and sticks, then continued walking, lighting the way. 

Shaking our heads, we all followed after him. 

We reached the end of the path, and onto the warm summer sand. 

The cool breeze coming off the ocean, making us feel alive. 

Who knew, that less than 6 hours later, all my friends would be dead. 

We walked about half way between where the sand met the path, and where the ocean water met the sand, made a left, and walked until we were about in the middle of the shower facility. 

This is where we always used to start the fire, that way the flames would be shielded by the building, and wouldn’t draw the attention of any cars driving by, and better yet… the cops, because technically, we weren’t suppose to be there. 

It was too dark to really see the smoke, so we thought we were safe. 

We were wrong!

Jason set the newspaper ads on the sand, piled the sticks on top of them, and dug a small trench in the sand around the sticks and paper, just in case the tide came in that far. The trench would stop the water from putting out the fire. 

Stacy handed him the lighter fluid and matches. 

He then doused the sticks with the lighter fluid, and lit a match. 

We all stepped back, except Jason. 

Jason threw the match, and stepped back quickly. 

Whoosh! 

The fire ignited with thunderous rage, then quickly died down. 

“Yeah, Baby!”, Jason said smiling.  

I set the cooler down, as Jordan handed everyone a beach chair. 

The girls put their stuff down and took a chair. 

Jason did too. So did I. 

We set them up around the fire, and all sat down. 

I opened the cooler, and handed everyone a beer, except Donna. 

I handed her a wine cooler. 

“Stacy! You be the DJ. Play something!”, Jason said, chugging his beer. 

“Bon Jovi, it is!”, she replied, and put on their latest album, at that time, Slippery When Wet. 

It wasn’t what us guys listened to, but it was good enough to party with. 

“Let It Rock” began playing, as we all took off our shoes and socks, and began dancing around bare foot and head banging, having a good time. 

When side A was over, Stacy flipped the tape and played side B. 

By that time, we were all tired from jumping around, and settled in to our chairs, and began talking, laughing, and drinking. 

We were rocking out to the music, having a good time, and enjoying each other’s company one last time before we went our separate ways. 

This went on for about 3 hours, changing tapes every now and then. 

I don’t know what bands we listened to, but they were all teenie-bopper Bubble Gum bands. 

It was about midnight by that  time. 

Right before the shit hit the fan,  Jason, Donna, and I were completely shocked, when Stacy, a little more than drunk, leaned over, grabbed Jordan by his face, and planted a HUGE lip lock on him, and held it there for a good 20 seconds. 

She broke free, leaned back in her chair, licked her lips and said, “Something to remember me by, Jordy. But that’s all you get!”

Jordan, more shocked than the rest of us, just sat there, like his mind had just been blown, with a huge smile on his face. 

I didn’t think he would ever stop smiling. 

Now, before I continue, I’d like to give you all a little information, and a little description, for each one of us, just to give you a visual. 

Jason Poore: 19 years old. He was from a well to do family, and lived in a ritzy neighborhood. 

But he was a down to earth guy. 

He got held back in Kindergarten, which is hard to believe, I mean, how do you fail milk and cookies, but he did. 

Jason wasn’t the brightest light on the tree, but he was build like a brick shit house, 6 foot 4, 285 pounds of muscle, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. He was a football coaches dream. 

Donna Engleman: 18 years old. She had come from a broken home. Her father was an alcoholic, which is why she rarely drank. Her parents divorced when she was 8. 

She lived with her mom, in a less then new trailer at Lake Forest Trailer Park. 

She was about 5 foot 3, slightly chubby, with wavy red hair, green eyes, and glasses. 

If she wore the right clothes, she would look almost exactly like Velma from “Scooby-Doo”, except for the hair and eye color. 

I always liked her liked her, but was too shy to say anything. I regret that to this day. 

Jordan Ramsey: 18 years old. He was from a working class family. His mom was a housewife, and his Dad was a forklift driver for UPS. 

He was short, about 5 foot 5, overweight, and clumsy, with long black hair and acne, basically a nerd, that everyone picked on. 

Jason and I got in more fights in school, defending him, than we can even count. 

He reminded me of Jerry Mathers from “Leave It To Beaver”, but Jordan was cool. 

He lived with his parents, in a small bungalow styled house on the outskirts of Felton.

Stacy DeLuca: 18 years old. She was a spicy Meat-a-ball!

That was my pathetic impression of an Italian accent… sorry about that. 

She was from a strong Italian family. 

She was full of piss and vinegar, and sharp with the tongue. 

She would tell you exactly how she felt, with no care or remorse for what she said, and could back up her words with her fists, if she had too. Her three older brothers made sure of that. 

Her father ran a local car dealership, never sold any cars, but had money out the Ying Yang. 

Her mother owned a local beauty salon, that was rarely open. 

Can you say “Storefront”, if you understand what I’m saying. 

They made Jason’s family look homeless. 

I think they were the Delaware version of the Sopranos. But don’t tell them I said that. 

Stacy was about 5 foot 9, incredibly gorgeous, with long black hair. 

She was thick, and well endowed. 

But she wasn’t stuck on herself  or self absorbed. She was cool. 

And then there’s me… I was 18 years old then, now I’m 58. 

My Father is a retired military man… Go Navy!

My mother passed away 2 days before my 15th or 16th birthday. I can’t remember. 

My father remarried, six months later, and we all lived in a trailer in the same park as Donna, just three trailers away from each other. 

I now live in Harrington. I rent a room off a nice old lady named Ruth. 

I’m about 6 foot 1, skinny with bushy brown hair. 

Now back to the story:

After Stacy’s kiss, and Jordan’s shocked expression, there came a high pitched screeching sound, which frightened all of us. 

“What was that?”, Donna asked no one in particular. 

“Yeah! What the hell was that?”, I said nervously. 

We all began looking around. 

Suddenly, Donna screamed, and pointed behind Jordan, who turned around to look.

“There! Right there! In the dark!  Do you see it?”, she asked frightened.

We all looked, and saw nothing. 

“I don’t see anything!”, “Me either!”, “Stop it. You’re scaring me!”, “There’s nothing there!”, the four of us responded. 

“Right There!”, Donna said again, “There’s something in a black hood standing on the other side of the terminator.”

No! Not the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. 

That’s what the line where light meets dark is called… a terminator. 

Now that we’ve had our English lesson for the day, let’s continue. 

“How can you see it in the dark?”, Jordan asked. 

“I don’t know, but I do! It’s right there!”, she replied. 

Jason then stood up. 

“Where?”, he said then hiccuped, obviously drunk, “I’ll kick its fucking ass!”

Full of liquid courage, he then began walking to where Donna was pointing.

The rest of us got up and huddled around Donna. 

Jason reached the edge of the light. 

Standing there, staring into the darkness, he yelled, waving his arms like a boxer

“You want some, Come get some, motherfucker!”

He then turned back to us laughing and swaying back and forth.  

“There’s noth…”, he started to say, then appeared to be pulled into the darkness by an unseen force. 

He screamed. 

“Stop fucking around! This isn’t funny!”, Stacy yelled. 

“Yeah, Dude! Not cool bro!”, I said. 

Suddenly, there was another high pitched screeching sound, followed by a muffled scream. 

“What the fuck was that? What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck did…”, Jordan screamed hysterically. 

He didn’t finish his last question. He couldn’t. He was speechless, as was the rest of us. 

Right then, out of the darkness, across the terminator, and into the campfire light, came Jason’s severed, bloody arm and hand, still holding his beer can.
