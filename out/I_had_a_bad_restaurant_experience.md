Part of playing shows by myself on the road is a weird life. It’s not all it’s cracked up to be but it’s an amazing chase. The downsides are trying to sell my CDs, hoping I make decent tips at these dive bars, late nights, money going in the gas tank and for cheap grub. 

I only had a few more shows before I’d take a week off and crash at my parents home before I’d start all over again. I finally got the point I was driving out of state to play my songs. 

I felt happy, I made four hundred bucks at this last show and that was probably the best I’ve ever done. I was also tired. My best bet was to find a Walmart parking lot or a rest area to sleep in since decent hotels were still out of the question. 

Then I seen a neon sign that said “cheeseburgers.” It wasn’t your average fast food joint either. It wasn’t a chain one that I had to stick with usually and it looked better than a 2 a.m. trip to QT or Sheetz. My rusty van turned into the parking lot. 

I walked in the door and noticed how sticky the floors were. I mumbled a few cuss words under my breath. No one was eating in the dining room either. 

I walked up to the front where a jaded young man with braces and blonde curly hair was looking off in the distance. 

“What would you like to order, sir.” It sounded like his mouth was full of spit. 

I looked down at his name tag and tried to make good conversation.

“Hello Terry, I’d like the number three combo with a coke to drink.”

He leaned into the outdated microphone. “Number three combo.” He looked at me and said “8.29”

I tried to make small talk with him while I was digging in my wallet. “So how’s your evening been?”

He sighed and held out his hand. I get it, I’m tired too pal. 

The lights in the restaurant began flickering rapidly. His eyes got a little bit bigger. 

“Sir, come hide behind the counter.” 

“What?”

“Or don’t, it’s your funeral.” He ducked down and I seen some of the kitchen crew starting to find places to hide. I quickly jumped over the counter and ducked behind it. 

“What’s going on?” He shushed me and I felt his spit hit my face. 

The bell rang when the door opened and I heard heavy footsteps. A foul smell crept through the restaurant like a dead mouse in the wall but much, much worse. 

A voice spoke out that sounded like at least six voices combined, it was sinister.

“I would like to order some food please.” 

I felt the weight of whatever it was leaning over the counter and at the edge seen long fingers waving down. They looked bone thin and had multiple colors.

“I said I’d like some food…please.”

I looked at the cashier and he held his finger over his lips.

“ID LIKE SOME FOOD.”

I about screamed. It was so loud and scary. The door bell rang again and whoever walked in let out a big scream. They tried to run but I heard it grab him and swallow him. I heard bones snapping and it giggling as it munched on its snack. 

“I’ll come back another time.” It stomped out.

Everyone began slowly coming back out and went back to their jobs without talking.

“What the hell was that!?”

Terry still pretty close to me spoke up. “I’m not supposed to talk about. It comes around once a month. Had that person not come, it would have went on another minute or two and leave.”

“What about the person that came in, are you not going to call the police?”

“No, there’s a rule list we follow.”

“What rule list!?”

“Sorry, can’t read it to you. Employees only.” 

I had no idea what list of rules would mention some sort of monster entering the restaurant.

“I uh, I need to use the bathroom where is it?” 

He took a deep breath and sighed of annoyance. He checked his watch. And pointed them out.

“I’d say you got about ten minutes. If you see green slime in the toilet or hear voices coming from it, just run out.” 

What the hell? “I’ll just hold off.” My stomach was aching and my fear had me shaking. He spoke up again 

“8.29”

“What?”

“You didn’t pay for your food yet. It’s ready now. 8.29”

“Im not actually hungry anymore.” I walked around the counter back to the dining room.

“So if you don’t pay, I’m supposed to ring this bell and you can deal with the manager. I really, really don’t suggest that. It’s part of the rules.”

I handed him a ten dollar bill and took my change and food out with me. This had to be the worst experience I’ve ever had in a restaurant.
