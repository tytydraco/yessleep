This night, always.

My dad used to say that. Over and over. Like it was some kind of mantra. “This night is always. Remember every detail. Remember or you’ll lose yourself.”

Back then, I thought he was just being poetic. Senile, maybe. After my mom died last year, he started a podcast — real weird one. Philosophical, cryptic. But I was his only listener, so I figured it was just his way of grieving.

I hadn’t seen him in a while, and I felt guilty about that. So I decided to visit him — make the drive out. On the way, I played one of his latest episodes. It started the same as always:

“This night… is always. The day fades, the night returns. Always. But this night will be different. The night will stay. Remember. Remember everything.”

I laughed a little. It was unnerving, sure, but come on — it was Dad. Goofy, soft-spoken, light-hearted Dad. The kind of guy who’d eat your broccoli behind Mom’s back just to save you from it. But lately, something had changed. He’d started to feel… haunted. Like he was afraid of something only he could see.

I pulled into the driveway at 6:30 PM. The house was dark, blinds drawn, like no one lived there. I knocked. Silence. That alone was terrifying — my dad used to be impossibly light on sleep. You tap on a window and he’d leap out of bed. But now? Nothing.

Then — BEEP. A notification lit up my phone:

“NEW VIDEO: Do Not Enter the House — Richard’s Podcast.”

My stomach turned. I tapped it. The video was blurry, shaky, low-res — it showed a dark hallway. My childhood hallway. No narration. Just silence, air conditioning, and that dim corridor leading to my parents’ room.

And the title? “Do Not Enter the House.”
It wasn’t a metaphor. He meant right now. Me. I was outside. And somehow… he knew.

I should’ve left. I know that. But I thought he was playing some messed up game. Losing it. So I pushed through the door — literally broke it open.

But when I got inside, everything changed.

Lights were on. The blinds were up. The smell… god, it was Christmas. Cinnamon. Pine. And before I could react, a little boy ran up to me shouting:

“Jim! Come see what Mom got us!”

I froze.

It was my brother, David. Except… he was seven. I blinked. No. No, this is wrong. David is thirty-four. What the hell is going on?

I followed him to the tree. The exact one we had when I was a kid. He sat down beside the presents, beaming.

“Have you seen Mom?”

“No,” I said. “Not for a while.”

“Did she get us candy canes again?”

“David…” I swallowed. “Do you know what YouTube is?”

“Huh?” he laughed. “What’s that?”

I felt sick.

This wasn’t a dream. Or if it was, it was using my real memories. And then — I heard it.
A thud. From upstairs.

I remembered it. I was here when it first happened — 26 years ago. That same Christmas. Back then, I ignored it. But now… something told me to go look.

I went up the stairs. Slowly. Everything felt too familiar. Like I was walking inside my own brain.

Another thud.

I reached the top. There she was — my mom.

“Jim? Have you opened the presents yet?” she said, smiling softly.

“What was that sound?”

She froze. Her smile twitched.

“Oh, that? That was… nothing.”

Then she turned and disappeared. Just like that.

I tried to follow, but my phone rang. It was David again — the real one.

“Jim. Where the hell are you? You missed the funeral. People are leaving.”

My heart stopped.

“What?”

“Dad’s funeral. Today. Are you okay?”

And then I remembered.

He died yesterday.

I was supposed to be heading to the funeral. Not the house. How the hell did I forget that?

I stumbled back downstairs. The lights were gone. The tree, gone. The warmth, gone.

I ran to my car and checked his YouTube channel again.

Every episode. Gone. As if they never existed.

I drove to the funeral, too late. Everyone was gone except David.

“Did you delete the podcast videos?” I asked him.

He frowned.

“What videos?”

“Dad’s podcast. YouTube. You didn’t see them?”

“Jim… Dad never had a podcast.”

I stood there, cold.

Then David looked at me — and I swear — he said it in Dad’s voice:

“But remember, Jim. This night… is always.”
