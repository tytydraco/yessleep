My name is Richard Prater. I’m a 43 year old man, working as a cashier at Walmart, and I hate my life. 

It was a normal Tuesday. I got up at 10 A.M., to make it to my 11 A.M. shift, put on the cleanest looking clothes I could scavenge, that idiotic blue vest, and climbed into my shitty, beat up, reliable old Corolla and pulled out of the alley that I call a drive way. I stopped at Dunkin on the way and got some sort of craze something latte and 2 of the saddest little microwaved egg things I’ve ever eaten, I even scanned my stupid little reward points thing that I’ve never bothered to use. 

I got to the store at about 10:30 so I had a few minutes to kill. I walked through the entire store, to the dimly lit little dark hallway that contained our break room. I sat down, or you could say, collapsed into, the little brown faux leather couch and began to hyper analyze the stupid little employee motivation posters on the wall. I told myself if they made us do that obnoxious, humiliating chant today, I would come to this very room and hang myself with a rope from the hardware department. I even picked out the specific square in the ceiling grid that I would do it from. “Mark, go to 3.” Came plainly over the grilled intercom overhead. 

After walking up front to my assigned cash register of the day. I flipped on the switch, which lit up the yellow light above me, (16), “Just me and number 4 today.” I thought, looking back at the curly haired black girl who was wearing same blue vest, with different clothes on underneath. Chanel, or something like that. She was wearing a black hoodie with navy blue jeans, compared to my grey sweatshirt, and army green cargo pants. It was the middle of winter. 

A boy around 14 came to my line with a smug grin that I knew meant trouble. I immediately felt rigid and nearly lost my composure before he even said a word. “Hey man you’re that guy that lives in the shitty old apartment in the alley by Ridgeway High aren’t you?” “What are you doing working here?” His red hair contrasted greatly with his striped, different shades of green t shirt. “Well that’s a rude way of approaching an elder, isn’t it?” I snapped back, glaring at him questioningly. “Not when they are a cashier at Walmart.” He snapped back. 

I couldn’t believe this, all of the things I felt about myself being said aloud. I couldn’t tell if it was spiritually cleansing, or existentially destructive. The worst of it is, I still rang up his groceries. I still looked at him with the same vacant stare and said “Fourteen Dollars and Thirty Seven Cents.” Just as I would do with anyone else. Yet I felt humiliated, and I to this day cannot remember what he bought. 

Now, I knew all of these things about myself already. I knew I was a loser, I knew I was a 43 year old man, too old to be a cashier at Walmart. I knew my apartment was shitty, I knew I was the creepy guy living next to the old high school. But it broke me to realize with undying honesty that someone else realized it as well. I couldn’t stop moving, I had to go, I needed more. I don’t know of what, just of something. Something to take away this feeling that the world left me behind. That I didn’t really know what I was supposed to be doing. No one ever showed me. My Dad wasn’t around, and I don’t think my Mom really knew either. 

I went home hungry at the end of the day and sat by myself in complete silence; staring at my dark reflection in the little 24” television that was all I could afford. I had no face, I was just a body. A dark, empty, meaningless shape. I was nothing. 

My stomach growled but I had no urge to eat. I turned on the tv, picked up my phone and looked up, “what do people use as background noise when they are home alone?”, on Reddit. 
I started reading through a few different posts, mostly things like “Coffee Shop Jazz” “Travel documentaries”, you know, the things normal people think about. 

I got down a little more and something popped up that really peaked my interest. “I like to listen to Reddit horror stories on YouTube.” 

This caught my attention because I had never even thought of this idea before. I was always a fan of horror writers like Stephen King and Clive Barker, surely this was something that could fill some of the emptiness that had consumed my life. I began to listen and listen and listen. Stories of mothers gone insane, paranormal secrets of a family, people killed in cold blood. I loved it, I had a way to fill my time where people suffered more than I did. 

I began to want to be the creator of some of these stories, but I had no idea where to start, and my life wasn’t exactly a haven of inspiration. I started to come up with stories only to abandon them after a few paragraphs when my characters and plot began to feel shallow. I needed to get out of my house, and more importantly I needed to get out of my head. I needed to go out and find inspiration.

I began to frequent the midsize little downtown area where most of the bad shit in my city went down. At first it was the usual things every bar fly sees on a nightly basis, drunk guys screaming, bums angry because a man in a suit couldn’t spare a dollar, the endless catcalling of early 20s males with way too much confidence. 

Then I started to notice the darker corners of reality. The back alleys, under bridges, abandoned houses. I wanted to see what this underworld was about, I wanted to take it all in for myself and then go home and put it into words. Then I could truly create something meaningful. 

I saw a man stabbed on a street corner for no reason at all, I saw an abandoned dog tied to a tree whose short brown fur was stretched pathetically over its malnourished body, ribs and all. I didn’t cut it free. Quite frankly, I didn’t care. His life couldn’t be as bad as mine. 

I still went home and sat in front of my seedy little computer and couldn’t so much as come up with a word, I needed to live my stories. I couldn’t just pull something out of thin air. I needed to be the main character of the great story that I was going to write. I would go down in history, people would know me. It didn’t matter what is for. It didn’t matter if they hated me. They would know that I exist, I would know that I exist, and I would finally be able to be somebody. 

I walked out of my apartment into the perpetually damp cobblestone alley, with only one light for the whole way, it was rather dark. Good. My shoes didn’t even make a sound as I walked. I looked up at the old brick siding of Ridgeway high, it carried a certain dark serenity in the midnight glow, lit only by streetlights. There was movement near the front door, I stood next to the brick school sign out front, trying to cover my position. Why was a boy, alone, out in front of the school at night? 

I watched him as he made his way around the school, appearing to be looking for an unlocked way in. He found what he was looking for in a window on the west side, one of the teachers probably cracked it to let a little air in and forgot about it at the end of the day. I saw his feet slither in the window as he hopped in, grabbing with his hands and going in headfirst. I decided to follow. I came to the window, snuck a brief glance in, and when I didn’t see any sign of life, climbed in, feeling the handle of the knife in my waistband press into my stomach. 

I wandered through the unmapped halls of a high school I had never attended. Following a boy I had never seen. I passed through a set of open double doors into what appeared to be a large entrance hall, lined with glass cases full of trophies, important alumni, you know the drill. 

I heard a lock break to the right. I tiptoed as quietly as possible to the doorway of what looked to be a nurses office. Here was my Target. He had broken the medicine cabinet lock off with the end of a flashlight, and was sorting through the endless bottles and packets, not appearing to be satisfied with his findings. I took a quiet step back, not knowing what I had gotten myself into. “ Could I really go through with this?” I thought, but before I could even respond to my own thought the boy stepped through the door. I can do this, I thought, as I grabbed him and forced him to the floor. With my hands instinctively around his throat, I hadn’t realized that I couldn’t grab the knife and hold him down at the same time, so, like the animal that I am, I reacted. 

I began to lift his neck up, with my hands gripped around it as tight as I could manage, and I began to bash his head into the tile floor. I saw the light leave his body a little more each time it made contact. I expected a sharp, cracking sound, but instead it sounded soft. Like the sound of someone kicking a punching bag. I bashed his skull into the ground over and over again. I kept going after I knew that he was dead, I needed to be sure. After things went still I just stayed there, sitting on top of him for a while, he was already dead by the time I noticed he was wearing a green striped shirt, the same boy who started all this. “Dope fiend, no wonder.” I thought. 

There wasn’t as much blood as I expected. A small pool of it behind his head but that was all. I was able to clean it up with a couple of paper towels from the girls bathroom. I realized then that I wasn’t sure what I would do with the body. I hadn’t planned this. Or had I?

I found the janitors closet, grabbed a roll of black trash bags, a roll of duct tape, and decided that would be cover enough for me to at least get him home. It took two trash bags to cover him completely, he was 14 and hadn’t hit his growth spurt yet. There was one trash bag going over the feet up until about the waist, the other going over the head and meeting almost perfectly in the middle with the other. I unstuck a huge strip of duct tape, bit it off with my teeth, and began to seal the boy inside. When I was done, I picked up his lifeless body, which was lighter than I had expected. “Dope Fiend.” I thought, and laughed to myself. I carried him to the same window that I followed him through before, when we were both alive, and tossed his lifeless body out carelessly on the ground outside. There was a small cracking sound that I assume was his wrist breaking by the way he was on top of it when I scooped him up again. 

I arrived back to my home and looked at the digital clock sitting on my TV stand in the living room, 12:45, it read. “It all happened so fast.”, I thought. I could only think of one place that would make sense for a dead body, the bathtub. I laid him inside, left the trash bags covering him, and poured the tiny bit of ice I had in the freezer on top of him. “I will pick up a couple bags tomorrow.” I thought. 

The night continued on with no rest possible, the adrenaline in my system was like nothing I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t think of anything else, I know this was something I could get locked away for, but I no longer cared. I was like an animal. An animal that needed the kill. I needed more. I decided to wait until the following night and go back to the seedy little downtown area where I had started. 

When I stepped out of my Corolla onto the pavement downtown, I was a man on a mission. This time I wanted a woman, I had to even it out. One man, one woman, the perfect Union. I would know her when I saw her. So I walked the dimly lit streets and searched. I saw one woman after another yet none of them felt right. They all eyed me with the same suspicious eyes, like they could see through me, see why I was here. I got in line outside of a little club with loud music blaring from inside. I got up to the sweaty, meat head bouncer, and as I reached for my back pocket, I realized I hadn’t even bothered with my wallet. “Dont waste my time, fella.” He said, and promptly moved me off to the side to make room for the whorish looking women behind me. 

That was when I saw her. She was walking away from me, black curly hair, a black woman from what I could tell in the dark of night. She was carrying one of those department store paper bags with the handles in her left hand. This was the one. I felt it. I could feel the goosebumps stand up on my arm. My penis was halfway erect from the moment I saw her until well after she had died. I was aroused just at the thought of what I was going to do to her. I followed her down the street, keeping a safe distance so she wouldn’t distinguish me from any other bystander on the street. She turned left and went past a sign into a parking lot in a little square just behind the buildings on the Main Street. “$5 parking”, the sign said. I watched as she put her bags into her truck, and as soon as she closed it, I grabbed her. 

This one had a little more fight in her than the boy did. She screamed a little, trying to swat at my face with her long, fake nails, and even succeeded it a little, although I didn’t feel it until the next day. Finally, I reached into my waistband, pulled out my knife, and held it at her throat. She stopped, both hands raised slightly with her elbows level with her shoulders. “Please don’t do this!” She begged. “Shut your fucking mouth.” I told her, and slapped her full force across the face. God that felt good. I grabbed her by her hair, made her turn her back to me, and put my knife to her throat. “Please, no, don’t do this!” She pleaded, even more desperately than the first time. With that I slid my knife effortlessly across her throat. You never forget the sound of cutting someone’s throat open. Its subtle. The screams are not. I had to hold my hands over her mouth to avoid anyone else hearing. After a few seconds the blood rushed out of her mouth, and combined with her saliva it oozed through my fingers onto the concrete of the parking lot. She squirmed and squirmed but eventually she stopped. I let go of her hair and she flopped face first onto the ground, lifeless. 

I picked up her purse and felt around inside until I found her keys. I pressed the little trunk button on it, got it opened up, and forced her body inside. I used the new clothes she had bought while shopping to lay her on, in order to soak up the excess blood that was still oozing out of her throat. I wiped as much blood as I could off of my hands onto her shirt. 

I closed the trunk, took the keys and got inside the drivers side of her beat up Pontiac, deciding I would drive back to my car, transfer the body, and leave hers in the parking lot there. I did just that, I changed the station from hip hop radio. I couldn’t take any of that noise, after going through every channel, I turned it off, and rode the rest of the way in silence. 
 
I got to my car about 12:30 that night, wrapped her in 2 more of the trash bags from the roll I swiped from the school, the same technique I used for the boy. After I lifted her out of her trunk, and into mine, I decided to use another trash bag to clean up the blood stained clothing that I had laid her on. I picked them up with my bare hands, I figured, her blood is already on me, what more could it really hurt. After I picked up the clothes, I looked in the front and backseat, planning to wipe up any more evidence that I had left. Laying on the backseat, was a blue Walmart vest with a nametag attached that said “Janelle.” “Hot damn.” I thought, “I never even noticed.”

I drove her home, carried her heavy ass into my shitty apartment and tossed her in the tub with the boy. She fit right next to him, and her feet didn’t even come all the way out of the tub, this way I would be able to cover them completely with ice. This way I could keep them here with me as long as possible, a reminder of who I used to be, who they used to be. I wished I could have them forever, but I knew that this wasn’t the case, it couldn’t be the case. I’m a Walmart cashier, I can’t afford a deep freezer at the drop of a hat. I hadn’t decided what I would do with them, yet, I had a few thoughts at this point. I knew I could afford a hatchet, or a handsaw. Maybe I’ll toss them in a river, surely something would eat them. 

I walked into my warm living room, walked past my sad 24” television, and sat down at my computer. I began to type, the words began to flow effortlessly, there was no need to make up anything anymore. I had lived out my stories, and now it was time to tell them. Her blood had turned to brown under my fingernails as I pressed down on the keys. Word for word I typed out my stories, telling the internet everything I had done, and they all loved it. They ate it up. I presented it as a piece of fiction and they received it as a work of art. Now they all want a sequel.
