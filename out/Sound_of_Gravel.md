It was just after 11 p.m. when I pulled into the driveway of the Airbnb. A small one-story house sitting on the edge of some rural nowhere, surrounded by woods and silence. The kind of place you’d pass without noticing, if not for the flickering porch light and the crushed gravel drive that crunched under my tires like bones.

I’d taken a last-minute photography gig, driving three hours from the city just to capture some night skies with zero light pollution. The ad said “quiet, private, remote”—perfect for what I needed. The host had sent me a code and instructions. No one to meet, just me and the stars.

Inside, the place was cleaner than I expected. Minimal furniture, that IKEA sort of vibe. Living room, tiny kitchen, one bedroom. Windows bare. No curtains. Felt exposed, but I told myself it was fine. I checked for cameras, just in case. Nothing obvious.

I unpacked, then set up outside with my gear. It was a beautiful night—clear sky, the Milky Way like a smudge of glitter overhead. I lost track of time taking long exposures, until I heard it.

Crunch… crunch…

Footsteps.

Slow. Heavy. Deliberate.

I froze, hands still on my tripod.

There wasn’t supposed to be anyone else here. The nearest house was at least half a mile down the road. I looked toward the driveway. The motion light kicked on.

Nothing.

I waited, breath held. Then again—

Crunch… crunch…

Closer.

I snatched my gear and backed into the house, locking the door behind me. I stared through the peephole.

Still nothing.

I did a walk-through, checking every window, every lock. Everything was still shut, untouched. I told myself it could’ve been an animal. A deer. Maybe a raccoon.

But it didn’t feel like an animal.

It felt… human.

I left the light on in the bedroom and lay down fully clothed, pepper spray within reach. I kept listening. But nothing else happened.

Until 3:12 a.m.

I woke to a sound from the living room.

Not outside. Inside.

Just a single floorboard creaking.

I held my breath.

There was no one else in the house. No pets. No pipes. Nothing that should make that sound.

I moved slowly to the door, cracked it open, and peeked into the hallway.

Dark.

Quiet.

I should’ve run then. But I didn’t. I convinced myself it had to be the house settling. Or my imagination.

By morning, everything seemed normal. I was still alive. No sign of a break-in. The door was locked. So I stayed.

Why? Maybe I didn’t want to feel crazy. Maybe I just needed the money.

That afternoon, I took a walk around the house to clear my head.

That’s when I saw them—boot prints in the dirt. Large. Deep. Not mine. They led from the edge of the woods right up to the back wall of the house.

No prints going back.

I felt cold all over.

I took pictures of them, marked the area, and tried to call the host. No response.

I called a friend and left a voicemail: “Hey, this place is giving me weird vibes. Just letting someone know I’m out here. Might leave early.”

I should’ve listened to my gut.

That night, I kept the lights off inside, except for one in the kitchen so I could watch for reflections. I sat in the living room, tense, keys in my pocket, shoes on, phone in my lap—no signal, still.

At 9:43 p.m., the motion light on the driveway turned on again.

I didn’t look this time.

I got up quietly, grabbed my bag and camera, and walked to the front door.

When I went to unlock it—the keypad blinked red.

I froze.

I tried the code the host had sent.

Denied.

I tried it again. Again. Red.

Someone had changed it.

I backed away, heart pounding. I checked all the windows again. Locked. Phone—still no bars. I opened my laptop, found an offline map—closest police station: 18 miles.

And then, from above—

Creeaak…

A footstep. On the roof.

I bolted into the bedroom and slid into the closet, closing the door slowly, quietly, and crouched there in the dark.

I waited.

Nothing.

Then—footsteps.

Inside the house.

Someone was walking. Not searching. Just… walking. Slowly. Like they were waiting.

Then they stopped.

Right outside the closet door.

And I heard breathing.

Then a voice, soft and wrong:
“Are you still here?”

I covered my mouth, frozen. My body wouldn’t move. My mind screamed at me to stay still.

The voice didn’t repeat. The footsteps turned and walked away. A door closed somewhere.

Then… silence.

I stayed in that closet until sunlight came through the slats.

When I finally crawled out, the house was empty. The front door stood wide open.

No footprints. No broken windows. No forced entry.

Just gone.

I didn’t stop driving until I found a gas station with a signal. I called the cops. They went out and checked the property.

The listing had been deleted.

The house wasn’t even on Airbnb anymore.

And the person who owned it?

He’d died six months ago.
