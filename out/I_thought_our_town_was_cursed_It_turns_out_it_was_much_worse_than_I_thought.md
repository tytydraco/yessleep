I've lived in this small town in Texas for all of my 34 years. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and nothing much happens. Or at least, that’s what we all thought. My name is Ryan, and I need to tell you about something terrifying that’s been happening here, something no one else seems to believe.

About six months ago, strange things started happening. The first was a car crash. John, a guy I went to high school with, lost control of his truck and hit a tree. Everyone said it was a tragic accident, but John wasn’t a reckless driver. Then, a week later, another accident. This time, it was Mrs. Henderson, a sweet old lady who lived a few blocks over. She fell down her stairs and broke her neck. Again, an “accident.”

People in town began whispering about a curse, but no one really took it seriously. After all, accidents happen, right? But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something more sinister was at play. Then, I saw it.

It was late one night, and I was driving home from work. I saw a figure standing at the side of the road, just outside the glow of my headlights. I slowed down, thinking it was someone needing help. But as I got closer, the figure vanished. I stopped the car and got out, but there was no one there. I brushed it off as my tired mind playing tricks on me.

Over the next few weeks, I kept seeing glimpses of the figure. Always at the edge of my vision, always gone before I could get a good look. More “accidents” happened. A young couple died in a house fire, a teenager drowned in the local pond, a man electrocuted himself while fixing his roof. Each death was different, but they all felt connected.

One night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the figure I’d seen and the people who had died. I decided to drive out to the site of John’s crash. As I stood there, staring at the tree he’d hit, I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around and saw it: the entity. It was a shadowy figure, almost human but not quite. It had no face, just an empty void where its features should be.

I tried to run, but my feet felt like they were stuck in quicksand. The entity moved towards me, and as it did, I saw flashes of the “accidents.” Each one played out in my mind like a movie, and in every scene, the entity was there, causing the events that led to each death. It was orchestrating everything, making it look like accidents to cover its tracks.

I don’t know how I managed to escape that night. I woke up in my bed, drenched in sweat, with no memory of how I got home. But now I know the truth. The entity is real, and it’s killing people. It’s wiping out our town, one by one.

I tried to tell the others, but no one believes me. They think I’m crazy, that the stress of all the deaths has gotten to me. But I know what I saw, and I know it’s only a matter of time before it comes for me.

If you’re reading this, please believe me. Be careful. If you see a figure at the edge of your vision, run. Don’t stop, don’t look back. It’s out there, and it won’t stop until we’re all gone.
