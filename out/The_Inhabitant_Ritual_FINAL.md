11:20.

It took Wade. I don’t know if he’s still alive, but it took him and it’s probably going to do something bad to him.

One more thing. That stupid son of a bitch left the goddamn paper with the phrase in his car. If we get out of this, I’m beating the shit out of him.

Gathering myself once more, I went to the stairs and headed back up to the first floor. It was pitch black in the house now, so I had only my flashlight to guide me.

I couldn’t even begin to think of where it had taken Wade. I wasn’t exactly equipped with any good ideas, so the best I could come up with was going room to room and hopefully catching the mannequin off guard.

I heard clattering in the kitchen.

Could it have been in there? I only had one way to find out, so I snuck through the halls and eventually made my way to the entrance of the kitchen.

It had Wade on the counter.

I wasn’t sure if it could see me, so I turned my flashlight off. I decided that sneaking up behind it and hitting it as hard as I could with the flashlight would be the best way to go about it.

I snuck up on it and raised my flashlight.

Then it *turned around*.

It wasn’t as though the mannequin had innate abilities to lock someone in place, but it almost felt as though it’s gaze froze me. I couldn’t move at all.

Like a deer in headlights.

“C—c’mon, move!” I yelled at my hand, straining nearly every muscle in my body just to move one finger.

The mannequin turned its head. Even though it didn’t have eyes, I could have sworn it looked at me, and then my hand.

I snapped out of my paralysis and hit the head with a dizzying thunk. The mannequin’s head careened to the left before snapping back into place. I heard the sickening sound of wood and wires creaking as it raised its arms.

It *pushed* me.

Had it not been for the refrigerator behind me, I might’ve gone way farther than I did. Still, I could tell this thing meant me harm. I crashed against the fridge and crumpled to the ground soon after.

I felt winded. I could hear it walk over to me as I was struggling to catch my breath. I turned myself around and attempted to crawl out of the kitchen, but the mannequin grabbed my ankle.

Strangely enough, it didn’t drag me or anything like that. Instead, it crushed my ankle. I screamed out in pain. My foot felt like it was on fire.

 I looked down to it and saw it had turned from my regular, healthy skin tone to an ugly, purple-brown shade. I wouldn’t be able to walk with it. I had to find a way to get out of this.

Before I could think of anything, it grabbed me. It held me in a way a fireman would and threw me out of the kitchen. I crashed through the basement door and went tumbling down the stairs.

I tried to get up, but every part of my body ached. I was able to lift my head for a few seconds only to see it in the doorway of the basement. It looked down at me and slammed the door, trapping me in the basement.

Wade. I couldn’t save him. Those were the last thoughts I had before I blacked out.

11:58.

I jolted awake, pain still flowing through my body like a river. I was able to get up this time, though I struggled doing so. Unable to walk properly, I crawled up the stairs and was about to open the door when Wade appeared before me.

I couldn’t believe it. He was alive.

“Holy shit man. Wha—what happened? Did you manage to catch it with the phrase?”

He looked blankly at me before dryly replying.

“Wha—wh—what phrase?”

I chuckled. He always was a jokester.

“Th—the phrase to cast the spirit away! You—you did do it, r—right?”

“Phrase. Phrase. Phrase. Phrase.”

“Wade, man, what’s going on?”

I shined the light past him into the kitchen and nearly passed out from fear when I saw it.

*The mannequin*.

It did get him. I didn’t know what else to do, so I heaved myself and tried to stand up.

“Oh, I get it now.” I said, putting a hand on the spirit’s shoulder. “You want to finish the game, right, buddy?”

I was going to make a move. A *stupid* move. It was going to be an incredibly stupid decision, but only if it didn’t work.

“Let me squeeze past you and take a look at that thing, would ya?”

As soon as I was behind what was once Wade, I shoulder-tackled it. My plan ended up working. It fell down the stairs in an explosion of noise.

As the puppet finished its descent, I heard a sickening crunch. I limped down to the basement and decided I would turn the power on before investigating what happened to that, thing, I guess.

Wade, well, I guess Wade’s body was crumpled on the floor, his neck *broken*. I slumped to my knees and began to sob. Wade was my best friend and even though this was his idea, I felt guilty for the fact that it got him killed.

I suppose there’s an 11^(th) rule.

“If the spirit transfers to another vessel, and that vessel is destroyed, then Incola will be transported back to the spirit world.”

I never needed to say the phrase.

 

My parents got home at 1:30 AM. They found me passed out in the basement with a bruised body and my friend’s dead one right near it. I wouldn’t say it was clear cut, but nobody blamed me for Wade’s death.

I’m currently recovering from my injuries in the hospital. Broken foot, skull fracture and a broken collarbone. It hurts like hell but I’m glad I made it out alive.

I have nightmares every night now. Not about the mannequin, I have them about Wade. He comes to me and berates me.

“You should’ve done better.”

“You could have saved me.”

“You enabled me to do this.”

Of course, I know it isn’t really him, but it still ends with me swearing and shivering every night. I’ve been seeing a therapist to put all of these feelings to rest. It’s working, and I’m slowly beginning to put my life back together.

 

Looking back on it, I can only ask one thing. One thing for my own sake and the sake of everybody else in the world.

 

How many other people have tried to do what I did? How many have succeeded?

How many have failed?

How many have released *spirits* upon the world?
