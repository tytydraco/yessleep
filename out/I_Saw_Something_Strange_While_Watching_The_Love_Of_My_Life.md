She has black hair and blue eyes. She is 5,6. She lives in a third story apartment above a little coffee shop. Every Saturday morning, she goes down to the shop and gets a cappuccino with extra whipped cream and a sausage egg sandwich, then walks to a nearby park and sits on a bench with her meal and a book. She is the most beautiful woman in the world. I know all of this and much more about her, but she knows very little about me. 

We’ve only actually spoken three times:

The first time was on that first day I saw her sitting on that bench. I immediately knew that she was perfect, she was breathtakingly beautiful but there was something else too, something that I can’t explain, which told me that we were meant to be together. Naturally I approached her to ask her out. I had spent a good ten minutes figuring out what I was going to say, but standing in front of her the words just wouldn't come out. So I just stood there until she asked if I needed something. I said no and then escaped from the situation, now understanding that before I could task her out I would have to prepare. 

The second time was a mistake, it happened about a month into the process of getting to know her. For the previous two Sauturdays I was content to watch from the safety of a cluster of trees, they concealed me well but unfortunately her bench was too far away for me to fully appreciate her. So that third day I got greedy. I went to the park at 7:30 (her average arrival time is 8:02) and found a thick patch of tall bushes right by the bench. I crawled into them and did what I thought was an acceptable job concealing myself. 

The half an hour of thorns rubbing against my skin wasn’t pleasant but it was all worth it when she arrived. Being allowed to stare at her upclose, without fear of discovery, was the greatest experience I had ever had up until that point. At least it was until she saw me. She started screaming and asking what I was doing, I just stammered something about birdwatching and ran away. Even then I knew this was only a minor setback, the only thing that really hurt was that she didn’t seem to remember me from a month ago but I also knew that I had to be patient. It actually worked out pretty well because the idea of bird watching inspired me to purchase binoculars which allowed me to combine the best of both the trees and bushes.

The third time was while I was installing the camera. 

I had to disguise myself as a technician and go to her door right before she left for her Saturday walk. I deeply regretted missing our time together but it was the only way to be sure she wouldn’t be watching while I “worked on some electrical issues”. She let me in without a question, I didn’t even have to use half the cover story I prepared. If I was forced to name one flaw about her it would be that she was too trusting. Once I was in I concealed the camera between two photos on her mantel, from that spot the device could see almost all of her apartment: Her living room, her kitchen/dining area, the door to her bathroom, and the door to her bedroom. 

I had actually considered putting the camera in her bedroom but decided not to because 1. It would be an invasion of her privacy, and 2. I am not a pervert.

I know some people would consider what I did wrong. Even I had second thoughts as I was about to leave. But then I thought about why I was doing this: It was an act of pure, unwavering, selfless love. I put that camera in her apartment because I wanted to have the ability to, at any point in my week, take out my phone and see the woman I love. What's so wrong about that? What's so evil about caring for someone so deeply that you just want to passively, harmlessly observe them as they live their life? If she didn’t know that I was watching then it couldn’t possibly have hurt her, and it definitely helped me, especially for those awful Saturdays when she couldn’t make it out to the park.

It wasn’t like she’d never know either. I planned to tell her once we had been married for a few years, then we could both laugh it off. 

That wonderful day when we could be together and laugh with each other without all the secrecy was coming soon. I could feel it. One Saturday I would wake up and just know that today I would do what I failed to do years ago and ask her out. I would first hide all of the photos and other artifacts which pertained to her (just like I do every month for my brother's “check ins”) just in case we went back to my place after our date. Not that I would expect that of course, I like to think of myself as a very patient person.

Today was unfortunately not that day, but a Saturday was the next best thing. Even if the grass was wet and the sky was gray like they were today, it was still the highlight of my week. The camera was useful but granny, low frame-rate footage couldn’t compare to really being near her. She was there as always, sitting on her bench reading some trashy romance novel. I always wondered why she read those when I knew she was more than capable of reading more advanced literature.

You could tell she didn’t even like them that much even if she read them every Saturday, the same way you could tell she was lonely even if she went out with friends a lot. You can tell a lot about someone when you know them as well as I knew her. I think I knew her better than she knew herself.

I was thinking about how her friends would probably try and interfere with our relationship out of jealousy once we got together when I got a notification on my phone. It was a motion alert from my camera. I hadn’t gotten that notification while she was out since her cat Rufus died (his loss was a terrible blow for both of us) and so I was naturally concerned. “What if it was a burglar?” I thought uneasily, knowing then that I would have to find some way of telling her without ruining things between us.

Even with the best camera in the world it would have been hard to see anything with the lights off and sun blocked by the clouds. You could make out parts of the kitchen and living room that were near windows, but as your eyes moved deeper into the room the light became weaker until you could barely see anything at all. But through the dark I saw a figure standing in the doorway between the bedroom and the rest of the house. A figure with pale skin and blue eyes and black hair. It was her. It was impossible but it was her. She wasn’t moving, you could barely tell if she was breathing, but she stood there, and it was her.

Could she have had a twin this whole time? But why would she keep that a secret? I looked up to the woman on the park bench in front of me. At the woman with black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. At the woman with the same book she’d read at this park for the past four weeks. At the woman now standing up from her bench and walking towards the apartment where she already was. I felt the urge to throw up.

I wanted to run from my hiding spot and tell her not to go to that building but what could I have said? There was nothing I could have done but I still felt awful and afraid as she exited the park. I looked back to my phone to see if maybe it was playing old footage somehow, but when I did I noticed that the figure was gone. The figure was gone and the bedroom door was now closed.

It usually takes her an about 2 minutes and 39 seconds to get home from the park. I don’t think today was much of an exception, but it felt so much longer. I just sat there: staring, waiting, looking for any sign of movement from the bedroom. Then she opened the front door and walked in. She took out her laptop and sat down at the kitchen table. I realized just how bad the frame rate was as I watched:

*She was typing.*

*Still typing.*

*She looked up like she heard something.*

*She looked around.*

*She sat back.*

*Did the door just open a crack?*

*She went back to typing.*

*The door was halfway open.*

*She didn’t notice.*

*Something lunged out of the darkness of the bedroom like an animal. It was her.*

*There was a struggle.*

*I lost track of which one is which.*

*One grabbed a kitchen knife.*

There was too much blood and I had to look away. 

Maybe it was all some sick, unfunny joke. Maybe she knew about my feelings and got the wrong idea. Maybe when I looked back, her and her stunt double or however that was, would be laughing. I turned to the camera ready for  the gore and blood, I wasn’t ready to see her staring straight at the camera. Straight at me. I never thought those beautiful eyes could make me afraid.

When she left the apartment she took the camera with her. It shook and bobbed up and down as she walked. I just sat there watching as she walked. Then when she’d made it to the end of her block and made the left turn that she made so many times before, I knew where she was going. 

So I ran. I ran and I felt my feet and chest and lungs beg me to stop, but I couldn’t. I never looked down at my phone, maybe it was the real her who won the fight. For all I knew she had just gone back to her bench, but I would be able to check once I was home. The three flights of stairs were almost worse than the twenty minutes of running, I almost tripped twice having to stabilize myself on the rough brick walls, and my hands were almost too sweaty to unlock my door, but I made it.

I flung myself onto my bed and wrapped myself in covers like a child afraid of the dark. I stayed like that until I remembered to check my phone. When I did, those blue eyes greeted me once again. The way she stared was strange, cold, like she wasn't alive, but I knew she was because she would blink every once and while. Seeing her like this was frightening, but it wasn’t the thing that would fill me with the kind of dread so great it was the only feeling that came close to matching the intensity of the love I felt for her. That came a second or two later when I saw, in a sliver of the screen not consumed by her face, part of an old brick wall. I knew where she was.

I waited for an incalculable amount of time. I was waiting to die. I was waiting to hear the crashes as my door buckled and gave way, to hear her thudding footsteps as she entered, to hear her scream or shout. But when sound finally came from outside, it was a soft:

“Hello.”

I didn’t respond, but she knew I was there. So she talked to me. 

She told me that it was her, the real her. That she had killed her attacker and found the camera. That she realised who I was and how I was doing my best to watch over her. She called me her “Guardian angel”. She said she remembered me from all those years ago when I first approached her, that she waited for me in the park every Saturday since and only found me that one time in the bushes. She said she only screamed because she was surprised. She said she thought she recognized a technician who came by to work in her house, that when she saw the camera she put it all together.

She had almost lost everything and realized she was done waiting. She went out to the park and asked someone if they saw someone matching my description, they had and they pointed her in the right direction. She went from person to person this way and eventually she made it to me.

I still didn’t respond, but my hands were shaking, they are shaking as I type this. The only thing I have ever wanted might be right here in front of me.

She moved on from the facts of what happened a while ago. Now she’s talking about herself. She says her family doesn’t visit very often and they don’t really care about her. She says she’s never had any friends. She’s lonely. She’s lost. The only times she doesn't feel lost is when she thinks about us.

I know there's a chance that the girl outside means me harm, but I’ve had time to think for the first time since I saw what I saw in her apartment. Either the love of my life, the light at the end of my weeks, the only thing that makes the days on my calendar mean more than numbers on a sheet of paper, is gone forever, or right outside my door. 

So as either one first or one last act of love: I think I am going to let her in.
