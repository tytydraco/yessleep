“Hey Meatball!”

Damn, it was Chris Bishop, the leader of the boys at school who loved to harass me on a daily basis.

I was a bit of an outcast, you could even call me a loner. My mom and I had moved to Rapid River only a few months ago. I hoped it was enough to reinvent myself, start with a clean slate at a new school, but my weighty appearance once again put me at the bottom of the social pecking order. This was not the first time I was called a meatball and it probably wouldn’t be the last. Being at the bottom gives you a lot of time to think to yourself.

“Little fatty fat! Of course you work in a pizza shop, you’re just a big dough blob! Big meat-head! Colossal meatball! What’cha gonna do! What! What!” Chris dramatically spread his arms out for emphasis. It wasn’t a real question, and he didn’t have an order, so there was no point in engaging with him.

I retreated to the back room of the pizza shop to ignore the barrage of insults. Chris reminded me of a little dippy dog I once knew, constantly humping my leg and barking to get a reaction from me. The irony of calling me both little and big was entirely lost on Chris but it gave me a chuckle and helped me cope.

I had started working at Rinaldo’s Pizza not too long after moving here. As a part time job the pay was good and it wasn’t a far walk from my house. Rinaldo’s menu looked big on paper, but it mostly boiled down to dough, cheese and tomato sauces in different ratios. Mr. Rinaldo himself hired me and taught me how to prepare the items. Frankly, the man seemed a little out of place even for Rapid River. He was practically a stereotype, a grinning Italian man with a black mustache serving pizzas and pastas. He might as well have been named Super Mario. He didn’t get the humor in that though, I’d already checked.

“Of’a course we can do’a that for you!” He exclaimed while taking an order over the phone. He hung up and turned to me with a glint in his eye. “This is’a… special order!”

Rinaldo was a people pleaser, he very much subscribed to the concept of the customer being right. He sometimes agreed to things that he didn’t even have on hand. More than once I had been sent out on a special errand to procure an obscure ingredient.

“Sure boss, what would you like me to do?”

“I have’a perfect sauce a’simmering downstairs, please’a go and get a bowl of it for’a me!”

Good, I didn’t need to go on a wild goose chase tonight! Still though, I didn’t like going into the basement. Rapid River was an old mill town and Rinaldo’s Pizza was located in a crusty building as old as the town itself. The basement had dusty stacked stone walls with no windows, it clearly had been grandfathered in when things like building codes were invented. Nevertheless, with the cramped space on the main floor, this was the area where Rinaldo stocked his ingredients and prepared the various sauces for his menu.

I walked down the rickety wooden stairs. It was really quite something to see Rinaldo’s setup. Given the modest means of Rapid River’s residents, Rinaldo focused his business on serving up a large quantity of cheap orders,so he had needed to go industrial. He simmered various sauces in enormous drums on what I could only imagine were custom built large gas burners. This wasn’t my first time down here, but the whole atmosphere changed the further you walked into the room and I didn’t like it.

Rapid River was a bit of a rundown down. Without a lot of resources, the government was almost informal with somewhat irregular enforcement at best. I imagined it had never really recovered from its mill town heyday in the 1800s. The businesses and people here seemed to fly by the seat of their pants without a lot of concern for the future, but seeing Rinaldo’s home-made setup in his rickety building still made me wonder whether the town had health or food safety inspections and what they might think of the basement “kitchen”. Oh well, this was just a part time job. No need to overthink things. After all, Gordon Ramsay showed that countless restaurants around the country have questionable arrangements for storing and preparing food.

“Hey Rinaldo, which one of these did you want me to bring up?”

“The one by’a the pasta packs, that’sa it!”

Rinaldo was directing me to get some of the sauce simmering in a far corner. I tugged on the pull-chain light in the middle of the basement. I really didn’t like moving around down here. Boxes of pasta, bags of flour, fridges full of dough and what seemed to just be trash littered the floor around the sauces simmering away in their oversized drums. I hated stumbling around in the dim light. I was pretty sure that the old mortar in the walls was crumbling out and probably even getting into the sauces. I mentioned it to Rinaldo once when I first started and he laughed and said it was his special ingredient. It didn’t really seem like something to joke about but what do I know.

I was finally at the drum. It is hard to describe how large it was. The drum was high, almost up to my chest, I had to climb a few steps on a step ladder to get in a good position to scoop some out. I have to admit, the aroma from the sauce smelled pretty good. I carefully bent over to ladle the sauce into the bowl and then suddenly, without warning, felt a quick strong push.

You know how time seems to slow down when you anticipate hurting yourself? That’s exactly how it worked as I fell face first into the scalding sauce. I instinctively threw out my hands to catch myself, but they just wound up entering the boiling sauce first with my face and the rest of my body following closely behind.

I could barely see, the hot metal of the drum and the scalding heat of the sauce seared my skin from all angles. Somehow in the shock and adrenaline rush I was able to roll around. I barely got a glimpse of Mr. Rinaldo before he struck me with a large wooden oar, dunking me again into the scalding sauce.

“I knew you’da be a good morsel! Delecioso!” Rinaldo twittered with delight while sprinkling Parmesan cheese into my eye.

I lost track of how long I was wrything in agony. Rinaldo hummed a tune and forcefully flipped and stirred me around with the oar. It felt like I was beginning to dissolve into the sauce. Unexpectedly, I suddenly felt a sense of calm. Time had slowed down again, I wasn’t in pain anymore and through my saucy squint, I could just make out flashlight beams and yelling. I wasn’t totally conscious to see how things went down, but I’m told Chris Bishop was my savior, following us down the stairs and calling 911 when he saw Rinaldo push me in to the drum. Who knew the school bully cared so much about his victim after all?

I’ve been in the hospital for weeks now. It hurts to move and I dread getting the bandages taken off. I get the feeling I’m going to wind up looking like Darth Vader without the suit. I’m so tired all the time while my body tries to heal. There’s not much to do but lie here, think to myself, and dictate this post... I’m so good at that though, I’ve had so much practice living inside myself over the years. I’m going to close my eyes and rest a bit now... but you know what? I guess those jerks have been right all along. Even Rinaldo knew it. Deep down, wherever I go, no matter what I do... I'm just a meatball.
