I am a teenage girl and that’s all I’ll specify about myself 

I live literally in the woods so I explore a lot I always bring a bag of a first aid kit, emergency sleeping bag, emergency food and water, a hunting knife, and a flashlight (this is important for later)

I decided to go exploring and stayed out for longer than I should’ve and it was dead dark like in a horror movie. I decided I’d just build a small structure like I had taught myself too and just sleep it out. I kid you not the fucking structure flew upwards and away. At this time.
    
 I had started a fire so I saw basically all of it. The thing was destroyed. It was rainy not windy so I didn’t understand what just happened until it’s like I passed out and hit my head. 

  I suddenly wake up with my head bleeding. At this point my parents think I’m making my way back but I got curious and decided to find what the hell happened. I bandaged myself up the best I could and went out
    
Im walking around when I find a cellar at this point I’m not on my property anymore so it’s just unclaimed land because no one lives around us and no one owns the area around us. What I forgot to mention is that 
   
I had also bought a lock pick so I’m lock picking this cellar door. Im able to open it and it looked like something from like an SCP foundation story. White walls and five doors one in front four on the sides. Decorated like a office.
    
Its pitch black so I had to bring my flashlight out and when I stepped in I instantly realized something was wrong.
I don’t get these feelings often so that’s why I was to the point of sprinting out of there. 

It felt like I or anyone wasn’t supposed to see this area but I decided to keep looking around three of the two door were unlocked literally old fashioned computers like the windows type. And a nice office space. I lock picked the other door and I swear to god there was a woman in there she looked fucking gross like she was dead.
    
Not like a stroke or like something that wouldn’t really affect the outer appearance her arm and legs were fucking bent in ways I never would’ve thought possible her head was spun a whole 180 and her face was skinned off. I felt like throwing up the mushrooms I had cooked. She was also an explorer but her bag was much heavier I also took her wallet. 

  Not to steal but to see if I could identify her just before I heard it. She wasn’t dead. She was alive and trying to move. I don’t know how the hell she was alive because her head was bent in no way a human could survive in. I took the shit and fucking dipped. Im slightly overweight and I ran faster than I thought I could ever while carrying what felt to be a 60 pound bag full of who knows what. 
     
I ran to my property and called the police they came and did a huge investigation buy found nothing I didn’t tell them I had her bag but I did show the wallet. This woman went missing a few weeks before she was took from Arizona so I don’t know how she got here.
    
After the police left I went into my room and started going through her bag.
A first aid kit, a sleeping bag, empty food and water containers. And then it hit me something was screaming in this bag it was moving. I move everything and I about screamed. In the bottom was pictures of dead people and VHS tapes. 
    
I did something I highly regretted I watched the VHS tapes it was videos of someone killing the people I saw in the photos I took the shit out and told my parents they acted like this happened before and gave me very specific rules
    I needed to take two gallons of holy water and go to the spot where I found the cellar then do this 

1. Wear gloves and take the tape and pictures out.

2. Pour the one gallon of the holy  water on them
(Do not let any touch your skin)

3.light a fire and toss the tapes one by one while chanting “I’m sorry for disturbing your peace you may rest now” 

4. After they have been totally destroyed 
Put the fire out by pouring the other half of the holy water

5. If the flame turns blue then dies out your forgiven if it turns black then dies out you’ll have to say
“I’m deeply sorry you feel this way but may I be forgiven just this time?” 
The flame should come back then die down 

I did this and I was forgiven but I don’t think that woman was.
