For the past week, something’s been… off with my mom.

She’s still doing all the usual things. Making her black coffee first thing in the morning. Tending the roses in the backyard that she refuses to let die, even though it’s August and the heat’s brutal. She still calls me “sweetheart,” still leaves Post-its with gentle reminders to eat, hydrate, sleep.

But she won’t look me in the eyes anymore.

Not for more than a second or two.

I caught her watching me last night from the hallway mirror. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling on my phone, and I just \*felt\* it. That kind of prickling heat behind your neck like someone’s watching. I looked up, and there she was standing stiffly behind the corner, peering in like she was studying something… or someone.

When our eyes met, she froze.

Then she forced a smile. “You okay, honey?”

I nodded. She disappeared down the hallway like nothing happened.

But I \*know\* she was watching.

This morning, she left a slice of toast on the kitchen table for me, same as always. But there was no butter. No jelly. Not even a napkin. It was just… dry.

I asked her if everything was alright.

She hesitated. “Of course. Why wouldn’t it be?

I shrugged. “You just seem distant lately.”

She looked at me for a long time. Her fingers were tight around the coffee mug. Then she said, slowly: “Sometimes people change. And sometimes… they think no one will notice.”

I tried to laugh it off, but my chest felt \*hollow\*. I didn’t eat the toast.

It’s not just the weird glances or the strange things she says. She’s started locking her bedroom door at night. She \*never\* used to do that. And I swear, one night I heard her whispering behind it. Like prayers… or warnings.

This morning, I woke up and found her in the living room, going through old photo albums. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in.

“Looking for something?” I asked.

She stared down at a photo of us from years ago. Me at least, I think it’s me smiling in front of a birthday cake, frosting on my chin. Her eyes flicked up to my face, then back to the photo. Her hands were trembling.

“You used to have a mole,” she whispered.

I blinked. “What?”

“On your left cheek,” she said, tapping the photo. “Where is it?”

I touched my cheek. “I… guess it faded.”

Her lips pressed into a tight line. “Moles don’t fade.”

I couldn’t think of anything to say. Just stood there like an idiot.

Tonight, she left a knife under her pillow.

I saw it when I walked past her room. The door was cracked open, and she was pretending to sleep. But I saw her fingers curled tight around the blanket, like she was bracing for something.

I think she’s afraid of me.

And the thing is… I been having dreams.

Dreams of things that don’t make sense. I hear echoes I see a forest. Wet leaves. I even smell smoke. And the face \*My\* face staring at me with wide, terrified eyes as I reached out for \*him\*. As I \*stepped into my skin\*.

I start to question myself.

"What am I?"

"Am I really who I am?"

Then one night I go to the bathroom and look in the mirror and see all the imperfections all the mistakes... then I see it I see what my mom sees...

I’m \*not\* her son and mom knows it.
