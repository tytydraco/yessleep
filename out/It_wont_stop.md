I don’t know who to tell this to, so I’m putting it here. I need someone else to know what’s happening in case I stop responding, or this post just… ends.

I’m a writer. That matters. Please don’t skim past that part.

I write almost every night. Same routine. Same desk. Same document template. I’m obsessive about it. If something’s different, I notice.

Last night, I sat down to write and found a document already open. That wasn’t unusual at first,  sometimes I forget to close things, but the cursor was halfway down the page, not at the top. And there were words there. A lot of them.

I hadn’t written anything yet.

The first line said:

“I’m not supposed to remember writing this.”

I honestly thought it was something old. A scrap. A half-idea I’d abandoned. But when I scrolled up to check the file info, the creation time was stamped three minutes in the future.

I laughed. I actually laughed. I told myself it was a glitch. I didn’t want to think about it too hard.

Then I read the next paragraph.

It described me sitting at my desk. The way I tuck one foot under the chair. The cracked knuckle on my left hand from when I punched a door years ago. Things I’ve never written about. Things no one else would know.

I felt that slow, sick drop in my chest, the one where your body realises something before your brain catches up.

I scrolled faster.

The text started addressing me directly.

"You’re reading this faster now. You don’t like how close this feels."

"You’re checking the room even though you’re telling yourself not to."

I hadn’t realised I’d turned my head until I saw my bedroom door in my peripheral vision.

It was open.

I always close it.

I stood up and shut it. Locked it, actually. That should have helped. It didn’t.

When I sat back down, more text had appeared.

"That won’t help. It’s already inside the part of you that writes."

That’s when I slammed the laptop shut.

I didn’t sleep. I stayed on my phone until sunrise, convincing myself I’d imagined everything. That exhaustion can do weird things to your brain. That I’d deal with it in the morning.

This morning, I opened the laptop again.

The document was still there.

Longer.

It now included things that happened after I closed it. Me pacing. Me checking my phone every few minutes. Me standing in the bathroom at 3:12 a.m., staring at my own reflection because it felt like someone else was watching through it.

I know how insane this sounds. I know what this looks like. But I swear to you, I am not writing this ahead of time. I’m reacting to it.

The worst part isn’t that it knows what I’m doing.

It’s that it knows what I’m thinking.

There’s a paragraph that keeps changing every time I reread it. Always just one sentence.

Right now it says:

"You’re wondering when you stopped being the author."

I tried deleting the file. It reappeared.

I unplugged the laptop. The screen stayed on.

I typed into the document: “What do you want?”

The response showed up immediately, in my exact writing style.

"To be finished properly."

I don’t know what that means, but I know it’s bad.

Because near the end, the part I’m avoiding, there’s a section titled “What happens when he tells them.”

I haven’t read it yet. I’m scared that if I do, it’ll lock things in somehow. Like the story needs witnesses. Like it needs you.

I’m posting this now because the document just updated again.

It added a final line.

"He’s running out of time, and he knows it."

If this post cuts off suddenly, or if my account goes inactive, please believe me:

I didn’t disappear.

I was finished.
