I had been planning this holiday for months, ever since my breakup with Megan. I wanted to get out of the country and do some backpacking around Indonesia, hoping it would help me clear my head. So, I booked some flights, saved up some money, and boarded the plane at Brisbane airport. My boss was extremely understanding and granted me additional leave. I hadn’t taken a proper holiday for nearly 3 years, so had a few months in the bank already. Megan and I had been saving for an apartment in downtown Brisbane which meant we had been living frugally. One of the reasons she wanted to break up was we never did anything or went anywhere. Oh, the irony.

I had no idea what I was in for when I boarded my Flight on that sunny Brisbane afternoon. I took my seat next to the window, just past the wing and engine, otherwise known as the cheap seats. The row of seats was three sets of three across, and I was the first there. I was soon joined by a middle-aged woman traveling alone, and an Indian man, whose wife and 2 children were in the middle row next to him. The cabin was filled with excited energy as the Boeing 787 taxied down the runway into position, before accelerating and taking off, the wings shaking slightly as we climbed higher into the sky. 

As the plane leveled off, I settled into my seat, hoping to catch some sleep before we reached our destination. The flight was scheduled to take approximately six hours, and we were set to land at around 7pm local time. I couldn't wait to finally reach my destination and start exploring the beautiful country of Indonesia. I had booked a room at a backpacker's hostel for the first two nights of my trip. It was an affordable option that would allow me to meet other travelers and potentially make some new friends. I was anticipating a night socializing with my new roommates and thought a few hours’ shut-eye now would pay dividends much later on. I heard the lady next to me say excuse me to the Indian gentleman, before heading down the cabin towards the bathroom. My eyes were already closed, and as I listened to the drone of the engine I slowly drifted off to sleep.

I awoke a while later when the plane jolted a little. I rubbed my eyes and checked my watch. We had been flying for about two and a half hours. I clicked the screen on the seat in front of me and accessed the plane's GPS feature and discovered we were halfway over the Northern Territory, a little above Alice springs. I noticed the lady next to me had left her seat again, and the family in the middle row was chatting away excitedly while the father slept in the seat in my row.

Resting my head against the window, I felt the plane’s vibrations against my forehead. Outside, the skies were still clear with scattered clouds. I was watching the wispy clouds as we flew past them when I noticed… something. A glint? Something reflecting? Maybe it was another plane. I sat up and focused my attention. I couldn’t see another plane, and the skies were clear enough to make it impossible for a plane to be hidden. So what was it?

Then I saw it again as it seemed to dart through the sky from behind one of the clouds. A nearly transparent object which caught the sun’s rays and glinted, just for a second, as it moved. It was maybe a kilometer or so from the plane, though judging distance is not a strong point for me, and it was so hard to see, that had I not been concentrating I don’t believe I would have spotted it at all. As I watched it, it vanished from sight, causing me to question if I had seen anything at all. After a few minutes, I convinced myself that it was nothing, just the remnants of the short sleep I had woken from. 

My attention was pulled away from the plane’s window when I heard a commotion inside. There was some screaming and crying, and a lot of calming voices. I unbuckled myself and slid past the sleeping father to go and see what was going on. As I stood upright in the isle, I noticed a grey ash all over my pants and on my left sleeve. Confused, I dusted it off as I walked down towards the commotion.

A woman was in hysterics, and as I listened to her rambling, I began to piece together what had her so upset. The child she was traveling with was missing. It sounds like they went to the bathroom half an hour ago, and had not returned. She had gone looking, and when she didn’t find them in the bathrooms, had figured they had gone exploring the plane. But after an exhaustive search, she had not been able to locate them.

Suddenly, there was another scream from further up the aisle. I followed some cabin crew as they rushed to attend to the distressed passenger. This time, it was even more bizarre. The woman in her 20s was talking to her partner, and when she turned back from switching on the overhead air vent, her partner had vanished without a trace. All that was left was a little grey ash-type substance on the seat he had been sitting in. 

That’s when I thought about the lady sitting next to me, and the grey ash that was still evident on my pant leg. A looked back towards my seat, and she was not there. Had she also gone missing? What is going on? 

Suddenly there was a “poof” noise from right next to me, and just like that, the flight attendant next to me… vanished!

Screams filled the plane as one by one, more passengers started to disappear. I ran towards my seat and into another passenger, and we both crashed to the floor of the plane. And just as we hit the ground “poof” he disappeared and I fell right through the grey ash that remained. 

I jumped back to my feet, and panic set in as I frantically wiped the residue off my arms, face, and hair, trying to rid myself of any trace of the passenger dust. I looked around the plane, and chaos had taken over. Passengers were screaming or crying, some were praying, and I watch as they just “poof”, disappeared into thin air one by one until there was just a handful left.

Suddenly, a voice came over the intercom, urging us to remain calm. But before the speaker could finish, the captain's voice was cut off, and the plane banked sharply downwards. I realized with a jolt that we had lost the captain and were now in freefall. I grabbed the nearest seat and closed my eyes. We were going to crash. I steadied myself as the plane continued to bank. The remaining passengers’ screamed. The engines whined. I took a deep breath and

I awoke on an island, covered in sand and water. As I stumbled around, trying to get my bearings, I discovered a group of other survivors. We banded together to find food, water, and shelter as we waited to be rescued. 

A few days passed, and we were finally rescued. As I sit here on the rescue boat, recording this on a voice recorder I borrowed from the rescue team, I just can’t believe how lucky I am. A lot still doesn’t make sense to me, it probably never will. For example, they didn’t find any wreckage from the plane. And weren't we supposed to be flying over the middle of Australia when that all happened? And why is the rescue boat flying Canadian flags? 

I guess I’ll never kn.. Wait, what was that? Sorry, I thought I just saw something moving in the sky behind us, something, I don’t know, never mind, it’s probably just the dehydration making me see things. “poof”

This is the transcript from a tape recorder found on an abandoned rescue vessel off the coast of the Philippines. It was reported missing from the Canadians two days ago. No one has an answer for how it got here, nor where all the passengers and crew have gone. Right now, the Governments are working to keep this quiet, so I am risking my job, and possibly my life, to share this with you. Please, share this with anyone and everyone you can. We are not alone.
