Mike McCormack has always been rich, and all the kids in our town wanted to be friends with him for that reason, he had the coolest toys, the best snacks, and the biggest house, which is why I was so confused when he invited *me* to his birthday party, being that everyone knew I was poor, and nobody ever talked to me.

“Cole?” He asked, I looked up from my coloring sheet.

“Hi Mike.” I said, trying to sound cool. “What’s up?” 

“I was wondering if you’d like to come to my birthday party!” He said, offering an invitation, I nodded, hoping it wasn’t a prank.

“Yeah I-I’d love to!” I said, nervously taking the invitation. 

“Great! See you then!” Mike replied, smiling.

I was so excited, when I got home from school I told my whole family, granted only my parents cared but I still went on and on about it.

“Well that’s wonderful honey!” My mom said while putting dinner on the table, after I’d reminded her about how Mike invited me to his party. 

“It would be wonderful if you’d stop talking about it.” My older brother Andy groaned.

“Andrew.” My father said sternly, Andy stomped his foot. 

The next day I spent 20 minutes going through my whole room to scrounge up money so I could buy Mike a great gift, so he’d wanna be my friend. I looked in stuff, under stuff, and practically turned my room upside down only to find 8 dollars and a quarter, disappointing.

I made my way into town to go look for money people dropped at the arcade, but I got kicked out having only made an extra 2 bucks because of complaints from customers due to me crawling around machines, oh well.

I walked into the toy store, and after looking around for a long time, the best I could do was buy him a small nerf gun, it didn’t come with those little foam bullets, but I figured he probably had more than he needed already.

For the days leading up to the party, I could hardly sleep at night out of pure excitement, hell I was probably more excited for Mike’s birthday than Mike himself was. When I slept, I dreamt of how awesome it would be to be friends with Mike, and how awesome it would be just to have a friend. And then the big day arrived, my mother dropped me off in front of Mikes house.

“I’ll see you tomorrow sweetheart, and remember to call me if you wanna come home early alright?” My mother told me.

“Yeah I will, bye mommy!” I yelled over my shoulder as I ran to the houses front door.

Mike’s house was…well, I guess fabulous would be the right word. It had a huge stone driveway with 2 basketball hoops, perfectly trimmed hedges, two small fountains on either side of the tall, elegant, double doors. I knocked, a few moments later a tall woman wearing an all black floor length dress with a black shawl over herself answered the door.

“Yes?” She asked.

“H-hi! I’m here for uh, Mikes party!” I said.

“Oh!” She said, her tone shifting from annoyed to friendly. “Hello! I’m Mikes mother, right this way dear!”

She led me through the house to the backyard, where the rest of the kids were, Mike had a huge bounce house, and not one of those lame ones, it had an obstacle course, a little maze thing, and at the end was a huge slide that led into a deep ball pit, most of the party guests were in the bounce house, I joined them.

My eyes darted around, looking for somebody to play with. I was a very shy kid, so I was looking for somebody like me to talk to, I went through the whole bounce house, but I didn’t find anyone that fit my description.

I was about to give up when I noticed a boy sitting in a corner of the ball pit alone, the shade from an overhead tree making it dark,
I made my way over.

“Hi.” I said.

“Hello.” He responded.

“I’m Cole, what’s your name?” I asked.

“Liam, I’m Mikes brother.” He said.

I didn’t know Mike had a brother, Liam looked about our age, maybe a little older. He looked a lot like Mike, curly dark brown hair, and brown eyes, Liam also had freckles almost all over his face, a feature he and Mike didn’t share. 

“Everyone! Time for presents!” Mrs. McCormack yelled, I looked at her, then back at Liam, he was slowly sinking into the plastic balls.

“Are you coming?” I asked him, his eyes moved to look at me, he shook his head and submerged in the ball pit, it weirded me out a little, but I ignored him and went to the middle of the backyard where present’s would be opened.

Mike opened the bigger ones first, he got a ping pong table, a gaming console, a bike, and more, I can’t lie, in that moment I was extremely jealous.

Finally, Mike opened mine, last.

“Uh, thanks..” he said quietly, before tossing my gift to the side and turning his attention to his bigger presents, I felt hurt and disappointed, tears welled up in my eyes.

“Alright kids let’s eat cake!” Mrs. McCormack exclaimed.

The cake, like everything else, was fabulous. It was a tall 3 tier chocolate cake that was beautifully decorated, with the words *Happy Birthday Mike!* written out on it in cursive. I took 2 slices, I figured I’d bring one to Liam as a friendly gesture, I walked over to the ball pit.

“Hey, I brought you some cake.” I said, handing it to him. He looked at it for a few moments, then looked up and smiled at me.

“Thanks Cole! But I’ll eat it a little later.” He told me, placing the cake on a small patio table next to the ball pit.

He sat back down into the ball pit, I decided to leave him alone, he didn’t seem like he was in the mood to play with me, I sat in the grass against a tree and finished my cake. Once I was finished, I was super thirsty, I looked around for something to drink.

“Mrs. McCormack?” I asked, “do you have anything to drink?”

“There’s a pack of water bottles inside on the kitchen island dear!” She responded, “the kitchen is just inside through that door.” She told me, pointing to the double doors on the patio, I thanked her and walked inside.

Just like she said, there was a big pack of waters on the island, I took one out and sipped on it while looking around. The kitchen had a huge wall with hundreds of pictures of the family, pictures of Mike, his dad, his mom, some extended family, but I saw none of Liam. I thought it was weird, but I didn’t think too hard about it. I finished my water and went to play outside.

After hours of playing with Mikes new toys, running through the obstacle course God knows how many times, and playing approximately 30 games of water balloon wars, it was time for the sleepover portion of Mikes party. The people who weren’t staying over left with their parents, and the people like me who were sleeping over gathered inside to wind down.

We spent an hour playing various board games in Mikes living room, I guess I realized Liam was nowhere to be seen while we were transitioning to playing some game on his PlayStation, I looked around the room, and then outside to the ball pit, he was still in there, just wading around through it.

I waved to catch his attention, he waved back, I motioned for him to come inside, he shook his head and continued walking through the ball pit. I figured he just really liked the ball pit and wanted to play in it as much as he could before his parents took it down or something like that.

And then it was time for bed, we were all sleeping in Mikes room.

“Goodnight everyone, get some sleep.” Mrs. McCormack said before turning out the lights. 

I struggled a bit to sleep somewhere unfamiliar, but I ended up sleeping uninterrupted for about 4 hours. I woke up around midnight, needing to pee. I crept into the huge hallway, in search of a bathroom, I knew Mike probably had like 4 in his house, so I was bound to find one without help.

I stumbled across Mrs. McCormack, I could tell it was her because of the dim hallway light. She was in the hallway near the kitchen looking at a picture, sobbing. I tried to sneak by her but she noticed me.

“Oh! Cole!” She said in a shaky voice, quickly wiping her tears, “you scared me!”

“I’m sorry ma’am, I’m just looking for the bathroom.” 

“Oh, right this way dear.” She said, leading me around the corner. I did my business, then walked back to Mikes room, now I didn’t wanna snoop, but I peeked at the picture Mrs. McCormack was crying over. It was a little certificate thing, it read *A mothers love never ceases* with a small purple butterfly next to a sonogram picture of twins, I didn’t get it, I figured it was some family keepsake, I wandered back to bed.

The next morning I was sitting on the couch watching tv with everyone else when my mother came to pick me up.

“Cole! Your mother is here!” Mrs. McCormack called to me.

“Alright! Bye everyone.” I said.

“Bye Cole, thanks for coming!” Mike said.

I waved, and grabbed my stuff, my mother was chatting with Mrs. McCormack at the front door, I gave her a hug.

“Thank you so much for having him.” Mom told Mrs. McCormack. “And tell Mike I said happy birthday.” 

“Of course, thank you for coming.” She said, wiping a tear from her eye.

“Are you okay?” My mother asked.

“Oh yes, I’m sorry it’s just a bittersweet day, Mike had a twin brother who passed away, Liam, he was stillborn, I just get a bit emotional.” She responded.

“Oh I’m so sorry.” My mother said quietly.

They continued talking while I zoned out, so many questions bombarded my mind, Liam was dead, this whole time, did I just somehow imagine him? I couldn’t have, that’s why Mrs. McCormack was crying last night, it didn’t make sense.

“Well, thank you again Mrs. McCormack.” My mom finally said, taking my hand.

“Your welcome, bye!” She said, mom took me into the car, I was quiet most of the ride.

I’m the following years, I actually did become friends with Mike, I went to his birthday party every year.and every year I’d see Liam.

Just lurking in the shadows.
