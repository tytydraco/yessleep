Background
I grew up in a quiet area just outside Norway's capital—safe, peaceful, the kind of place where neighbors greet each other and kids roam freely. Sure, there had been the occasional burglary, but those incidents felt distant, more like stories than threats. My house was just a five- to ten-minute walk from school—maybe 500 or 600 meters—so walking there alone never felt like a big deal.

Until one day, it did.

The Story
It started like any other ordinary school day. I was around 11 years old, and during recess, my friends and I were playing on the large grassy field between the school and a small walkway that led to the main road.

That’s when I noticed him.

A man stood alone on the path, next to a bicycle. He had long, tangled brown hair and a thick, unkempt beard. His clothes were worn, his presence out of place. He didn’t speak. He didn’t move. He just stood there, watching—me, my friends, the other kids laughing and running around.

We glanced at him briefly, then brushed it off. Just some guy, we figured. Nothing to worry about.

Later that day, when school let out, my friend and I began walking home together, as we often did—we lived just a few houses apart. But for some reason, that day, we decided to take a slightly different route. It was only a bit longer, maybe 150 meters more.

That’s when we heard the wheels behind us.

The same man from earlier rode up on his bike and started talking to us. Calm, casual—almost too casual. He asked if we knew where his uncle had moved. Said he’d just moved to the area and needed help finding his house.

We asked for the uncle’s name. He didn’t have one.
We asked if he had a phone number. He shook his head.

Something didn’t feel right—but we were kids. We didn’t have a strong sense of danger yet. I remembered a house nearby that had recently sold and mentioned it as a possibility. The man smiled, thanked us, and then said something that, at the time, seemed harmless.

“Since you’ve helped me, I’ll walk you home.”

And so he did. We made small talk. He seemed friendly, even kind.

But as we neared the steep path leading up to our street, we told him this was where we lived. He stopped. Smiled again. “Alright, I’ll leave you here then,” he said.

We said goodbye, and he turned around.

We didn’t think much of it—until my friend told his dad what had happened. His dad, a police officer, immediately froze. What we thought was a harmless encounter had, in his eyes, all the signs of something much darker.

He came straight to my house, explained the danger, the gravity of what had just happened. We may have shown a potential predator exactly where we lived.

That night, the fear set in. I couldn’t shake it. My bedroom window, which I usually left cracked open, was locked tight. My friend’s dad insisted we keep everything secured, just in case.

But sleep didn’t come easily.

At some point in the night, I woke up. Everything was still—too still. The room was pitch black, the kind of dark that feels heavy. I got up and peeked through my window.

And there he was.

Standing in the middle of our street. Not moving. Just… looking.

I slammed the curtains shut and backed away from the window. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, I told my parents. They took it seriously—but by then, he was gone.

And I never saw him again.
