I stole a look at my neighbour’s garden.

Obviously he had done nothing. The horrible greyish-green lichen which was choking the life out of his garden would soon be infesting my beautiful expensive shrubs – my roses, and my beloved pear tree, if it hadn’t already. Asshole.

I knew things had been going downhill for him ever since Marie, his wife left him- and I needed to make allowances- he had been looking terrible, but he needed to snap out of it and take responsibility. Honestly, I had been surprised Marie had put up with him as long she had, if you ask me.

I walked over to the short fence between our gardens, and called out “Hi! John?”, taking a closer look at the dying plants. The lichen had a rough fuzzy texture and seemed to have spread over two thirds of the garden. His two trees were twisted, looking dead. The thick greyish-green deadly mat was less than a yard away from our fence -in fact it was hard to tell were the lichen ended and dull spring grass began, and I was quite sure too late to do any thing about. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, and I hadn’t been able to find much information online either.

“John?” I called again. There was a silence, and I wondered whether I should call my husband- I could hear him clattering about in the kitchen.

Then the back door of John’s house squeaked open and he stepped out onto his deck.

“Leave me alone you fucking bitch!” he screamed.

I stared at him, speechless with shock.

But it wasn’t at his words.

In the bright morning sun, I could clearly see his body and face were being covered in the lichen. I could see the stuff sprouting vibrantly along his deck, over his feet and crawling up his legs. As he moved towards me, the lichen was already reaching his thighs and moving upwards. There was growth on his hair too, and it was spreading down already almost covering his forehead.

It didn’t impede his movement. He strode towards me while I remained rooted and unable to turn and flee, even to call out for help.

“Do you even know what it’s like to have your heart shattered, ripped out and stamped on, you glassy whore?” he screamed, the lichen spreading further round his eyes and nose, already covering his torso.

“This is what a broken man looks like! Enjoy! You must be loving it, cunt!”

Even in the surreal terror of the moment, I couldn’t help flinching at the forbidden word, and the slight movement seemed to break my paralysis. I screamed for my husband, and turned to run inside.

Immediately I tripped over a pear tree root which seemed to have emerged from the soil only a second ago.

I felt something crawling up my bare legs, covering them.

I looked up at the beautiful branches of my tree, which I loved so much, patterning the blue sky.

John was screaming at me over the fence, but his voice was being muffled, and I knew without looking that it was being filled with the lichen.

Struggling to get up, I managed to raise myself, although my legs were now firmly pinned to the earth by the invading lichen. I glimpsed the man-sized lichen-covered figure that had been John and then -oh thank god- finally my husband appeared, wielding a kitchen knife.

His eyes wide with horror, he cut back the lichen even as it was growing up my waist, freeing my legs, and yanked me up.

The wave of lichen still lapping at our feet, we ran holding hands, faster than we had probably ever ran since we had been schoolkids. Fear prompted us to leap up our deck stairs like deer, and we dashed in, slamming the flimsy kitchen door shut.

The lichen was crawling up the deck stairs.

We looked at each other, and without a word, ran to the front door, with a brief pause to grab our phones and wallets.

Within five minutes we were driving down the street.

The front of John’s house was already entirely covered, and we knew ours would be too, soon.

It was a long time before we could return to our neighbourhood, finally free of the inexplicable deadly invasion which had originated from our neighbours' property, and re-settle back into our house.

The pear tree had survived the attack.

But the first morning back, as I stood in the kitchen looking out at the garden and the tree, I knew I would never go out again to enjoy it as I used to.

And we moved into a condo soon after.
