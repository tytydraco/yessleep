I've always found solace in the undulating hills and densely forested landscapes of the Adirondacks. As an introverted soul, it was the seclusion and quiet tranquility of this region of upstate New York that drew me in. But there's a peculiar road there that twists my tranquil appreciation into a coil of lingering dread. This road, known locally as Wait Road, serves as a shortcut, connecting my life between my girlfriend's house and my own.


Wait Road is an odd little passage, not much more than a narrow strip of pavement cutting through the wilderness. It's flanked by trees so close you could reach out your car window and brush your fingers against the bark. There are no lines painted on it, and cell service there is as nonexistent as the local populace.


One evening, under the enveloping blanket of night, I found myself driving down Wait Road, just like I'd done countless times before. My headlights cut through the darkness, revealing nothing but the repetitive pattern of passing trees.


But then, I saw it - a stop sign, sticking out of the ground like a monolith from another world. A beacon of red in an ocean of inky blackness. The strangeness of it sent a chill down my spine. The road had no intersections, no branching paths, just the endless procession of trees. There was no reason for a stop sign.


Cautiously, I stopped my car, perplexed by the oddity before me. I scanned the area for any signs of change, of human activity, of anything that could explain this sudden intrusion of order in the wilderness. Nothing.


It was then that I noticed them - two white, glowing orbs nestled in the tree line. Eyes. They were at a height that would suggest they belonged to a human, but they radiated an ethereal glow that was distinctly unhuman.


Frozen in my seat, I watched as the eyes began to move. They floated through the underbrush, maintaining their height but growing larger, as if whatever owned them was coming closer. Panic rose in my chest, my heart pounding like a desperate prisoner against my ribs.


I wanted to drive away, to leave this ungodly scene behind, but I was held by a silent agreement with the sign and the eyes. They stared at me as if evaluating my soul, peering into the very depths of my being. Time seemed to lose meaning; there was just me, the sign, and the eyes.


Suddenly, a low growl rumbled through the silent night, a sound so deep and primal that it resonated within my bones. It came from the direction of the eyes. It was a warning or maybe a verdict.


Without wasting another second, I floored the gas pedal, leaving the sign and the glowing eyes behind. But even as the road unfolded before me and my car roared through the tranquility of the Adirondacks, I could still feel those eyes watching me.


Now, every time I drive through Wait Road, I can't help but glance towards where the sign was, where the eyes watched me. The sign is gone, as if it was never there, but sometimes, just sometimes, I can see a faint glow from the corners of my eyes, waiting just out of sight.


The glowing eyes on Wait Road didn't follow me, didn't attack me. They just watched and waited. I still don't know what they were or what they wanted, but I know they're there, hidden in the forest, guardians of a lonely road, and a story no one else would believe. I can only wonder, in the deepest, darkest part of the night, what are they waiting for?
