When my grandmother, Gertrude, departed from this world, leaving behind only a forgotten house in the isolated village of Eichenwald, I became her reluctant heir. Distant relatives refused to take on the responsibility, and with a heavy heart, I decided to move into the house that held the hazy memories of a life obscured by Alzheimer's.  
  
My name is Anna, the eldest granddaughter of my grandmother. My entire family has been living in Germany for several generations—my parents, my siblings, and I reside in Monique, a village on the outskirts of Eichenwald. The village is not far away, so the journey is relatively short. I made the decision to move, as I was stepping into adulthood and yearned for more autonomy and privacy. After the mourning period, I began packing my bags, loading them onto my small scooter.  
  
"Goodbye, my daughter. Take care," my father said, giving me a kiss on the forehead. "Let us know when you arrive."  
  
I hopped on the motorcycle and rode through forested roads for about 40 minutes until I reached the landscape that briefly housed my childhood. It was a modest wooden house, secluded amidst the shadows of ancient trees—mighty oaks and resounding pine trees. As I entered, the dusty furniture and faded walls screamed of abandonment. The smell of mildew and dampness filled my nostrils as I opened the windows to let the air in. I began a thorough cleaning, which lasted the entire afternoon. Exhausted by the end of the day, I decided to go up to the attic—not to clean, as I lacked the strength, but to check on things.  
  
The attic seemed, in some ways, untouched. Small dollhouses with porcelain dolls, a miniature toy kitchen set, and even a giant teddy bear. However, what truly caught my eye was a beautiful dressing table—wooden, pink-stained, with a slightly dusty mirror. As I approached, I noticed a small leather-bound agenda tied with a ribbon. I picked it up carefully, opened it, and saw the title: "Mein Tagebuch." It was her diary. I decided to take it, to read a little, to learn more about how this kind lady saw the world. After a hot shower, planning my routine for the next day, the diary rested on my bed. I dressed and picked it up to read before bedtime.  
  
A fact I must mention is that my grandmother hadn't lived in this house for years. She moved to Monique when she was around 15, and about 22 years ago (coincidentally my age), she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She never had the chance to return, living with us and other relatives until her last days. As I opened the pages, her memories flooded back. Since I was a child, Gertrude told me captivating stories about her home, her adventures—whether stealing apples from the neighbor's orchard by leaping over the frozen river, herding cattle through the fields, or about her childhood friend, a fairy named Silbi. Regarding the latter, she claimed Silbi appeared when she was five and had been her constant companion since. I, like any skeptical child, believed Silbi was just a product of her foggy imagination—a cherished imaginary friend that her damaged mind confused with reality.  
  
However, as I flipped through the diary, I discovered some rather eerie things about this supposed Silbi.  
  
In the first mention of her, a strange account was written: Supposedly, Silbi appeared to her, asking for help. Gertrude mentioned that there were evil creatures in the neighbor's barn, and Silbi told her she needed to spread a magical powder to ward them off and protect the animals. My grandmother obeyed and placed the "magic powder" in the neighbor's barn. The date matched an event we knew about—an unfortunate incident where the neighbor's barn, along with animals and the neighbor himself, caught fire. According to the diary, this happened a day after my grandmother applied the "magic powder."  
  
I decided to transcribe a few other strange entries here:  
  
**July 23, 1938**  
  
*Dear diary,*  
  
*Silbi visited me again, her golden hair shining with a beautiful glow! This time, she said the village's crops were failing due to the hunger of the guardian creatures. She claimed I could help by performing a simple ritual in the field.*  
  
*I followed her instructions carefully, drawing symbols she asked for and reciting some peculiar words. Everything seemed to improve instantly; the crops began to grow rapidly, and my father seemed very happy. But as night fell, what emerged from the ground wasn't delicious food but twisted and dark roots. Silbi appeared in my room at night, crying and saying I had done something wrong, hadn't drawn the right symbols, or said a dangerous word. We would starve this winter.*

  
  
**December 5, 1942**  
  
*Dear diary,*  
  
*Silbi appeared urgently, her eyes reflecting a sadness that cut my heart. She claimed the forest spirits were weakening due to the advancement of the plantations. She said the animals were being hunted, and the trees were being displaced. To help the spirits, they would need something with great spiritual energy. She took out a metal box from one of the bushes; it gleamed like crystal. "Take it; I need you to put something of great value to you, something that brings you joy day and night, something that represents the most important to you. This will give the spirits the strength, and everything will be fine."*  
  
*I chose a necklace that had belonged to my mother; it was one of the few memories I had of her. I put it in the box and handed it to Silbi. Nothing happened; the spirits continued to die. She said it wasn't a strong enough object, and it was my fault; I spent the whole night crying.*

  
  
I continued flipping through the pages as the stories became stranger—Silbi's supposed "help" requests and their disastrous results. Some tragedies and things I wouldn't dare recount here. However, one entry in particular caught my attention, the last entry of the diary when my grandmother was 15:  
  
**October 31, 1945**  
  
*Dear diary,*  
  
*Harold, the farmer's son, whom I've been seeing, proposed to me. Dad agreed, and we're happy! I plan to move with him to the big city as soon as I can, not just because of our wedding, but because of recent events...*  
  
*Silbi is no longer the kind friend I knew in my childhood. She appeared before me tonight with empty eyes, her smile devoid of any trace of sweetness. Her once radiant and glowing skin now had a dead grayish tone and peeled in some places.*  
  
*She came and told me I was foolish; the rituals we performed in the past, the objects I gave her, and even my blood, were used by her in a macabre pact. Now, we are bound to each other until death. No! I can't bear it! This is too much for me!*  
  
*Today, later, she offered a terrible choice, a sinister bargain. Silbi said I could free myself from her, but I would have to offer someone in my place—a child as innocent as I once was... I couldn't resist; her oppression weighed me down and left me unable to take any action; I had to accept.*  
  
*"I don't...I don't want to subject someone to this," I whispered in tears. "I don't even know any children."*  
  
*"Oh, don't be like that... let's schedule a payment, shall we?" She laughed. "How about offering one of your future children?"*  
  
*My heart began to pound; I couldn't...*  
  
*"No, I can't...." I started crying. She approached me, her cold hands touching my back in a kind of macabre comfort.*  
  
*"And what about... a child you don't know? A grandchild?"*  
  
*"What? But... I don't."*  
  
*"Well, it's the best choice, Ger... you wouldn't want me to choose for you, would you? You wouldn't want me to freely choose one of your little ones..."*  
  
*"I... I accept."*  
  
*She sealed a contract with me; I cannot break it. She will accompany me in my dreams, in my visions, while waiting for my seed... Forgive me, unknown child, forgive me! I won't be able to warn you; she sealed my silence in the contract, and I don't know what might happen to me if I try to stop her. Forgive me, forgive me.....*

  
  
I was stunned. The rest of the pages were covered in "forgive me" and "I didn't want this" scribbles. I hear footsteps, whispering voices, and shadows at the windows. I just want to get out of here, but I can't; something locked the doors and windows, and believe me, there's no breaking them—I tried. 

A song sung by a raspy and scratchy throat echoes every night from the basement, but I dare not go up there. I hope at least my internet connection still works, and this reaches someone. If anyone lives near H̸e̷r̵m̶a̵n̴n̶s̸t̸r̷a̶s̵s̴e̸ ̶ XX, please help me. Silbi wants to play, and I need someone in my place.
