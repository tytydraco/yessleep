I moved into my new apartment about three months ago. It’s a decently sized place in an older building downtown, the kind of place with creaky floors, high ceilings, and a constant, low hum in the walls—like the building itself is quietly breathing. It’s not glamorous, but I like it. Cheap rent, nice light, and mostly quiet neighbors.

Mostly.

A week after I moved in, I started hearing thumps at night. I figured it was the upstairs tenant at first—maybe they dropped something, or had a hyper dog. But the pattern was weird. One thump. Then silence. Then two quick ones. Then nothing for hours. Like someone was knocking, but not on my door. I ignored it. Cities are noisy.

Then I started noticing cold spots. Specific spots, too. Like, one corner of the bedroom would feel like a fridge had been left open there, even with the window shut and the heater running. That was when I joked to my friend that the place might be haunted. I laughed, she didn’t.

Week four, I was moving my bookshelf and noticed something strange. The wall behind it sounded… hollow. I tapped around it, and the sound changed about a foot from the floor. It was subtle, but definitely a different echo. My curiosity got the better of me, so I did what any irresponsible tenant with zero regard for their deposit would do—I pulled up the floorboard.

It came up easily. Too easily.

Underneath was a small, metal hatch. No dust on it, no spiderwebs. Like it had been used recently.

Against my better judgment, I opened it.

The smell hit first. Damp, but not like mold—like old sweat and copper. The hatch led to a narrow crawlspace, no taller than maybe three feet. It sloped downward under the apartment floor. My phone flashlight barely cut through the dark, but I could see that the tunnel curved left, out of sight.

I should’ve closed it right there. But I didn’t.

I crawled in.

The air got colder with every foot forward. I moved maybe twenty feet before the tunnel opened into a low, concrete room—maybe 10x10 feet, with smooth walls, like it had been deliberately constructed. It was too clean. No cobwebs, no debris. Just dust, a single folding chair in the middle, and… a wall covered in photographs.

Dozens of them. All black and white. All of the same man.

Some close-ups of his face. Others from a distance. A few were of him sleeping. The most recent one—clearly taken with a phone camera—was of him walking into my building. I recognized the lobby wallpaper. I recognized the timestamp. It was two days ago.

There was a note pinned under that photo.

"HE LIVES HERE NOW."



My blood turned to ice.

I backed out slowly, quietly, not even daring to breathe too hard. I put the hatch back, shoved the bookshelf over it, and didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I called my landlord. Asked if the unit had a crawlspace or access tunnels for maintenance.

He said no. Sounded confused. Said there used to be a boiler room system under the building in the 60s, but it had been filled in decades ago. When I asked about previous tenants, he hesitated and said,

“People don’t usually stay long in that unit.”



I moved out that weekend. Didn’t even bother packing everything. Some clothes, laptop, important documents—I left the rest. I didn’t tell anyone why. Not even my parents. They’d just worry.

Last week, out of morbid curiosity, I looked up the building online. A forum thread. Some urban explorers had checked it out.

Someone had posted a photo from inside a hidden room.

It was the same room. Same concrete walls. Same folding chair.

But now, there was a new photo on the wall.

It was of me.

Sleeping.
