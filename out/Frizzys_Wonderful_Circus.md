The car door slammed shut behind me as I stared at the faded sign. The sign had once said *Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus*, now laid in disrepair. I sighed, the place of my childhood stood in complete disrepair. Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus, the small town middle of nowhere version of Chuck E Cheese. My parents would drive me here whenever I got too rowdy to stay on the farm. It even got to the point where I would do it on purpose just to get a trip here. The “Circus” consisted of Frizzy, the leader who was a white and black rabbit, Sassy, a fluffy red, black, and white calico cat, Pogo, a black and white Border Collie with ice blue eyes, Izzy, a gray elephant with large gray ears with large green eyes, Tigris, a stunning tiger with piercing amber eyes, and Everest, an arctic fox with pale blue eyes. When I was a kid, Sassy always ended up as my favorite, her sassy attitude and her dry jokes were the laugh of the crowd. Pogo had always scared me though, his blue eyes looking slightly too human and his sharp voice and rowdy personality causing me to scream and sob the first time he appeared, clinging to my parents as they tried to console me. Even after I had gotten over the incident I was still wary of him, never approaching the animatronic after the shows. 



The front door screeched open, disturbing a place that had been silent for years and even I winced, as if waking up a dark force. I never can remember when the place closed. I just knew I stopped going suddenly and my parents paled whenever I brought it up. Every time I searched it up when I was older, nothing popped up. It was like some deeply covered secret. Even locals wouldn’t talk about it. When I brought it up they tensed and any former friendly conversations lost their friendly touch and turned more skeptical. I was planning on touring it anyway but my true purpose was to discover the reason for Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus closing. 



I walked into the building, papers were scattered all over the floor and the floor had a dark stain long dried on its surface. I concluded it was likely water damage, although it was fairly dark for water damage. The floor creaked under my weight as I walked along the flooring. I peered curiously into each room and even peeked at some of the papers. Most were far too old and damaged to even read but the ones I could were nothing more than financial records. I pushed open a door to the stage area and as I peered at it, nostalgia flooded my body. A little more rundown but it looked nearly the same. I was peering around the stands when I heard the first noise.



“W-w-....,” A robotic voice sounded out, “Welcome to F-frizzy’s Wonderful-l-l Circus-s-s.”

I jumped into the air and whipped around to the stage where Frizzy was doing the screeching twirl he always did after the introduction. It was my first look at animatronics. Frizzy’s ear was snapped clean off, metal and all, half of his face was torn off, and one of his eyes dangled out of his socket. His two buck teeth were a rusty brown, suiting the rest of the metal on his body, a dark stain crept up his once soft fur leaving it crusty. A shiver ran down my spine. The power wasn’t on in this place. None of the animatronics should function but Frizzy was. I crept down the stands where kids and parents alike sat for shows and over to the robot. I reached up a hand, ready to touch the robot, when it jerked again. 



“H-hello, kids-s-s. Ready-y-y to m-meet the c-crew-w-w. Are y-you ready-y-y for the s-show-w-w?” The voice stuttered out. The spotlights flickered on and revealed the empty parts of the stage where the other animatronics should stay. From another area, heavy footsteps were heard from behind me. I spun around and the footsteps stopped and when I turned around everything was still. I shrugged it off, excusing it as an electrical problem, the old system kicking in. I continued on the stage, the circus setting visible, the stand where Tigris usually stood. The ring hung above where Izzy usually hung. The large stone that Tigris stood upon, a false ring of fire standing near. A large snowy ski hill where Everest took her place stood empty, dark stains spread across the floor in streaks like something was dragged through it. That thought chilled me as I realized how eerie this place was. For some reason, that didn’t deter me and I kept moving forward, intent on exploring my childhood place. The lack of the familiar animatronics didn’t deter me. I only assumed they had been scrapped for parts and Frizzy was left because perhaps they couldn’t remove him or some other lame thought. 



The next hallway led to the play area, a massive multicolored playground with many slides all leading to a massive ball pit. I had spent many hours in this thing as a kid but a strange odor of something rotten floated out of it causing me to gag. I continued forward, holding a hand over my nose as if that would stop the smell. I shone my flashlight into the pit but nothing was there and I certainly didn’t want to touch it. All I knew was that some rat, or something, had died there. I didn’t want to touch it. A scampering sound was heard from above and I shone my light up to see something skitter by. I leaped back with a yelp, before laughing at myself. It was most likely some rodent or wild animal. It did look a little bigger though…



I open a door to a storage closet and let out a strangled scream at the sight before me. Sassy laid before me, or what used to be sassy. Her long fluffy fur was matted, the suit of her ear was missing revealing the metal support below. Her legs were completely torn off and she could no longer even stand, the same reddish brown stain was spread across her and she was lying in it. 



“Oh.” I mumbled, kneeling down beside her, I reached out a hesitant hand before setting it down on her. My heart throbbed but I closed my eyes for a moment. The animatronic suddenly jerked beneath me with a metallic screech. 

,

“W-w-won’t y-you e-ever j-just…” Sassy began, “s-shut up-p-p, Frizzy-y-y?”

I laughed despite myself, it was her typical line during every show. The short-tempered sassy calico cat was always the heart of the show, besides Frizzy of course. I got up, wiping my hands on my pants with a grimace. The rust-colored crust had come off on my hand in dust, a metallic scent coming off of it. The smell was familiar but I couldn’t place it and I didn’t care at the time. How I would regret that decision. I exited the supply closet leaving Sassy to go through her routine with no one to see and unable to even complete it. 



In the next room was where I believe everything went wrong. It started in a dead silence, not even the creak of the building settling. The silence was broken by a *screech, screech, screech, screech.* I whipped around and a scream tore its way out of my throat. The suitless version of Pogo, with his slightly too-human eyes, stood before me, a snarl visible on his face. His teeth were daggers. His head jerkily tilted to the side, blinking his eyes once, a stuttering sound was heard and it took me a moment to realize it was a growl. One that was slightly too animalistic for an animatronic. It took one shuddering step forward, its mouth opening, revealing those razor-sharp teeth. That was when I bolted. I raced through the halls, dodging rubble and anything I could trip over. All I heard behind me was a *thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud*. That was all that kept me going. 



I almost screamed again when I came across Sassy, hissing and furious, crawling across the ground, her eyes almost glowing in the faint light. I leaped over her, dodging her razor-sharp claws by an inch, stumbling on the landing. I picked up the pace weaving in and out of areas. A figure crawling around on all fours approached, the orange and black fur of Tigris was noticeable. Her eyes were narrowed and she pressed down and I knew instantly what was going to happen. I dove out of the way as she leaped into the air, her claws slicing through nothing but air. I quickly scrambled to my feet and took off faster than the light I needed to get out. 



I got to the main stage and everything looked near the same until I reached where Frizzy stood. The ringmaster was gone, the place where he stood held nothing. A metallic-sounding clink was heard from somewhere to my right. When I looked over, there was the rabbit, his face in a freakish smile that shouldn’t be possible. He had a bouncing walk, almost like a skip but more rusted. He did a twirl before continuing onward, a laugh sounding across. 



“H-hello kiddo! R-ready for-r-r your-r-r special show-w-w?” Frizzy stuttered out. I was NOT ready. I turned and bolted towards the door. I skidded to a halt when I saw Izzy and Everest standing in front of it, blocking it off. Everest’s mouth opened wide and let out a screech. I covered my ears but bolted in another direction. A door I had not entered was visible to the side. 



I burst through the door, slamming it shut behind me and fumbling for the lock. I clicked the lock and turned around. I stared at the stairs in front of me and slowly descended them. This was the only place that was clean of the reddish-brown liquid and at that point, I didn’t even want to think what it was. Deep down I knew what exactly it was but I didn’t want to put it into words. To say what it was. Even if it was childish saying it made it *REAL,* 



A makeshift file room stood before me and by makeshift I mean it held two filing cabinets and then a few boxes on the floor. I opened the filing cabinet and pulled out the first file, flipping it open. 



*July 15th, 1993*

  


*The makings of Frizzy's Wonderful Circus Characters proved to be quite a challenge. Artificial intelligence just didn’t get the characteristics we thought were necessary. We felt that we needed something more REAL, more INTELLIGENT. This is when we came to the idea of making it real. Using something from the natural world to fuel intelligence. It started with experiments on animals, a rabbit, a border collie, a tiger, an elephant, and an Arctic fox. Then it evolved. We wanted them to be able to SPEAK. So we decided to bring in parrots but parrots can only repeat words. That was when the final experiment came into place. We would use humans. Of course, the human intelligence we used wouldn’t be aware of it. We would ensure that. Make sure it remained unaware enough that it never knew its true form.* 

  


*January 18th 1996*

  


*The human mind is becoming too aware but we are ordered to continue the experiments. Pogo’s eyes are wrong… too human. They almost seem aware of us. The animatronics are acting odd. Their limbs move in more animalistic ways. They seem aware of their presence. Aware they are ALIVE.* 



These files after that became unintelligible so I moved on to the other files. They were news articles.

*5 kids in the small town of \*REDACTED\* were reported missing earlier this week after failing to return home from school. No traces of the kids have been found. Police are currently investigating the possibility of foul play but have hopes they are still alive.* 



*July 15th, 1993*



*Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus, is a fun world of play and a place where kids can be kids!* 



*An animatronic location has popped up out of nowhere in the small town of \*REDACTED\*. A location-based around a circus, starring Frizzy, the rabbit, Sassy, the calico cat, Pogo, the border collie, Izzy, the Elephant, and Everest, the Arctic Fox.*



I went to flip to the next news article and another note fell out of somewhere in the pile. 



*June 20th, 1995*(A year before I stopped going to this place)



*The animatronics are almost… normal. Too normal. I fear they are planning something. An uprising, a dash to freedom, something. No one will listen to me. They think I’m foolish. I know I’m right though. Something is off.* 



Then a news article, dated the year I stopped going.

  


*June 20th, 1996*



*Malfunctions in the animatronics at Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus World have resulted in many deaths. The owner and maker of the animatronics have not responded, and the number of dead is currently unknown. A police investigation is ongoing, but the cause of the malfunction is unknown.* 



I am currently huddled in the file room, unsure of what to do or how to escape, there is no service and no way out and I fear they know. I had just finished writing this when the thudding began and the door shuddered from its force. The door won’t hold much longer but I needed to share the truth. The animatronics at Frizzy’s Wonderful Circus are aware of their origins. They are angry. They want out into the real world and when they do I am terrified of the damage they will cause. They want revenge. For others to know their pain.
