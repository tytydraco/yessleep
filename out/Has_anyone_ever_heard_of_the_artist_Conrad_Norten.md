I started looking for information on Conrad Norten because of an art history project. It's been 3 years since I finished that art project and I finally have found my answers.

Let me explain.

To be honest I don’t know where to start, I guess from the beginning 3 years ago I was 19 and going through college, I never really wanted to, I didn't even have a major. This was my second semester and I had to take a class to keep my student housing so I begrudgingly chose art history thinking How hard can it be? I would learn about a few dead guys and why this painting was meaningful. And that is what it was, I don't remember the first few classes, I don't even know if I went to them. I was never the best student, I just wanted to make music and see the world like every other teenager in 2022. Music was all I had as a college student, and the $16.23 sat fearfully in my bank account.

I started attending class more when I realized my attendance was 30% of my grade. To this day, I still believe that should be a crime. As I started to go to my classes,, and we learned about looking closer at paintings for clues about the painting's deeper message that might be hidden and about how the title of a piece can tell a whole story. I can’t help but wish I took more notes.

Then, on November 13, on a cold windy day in Chicago, my teacher told us we had to each pick an artist from the past 70 or so years to write a short biography about and then talk about the deeper meaning of a few of their paintings. I chose an artist from a list given to us by the professor. The name just stuck out to me, there was a weight to the words printed onto a plain piece of paper. Conrad Norten. Saying the name aloud felt forbidden, when I went to my teacher to tell her my artist of choice my throat suddenly started to dry up as the words left my mouth,

“My artist of choice is Conrad Norten,” I mumbled to my teacher, my face felt red, as I could feel the heat start spreading from my cheeks to my nose, to my ears until I was sweating, At the time, I thought it was a fever, head cold, too many layers. I felt like I was lying or saying a forbidden word. Saying that name felt wrong, but I still blamed the bad weather and the questionable food at my friend's house. But now, I think it was him.

The research started half-heartedly, I didn't care much, I just needed to pass this class by any means. I learned the basic things about my artist of choice, he was born to a poor family in the middle of somewhere in Texas, on January 5, 1956, he struggled in school and dropped out in 10th grade to pursue his art in 1972 around the age of 16 and moved out of his parents house a year later with money he had saved from some odd jobs. Conrad in 1978 began working at a bar during nights for 45 hours a week. He would spend the rest of his time painting. I didn’t understand how this man had time to work enough hours to support himself and create so much detailed art.

His art was as if the world had a distorting filter on it. The colors never were in the lines, nor did they go together. Nothing looked real. Yet each one looked like a real place, a real photo, a real reality.

Sorry Reddit it’s late and I have to work in the morning. I will share more of what I have discovered about Conrad as soon as I get the chance.
