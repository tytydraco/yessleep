My transformation into a monster saved us all.

Not fighting it – surrendering to it. Completely. Utterly. While reality fractured around us and the toothed sky devoured what remained of the moon.

"Your blood is connected to them," Lola Rosa had explained, her wounds leaking shadows instead of blood. "Connected to her. If you transform fully..."

"I can break them from the inside," I finished, understanding at last.

The price was everything I'd fought against. My humanity. My soul. The last barriers holding back the hunger. But watching the transformed children crawling on the ceiling of our ruined healing house, their bodies twisting into geometric impossibilities, I knew we had no choice.

Maria argued against it. "We just found my grandfather's journal," she protested. "There has to be another way."

But the journal's pages were transforming too, the words crawling like insects, rewriting themselves into prophecies of hunger. We were out of time.

I stopped taking the herbs. Stopped fighting the change. Stopped pretending I was still human.

The transformation, when it finally came, was glorious agony.

My spine didn't just split – it shattered, rearranging into crystalline structures that sang with impossible frequencies. Wings burst from my back in fractal patterns, each feather a blade, each blade a mouth. My tongue elongated into a nest of writhing tendrils that could taste time itself.

I became beautiful. I became terrible. I became true.

Susannah found me as I rose into the reality-warped sky, my new form a match for her impossible geometry.

"Finally," she breathed, her voice harmonizing with the screams of the transformed village below. "Finally you understand."

"Yes," I said with my hundred mouths, tasting her essence on the quantum wind. "I understand everything."

She never saw the blessed stingray tail until it was too late. I'd dissolved it into my transforming flesh, let it become part of my new anatomy. When we came together in what looked like an embrace, it pierced her from a dozen angles simultaneously.

Her scream shattered windows in seven dimensions.

But she wasn't alone. Her family rose around us, their forms even more terrible than hers. Elena's body had become a recursive nightmare, each layer containing smaller, hungrier versions of herself. The grandmother was a void shaped like hunger, rimmed with infinite teeth.

The battle that followed destroyed what remained of physical law.

Maria led the ground assault with the last of her grandfather's weapons – blessed bullets that could bend around corners, holy water grenades that exploded in patterns that canceled out monstrous geometries. Lola Rosa's voice rose in prayers that made reality remember its original shape.

I fought in the space between spaces, using my newfound connection to their blood against them. Every transformed child they'd made, every victim they'd changed – all of them were connected to the original corruption. To Susannah's line.

To me.

The transformed children came to my call first. Their impossible anatomies recognized something in my new form – not just monster, but protector. Their fractured minds sensed the blessing hidden in my corruption.

"Help us," they cried with their mouths of void and flame. "Help us remember."

I reached into their twisted forms with my many tongues, tasting the original pattern of their humanity. Found the thread of Susannah's corruption and devoured it with my blessed teeth.

They fell from the sky like rain, their bodies remembering human shape.

But the aswang weren't finished. As their army of transformed children reverted, they struck back with the full force of their ancient hunger. Reality warped further. The ground grew wings. The air became teeth.

Ana and Diego led a group of villagers in laying salt lines that moved like rivers, corralling the transformed ones into killing grounds. Father Santiago's broken body pulled itself together long enough to speak prayers that made monsters remember their mortal shapes.

Not all could be saved. Some transformations had gone too deep, rewritten too much of what they once were. Those, I had to end. Each death tasted like failure on my thousand tongues.

The final confrontation came at midnight, in a space that was no longer physical.

Susannah faced me in a void between moments, her form still beautiful despite the blessed wounds. "They'll never accept you back," she said. "You're like me now. A thing of hunger and impossible geometry."

"No," I said, understanding finally flowing through my transformed mind. "I'm what you could have been. What you chose not to be."

My wings, blessed and corrupt, spread through dimensions she couldn't reach. The stingray tail poison in my veins sang a song of ending.

She fought. God, how she fought. Her tongue became a universe of blades. Her hunger became a gravity that consumed light. Her love – because part of her did love me, in her monstrous way – became a weapon that tried to reshape my reality.

But I had something she didn't: I remembered being human.

The blessing in my monstrousness came from choice. From sacrifice. From the willingness to become a horror in order to end one.

When I tore her apart, I did it with mercy.

The others followed – Elena dissolving into recursive nothingness, the grandmother's void-form collapsing in on itself. One by one, the ancient aswang died, taking their corrupted reality with them.

Dawn came. A human dawn.

The sky forgot its teeth. The ground lost its wings. Children fell asleep in normal beds, their geometries simple and mortal once more. Reality snapped back like a rubber band, leaving only scars where impossible things had been.

But not everything could be fixed.

Maria found me trying to transform back, my blessed monstrous form refusing to fully release its hold. "Some changes mark us forever," she said softly.

I looked at my hands – human-shaped now, but marked with fractal patterns that shifted in certain lights. My tongue was still longer than it should be. My eyes still saw through too many dimensions.

But I was me. Changed, scarred, marked by both blessing and corruption – but me.

The village rebuilded. Lola Rosa's healing house filled with survivors – not all of them fully human anymore, but all of them choosing to be something more than monsters.

Ana's scars remained, but she could carry children again. Diego's nightmares continued, but now he used them to hunt down other aswang, protecting others from what he'd survived. The transformed children had to relearn how to be human, but they did it together.

Maria stayed. So did the knowledge in her grandfather's journal – now stabilized, a warning and a guide for future generations.

And me? I learned to live between forms. Human enough to remember mercy, monster enough to fight the darkness. My wings emerged only when needed, blessed and terrible and mine.

Sometimes, on nights when the moon is dark and reality feels thin, I taste Susannah's essence on the wind. Part of me still hungers. Part of me always will.

But I hunt different prey now. Hunt those who hunt the innocent.

After all, every monster needs a monster to fear.

And I remember being both human and horror.

I remember the price of love, of mercy, of sacrifice.

I remember the taste of impossible geometries, and I choose, every day, to remain just monster enough to protect what matters.

Just monster enough to stay human after all.
