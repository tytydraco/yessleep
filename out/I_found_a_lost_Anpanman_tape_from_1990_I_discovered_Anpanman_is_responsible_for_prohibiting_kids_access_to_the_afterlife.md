The basement of my Japanese grandmother's house always gave me the creeps. It was an ancient, cobwebbed space, filled with dusty boxes and mismatched furniture. I had always assumed that it was the typical clutter of a lifetime of memories. It wasn't until I was cleaning it out after her passing that I stumbled upon something that would change my life forever.  
  
Hidden amongst the piles of moldy books and knick knacks was a set of old VHS tapes. They were carefully wrapped in yellowing newspaper, as if they held some sort of significance. Curiosity got the better of me, and I carefully unwrapped the aged paper to reveal a faded label on the tape: "Anpanman - yaman 04.06.1990."  
   
For those who don't know, Anpanman is a classic Japanese children's show that began airing in the late 80s and still airs today. It features a superhero called "Anpanman", who saves the world from a bacteria character called "Baikinman" while giving people parts of his head as food and teaching kids important life lessons. It was a show that I fondly remembered from my childhood, but I hadn't seen it in years.  
   
As I held the worn tape in my hands, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The handwriting on the label was shaky and hurried, as if it were written in a hurry by someone desperate to preserve the memory. I dug an old VCR out of the basement and hooked it up to a small TV in the corner of the room. The screen flickered to life, casting an eerie glow over the musty darkness. I hesitantly inserted the tape and pressed play.  
   
It started as any other episode—Anpanman flying through the sky, the catchy theme song playing in the background. If you’ve ever watched the viral Youtube video: "When you’re overqualified for the job", then you will know this song. The colors were slightly faded, but otherwise, it seemed like a normal recording. That is, until the scene suddenly cuts to black. I squinted at the screen, unsure if the tape was damaged, but a moment later, the image returned.  
  
‘I realized how great it is to live…’  
‘Even if the scar in my heart hurts.’  
‘What was I born for?’  
‘What will I do in my life?’  
  
Dokinchan and Kokinchan (search them up) appeared on the screen. But something was terribly wrong. Their faces were missing. No eyes, no mouth, no nose – just a smooth, blank expanse of white skin. They stared directly at the screen, as if they could see into my very soul. The background was a deep, abyssal black, swallowing all light and hope.  
   
I felt a chill run down my spine. This wasn't just a simple error in the animation; it was a deliberate choice, a message meant for someone. But who? And why? The scene continued, with the two faceless characters standing motionless as an eerie, discordant melody began to play. It was a haunting tune, one that seemed to echo the despair that radiated from the screen.  
  
‘I don’t like not being able to answer these questions.’  
‘By living in the present our heart burns.’  
‘That’s why you go with a smile on your face.’  
  
As the music continued, I felt an increasing sense of dread. The faceless characters seemed to be growing closer, their featureless countenances filling more and more of the screen. I knew I should look away, but I couldn't tear my eyes from the horrifying scene. The melody grew louder, more discordant, and I felt my heart pounding in my chest.  
   
Just as it seemed that the faceless figures would consume the entire screen, the tape suddenly cut out. The TV screen went dark, leaving me sitting in the dim light of the basement, my heart racing and my hands shaking. I felt cold, as if a great weight were pressing down on me, smothering me with its oppressive darkness.  
   
I sat there, trying to catch my breath and gather my thoughts. My mind raced, trying to make sense of the chilling scene that had just played out before me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I had stumbled upon something sinister, something that had been hidden away for a reason. With trembling hands, I ejected the tape and examined it once more, my eyes searching for any clue as to its origin or purpose.  
   
As I turned the tape over in my hands, I noticed a small, nearly illegible note scrawled on the back of the label. It read:  
   
"May the innocent souls be saved."  
   
The words sent a shiver down my spine. What did it mean? Who were the innocent souls, and what did they need saving from? And how was this strange, disturbing version of Anpanman connected?  
   
Determined to find answers, I decided to dig deeper into my grandmother's belongings. I searched through the dusty boxes and piles of clutter, looking for anything that might give me some insight into the tape's origins. As I rummaged through the basement, I came across a tattered old journal that had belonged to my grandmother. Its pages were yellowed and brittle, filled with her neat, precise handwriting.  
   
I carefully flipped through the pages, looking for any mention of the tape or the strange images I had seen. As I neared the end of the journal, I stumbled upon an entry that made my blood run cold.  
   
It was dated 1990, the same year as the tape. In the entry, my grandmother described a series of strange occurrences that had been plaguing the small town where she lived. Children had begun to suffer from unexplained illnesses and nightmares, and several had even gone missing without a trace. The townspeople were on edge, with whispers of dark forces and supernatural events spreading like wildfire.  
   
As I read on, my grandmother described her own investigation into the matter. She had discovered a connection between the afflicted children—they were all fans of Anpanman. In fact, they had all been watching the show on the same day, just before their troubles began. The more she investigated, the more she became convinced that there was something sinister at work—something that was using the beloved children's show to target its young audience.  
   
The entry ended with my grandmother's chilling conclusion:  
   
"I fear that whoever is behind this is trying to prevent these innocent souls from finding peace in the afterlife. I must find a way to stop them, to save these children from a fate worse than death."  
   
My heart pounded in my chest as I closed the journal, the pieces of the puzzle starting to fall into place. The tape, the faceless characters, the haunting melody – they were all part of some nefarious plot to trap young souls and prevent them from moving on to the afterlife.  
   
I knew I had to do something, to find a way to break the curse and free the trapped souls. But how? And who created this twisted version of Anpanman in the first place?  
   
I couldn’t stay in that basement a moment longer. I clutched the tape and journal to my chest and raced up the rickety stairs, not stopping until I was outside in the bright sunlight. I leaned against the side of the house, trying to catch my breath as I contemplated what to do next.  
   
It was clear I had to take the tape to TMS Entertainment, the studio that created Anpanman. They might be able to identify who created this sinister version and how to counteract its evil power. Without delay, I hopped in my car and began the three-hour drive to Tokyo.  
   
As I neared the sprawling metropolis, an ominous feeling crept into my chest. The towering skyscrapers that normally inspire awe now felt oppressive, as if they were watching my every move. I shook off the paranoid feeling and made my way to the TMS Entertainment building, a gleaming edifice of steel and glass.  
   
At the reception desk, I asked to speak to someone about an urgent matter regarding Anpanman. The receptionist looked at me strangely but paged someone from the creative department.  
   
A few minutes later, a man in a crumpled suit approached me. "How can I help you?" he asked. His tired eyes and defeated posture made me hesitate for a moment. But the memory of my grandmother’s chilling discovery steeled my resolve.  
   
I held out the sinister tape. "I found this in my grandmother’s basement. It’s...it’s not a normal episode of Anpanman."  
   
The man took the tape, eyeing it dubiously. But as he examined the faded label and noticed the strange inscription on the back, his eyes grew wide. He looked up at me with a mixture of fear and disbelief.   
   
"Where did you get this?" he demanded.  
   
I explained the whole story to him: discovering the tape after my grandmother’s passing, watching the disturbing content, finding her old journal, and learning the truth about its origin. By the time I finished, the man’s face had gone pale.    
   
He turned to me with a grim expression. "You shouldn’t have come here. Now that you know the truth, you're in grave danger."  
   
Before I could ask what he meant, two security guards approached us. "We need you to come with us for questioning," they said sternly. The man who had been helping me averted his eyes, refusing to meet my gaze.   
   
The guards escorted me to an empty room and forced me into a chair. "Do not try to leave," they commanded, locking the door behind them.  
   
A few agonizing minutes passed before the door opened again. But instead of the guards returning, a team of people in surgical masks and gloves entered, wheeling in a table covered in strange medical equipment. At the center of the table was a massive pile of anpans, the bean-filled buns that Anpanman was made of.   
   
"Eat." commanded a muffled voice from behind one of the masks.  
   
I stared at them in disbelief. "What...what is the meaning of this?"   
   
"You know too much," the voice replied. "The only way we can allow you to leave here alive is if you eat every last anpan on that table."  
   
My mind raced. I thought of making a run for it, but I knew the guards would stop me before I could escape. I was trapped, with no choice but to comply with their bizarre demand if I wanted to survive.  
   
With shaking hands, I reached out and took an anpan from the top of the pile. I bit into the soft, sweet bun, though I had never felt less hungry. The masked figures watched in silence as I choked down anpan after anpan, my stomach churning with each bite.   
   
By the time I reached the last bun, I felt horribly ill and groggy. The room started spinning around me, the pile of empty wrappers blurring into a sea of red and white. I collapsed to the floor, darkness overtaking my vision as I descended into unconsciousness.  
   
I awoke with a start some time later, finding myself lying on the sidewalk outside in the slums somewhere. But something wasn’t right—my body felt strange, as if it didn't fully belong to me. I looked down at my arms and legs and gasped.  
   
I stared in horror at my limbs, which were now puffy and rounded. My skin had turned a grotesque red. I had been transformed into some sort of strange creature, like a parasitic life form inhabiting a human body.   
   
Panic rose in my chest as I examined the rest of my body. A crude stitching ran down the center of my torso, as if I had been hastily sewn together. Strange symbols and drawings were scrawled across my arms and legs in black ink, with satanic markings and cryptic letters swirling together into a sinister pattern.   
On my chest, someone had drawn a crude portrait of Takashi Yanase, the creator of Anpanman, surrounded by starving children with hollow, desperate eyes. The image turned my stomach, and I stumbled to the side of the road to throw up.   
   
As I knelt there retching, the full horror of my situation began to dawn on me. The tape, the journal, the nightmarish figures of Dokinchan and Kokinchan—they were all part of some twisted ritual to claim innocent souls. And now, by being forced to eat those anpans, I had become their latest victim.   
   
I was no longer human. My body and free will had been stripped away, claimed by the sinister forces behind that accursed tape. I was now a pawn in their evil scheme, trapped in this hideous form to do their bidding.  
   
In a frenzied panic, I raced down the street, stumbling and disoriented. I had to get away, to escape whatever sinister purpose they had in store for me. But no matter how far I ran, I couldn’t escape the prison of my own flesh.   
   
Exhausted, I collapsed in a heap in an alleyway. As I lay there, a new realization came to me. There was no escape from this fate; I was forever damned to this grotesque existence. But perhaps I could turn the tables on my captors, fight fire with fire using the abilities they had given me.  
   
With grim determination, I ran into a cosplay store to conceal my disfigured form and found a cosplay of Dokinchan. She is orange with magenta boots, a white face, white hands, and an orange antenna. It was like a mascot suit, but I wanted something more. Everyone is looking at me like I am a monster. I will hunt down the ones responsible for this evil, make them regret the day they chose me as their pawn. I would become their greatest nightmare and save any other innocents from suffering my fate.  
   
I walked out of there wearing white zentai, cat ears, and a white tail, glimpsing the woman at the counter calling someone. I carefully apply cat paws to my hands, and as I walk back into the alleyway, I put on fluffy white boots with pink cat paws on the bottoms of them. I was no longer the person I had once been. My humanity was gone, leaving behind only a desire for vengeance.   
   
From the shadows of the alley, a new creature emerged. No longer was I some hapless victim. I was now Fukia. Created out of the love of Dokinchan and Kokinchan, I protect humanity and will destroy anything that threatens love and joy throughout the world. I was the secret cover villain in the Anpanman series' creator's mind past the point of no return. As I reemerged into the lightingless night, the population of billions will know that true happiness and care are mindless lies. I will seek my vengeance, and nobody will interfere, or ethics, values, and compassion will collapse in endless suffering. Where Anpanman and his friends exist in our society like impenetrable gears preventing progress, they will grind humanity to its doom.
