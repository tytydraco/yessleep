I wasn’t sure when or who put it there, but a phone booth appeared outside my house. I hadn’t seen one in years and thought they were phased out. I wasn’t even sure what use it would be when I always had my phone on me and why was it outside my house.

I didn’t give it much notice until It started ringing late one night. I had no intention of getting out of bed to answer it. The ringing lasted all night and only stopped when the sun started to come up.  

The following night the phone started ringing again at the same time as before. I tried to ignore it, but something told me it was urgent.  

I put on my coat before heading out into the cold night air. I stood in the confines of the booth and picked up the receiver and placed it to my ear. 

“Hello, who is this?” I asked. 

At first, all I could hear was an ear-piercing crackling sound before it went silent. 

“Hello, my name is Maryann, what's yours,” said the voice of a young girl. 

I felt uneasy about the whole situation and didn’t think it was safe to give my real name, which, strangely enough, was Maryann. 

“My name is Suzan. How old are you Maryann?” I asked. 

“It's my tenth birthday today. I really like your name. It’s the same name my mother has.”

I felt a cold chill up my spine because that was also my late mother's name. 

“How did you find this number?” I asked. 

The phone went silent for a moment before I heard shouting on the other end of the phone. 

“That’s my dad. I need to go,” said the girl with a hint of fear in her voice. 

The phone suddenly went dead and all I could hear was static on the other end. 

The next night, as I lay in bed, I thought I must have dreamt it all. It was all just too surreal for it to have happened, but just as I was about to close my eyes, the phone rang again. 

The booth kept me dry from the relentless rain that was pouring down. 

I picked up the handset and was greeted with the same sweet voice from before. 

“Is this you Suzan?” Said the little girl. 

“It is Maryann. How are you tonight?” I asked. 

The little girl let out a deep sigh over the phone. 

“I’m sad, my dad was angry with me for being up late last night.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that Maryann. My dad used to be mean to me all the time as well.” I explained.

“Did you used to hide as well?” asked the little girl.

Tears streamed down my face as memories I had buried deep in my subconscious began to resurface.  

“I used to hide in the cupboard under the stairs,” I said as I wiped the tears from my face. 

“How are you able to ring me? I asked. 

“My mom bought me a “Dream Phone” for my birthday, and when I dialled one of the numbers, you answered.”

Getting a dream phone was one of the few happy memories I had as a child. The phone was off-limits, and if I was caught using it, I would have taken a beating. So when my mom bought me the dream phone for my birthday I remembered feeling so grown up even though it wasn’t real. 

The following day I couldn’t stop thinking about Maryann. I thought what was happening was some kind of psychotic break, but crazy people don’t normally think they are crazy. 

I pulled a box from my attic. It contained things from childhood including diaries I had kept growing up. I wasn’t sure why I kept on to it because I had so many bad memories attached to it. 

I flipped through one of the diaries I had written in around the time I was Maryann’s age. 

I flipped to the entries I had made around my tenth birthday. A feeling of dread crept up my spine as I read what I had written all those years ago. 

“Suzan seems so nice and we have a lot in common.”
 
My hands suddenly began to tremble as I read out the next passage. 

“Suzan used to hide under the stairs like me when she was young. Her daddy was mean too.”

That night I sat up waiting for the call. As soon as the phone rang I ran straight out to the phone booth. 

When I answered Maryann was crying on the phone, and I could hear a man shouting aggressively in between loud bangs. 

“What's happening, Maryann? I asked. 

“My Dad is drunk and he’s fighting with my mom.” I’m scared, Suzan, what will I do?” she asked as her voice trembled with fear. 

“You need to put down the phone and run to your safe place.” 

“What about my mom? He’s hurting her.”

I remember those nights so vividly now when my dad would beat my mother relentlessly, but I also remember when he was bored of beating her, he turned his anger on me. 

“Your mom is going to be ok. You need to get to the spot under the stairs.”

I could hear the screaming getting louder as if he was making his way to Maryann's room. 

“How do you know that's where I hide?” she asked. 

“That doesn't matter. You need to go now.” 

Suddenly, the phone went silent, and all I could do was pray she made it to her hiding place safely. 

I opened my old diary and flipped the pages. I remembered the date clearly because the fear I felt all those years ago was now raw in my mind. 

“Tonight, my dad was worse than ever, but thanks to Suzan, I made it to my safe place.” 

I couldn’t explain what was happening, but I could clearly remember writing it, but I couldn’t remember talking to Suzan, or in this case, myself. 

I flicked the page to a passage I wrote the night my life changed forever. It was the night my Dad killed my mother and tried to kill me. For the little girl on the phone, that date was tomorrow night. 

This time I waited in the phone booth for the phone to ring. 

It felt like I was back there the night it happened. My chest felt tight as if all the air was sucked from the booth, and I could hardly breathe. 

I picked up the receiver before it had time to ring twice. 

“Maryann, are you all right?” I asked. 

“I made it to my safe place just like you told me to.” 

I couldn’t help but smile. 

“You are so brave, Maryann, I’m so happy you are ok.”

“My dad has been acting even stranger today and my mom has been crying all day. I think she needs to go to the hospital.” 

Suddenly vivid memories of that night invaded my mind. Right before my Dad went crazy, I remembered him singing “Tonight the Night" by Neil Young as he wandered through the house looking for my mother. 

Just like all those years ago, I could hear my Dad sing that awful song through the phone; I knew Maryann needed to act now. 

“Maryann, I need you to be brave one more time. This time you need to go outside and run to a neighbor's house and beg them to call the police. Tell them your dad is killing your mother.” 

Just as she was about to say something, I screamed at her to run before the phone suddenly went quiet. 

I went back to the house and picked up my old diary. As I flicked to the next page and read the next passage I was suddenly overcome with emotion. This time, it was a happiness I’d never felt before. 

“I was a brave girl last night. I ran to the neighbors just like Suzan asked and the police came and arrested my Dad. I’m at my Aunt's now while my Mom gets better at the hospital.”

That night I dreamt of a life I never got to live. It was filled with happy memories of my mother as she got older. 

When I woke the following morning the phone booth had disappeared. I was filled with mixed emotions and was sad I wasn't going to get to talk to Maryann anymore. I wanted to hear her voice and tell me everything was all right. 

As I sat there drying my tears my mobile phone rang. I picked it up and began to shake as I looked at the caller ID which read “Mom.”

My hands trembled as I pressed the answer button. 

“Hey, Maryann. I’m just wondering if you are calling tonight. I’m cooking your favourite.
