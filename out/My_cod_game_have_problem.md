My cod game have a problem

Disclaimed this is a fictional stories so don't jugged me
When I ten year old I still remember that I very love call of duty and starting to get some interest in it.
And then like 2 month I get my birthday present and my relative give me a lot of stuff. Especially my brother he gave me a cod 2 game and I really love it. But after playing it,I start realise that my game have some thing weird , like when I go to the save I selected my map and somehow log in a map that no one in there , only thing appear it some trees I just thing it a bug but when I fire my Brent game just go crazy and it just make me feel ...bad for my TV . Ok I don't mention it on the first place but there it a account be for this account right here I asking my brother and he said he got this from a friend. that odd but idk , now I care .the account already play all the map but I see it like a hacker account more. I search for container and see a note in there
Part 2 coming soon


Part 2 
They are the "rule of the game" and it said this:
1 if you turn on game and see account name: Jeffery245 or totallyme908 then sorry you can outrun you fate
2 if you see other name like jk123, go down to rule 5
3 disc name is call of duty modern warfare, if you see 
Call of duty modern warfare 2 then call this number ******347**89
4 if you TV screen broke down said please go insert my live then you have 5 MINUTE to hide, NEVER hide under chair, bed, table. recommend to hide under staircase 
5 so you see the name so all you can do it pretending you don't see it otherwise when you giving to much attention to it you should go to bathroom and get a bucket of water then drink it but don't swallow it wait for it to come and spit the water out on the creature. It will kill it
6 other way for rule no 4 it only when you know English and Russian the speak to the thing finding you that " can my little live be spare" 5 time then it will be chance to live
7 if you see a guy with German army suit then gdhdgvcgvfghc


I get scared, what the hell going on
My dad come in and asking me that I'm I fine ? No I'm not fine at all. I want to take the game and toss is to Paris right now. My dad said : you game is haunted already
I shock. " You should know it better " " I find out this game on black market and it sus " I rushed to my brother room and frustrated with him " why you giving me this shit " I return my room and cry I'm sure that I see account name Jeffrey245, finally I trash the game then go to Reddit then found out that the last owner of the game died by the game with no reason explain, they said he have cheat and open a cursed file releases the demon go inside him, but he still have some humanely and write down the rule before he go down
Hell yes I dumped the game
