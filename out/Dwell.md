                           

Ineffable is the void left behind from the death of a spouse. It is a darkness so oppressive, so absolute that it fills each and every moment. I still have no memory of the day I found him. A defense mechanism of my own mind against the trauma of that day. Even the subsequent weeks have been a blur. Life in a waking dream, and dear god it has been busy. Endless stacks of paperwork, police reports, lawyers and funeral directors. There is hardly time to grieve.


 John left no family or friends behind in this world. We had each other and that was all we needed. Everything since his passing has been my solo burden to bear. In life he seemed to only have time for me and his work. I never questioned it. Hell, I relished every moment. With his job came travel, at times for long stretches, but he more than made up for it when he was home. His memory haunts me in every inch of this city consequently. Handheld evening walks in the park, countless dinner dates, a never ending search for that perfect cup of pour over coffee. There is not a place worth being that we hadn't experienced. A myriad of memories together. No more.

I knew immediately I had to leave this place, to escape the constant reminders of him. I wanted solitude in my grief. The sympathetic glances from neighbors, as well intentioned as they may have been, only served as a grim reminder. I needed a fresh start, a place where I knew nobody. I just didn't know where that could be.

It rained the day I buried him. A brutal and unrelenting rain that didn't let up until the darkest hours of night. I stayed up until dawn, I did most of the time back then. That night I found myself in the attic, a bottle of whisky at my side as I poured through boxes of old photographs. In a madness I had strewn them across the floor until I sat surrounded, an island in a sea of images. It was in the final box that I found it.

It was the oldest photo of John I had ever seen, and one of the few images of his entire family together. It was a picture long faded by time. The four of them pressed closely together in front of their towering red brick home, all framed by a gorgeous green mountain backdrop. I knew the matching red robes they wore to be religious in nature. Both of John’s parents were pastors after all.

I studied every detail of the photo for what felt like an hour, tracing my thumbs around its worn edges as I pondered. They all looked so stern, almost as if they were aware of the lifetime of tragedy that would befall their family. There was something magnetic about that red brick home, as if it contained the answers to all my problems. 

  John’s grandparents built that home, as well as the first church in Dwell. It was a new town then, a mining town like so many other Appalachian settlements. John didn't talk about his family all that much. It was understandable with how much of its history was plagued by death. I knew his grandparents passed away at a young age, an unfortunate family tradition that did not stop with them. A car wreck took both of his parents when he was in college. I never even had a chance to meet them. We bonded because of that initially. I had been long estranged from my family. They might as well have been dead. We were truly kindred spirits, two loners who had found their other half. He was everything to me.

 After the death of his parents, the house was inherited by his older sister Abigail. A reclusive and mysterious woman to me. I had only met her a single time at our wedding. She seemed to barely leave the family home. When she took her life last spring the house was passed onto John. The last remaining branch of a devastated family tree.

I had yet to visit the property, not even while she was alive. Something always seemed to come up despite my best efforts. John had made it clear he had no intention of selling the house. We talked of retiring there, of passing it along to our future children. At that moment it suddenly became clear what I must do. The house would stay with the family, it would stay with me. I needed an escape after all. 


Our current home sold almost as soon as it was put on market. I was not surprised  in the least, being that it was a gorgeous Victorian era build. We had put so much work into it over the past decade, and the neighborhood had only become more desirable year after year. My stress had not waned one bit during the selling process, deciding what to keep and what to donate. Each belonging holding a memory of us, of John. I attributed my morning vomiting bouts as stress related at first. With everything going on it seemed logical, as did me losing track of when I last had my period. 

As the days went on I began to have a suspicion my symptoms weren't stress related at all. I didn't want to believe the at home test at first. It didn't feel real until my doctor verified it. I felt so numb and conflicted upon her confirmation. How could I do this alone? We had wanted children but not like this. This was not part of the plan.

The human spirit is remarkable in its resilience however. With each passing day I found assurance in my situation. I felt excited even. As godless as I am I could see this for the blessing it was. With how much had been taken from me I was due to receive positive news. It was as if a small piece of John was to live on.

My mood continued to lift with each belonging I let go of. Every donated item a small weight off my heavy and fatigued shoulders. I even caught myself smiling again as I began to think of potential baby names. I debated many girl names, but I secretly hoped it would be a boy. I had a name already picked out for that situation: John.

 When the day finally arrived the movers had a light day loading the truck. I had given away almost everything we owned. I knew the house in Dwell was fully furnished, John had told me as much. I felt excitement as I followed them out of that crowded city. A fresh start awaited me, a rural oasis where I hoped life would move at a slower pace.

The mountains rose higher the further we drove. Gorgeous heavily wooded peaks dominated the landscape. Clear pristine waterways flowed abundantly, nurturing veins for the lush vegetation that seemed to grow on every surface. I felt a profound sense of awe as we rounded every corner. I had seen Appalacia, but not like this. So pure and rural, absolutely untamed.

The occasional towns we passed were a stark and bleak contrast to the beautiful countryside however. Impoverished and largely abandoned communities tucked into deep valleys. Industry had long left the area as did the majority of the people. Those left behind seemed truly trapped, left with limited economic opportunity. Too poor to escape. It seemed a hopeless existence, the kind that allows addiction and crime to thrive. I had heard the town of Dwell had escaped the fate of these other communities. John always spoke of the town so fondly. I hoped this would be the case.

Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer opulence I saw as we rounded the bend and descended into Dwell that first time. It looked like a postcard. Steep cliffsides bordered the town's perimeter. Large well maintained homes dotted the surrounding landscape. The cobblestone streets of the town centre straddled either side of a mighty river. We passed dozens of thriving shops as we drove through the square, bakeries, grocers, restaurants, there was everything one could desire. In the dead center of town stood a massive and ornate church, its narrow red brick peaks dwarfing the rest of the town's buildings. I marveled at the massive stained glass windows as we passed. It had to have been the church John’s grandparents built, it was the only church in town after all.

Even the townsfolk of Dwell looked different. So clean, so old fashioned in their dress. Women wore long flowing dresses, the men finely tailored suits. Young children frolicked across spacious green parks without so much as single hair on their heads out of place. I didn't think places like this existed anymore. “I could die in this town” I muttered to myself as we turned off onto a steep switchback that would lead us to our final destination.

I let out an audible gasp upon seeing the red brick home for the first time. It was even more sprawling and elegant than the photo had made it seem. Three stories of beautifully maintained brick and stone, immaculate arched windows, and steep tall slate roofs. I was especially surprised at how well manicured the grounds were. The grass was cut, hedges trimmed and a wide array of flowers were thoughtfully placed around the front porch. It was clear someone was caring for the property this past year.

The movers wasted no time unloading. They were behind me with boxes in hand as soon as I turned the key and opened the massive oak front door. I was prepared for cobwebs and dust, but much to my surprise the interior mirrored the immaculate nature of the landscaping. I felt a sense of wonder as I started about the maze of large and decadently furnished rooms that made up the first floor. I marveled at the antique pieces, the stone fireplaces, the floor to ceiling bookcases. Each room seemed more grand than the last. I loved the home immediately.

“You can take a break if you need, the house is old, not haunted” I jokingly remarked towards the frantic pace of the movers. “Just a long drive home is all ma’am” the older of the two replied without missing a beat. “You sure you don't want us to take any of these upstairs”?  I assured him they were fine stacked near the entrance. I knew it would take some time to find a home for everything I had brought, and time I had. 

I peered through the front door and watched as the truck headed down the long wooded lane then onto the steep mountain road that led us here. I was back in an all too familiar place now, I was alone. It was not for long however. As I set about unpacking I heard a loud knock on the front door. I opened it up to a tall and thinly framed old man. He politely removed his hat placing it to his chest, a smile forming on his wrinkled face.

“Good evening miss Volk” he said as he extended his right hand forward. “Please, you can call me Leah” I responded, shaking his extended hand. “My name is Abraham, my deepest condolences for your loss”. I managed a halfhearted smile as he continued on. “Jonathan placed me in charge of maintaining the property after his sister passed last spring, I hope it is to your liking”. I was quick to affirm the pristine condition of the property both inside and out. “It couldn't have been just you doing all of this”? I exclaimed. “Yes ma’am, we take care of our own here in Dwell”. I found it odd that John had made no mention of anyone looking after the place, but I was certainly grateful that he had. “Do I owe you anything for all this hard work Abe”? I motioned towards my purse hanging near the doorway. “Heavens no”! He exclaimed “After all your family has done for this town, it's the least I could do”. 

I thanked him again but was cut off before I could finish “Dwell owes our strong sense of faith to the Volks you know, they built the church after all. Yes ma’am god takes a special liking to our little town” his smile widened even further as he spoke. “Well it's a beautiful town” I said, returning his smile.  “Listen I don’t wanna take up all your time, I know you're busy, but if you ever need anything I'm your closest neighbor just right down the way”. He motioned back down the road towards town. “Not too many folks live up this ways, I’m the only other house fore you get into town, brick place like this, only a lot smaller”. I nodded and assured him I wouldn't hesitate to ask if I needed him. I habitually locked the door behind him as he left, old habits from city life. I supposed most people didn't feel the need to lock up here. Maybe someday I would feel the same sense of security.

My first week in Dwell flew by. I busied myself unpacking and exploring the town. Everyone was so nice, in an almost overbearing way. I don't think they got to see a lot of out of towners in such an isolated community. Almost every person I met inquired if I would be attending church that Sunday. I must have been the only godless soul in the entirety of town. I spent most mornings drinking herbal tea and overlooking the steep cliff face that bordered my backyard. The view was absolutely breaktaking, though I knew I would need to build a fence along its edge before the little one became mobile.

With the second week came the start of the nightmares. In the past I have never been able to recall my dreams. Even when my alarm wrenches me from a deep slumber the recollection is fleeting, gone before I even sit up. These are something else entirely. They are as vivid as they are persistent. 

The dream is the same each night. I am a silent spectator viewing John’s last moments alive. It’s as if I am a ghost following him about his day. It always begins the same, I trail him as he walks throughout our home. I want to grab him, tell him how much I miss him. My cries fall on deaf ears, my hands always a pace too far behind to make contact. I watch with confusion as he moves from room to room throwing valuables into a large duffel bag as he goes. Jewelry, cash, his prized rolex. I chase him to the back door, stopping as it slams in my face. I reach for the door knob wanting nothing more than to run after him, but it refuses to turn. I see him leave and then return quickly. He exits his vehicle smashing out a glass pane in the patio door before he enters.

I try to plead with him as he walks up the staircase towards his office. I feel so confused and helpless as I enter behind him. Immediately he violently overturns his office furniture, scattering paperwork to the floor as he flips his heavy desk. I want to scream as he stares at himself in the mirror, his breath heavy from the aggressive dismantling of the room. He smiles at his reflection before relentlessly striking himself, not ceasing until his features are a bloody pulp. Only then does he turn towards me, blood pouring like a faucet from his smashed nose. He finally seems to acknowledge my presence through his maniacal gaze. I squint through tears in a final futile attempt to grab him, but he leaps backwards through the third story office window, falling just out of my grasp.

 John was murdered. I knew this, the police confirmed it. A burglary gone wrong. The nightmares fully revived my memory of finding him in a pool of blood on our back patio. I can see his horribly disfigured face again, a memory I loathed regaining. No person could do that to themselves, especially him. I cannot grasp why my unconscious mind has re-invented the scenario this way. Every night is torture. I cannot recall ever having the same dream twice in all my life. I have lived this nightmare every night this week, in more detail each time.

I wondered if my pregnant hormonal mind could be the root of this? Perhaps it was the forgotten memory of finding him manifesting itself in my dreams. My first doctor's appointment since the move was set for the following day. I would ask the doctor then. 

I stayed up reading until dawn that night, fearful of what would come to me in my sleep. With the sunrise came the usual visit from Abraham. That sweet man seemed to have some new chores to attend to each day. I don't know what I would do without him. He was so helpful in guiding me on how to manage such a property, his conversations served as a welcomed distraction from my nightly terrors.

  I greeted him each morning with a hot cup of tea, a small token of gratitude for his hard work. Today as we sat watching the sunrise I inquired if he could build a fence along the perimeter of the cliff. I didn’t tell him it was for the safety of my unborn child, I hadn’t even told anyone I was pregnant yet. “Of course” he replied “long overdue if you ask me, this is where Mr. and Mrs Volk fell after all”. His words caused me to nearly choke on my tea. “I thought it was a car accident”? I asked. Abe looked away for a moment before replying “no ma’am I remember it like it was yesterday”. I had so many questions.

Why had John lied? How do two people just “fall off” a cliff? I didn't bother to further interrogate the poor man. He left shortly after anyways. I think he could tell the comment had upset me. 

My sleep deprived mind raced as I journeyed down the mountainside toward Dwell. Such a scenic drive spoiled by thoughts of John’s blood ridden face. I gathered myself as I parked at the square, exiting and walking past a group of young children playing in the park. They spun in a circle, hands held as they gleefully sang a classic childhood rhyme: “ring around the rosie a pocket full of posies, ashes ashes we all fall down”. They instantly fell to their backs upon the song's conclusion before hopping back up and laughing in unison.

I almost began to laugh at the sight myself. What a picturesque childhood these kids had. A life I didn't know could exist outside a hallmark movie. I turned my attention from them and caught myself moments before I walked into the tallest man I had ever seen. He was dressed head to toe in black, a well worn bible in his right hand. It was the first time I had laid eyes on the town's pastor. The spitting definition of tall, dark and handsome. The small red robed congregation that followed him had stopped just behind him, his smile mirrored in each of their faces.

I began to apologize for nearly running into him but he was quick to dismiss me. “It’s wonderful to finally meet you miss Volk” he followed up. “My name is David” he reached out to shake my hand. “We are thrilled you chose to move into the family home”. I mustered as much cheer as I could, complimenting him on the beautiful town in which they lived. He began to introduce the congregation one at a time. My sleep deprived mind forgetting each name as quickly as I heard them. The last woman to approach was beautiful, young and clearly blind. Her cane nearly bounced off my feet as she approached.

“And last but not least is Miss Mya” David said as I reached for her hand. She leaned in as I grasped her hand in mine, whispering quietly into my ear. The phrase shook me to my core: “It’s a boy”. She briefly touched my stomach before walking off. I remained frozen in place, tongue tied as the group bid me farewell and headed down the brick sidewalk that bordered the park. 

“Yes Miss Volk, it’s quite common for pregnant women to report more vivid dreams during term, nightmares even” his answer to my question snapped me back to reality. I hadn’t been able to shake Mya’s comment throughout the check in process or the beginning of the visit. The doctor continued “It’s not completely understood but is thought to have something to do with hormonal fluctuations, as well as disruptions to your sleep cycle”. His words managed to bring me some relief despite the weirdness of the day's previous encounters. 

I felt conflicted as I drove home. Too many strange occurrences had happened in such a short time. I questioned if the cheery demeanor of the townsfolk was just a front, it had felt as though they had rolled out a red carpet for me since my arrival. Was it genuine, or did they want me lulled into a false sense of security, and why? What did they have to gain? I was so tired I honestly didn't know how to feel, perhaps it was all in my head. I certainly was far from a healthy state of mind. At least the Doctors visit was positive. I had a healthy baby and that was most important.

Things fortunately began to look up over the following months. I was still plagued by nightmares though my recollection of them was much less vivid than in previous weeks. Upon waking I can only seem to recall the feeling of falling and not much more. I have definitely taken on the physical appearance of a pregnant woman, much to the delight of the townsfolk. A “gift from god” I am told over and over. The nursery buildout is complete thanks to Abraham. He has taken on more work in general as I grow larger and less able bodied. There is an old saying that goes something along the lines of “it takes a village to raise a child”. I very much feel that I will have that type of support from everyone in town when the day comes.

In a town like Dwell everyone truly knows one another. You see the same faces every day, everyone on a first name basis. It feels comforting, like I know no strangers here. Oddly enough I have yet to see Mya again since that first meeting. I have so many questions for her, particularly since my last ultrasound confirmed that I am in fact carrying John Jr.

 The days seem to pass by slowly as of late. I have never had this level of free time in my entire adult life. No work, a great caretaker for the house. If there were not so many books at my disposal I would have likely lost my mind by now. I must have finished nearly a hundred since moving in. I tried to pull books from different rooms considering nearly every one of them had an enormous bookshelf. I rarely spent time in Abigail's old room though. It was exactly as she had left it, it felt eerie to be among her most personal belongings. Today however, I decided I would venture in for my book selection.

I carefully perused her bookcase, scanning for something that would peak my interest. It was in the top row that I saw it. A black leather book with a blank spine. I pulled it down and gazed at its empty cover, the first page revealing it was no novel, but rather a diary. Was it wrong to read it? Such personal information it must contain. I debated if I should put it back, briefly. Some secrets are better left unknown, but my curiosity quickly prevailed. I had hardly known Abigail in life, this was my chance to learn more about my late sister in law. I had to take it.

I carried the book to the kitchen, cracking it open to the first entry dated to nearly 4 years ago. She wrote in such a beautiful and cryptic manner. Most of the entries were mundane, consisting of normal day to day life. I recognized most of the names as townsfolk I too saw on a regular basis. As I flipped through the pages a name quickly jumped out. The illusive Mya.

“The sagacious read from my palm, seeing where I find darkness. She confirmed what I have always felt to be true. He was to be born of a Volk. His coming was at hand and in his veins, my own blood”. I didn’t know where to even begin. The previous entries had featured heavily her desire to become pregnant. As beautiful as she had been, I had never known her to date. I honestly assumed she was asexual. Was the baby to become a prominent member of Dwell? A spiritual leader perhaps. I was hooked.

 I moved from the kitchen to my favorite recliner in the study. It was apparent I would read this from cover to cover and I wanted to settle in. I flipped through the pages, eagerly scanning her neat handwriting looking for clues as to what this mysterious encounter with Mya could mean. It wasn't long before I saw another recognizable name.

“With this morning came the arrival of brother Jonathan, and with it the harvest, a time when all heads must bow” . I quickly double checked the entry date, recognizing it as coinciding with one of John’s “business trips”. He had missed my bosses wedding for this trip, I was certain of the date. Yet another post mortem lie of his coming to light. I would have been fine with him visiting his sister, why had he lied? I read on as tears welled in my eyes.

“Davids eyes never shine as bright as in the presence of John, he even stood by his side during sacrament. I know when that glorious day comes that we will stand by his side as well. Blessed it shall be when the earth finally becomes his throne”. The town's church had already started to feel like a cult to me since moving here. This all but confirmed that. If John had felt he had to hide his pilgrimages home from me then there had to be more going on here. The fact he was even participating in church activities was concerning. He always claimed to be agnostic like me.

As the entries continued the tone grew much darker. Her attempts to become pregnant were always futile, much to her dismay. The final entry was a morbid glimpse into her psyche in the final days. “It is all too clear that I am not to be his shepherd into this realm. My window to conceive has closed, an inevitable reality of nature. Those who can wait to take the leap on the day are more patient than I. Far preferable it shall be to simply not exist in the meantime. I will smile upon him when that day arrives, but for now I must go”. 

I slammed the diary shut, blinking my eyes as I readjusted to my surroundings. I had been so enthralled in my reading I had completely lost track of time. It was dark now. Although I had forgotten to eat dinner, the conclusion of the diary had left me so disturbed I had little appetite. I could picture her taking the “leap” as she called it. Plunging to her death off the very cliff where I drank my morning tea. I was fearful for my unborn child then. The town had seemed to have taken too keen an interest in my pregnancy. I knew I must protect him from whatever they wanted. He would never spend a day of his life in Dwell if I had anything to say about it. 

I packed my bags hastily, mostly with clothing, everything else I felt could stay. I wept as I placed them by the front door. I had already uprooted my entire life once and now I was to do it again. This place was too good to be true. As difficult as it was, I had to go. I would leave at dawn and return to the city.

Surprisingly I found sleep quickly that night. Surely having something to do with being utterly exhausted both physically and mentally. It was fortunate considering I wanted to leave early, I was afraid Abraham would try to convince me to stay. I wrote him a short letter thanking him for his help, and to let him know my intentions of leaving. I would work out the details another day, for now I just needed out. I slept soundly until dawn.

 When the morning came I was jarred from my sleep by a noise so full and violent it shook me to my core. It was as though a thousand brass horns bellowed an endless note in unison. I sat upright but a sharp pain sent me back onto my pillow. It was an immense pressure, cramping like I had never felt. I cried out in agony kicking my soaking wet sheets off as I writhed about. I was in labor, nearly 8 weeks early.

I willed myself upright, my damp feet touching the cold hardwood floor. This couldn’t be real, how could I be so unlucky. The journey down the stairs felt like an eternity. I stopped at multiple points clutching the banister for dear life. The contractions were growing in intensity at an alarming rate. I just needed to get to my phone to call Abe, there was no way I could drive myself in this state. 

I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs using the wall to keep myself upright. I had a clear view out the kitchen window and into the backyard. I could make out a familiar and welcomed figure then. It was Abraham staring out over the cliffside. I groaned as I slid the kitchen window open, the sound of the horns nearly knocked me off my feet. I made a futile effort to get his attention, but there was no way I could cut through this otherworldly sound that seemed to echo from the heavens. 

Out the side door I went, clutching my car keys tightly as I made my way. I screamed for Abraham when I could, but I was breathless, doubling over in pain with each step. Finally I got his attention when I was nearly close enough to touch him. “Abe please, the baby we have to”... My voice trailed off as he turned towards me, tears streamed down his face towards an absolutely crazed smile.

“And with his arrival trumpets will sound upon all of Zion. Let all of the inhabitants of the land tremble”! His voice boomed. “Abraham, what in the fuck are you talking about”? I replied. “We have to go”! I insisted through gritted teeth. He made no response. Instead he turned away from me slowly and outstretched his arms to his sides. I gasped as he leapt from the cliff’s edge, willfully plummeting to his death below.

I stood in shock, mouth agape. My ears began to ring as I stared across the valley towards Dwell. I squinted my eyes at the many dots perched along the cliffside bordering the opposite side of town. It was the townsfolk of Dwell, I watched in horror as they took turns leaping to the ground below. They fell arms outstretched just as Abraham did. There was no effort to brace before impact. An eager acceptance of fate. I turned to shield myself from the sight, mustering every ounce of strength I had to make a break for my car.

It must have taken me 10 minutes to travel the short distance from the cliff to the driveway. The pain felt too excruciating to drive, but I had no choice in the matter. I set towards my car at as fast of a pace as I could manage, stopping multiple times to catch my breath. It was during a short break that I looked up to the sound of tires rolling down the gravel lane. It was the unwelcomed sight of David and Mya barreling directly toward me. I groaned as I set towards my car once again, my shaking hands fumbling with the lock as they skidded to a halt.

I nearly closed the door on David's outstretched hand, locking it as he yanked on the handle. I gazed up at him through tear filled eyes, barely able to make out the wicked smile painted on his face. “And where do you think you are going miss Volk”? He questioned in a playful manner. “There isn’t another town for miles, I don’t think you’ll make it”. I started my car as he continued on “The doctor is ready for you, please let us drive you”.

 I glared up at him through the window “Instead how about you go fuck yourself”! I shouted as I slammed the car into gear and flew down the bumpy lane. A quick glance at my rearview mirror confirmed they were on my trail. Both vehicles sped down the treacherous mountain road. The pain made staying in my lane a nearly impossible task. I drifted around the tight switchbacks, skidding along the gravel that bordered the roads edge. Somehow I rounded the final corner leading into town, the road there presenting a new kind of obstacle.

The mangled bodies of the town's inhabitants littered the road leading into the square. There were dozens of them, men women and most unfortunately children. I weaved around one mangled corpse after another, grazing the occasional shattered limb as I went. No matter how fast I drove I could not shake them. They remained mere inches from my bumper all the way through town.

 I flew through a sharp turn next to the hardware store, the car's front tires making abrupt contact with one of Dwell's larger male inhabitants. The force of the hit sent shockwaves through my body, as a piece of splintered bone punctured the drivers side front tire. It flattened in seconds.

 My contractions had only grown longer and more painful as we went. My hands clasped the steering wheel in a death grip as I tried my best to perform my breathing techniques. I knew I would never make it to another town before the baby came, it felt like it could be any moment now. Still I refused to yield, compelled onward by a primal desire to save my unborn son. I was in agony.

I tried to push as we began to climb the only road leaving town. It all became too much then. Between the flat tire and the insufferable pain shooting throughout my body I lost control. The car spun wildly, creeping closer to the cliffside with each rotation. I lost the road at a high rate of speed, the car careening off a sheer cliff face. Time slowed down in that free fall, my life flashing before my eyes as we travelled down. I could only think of how I failed my unborn son as I watched the treetops below approaching through the windshield. The impact was as violent as it was brief, the blackness that followed was absolute.

When I opened my eyes the world was still. The blaring of the horns had ceased, the calming sound of David's voice echoed from the church stairs. I was back in the town square. I sat upright, admiring my now flat stomach under my red robe. I felt no fear or confusion in the moment, my pain replaced with an intense euphoria the likes of which I had never felt. It was pure ecstacy. The townsfolk stood at attention towards the church's steps, everyone donning the same red robes as I. There was not so much as a single drop of blood to be found on any of them. As if the events of the morning had been no more than a dream.

I walked through their neat and tidy rows, meeting each of their smiling faces with one of my own. They all looked so beautiful, so at peace. I started to laugh uncontrollably as I walked, entirely unable to contain my bliss. I turned my attention towards the steps and then to David who stood at the top. To his left stood Abigail, her long blonde hair gracefully blowing in the breeze. To his right was my John, he beamed down at me as I approached. My eyes welled at the sight, he looked even more handsome than in my memories. 

In David's hands was the most beautiful child I had ever laid eyes on. I took in every inch of his perfect little body as I ascended the stairs. I gleefully gazed upon his dark pointed hooves, scanning upwards towards the curled horns that formed atop his head. He was perfect. Tears flowed from my face as I smiled down at him. I took him into my arms gently rocking him back and forth. “Hello John”.
