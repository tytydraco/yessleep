Right off, we're not here to discuss my job. Not today, anyways. For obvious reasons, I can't go into much depth on it. I suppose I'll just give information as it becomes relevant, this is already going to get me into trouble with my superiors. Still, I feel that I can't sit on this much longer and we aren't strangers to letting people outside the organisation in on some choice details. I'd prefer to tell you this way instead of you figuring it out when one of our ops goes wrong. Because it's starting to get to that point.

Suffice it to say, we're not your CIA or MI6 brand of intelligence. We're more of an international initiative without loyalty to any single nation or group, rather working to identify and eliminate threats to humanity as a whole. Human threats and, as I became increasingly aware, threats of... other natures. If the execution of our duty makes us skip over some red tape, so be it. Let's call us the Office (haha, Steve Carrel, parkour!, get it out of your systems and be glad I'm not using MIB for the placeholder.)

Just to get a few more things out of the way - these stories span a long period. I, much like anyone else, started as a grunt. Through the years, I've risen up the ranks, been given access to more information.  Currently, I lead a small team, let's call them Alpha Squad, and we're specialised in deploying for long periods of time without any support from or contact with command, though we're called upon for many things from quick strikes to long-term intel ops.

You can call me M.

I can cover how I got into this field at another time if you like. For now, I'll start with a single story.

Back when I finished my induction training, I was attached to a very average squad - we weren't agents or anything. Other people did the spy stuff, we were the ones they called in if they expected things to go south and needed some guns on hand. My first deployment, we were called in to help raid a small base as the endpoint of an investigation that had been ongoing for a long time before I'd ever even heard of the Office. My squad was inserted some distance from the base, planning to approach on foot from the south while other teams closed in from other directions. Our squad in particular had to walk through a heavily wooded area to get to our position for the raid.

So. 5 am, dead of winter, we're trudging through this ocean of dead trees. Everywhere I look, all I see is pale bark and jagged, bare branches, looming out of the fog. God, the fog. It was heavy enough that we were walking closer together than standard spread so that we didn't accidentally lose sight of each other. I was drawing up on the far right, so on one side I could see my squad mate, picking through the detritus of dead leaves and twigs, steps muffled. I could make him and the next guy over out fairly clearly, we were all wearing basic gear - black clothes and plate carriers, helmets that covered our entire heads, assigned gun and sidearm, both silenced, and anything else our specific role required carried in our packs - standard fare, none of the fancy stuff for us grunts. On the other side... nothing. Just the occasional silhouette of one of those trees, stretching up, lost in the fog. As we walked, we did radio checks every few minutes. The squad lead would send a burst of static over comms and we'd respond in kind, the most basic of check-in systems but at least it was silent and reliable. We were keeping our Friend-or-Foe (FoF) tags off for now so that we weren't transmitting unnecessary signals. Let me tell you, I was pretty nervous. I thought all of that would have been drilled out of me during training, but hey. It was my first actual op and I didn't want to mess up. I was lost in these thoughts when it struck me - there hadn't been a check-in in a while. I look to my left.

Nothing.

Shit.

I remember thinking how much shit my squad would give me for getting lost while walking in a straight line when I sent two bursts of static over comms, basically just sending "?". I wait for a moment. No response. I repeat the signal. Nothing again. At this point, I decided to risk speaking over comms because every second I didn't know exactly where my squad was, the longer it would take me to link up with them. "Guys, I've lost visual contact with you, could someone light up an FoF?" I ask.

Silence.

I don't know how I rationalised it to myself back then but I think I had convinced myself that the forest and fog were somehow messing with comms even though the systems were rated for... well, anything, especially since there was no way in hell my squad was more than a hundred meters from me. It was just one of those things where I made a couple of stupid, baseless assumptions that made enough sense in the moment that I didn't bother considering them critically. 

Grumbling away, I started backtracking, hoping to pick up a trail that I would be able to follow to my team. It wasn't long before I found a path of disturbed undergrowth that had run parallel to mine until it diverged slightly - I couldn't tell which one of us had changed direction. I began following it, jogging to gain ground. Surely my squad would have noticed my absence by now and would have stopped up ahead, waiting for me to report in or catch up. I kept sending bursts of static over the radio, just in case someone picked it up.

It was then that I saw the trees moving.

I stopped dead, staring. Those silhouettes, the ones lost in the fog, at the edge of visibility. They were shifting with glacial slowness, just... sliding across the ground. I was sure that it must have been the movement of the fog distorting my vision or my imagination or something but... well, I'm sure I don't have to explain why this was a bit bloody unnerving. I take off sprinting, following the trail of flattened leaves and broken twigs. I'm holding my gun so tight that my hands are starting to go numb though I don't know what I hoped to do with it. I just wanted to get back to my squad and back on mission. Those were things I knew, things I could deal with. I can swear that I hear the sounds of pursuit, footsteps just out of sync with mine. Looking back, I don't see anything but the sound is definitely there. I could imagine nothing worse than being lost in the forest, hunted, alone. So I was pretty relieved when I see the back of the person clad in heavy black clothing emerging from the fog in front of me, weapon held loose at their side. 

"Shit, man, sorry. Radio was acting up." I say, checking over my shoulder and slowing down as I came up to them. No response. "Hey." I call, raising my voice slightly and I slow down to a walk, catching my breath. I'm up behind the person now and, even as I place a hand on their shoulder, I notice some things. What I had taken to be our bulky combat gear was actually layers upon layers of tattered black robes. That wasn't a black helmet, that was dark, purified skin stretched tight around the person's skull. And what I had taken through the fog to be their gun held casually, hanging down at their side, was actually elongated, spindly, claw-like fingers. 

I'm frozen as the being turns but, before I can get a look at its face, it starts screaming. The shrillest, loudest sound I've ever heard. Just pure pain, anguish, anger, ringing through those woods, digging into my skull like someone driving knives into my ears. I fall back to the ground, clutching my head, screaming as well. Through the tears in my eyes, I can see this thing begin walking towards me.

The trees are closing in. 

Wait... no...

Creatures like the one looming over me were stalking through the fog. Even as I watch, one of them goes down on all fours, crawling low to the ground as it slowly makes its way towards me, surrounding me, cutting off any hopes of escape. Images begin flashing through my eyes, thoughts and feeling. A white room and fear. A tall man and anger. Bright lights and... pain. So, so much pain.

And still, that horrific sound. I clench my eyes closed as it grows even louder.

I don't recall too much. I fumbled with my gun, brought it around to try to fire blindly towards the thing as I pushed myself away, but pain paralyzed me. And then my arms are being pinned down. I struggled but I remember thinking that that was it. That I was dead and that I'd never even know what the hell had even happened, that I would die with nothing but questions. But I suppose God, fate, luck, whatever you want to call it, had another plan for me.

"... rookie! Watch ... gun! M, calm the ... down!"

My ears are ringing but I make out words. I open my eyes and blink away the tears, looking up into the visor of my squad mate, holding me down. He shakes my shoulders. "What the hell happened?" the soldier growls. I look around. The rest of the squad surrounds us, guns up. But they aren't forming a defensive circle. They're aiming at me. I turn back to the man over me, the squad leader. "You... you didn't see that?" I ask.

"All I saw, rookie, was you groaning and crawling on the ground and then trying to punch my head off when I tried to get you up."

My mind scrambles. This isn't the ideal time for a breakdown. Was the pressure of the mission too much? No, that couldn't be it. I'd trained so hard. I was conditioned through and through, countless hours running sims and training ops just for me to have a nervous breakdown on the first-

My eyes fall to my wrist, where my sleeve has rolled up. Where the creature had grabbed my arms to hold me down. Where four long, spindly bruises were forming.

So it had been real. I'd thought I'd left all that shit behind. I've always seen and experienced... more... than other people. This isn't the time to explain either. I shrugged my sleeve down.

"Was running to catch up when we separated. Hit my shin against a rock. Hard. I'm green, sir."

"Like hell you are, rook, and you're a shit liar as well. Get your ass back to drop off and call in an evac, [rifleman], go with-"

"No!" I cut him off. I didn't want to be off the mission. I didn't want to leave my squad high and dry like that or fail in such a spectacular fashion before we'd even reached the base. But, more than anything, I didn't want to go back through the forest.

"No. Sir. I'm green."

He looked down at me, trying to get a reading on me through my visor. I may be new but we're all trained to the highest standard. We're all competent and know our limits. We've run enough drills together to trust each other without question. I was hoping against hope that that would be enough to convince him.

The pause stretched on.

"Then you're green, rook. Get yourself sorted and get back in line. Center this time, M." 

I nod.


I'm not sure I can tell you much about the raid itself, not before I get all of this cleared with the spooks up top. Suffice it to say, whatever was going on in those labs was a horror story in and of itself. If I'd told anyone in my squad that the surrounding woods were haunted after what we saw in there... well, they'd have probably told me "no shit". Again, story for another day.

But I didn't. I sat on it quietly, convincing myself that I didn't have to worry about it.

A week later, I was transferred to another squad, one nobody had ever heard of. Turns out they'd reviewed my helmet footage. Don't know what they saw but, apparently, it earned me a little promotion. 


Heh. some promotion.

A file appeared on my bunkside one morning, explaining a lot to me. That the Office was aware of non-human threats and creatures. That certain people were much more attuned to anomalies of a paranormal or... different... nature. That they had specialised squads in place that would handle such entities on top of their regular assignments. And that I, lucky bastard that I am, was apparently going to have to deal with these things much more regularly going forward. 

Whether I liked it or not.

Anyways, I'm going to push send and take this to my higher-ups. I like to think that I've done enough over the years that they won't make me disappear outright. And, hey, all things go well, I'll be back again soon with official approval and will be able to tell you much more.

Because this?

Oh, this was just the tip of a whole messed-up iceberg.
