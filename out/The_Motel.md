“NO!!!” who doesn’t fill in a pot hole that big?

My tire began thumping and it became clear, blowout. I pulled into the first available parking lot which was a seedy looking motel. 

Dim lighting, no cars, a few people who might be tweaking walking around the area. It was 2 a.m. and I was exhausted. 

I got out to look at the damage and knew there wasn’t any hope. I considered calling a tow truck but knew that would be several hundred dollars I didn’t want to spend to get dropped off at a tire shop. Then I’d have to wait until opening hours. I decided I could put a doughnut on and make it to a shop first thing in the morning. My phone said there was one fifteen minutes away. 

I considered waiting there til morning, but this town…I could get shot, robbed, who the hell knows what else. It would be best if I stayed in one of these rooms, even if it’s gonna be nasty. At least it’s a concrete block where I have some fortitude. 

It was one of those motels take is shaped like three fourths of a square and only one level tall.

I stepped out of the car and heard some popping noise off in the distance, I couldn’t tell if it was gunshots or fireworks. I heard some dogs barking and sirens. I looked down at the concrete below my car to see weeds poking through the cracks.

I grabbed the tire iron and doughnut after tossing the lift out. One of the lug nuts looked warped but I managed to get it straightened out. 

I pulled out my phone to see if there was a nicer motel somewhere near by and it wasn’t looking promising. 

I walked by the nasty, green pool and walked towards the lobby. 

It had horrible lighting, smelled of cigarette smoke, and had sticky floors. I tapped on the window where a big woman had fell asleep slouched over.

She spring up. She coughed up some mucus and muttered 

“Can I help ya?”

“I need a room please.”

She hacked up more lung butter.

“Fifty dollars.”

I swiped my card and she handed me the old key. 

I turned the sticky lock and walked in the room to see an outdated bed that gathered dust. The room smelled stale and had a box tv sitting there. I locked the door as quickly as I could. 

I began searching over the room to make sure I didn’t see any roaches or bed bugs. I didn’t even want to think of the horror that could be in the shower.

It couldn’t have been minutes when I heard a banging on my door and a woman screaming for help. 

I creeped over to the peep hole and looked through. It was a woman with mascara running down her eyes. She was wearing a leopard print shirt with too much cleavage showing, a denim skirt with fishnets. 

“Please let me in, he’s gonna kill me!”

“I can call for help!” I yelled at the door.

“You don’t understand, let me in.” Tears began streaming down her face. 

I opened the door and she dashed in. The air smelled like cigarettes and sweat. She put the chain on the latch and scooted down to the floor sobbing. 

“Do…do you need me to call the cops for help? Did some guy hurt you?”

“No, cops can’t take care of this one.” I was worried of some gang member or pimp coming up here and shooting through the door.  I looked out the window and didn’t see anyone besides the few that were there when I pulled in. 

I turn to ask her what happened and then I heard another knock. She crawled to the side of the bed and hid, “don’t let him in.”

I looked through the peep hole and seen a man  dressed in slacks and a blue dress shirt that had dark stains with sleeves rolled up. He wore a nice watch and his hair was slicked back.

“Pardon me, I was wondering if you would let my friend back out.” 

“Don’t let him in.” She repeated. 

“She uh, doesn’t want to come out she says .” 

Looking through the peep hole, I noticed he smiled and had a slight chuckle.

“Okay, well go ahead and shoo her out. That or you could let me in.” 

“Hey buddy, the lady doesn’t want to come with you, why don’t you-“

BANG

He pounded his fist on the door. It looked as if his eyes turned yellow.

“Listen buddy, I haven’t had enough. That fat bitch at the reception desk won’t wake up to let me in, those street rats in the parking lot won’t do. Seeing as this room is your domain until you check out, you can either let me in or kick her out, or I can make sure you and everyone you love pays for this.” 

What are you talking about? I’m gonna call the cops.” 

“Thank you! They would make a nice snack.” He let out another chuckle. 

“Snack?”

“Now, don’t be so naive. You know what I am. I need her blood and I will be a good gentleman and let you pass. Don’t let this prostitute be your demise.”

“Why can’t you just go somewhere else?”

“I’m starting to lose my patience.” 

Of one the parking lot dwellers approached him and tugged at his arm. 

“Hey buddy, you got any money?”

He shoved the man so hard that it was like a kid throwing a Barbie doll. The man shoved into my car and it busted a window.

“Away with you, your blood would kill me.” The man laid there unconscious. 

“We can play the waiting game, just know I already got your tag Info and have my sources.” A chill went down my spine as he whispered my address into the door. 

He grabbed a plastic chair and sat in front of the door.

“I’ll give you a little bit longer, just know that you won’t be the only one that I’ll enjoy when I decide to. It might not be tomorrow, or the next day. It could even be years. But one day, maybe when you even have a family, you’ll be the last of them I drink from.” 

I turned my head to the lady in my room.

“You have got to get out of here!”

“No! Are you crazy? I deserve life the same way you do.”

She’s right, I apologized and asked her what happened.

“Me and my friend Tia were roaming the streets trying to do our job when he came from around the corner and got her. He dug his teeth In her neck and..I’ll never forget the sounds.” She dry heaved and then sat on the bed. Dust flew from it. 

I looked back through the peephole and he was looking at his watch.

“Don’t suppose you have garlic, holy water, or a wooden stake do you?” 

“No” she reached in her purse and pulled out a buck knife. “Never know when a client would try to hurt or skimp me, We could order some garlic?”

“Do you have any idea what time it is? Besides,  that driver deserves life too. Look, we can’t wait. He’s gonna come back for us.” 

I began scouting the room and thankfully seen a wooden cross decoration in the bathroom. I took her knife and began carving the bottom as sharp as I could and hoped it would be sturdy enough. 

“I’m gonna have to let him in.”

“You’re crazy!”

“It’s the only way. What’s your name?”

“Patty.”

“Patty, you got to trust me. Go stand in the bathroom and lock the door.”

He began banging on the door. “NOW! NOW! Last chance!”

I opened the door and his eyes were yellow, he was panting and shaking from his anger and hunger. I could see fangs coming out.

“LET ME IN”

“If I let you in, you promise me that I’m free to go. That you wont come after me?”

She screamed from the bathroom.

“Yes, I won’t come for you. I want her blood.”

“Then I give you permission to enter this room. She locked herself in the bathroom.”

“Come out little pig.” He chuckled.

He stepped past the threshold and walked to the bathroom. As soon as he pulled back the door with all his might I turned him around and plunged the stake into his chest.  

He turned to me and let out an ear shattering scream. He tried pulling it out while Patty ran up with her knife and began stabbing him in the back. Blood began pouring out of him.

He dropped to his knees and she grabbed his arms and pulled them back. “This is for my friend you killed.” 

I kicked the stake in his chest and he fell face first onto the old carpet. We pulled his body outside and waited for the sun to come out. He caught fire and then became ash. 

Three months go by and suprise, not surprise, the motel didn’t charge me any kind of fees for the damage in the room. 

Patty took my number when we left and she sent me a text message. She’s living with her sister in a city not too far from my home. She’s now a waitress and making her life better. We actually planned out a date next week. I keep joking with myself saying I’m gonna bring her flowers with garlic mixed in. 

Since that night, I know to always carry the essentials with me. You never know when another one may be near by at night.
