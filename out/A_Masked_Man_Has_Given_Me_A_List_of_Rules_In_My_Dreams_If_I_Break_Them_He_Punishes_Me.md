When I first saw the Masked Man it was 10:37 PM on Tuesday, April 18, 2007. I remember because my parents had allowed me to stay up an extra hour to watch my favorite TV show: Bear Time with Mr. Teddy. A few minutes after falling asleep, it became clear that this was not the dreamland I was accustomed to. There were no toys, or friends or hugs from Mom. Instead, there was Him. 

He always appeared from darkness, gliding on a wave of black, formless and faceless as dream itself. The Masked Man neither smiled nor threatened — never shouted nor heralded his own presence. 

I never saw the back of the Masked Man, but what I did see of him revealed nothing about what sort of person he might be behind that mask. It was a long, thin facade, not unlike images I would later see of Plague Doctors in medieval Europe. But his was wider and lacked the queer birdlike appearance of those erstwhile medicine men. That is not to say that the mask was not queer. It shone black, and when I stared deeply into its rippling surface, I saw what looked like whole worlds disappearing into its unnatural depths. 

All at once, without any perceptible movement on the part of Him, a tube appeared at his hand. In the inexplicable way that dreams reveal themselves to us, I knew that the tube should be feared. My skin erupted in cold sweat and I tried to scream but just as the blackness of his mask stole whatever light surrounded the man’s face, it quieted all sound. I had been enveloped in the inky blackness and felt its frigid touch across my small, five-year-old body. 

But nothing could have prepared me for the hell that came next. With no warning, the Masked Man flung his tube towards me and watched as it attached itself to my mouth. I attempted to pry it away, but the thing merely became stuck to my hands as well. And so, helplessly, I watched with widening eyes as the tube slowly curled into my mouth, down my throat, and into my lungs. I could do nothing but plead with silent, watering eyes, locked onto the Masked Man, as he stood, silent and inscrutable, and as the tube filled my lungs with the same inky blackness until I felt that I would burst. All the while a loud, hoarse screeching noise erupted around the void, rising ever higher in volume and urgency.

For minutes and minutes on end I gasped, or attempted to gasp, as the cold, gluelike shadows crushed me from within. At the same time, my entire body began to weaken more and more until the sensation was nearly as frightening as the all-consuming asphyxiation. 

After watching this brutal torture, for how long I could not have guessed, the Masked Man held up a scroll. It was empty, and I was confused by the gesture. As I watched, the Masked Man dragged a scorched claw across the top of his scroll to reveal, in glowing, black letters, a single phrase — a command.

“Do not watch Bear Time with Mr. Teddy.”

I woke, heaving, and covered in cold sweat. Naturally, I screamed for my parents who rushed into the room and held me. They were quick to remind me that dreams can’t hurt you, that they loved me, that the Masked Man wasn’t real.

As a child you believe the things you’re told, because you’re a child, your parents are all-knowing Gods, and because you know nothing. So I believed that the Masked Man didn’t exist. But even at five years old I couldn’t help but think that whether he existed or not was almost beside the point. The pain that he had inflicted was very real, and I would do anything not to feel it again. 

I thought about the scroll that the Masked Man had held, with its simple imperative: “Do not watch Bear Time with Mr. Teddy.” Bear Time was my favorite show, and I definitely didn’t want to give it up because of some silly dream. But the memory of the black tar, the drowning and the pain made me hesitate.

All of the next day I thought about the Masked Man. Even bringing him to mind made me start to shiver with aftershocks of the pain. My little five year old body vibrated like it was hooked up to a live wire. Mrs. Grayson, my Kindergarten teacher, asked me what was wrong and I told her that I’d had a nightmare. She smiled at me, put a comforting hand on my shoulder, and said not to worry. She taught me a song that would make any monsters leave me alone:

Bad men go away

Come again another day

Little Jamie wants to play

Come again another day

In my young mind I’d just been given a shield against the Masked Man.

So that night I turned on Bear Time without a care in the world. Looking back on it, I don’t remember much about the show itself. I just remember how comforting it felt to watch it, like being wrapped in a warm hug. It brings to mind that famous Maya Angelou quote: “people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

After the show was over it was time for me to go to sleep. My parents surrounded me with my favorite toys, turned out the lights, and soon I was snoring peacefully under the covers. 

Almost immediately, the Masked Man returned. He glided into the frame of my mind’s eye, trailing his cold, inky blackness. We locked eyes, and I pulled myself up to my full four feet of height, and began singing Mrs. Grayson’s song:

Bad men go away

Come again another day

Little Jamie wants to play

Come again another day

But the Masked Man had no reaction whatsoever to my voice. Instead, he glided closer and closer until my words began to disappear into the shining blackness of his mask. He stood there with his head pointed vaguely in my direction, spreading dark tendrils across my body until suddenly his arm shot out towards me and that same, all-consuming hoarse screech came from everywhere and nowhere.

The tubes of black curled through my mouth and nose and down, down, down into my lungs. That unbearable pressure began to build and the suffocation started to squeeze, and my eyes started to bulge, and through it all an irresistible panic rose from my chest until it was all I could feel. Along with the panic came that same overwhelming weakness which drained every drop of strength from my petrified muscles. 

Soon, I was incapable of motion without Herculean effort. Pointing at the Masked Man became unthinkable — as unthinkable as running an Olympic marathon. But, with tremendous pain and determination, I was able to move the muscles in my eyes until my pupils pointed in his direction, silently pleading with him to end my suffering. Or, if not that, at least my life.

Instead, he stared back with that cold, inscrutable visage and held up his scroll, tapping on the first line which, still, read “Do not watch Bear Time with Mr. Teddy.”

Eventually, I woke from this hell and screamed for my parents once again. They held me, rocked me and whispered soothing words into my ears. But I was beyond inconsolable. There could no longer be any doubt. The Masked Man was real. Even through cold sweat and tears my traumatized five year old mind was beginning to come to terms with my new reality. I lived at the pleasure of the Masked Man.

From then on I refused to watch Bear Time. My parents tried to put it on the next night to get me to sleep but I screamed and hid my face under the blankets, shaking uncontrollably and shouting to the Masked Man that I wouldn’t watch; that I hadn’t watched it; that I was being a good boy.

They turned it off and exchanged glances which looked almost as terrified as I felt.

As a child, the idea that your parents could be as afraid as you does not enter your mind. They aren’t people, like you. They’re the ones who are supposed to *know*. But nobody really understood the Masked Man.

For a while I managed to avoid him. I’d even begun to convince myself that he was just a nightmare. But then, one night, he came again, gliding on his wave of black. As the terror and the pain surrounded me, a new sensation spread across my mind: indignation.

I’d followed the rule, hadn’t I? It had been weeks since I’d watched Bear Time. Not even a glimpse of it on the screen. Of course, I was unable to plead my case to the Masked Man, and could only stand there suffering silent agony.

This time, however, when he held up the scroll, his dark claw dragged across the second line and revealed another command: “Do not take an even number of steps on any given day.”

*Eyes opened. Bedroom dark. Screaming. Parents rushing in.*

Still, even after I had suffered through the pain several times, it was overwhelming. It isn’t true what they say: that time heals all wounds. Some of them just fester and poison your blood.

From then on, I counted each step that I took.

*1, good… 2, bad… 3, good…*

Kids at school began to look at me funny. Then they stopped wanting to play with me. I hardly noticed, so consumed was I with my counting. It was life, the counting. A single missed step and the Masked Man would return.

Not everyone avoided me. There was one boy named Alan who was also “special.” Our parents thought it would be good for us to spend some time together, so they shipped me off to his house one weekend for a sleepover. It hadn’t occurred to them to wonder whether we had anything in common besides our mutual isolation.

As it turned out, we didn’t. Alan was sitting in a corner stacking legos when I came in.

I asked Alan if he wanted to build something with me, but he just kept stacking, and didn’t even seem to realize that I was there. When I tapped him on the shoulder, he shoved me, hard, onto the ground. I yelled at him and shoved him back.

His parents came in to separate us, and I was afraid that they’d be upset with me, but this was apparently not the first time that Alan had had an issue with shoving. They told him, very sternly, not to do it again, and left the room.

Alan reluctantly agreed to let me add blocks to his tower, but only if I put them where *he* wanted them to go. As I busied myself finding the very particular pieces that he described to me (i.e. “get the yellow one with two dots sideways and three dots up and down”) a terrifying thought occurred to me.

Did Alan’s shove count as a step? I hadn’t taken it myself, but I *had* moved. Before that, the count was 2,137. Was I at 2,138 now? Should I take another?

Alan interrupted my thoughts by yelling at me for putting the yellow block on the wrong side of the tower. I moved it quietly and went back to trying to work it out. It wasn’t as if I could *ask* the Masked Man for clarification. He only showed up in my dreams, and then only to torture me. 

That night, after Alan’s parents had put us to bed, I lay wide awake, staring at the ceiling. Maybe if I didn’t fall asleep the Masked Man couldn’t hurt me. The count would reset tomorrow, after all. But then wouldn’t he just punish me when I *did* fall asleep?

I figured that it was worth a try, and that at the very least I could spare myself the pain for this one night. So, I kept myself awake all through the night, which to a six year old (my birthday had just recently come and gone) felt like years.

In the morning, I started the count again, but couldn’t help but be distracted by this legalistic minefield I had entered. All I could think about, every time my mind wandered, was the last time the Masked Man had come, how much it had hurt, and how desperate I was to avoid it happening again. 

So I stayed awake that night too. And the night after that. And the night after that.

But there’s only so long that you can keep your eyes open before your brain will *make* you sleep. Later, as an adult, I read extensively about the science of sleep to determine if there was any way to remove the need for it altogether. 

As it happened, there was an odd case of an American man who was born without any need for sleep. He sat in his rocking chair and read a newspaper every night and got up refreshed in the morning. Another man, a soldier from Hungary, claimed to have lost the need for sleep after a gunshot to the head. Yet another man, a farmer from Thailand, claimed to have not needed sleep ever since a childhood fever. None of these cases was ever explained or conclusively verified.

I, however, was not like these people. Sleep was an absolute necessity, and it claimed me whether I liked it or not. This time, however, the Masked Man did not come. Apparently, the shove from Alan had not counted. Of course, I had no way to know this as I was drifting off and the last sensation that went through my mind before darkness claimed me was one of absolute terror.

I woke shaking, but quickly realized that I’d managed to avoid the Masked Man. A feeling of all-consuming relief flooded my body and I sobbed, not in fear, but out of the sheer happiness of avoiding torture. Then, I began to think about how sad it was that this fact brought me so much joy. This was a thought that would inhabit me throughout my life: the quiet, brutal dissonance between my life and the norm. 

Why was it that I, a seemingly good kid with no sins I could think of, was condemned to this existence of endless calculation, just to avoid pain, when others ran and played outside in the sun without a care in the world?

I glanced out the window at the rising sun and saw a boy and a girl not much older than me playing with a ball in the street. I thought about how if that were me, I would be counting each step and covering my eyes to avoid any nearby television screens. I thought about how unfair it all was, and began crying all over again, but this time for real. 

I turned my face to the ceiling, up to the sky, up to God, and whispered a tiny, childlike prayer, asking for an end to the pain. But there was only silence in return. Years later, I would read the work of French philosopher Albert Camus, and come across his discussion of the absurdity of a world that places conscious beings into a position where they are faced with the “unreasonable silence of the world.” It occurred to me then, and occurs to me now, that this rather understates the matter. The world may be silent, but that silence rarely feels “unreasonable”. It felt, to that small, terrified six year old boy, like an accusation of a terrible crime.

And after many years I began to believe that this was the case. The more I was hurt the more I began to feel like I deserved the hurt, and hated myself for it. 

*What an awful person I must be.* I thought to myself. *Why else would I be in pain all the time?* 

But this was before I learned the most terrible secret of existence — justice is only the most cruel of the lies we tell ourselves to sleep peacefully at night, the free prize we were promised at the bottom of the cereal box of life only to find cheap cardboard and the saccharine-sweet face of some corporate mascot.

At least I’d avoided the pain for one more day. Or so I’d thought. The next night, when I went to sleep, I saw the Masked Man, and immediately tried to wake myself up. This was another tactic I explored through the years, but to no avail. I once paid a surgeon from the former Soviet Union to watch me while I slept and wake me at the first sign of a nightmare. He told me when I woke that he had tried everything he could think of. Drugs, deep brain stimulation, you name it. But nothing could interrupt the horrific penance demanded by the Masked Man.

That night, however, I was just confused. I had been certain to count my steps and avoid television screens, and knew that I had followed the rules. Nevertheless, the same inky blackness curled into my lungs and had me gasping against its frigid tendrils. The same unbearable weakness drained my body of the last of its strength.

As it happened, I assumed that this was a delayed reaction to my misstep with Alan. The Masked Man must have come just a day too late. But, instead, he dragged his claw across the third line on the scroll to reveal another command: “Always wear green on Thursdays.”

And so, from then on, I always wore green on Thursdays. It was clear then that the Masked Man intended to continue adding rules to his list. Even if I followed each one to the letter, there was always another ready to reveal itself and draw his wrath.

As the months wore on, the Masked Man added more and more rules, each time taking his pound of flesh in my dreams. The number of rules was becoming difficult to manage, so I kept a list of them in a piece of paper in my breast pocket, by my heart. Later, I would keep it in my phone so I could check it whenever I needed.

Even Alan stopped hanging out with me after that. The other kids ignored me for the most part, but some thought it was funny to mess up my count, or to steal one item or another of clothing that the Masked Man had ordered me to wear.

Eventually, it became impossible for my parents to ignore my bizarre behavior and they insisted that I talk to a shrink. At first, I thought that maybe he would be able to help. But after a month or two of breathing exercises and meditation, I realized that he was just as ill-prepared to deal with the Masked Man as my parents had been.

I saw him once a week, mostly to appease them, but knew that he wouldn’t stop the Masked Man from coming. 

Over the years, I withdrew more and more from the world. I made a friend here or there, but they would always quietly slip away when it became clear that I couldn’t leave the house for more than a few minutes at a time. By then I had become completely consumed by doing the Masked Man’s bidding. 

I was always doing my counting; I was terrified to see a television screen or a red door handle; I was forbidden from constructing a sentence which contained two words with five syllables each; and so on, and so on. But even with that constant vigilance, I was not good enough to stop his appearances entirely. He still came some nights, and each time the pain was worse than the last.

Once in a while I found a girl willing to put up with these eccentricities. But they never stayed for long. I dropped out of college after attending classes became too great of a risk. (My campus was in a wooded area and I was forbidden from seeing more than two oak trees a day). Little by little I stopped leaving the house altogether. I managed to find a remote job entering numbers into a table. I clicked here and there, moving the squiggles into the correct columns until they turned green. 

When I’d saved up enough money, I rented a cabin in the middle of nowhere, far from any possible reasons to trigger an appearance by the Masked Man.

And this is where I’ve been for the last few years. My skin is bleached white from lack of exposure to the sun. My hands are so pale that if I hold them up to the window they almost blend in with the clouds. 

Last night I peered at myself in the mirror and saw a gaunt un-person staring back. Inside, I’m still that small, terrified child who first saw the Masked Man, but the man in the mirror looks far older than his 28 years. He is bent, wizened and weak. His hair is prematurely thinning and his hands shake with the very effort of life.

He is tired of this existence. Even with this self-imposed imprisonment, the Masked Man still comes, still exacts his terrible price. And so he has decided that today is the last day. I watch as he reaches into the medicine cabinet to retrieve a revolver. He opens it, checks to make sure that the bullets are loaded, blows some dust off of the barrel, and closes it again.

He places it against his forehead and smiles a little, skeletal smile. 

Finally. Finally he will be free of the Masked Man. He has waited his entire life to say those words. He’s always known that this was a way out, but he hasn’t had the courage to do it until today. 

He presses his finger to the trigger, intending to pull it, when all of a sudden he’s gripped by an all-consuming terror. His eyes roll back into his head and he falls to the floor. 

As his body shakes uncontrollably, his mind is in a very familiar void, all made of black. Formless and faceless, a Masked Man glides on a wave of darkness until he stands before the skeletal figure. The Masked Man raises him up and points to his scroll as the tendrils begin to wind their way into the figure’s mouth.

As the figure’s eyes widen, and he begins to gag with the familiar black agony, the Masked Man drags his claw across the scroll to reveal one final command. The last one on the list. The last one he will ever need:

“Do not die.”
