I have always had vivid dreams.  Rarely are they nightmares, just the kind of dream that sticks with you for most of the day.  A few of my recent ones have left me chuckling to myself.  Being part of a penguin family but I was just my usual self, shuffling through the snow trying to protect my penguin wife’s egg.  Getting into a bar fight with a group of Hell’s Angels because I kept turning down their advances. Walking along a giant dinosaur’s teeth as its mouth slowly closed around me.  All dreams I still remember to this day.

I’ve been told to start keeping a dream journal but I haven’t found a need to.  I must have some form of photographic memory, but only for useless memories that never happened.  I don’t mind it.  Sometimes existing in those memories can be a brief escape from reality.

That’s what I thought for a long time at least.  I had a dream the other night that I can’t seem to shake.

I was walking in the woods near my apartment.  A beautiful state park, along a Great Lake. I knew it well.  There are no roads through the park, just the parking lot at the south-end, a few miles from the highway. You’d leave your car there and start hiking North.  There were a few trails, one running perpendicular to the lake on the East side.  This is the trail I was on during my dream.  It was dark out and gently snowing, large heavy snowflakes.  Most of the trees barren of leaves, save for the few pinetrees that cast shadows across the path.  I could glance to my right and see the slow, rolling waves, lazily dying into the frost covered pebble beach.  It felt peaceful.  Everything was so familiar.  I walked for what felt like the entire night, following this path I knew so well, never growing tired, never questioning why I was here in the dead of night. An owl cooed somewhere to my left.  Small corn snakes slithered off the path in front of me as to not be stepped on, I thought I saw a kangaroo bounding somewhere along the beach.  I wish I could stay he--  Wait.  That doesn’t seem right.

I abruptly stopped my calm stride and with it the forest stopped too.  No more distant owl, no more evergreens scratching their naked neighbors with their needles moved by the wind.  In fact there was no more wind.  It was as if the entire world stopped with me.  I didn’t dare move, as to not interrupt this sudden stillness.  Standing still for minutes on end, I waited for something to make a noise.  Anything. “Please, something move.  I can’t take this anymore.”  I thought to myself. In hindsight, I should have just pinched myself and been done with this strange dream.  But it felt wrong to interject.



What felt like hours had passed when I caught a shadow in my peripheral.  Something down by the water.  “Thank God.”  I could finally move.  Using my new-found freedom I ducked under a fallen tree to try and get an eye on whatever had cast it..  Peering over the dead wood I saw the silhouette of the kangaroo on the beach.  It had felt so out of place before, but if it was, no one had told it. It walked on all 4s in a large circle, maybe 12 feet in diameter.  When it had completed its circle, it slowly hopped to the center and began to rise up, standing on its hind legs and raising its head.  It stared at the night sky and slowly opened its mouth releasing a bellowing howl.  I covered my ears, though it did almost nothing to block the noise.  Small birds fell from the trees, bouncing off the dead branches of the birch trees and softly hitting the ground with blood seeping from their heads.  The night sky darkened, one by one stars blinking out.  The howl continued, unwavering, as if a call to the heavens themselves.  When it finally stopped I lay on the frozen ground, hoping my hearing would return.  After a few minutes of silence and the ringing beginning to fade, I dared to look over the dead tree once more.  As my eyes peered over once more, I had to stifle a scream.  The kangaroo stood only a few feet from me, for the first time as not just a silhouette.  I could see its hairless face, with lidless black eyes.  Poorly scabbed legs, with thick wriggling earth-worms crawling from the unhealed wounds.  



The last thing I remember was the sweet smell that almost sizzled off its skin.  A smell of honey and mulberry.  A smell I will not soon forget.
