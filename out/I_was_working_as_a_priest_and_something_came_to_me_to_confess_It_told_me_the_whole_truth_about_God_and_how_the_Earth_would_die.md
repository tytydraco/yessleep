I have served in the church for thirty years. In confessions, I’ve heard it all: the shameful murmurings of lust, the grief-soaked whispers of infidelity, and even admissions of bloodshed. I believed there was nothing left in this world to surprise me.

That was until last week.

It was an ordinary rainy Monday, during a storm that battered the stained-glass windows, when he arrived. A clean-shaven man in his middle years, with short chestnut hair, a coat, and utterly forgettable blue eyes. Just one of many. But I had never been so wrong. He looked ordinary, but there was something off. His eyes never met mine; they stared somewhere past my shoulder, and his hands trembled—not with fear, but something stranger.

“Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,” he began without preamble, his voice dry and rasping like sandpaper. Confessions always begin the same way, so I nodded and urged him to continue.

I should have turned him away then. But something… something unseen pressed on my chest, holding me in place, as though the act of listening itself had been preordained.

“As we speak, soldiers are dragging infants from their cradles on other continents. Myanmar, Ethiopia, Syria, and deep in Siberia. I am responsible for what happens there. Rivers drown in oil. Villages burn, their people inside them. That is my burden.” A lump caught in my throat as I scanned him again. He spoke calmly, still gazing into the distance. “Do you think you’re the Devil?” I asked, clutching the crucifix. "No, Father. I merely whisper the orders. No one knows my name, and no one ever will. He hides me. Like many others the world must never know.” His voice was devoid of hate or sorrow or pride—it was the tone of someone admitting to breaking a vase. Absolute calm. I asked him to elaborate on the orders he claimed to give, and without hesitation, he continued. "A child in Congo will call for his mother. But she will not answer. I had to command that her mouth be filled with soil. A girl who lost her whole family in war—I whispered her to jump from the roof.” You might call him a psychopath. But the way he said it, the cold, quiet certainty, planted seeds of doubt in my mind.

I asked the question I’d been dreading.

“Who were you talking about? Who hides you from human eyes?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he smiled—not with amusement, but with an ancient sorrow. He stood and left just as thunder cracked overhead.

I stepped outside a few minutes later, trying to follow him, but he was gone. That night, I told myself I would not return. But the next day, as the rain began again, I found myself walking back to the church. Not out of duty—but drawn. Something intangible guided my steps, not fear, not faith, but inevitability.

Tuesday, he returned within ten minutes. This time, he did not kneel. He silently walked in and sat on a pew, staring at the Bible in my hands.

“A beautiful lie…” he whispered, before continuing. “Abraham sacrificed Isaac—not once. Three times, Father. Because he liked it. He would have done it more had he not been told to stop. The blood David bathed in as he sang his psalms… Oh, Job—poor Job begged for death even before his trials began. God would not let him die quickly.”

I stood, fingers trembling as I clutched the Bible, the other hand fidgeting with my robe.

“What right do you have to blaspheme like this?”

His reply still echoes in the silence.

“Because I was there.”

Then came more: of Cain’s final thoughts, of the number of feathers on Gabriel’s real wings, of the first words the serpent spoke to Eve—words erased from Scripture. I tried not to listen. I told him to stop, claimed he was mad, and asked him never to return.

“Everyone deserves to confess, Father.”

He left me there, my stomach twisted with nausea from the things he’d said in just fifteen minutes. Those few I dared to ask about the man described him as completely ordinary. I never told them what he said. What would be the point? They wouldn’t believe me—no one would.

Wednesday, he arrived while I was deep in prayer. He stood silently behind me, listening, then sat across from me.

“When I watch people cling to God, I feel sorrow. Truly. You speak to Him, hoping He hears. But… if He does hear you, He might speak back. It is rare, but a boy in Naples recently heard the voice of God. And now he wants to drown himself, just to silence it.”

Fear, then anger gripped me. I seized his sleeve and hissed, “Why are you telling me this?”

He replied in his usual, flat tone.

“I must confess before I die. And you, Father, should consider doing the same. Death is near.”

I opened my mouth to object, but he continued:

“That which killed the Horsemen of the Apocalypse—God’s hound, created to protect and destroy—a six-legged monster— each like a cathedral pillar, jointed and jagged, tapering to points that pierce the earth like spears of judgment. Its body is covered in coarse, blackened fur, swaying though no wind dares touch it. And its face… Only a void. When it moves, cities crumble beneath it without sound. When it breathes, the air withers. It towers above the skyline, blotting out the dusk with its shape alone. It will soon wake, for God has chosen to begin again. We were only an experiment.”

A gag rose in my throat. I turned to the icon of the Virgin Mary, trying to drown his voice with prayer, but his voice was louder.

“God is not evil. His thoughts are beyond comprehension. But I have seen what lies beyond the apocalypse. A perfect world. At least until God decides to reshape it once more.”

Breathless, dizzy, I nearly collapsed. Soaked in sweat, I called him the worst blasphemer I had ever met.

Then he looked into my eyes—and for the first time, I saw something flicker there. A faint trace of sorrow.

“You will see it all, Father. In dreams. Just a glimpse. If I showed you everything the Pope saw, you’d beg for death, just as he did.”

He left, and that night, the dreams began. So vivid, they were indistinguishable from reality.

The same dream, again and again: I stand on an empty plain, save for a colossal silhouette in the distance. Six pillar-like legs. It's body is covered in coarse, It devours the sky, and gaping, weeping nothing void, where light is swallowed and screams don't have a echo. I wake screaming, drenched in sweat, surrounded by silence.

Thursday, he came later than usual. The final ray of sunlight spilled across the church floor, forming a halo, just as he confessed his greatest sin.

“I created Hell. When I first opened my eyes, God cast me into the void—nothing but echo and emptiness. And there, I received my first, my most sacred task.”

“You created Hell?”

“Not exactly. I made it what it is now. I filled it with fire, with screams, with chains forged from unspoken apologies. The sins shouted every second by the damned—hoping to escape, but there is no escape.”

That was when I broke. I told myself I had gone mad. That this man, his words, the dreams—they were figments of my mind. Hallucinations born from age, stress, or something darker. I screamed at him that none of it was real. That he was a devil sent to shatter my faith.

He sat motionless.

I turned away for a heartbeat, perhaps toward the crucifix, perhaps toward the wind stirring the curtains—and when I looked back…

Oh, Holy Virgin Mary…

He had no face. Where eyes, nose, and mouth should be, there was only smooth, pale flesh. As if someone had forgotten to finish him. Or he was already dead. I staggered back, fell to the ground, clutching the Bible to my chest. I watched as he stood and walked away, vanishing into a fog that hadn’t been there before. I must have lost consciousness. When I came to, it was the dead of night. I didn’t sleep again.

On Friday, I opened the Bible. On the first page, someone had written:

“There is no salvation, Father. I’m glad I confessed—I won’t have to see what’s coming. The year 2027: every twenty-seventh heartbeat of every human being skips slightly, because something horrific and looming listens in those moments. You, like me, like the universe itself, will be erased. Replaced by a new mankind, a new Heaven, a new Hell. Only God and His hound will remain.”

That was the last time I stepped inside the church. I did not leave from fear alone—but from the feeling that I had fulfilled my role. I had been summoned there, lured not by faith but by the strange magnetism of divine obligation, to bear witness to the man’s confession before the end.

Now I sit and type this, not knowing why. My dreams are the same every night: only me and the six-legged beast, herald of the apocalypse.

I don’t know what will happen and I don't know what did now. I don’t know who the faceless man was.

But I know this:
When the world is quiet,
I hear the ocean.
The waves rising.
And something climbing out.
