 It's a good thing we have some battery packs with us. Otherwise, my phone would be dead by now. I've been making sure to keep it charged and off unless necessary. We don't want to repeat what happened to Drake at the gym. If I ever end up getting torn apart by zombies to a song I want it to be something more fitting like heavy metal.





Anyway, Jeff and his group were an okay bunch and let us spend the night. We knew we should’ve kept moving, but free weed is free weed. Besides, we were safer in a group than braving it by ourselves. We were enlightened about The Unplagued. It had a long and rich history, dating back to about a week ago. 





Jeff and the others saw shit going down and decided, “Fuck it. Let’s live in the woods”. 







I don’t quite see the appeal. Then again, it’s not my place to judge, for the most part. Drake and me were sitting with Jeff, playing a round of Go Fish.





“Any fours?” I asked.



“Go fish,” Jeff replied.





I drew a card. While it wasn’t what I wanted, it did match another card in my hand. I put down a pair of sixes.





“By the way, “we meant to ask you this other night. Did any of you happen to see a guy named Van pass through here?” Drake inquired and gave a brief description of Van’s appearance. 





Jeff’s confused expression broke into another wide smile.





“Oh, you must mean the chosen one.”



“The what now?” I asked.



“The ceremony will begin at moonrise. You will find out everything then.”





In hindsight, we should’ve taken that as our cue to skedaddle. Instead, we stuck around. Drake ended up winning our game and afterward, Jeff ordered everyone to gather. He then got up onto a tree stump.





“Everyone, Drake and Gus here have been wonderful company among us. Have they not?”





At that, there were cheers of agreement.





“But they are still unaware of all of our customs. What do you say we demonstrate them so that we may have a lucrative harvest? Let the ceremony begin.”





The cheering grew louder, worrying us that it would attract some zombies. We remained safe, though so things proceeded.  Everybody started chanting and dancing like the people on Spooky Island from the first live-action Scooby-Doo movie. As this happened, we observed a large square object getting wheeled out covered in a bedsheet. 





Everyone stopped and pointed at the sheet that was then yanked off, revealing a wooden cage with someone naked inside, curled up in the fetal position.  Upon realizing who it was, our eyes squinted in disbelief. 





“Van?” we said in unison.





Feebly, he lifted his head, recognizing us. To put it bluntly, he looked like shit. Dirt, bruises, and cuts covered him. A piece of cloth was gagging his mouth. He muffled something and we assumed he was trying to say, “Help me”.





“Okay, that’s it,” Drake spoke up. “Does anybody want to tell us what the hell’s going on?”



“Friends, there is no need for this confusion,” Jeff told us. “The answer is simple. Van here is the chosen one and his noble sacrifice will yield us healthy crops.”



“Wait, did you say sacrifice?” I asked, a bit concerned.



“Why yes. It is a great honor and your friend here was worthy enough to be chosen.”





While we were far from friends with Van, especially at this point, the idea of him getting murdered didn’t sit well with us. At most, we wanted our money back and maybe to rough him up.





“Take him to the pit,” Jeff commanded.





The crowd parted, revealing a massive tarp surrounded by torches with abandoned construction equipment near it. The tarp was pulled back, revealing a hole filled with snarling zombies. The sacrifice part of things was making more sense now.





“Hey, quick question,” I told Jeff.





He raised a hand, prompting the others to become quiet.





“Yes?” he replied.



“Let’s say hypothetically we weren't exactly comfortable with all this and wanted to get Van out of here. What would happen?”





We thought Jeff would be offended by what I said. To our surprise, however, he was ecstatic.





“Why, nothing would make us happier.”



“Okay, well, in that case-”



“Solidarity is a truly noble gesture.”



“Wait, what?”



“Triple the offerings means triple the harvest.”





The next thing we knew we were surrounded and grabbed.





“What are you doing? Let us go,” Drake demanded.





Jeff ignored him.





“To tell you the truth, we were going to throw you in the pit tomorrow night anyway.”





We froze.





“You were going to kill us?” I said in disbelief. “How do you all even know this whole sacrifice thing works?”



“It’s quite simple really.”





Jeff explained that when The Unplagued was founded, there was little food.  One night, a member tried sneaking off with all they had, and in their attempt to flee didn’t notice the pit and fell in. Zombies were already in it that devoured them alive,





“Would you believe that right after seeing this, we were blessed by finding bags of beef jerky and cans of  beer?”



“Not be rude, but how do you know that wasn’t a coincidence?” I asked, trying unsuccessfully to appeal to what little remained of the crowd’s reason.



“Because we sacrificed someone to the pit the night after before going into town the next morning. Not only did my followers and I  find supplies,  we remained safe while doing so. Therefore, it is now our custom.”





If there’s anything this past week has taught me, it’s that things can go to shit fast.  Van was taken out of the cage and lifted into the air. We could only watch in horror as he was crowd-surfed to the pit and tossed in. The zombies were all over him like ants to sugar water. As he was getting his insides eaten, the gag was ripped out of his mouth, making his shrieks echo throughout the woods.





It was only as we were getting pushed toward the pit that I found the ability to speak again.





“Can’t we talk about this? It’s not exactly a fair deal for us,” I shouted. 



“Of course, it is. After this, you will be in paradise.”



“What proof do you have of that?”



“Our faith. Drake, Gus, your noble offers will not be forgotten.”



“How about you forget us being offerings in the first place?” Drake frantically asked.



“What’s done can not be undone.”





All of our careful planning just to be killed by some cultist nutjobs. At least, that’s what would’ve happened if not for another streak of incredible luck on our part. Storm clouds had been gathering during this ordeal. Following a clap of thunder, rain began pouring down, causing the dirt to become mud. People slipped on it, falling into the hole. 





They piled into it, giving the zombies a means of climbing their way out. What followed was two minutes of mayhem.  The Unplagued was no longer a fitting name. We were being held by two people each at the time. When the person on my left arm and the other on Drake’s right were tackled away, we seized the opportunity and freed ourselves.   





Drake punched the guy holding him in the throat and shoved him to the ground. I stomped the foot of the person holding my arm and then kicked him in the crotch.  He doubled over, groaning in pain. Then he was dog-piled by the zombies. 





“Gus, look,” Drake said, pointing.





Our stuff was resting by a tree. We rushed over, grabbing our guns. Zombies tried attacking and Drake smashed onto across the face with the butt of his rifle while I shot another with my handgun. Fighting wasn’t easy given the limited visibility except during lightning flashes which meant we were going mainly off sound. Anything we heard coming towards us was getting the pump action treatment.





“Didn’t we pack some flashlights with us?” I asked, then yelled “Oh shit” as a flash revealed another zombie lunging at me.





I put a bullet through its head as Drake was rummaging through his bag.





“Got it,” he exclaimed in triumph and turned it on. “Catch.”





I caught it when he tossed it to me and kept the light on him as he got his weapon ready.





“On your left,” I told him as he was cocking his rifle.





With one turn and pull of the trigger, half of a zombie's face disappeared in a cloud of red mist. To think, a mere few days ago such a sight would’ve made us blow chunks. I guess we’ve become more resilient since then. I don’t know if that’s necessarily a good thing or there might be even more psychological shit we’ll have to deal with later down the road. Either way, it’s helped us survive this long.





Maybe I just shouldn’t think about it too much. 





“God damn it, they got us all disoriented,” I said. “Which way should we head?”





After a brief discussion, we decided to go east while the cult members were getting devoured.  Along the ground, I noticed someone had dropped the calumet and picked it up.





“Hang on,  do you see that?” I asked, shining the flashlight on a nearby bush.





Checking it showed us Van’s stuff. We took the money from his wallet and left the rest of his things behind. We kept running until the cries of people and zombies alike were out of earshot.





“I think we’re safe for now,” Drake said as our lungs were getting some rest. “We need to find someplace to hunker down for the night.”



“Not exactly many options when it’s poring.“Guess all we can do is keep moving.”





We hoped the rain would let up soon. It didn’t and continued all night. We were miserable being soaked from head to toe and having our pants covered in mud. I would have given my right nut for a warm place to dry off and change.





“Rain’s stopped finally,” Drake commented as the clouds parted, revealing the first rays of sunlight. “Hey, Gus?”



“Yeah?”



“Did we grab any energy shots at the store?”



“I think so.”



“Oh, thank Christ.”





We each downed an 8-Hour Energy, temporarily alleviating our fatigue. However, our feet were still screaming at us. Therefore, we decided to sit on some nearby logs for a bit.



“How far do you think we have until we’re out?” I asked.



“Gus, I don’t know. We’ve been traveling for over two days now. We have to be close at this point.”



“I hope so. Hey, do you think maybe we should do something when and if we make it out of here?”



“Like?”



“Well, even before all this, we were spinning our wheels in the mud. I think we deserve to treat ourselves.”



“I get what you mean, man. Tell you what. After all this, let’s get some of that good shit for the peace pipe.”



“Hell yeah.”





We had breakfast, a bag of mixed nuts each with some water. Then we got moving again. 





“Hold up,” Drake said. “Is that smoke?”





By this point, another two hours of us waking had gone by. I took out the binoculars from my pack and handed them over.





“Holy shit, it is,” he said ecstatically while looking through them.



“But where's it coming from?”





He gave them back to me. Raising them to my eyes showed me a cabin in the distance.





“Someone's living all the way out here?” I asked.



“Looks like it. They probably want to be off-grid. Let's see if they'd be willing to help us.”





When we reached it, we were met with a medium-sized one-floor log cabin. 





“Hello, is anyone there?” Drake asked, knocking on the door. “Sorry to bother you, but my friend and I are in bad shape.”





No answer came. I gestured to the knob. Drake shrugged and tried it, finding, to our surprise, it to be unlocked. He turned it, pushing the door open to a home shrouded in darkness.





“That doesn't make any sense,” I said. “We just saw smoke coming from here.”



“Maybe whoever made it left.”



“Should we wait for them to come back then?”





At the noises of ravenous zombies in the distance,  we decided it'd be a safer bet to try explaining our unlawful entry. We went inside, shutting the door behind us. 





“Help me find the light switch,” Drake said and I heard him feeling along the wall.





There was a click and the lights came on.





“Good going, Gus.”



“That wasn't me.”





Suddenly, there was laughter coming from someone whose voice was eerily familiar. When he spoke, it chilled us to our core.





“Drake, Gus, it's been too long.”





Our heads whipped in the direction of that voice. Stepping from the shadows was the grinning face of Erickson. His fingers were wrapped around the handles of a glass tank containing a severed head he referred to as his wife.





“I take it you’ve enjoyed my virus?” he asked.



“Your virus?” Drake replied, shocked. “You’re the one responsible for the zombie outbreak.”



“That’s right. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t expecting you both to survive this long. Of course, I knew contaminating the water would take care of most of this town’s residents.”



“The water?” I said, realization splashing me in the face, no pun intended. 





I thought back to before everything went to hell in a handbasket.  Our faucet had acted up and therefore we switched to drinking bottled water.  As far as we knew, Roscoe and Van were only drinking bottled water as well. The latter made sense, seeing as how he had higher standards. As for the former, I think he mentioned once that he didn’t drink from the tap because he heard it would make him gay.





I don’t quite understand his reasoning. To each his own, I guess.





“Give us one reason we shouldn’t blow your head off right now?” Drake asked, pointing his rifle at Erickson.





The mad doctor only smiled.  My face broke out in a sweat at the noise of several weapons being trained on us from the darkness.





“You didn’t think I’d be so careless. Did you?” Erickson asked.





More people came out of the shadows. Only then did it dawn on me how oddly lit the place was.  The majority of them were a form of cop or security profession.  Then there were two that stood out. The first we recognized.





 It was former mayor Bill Schneider. With him was a woman sporting a viper smile. 





“Why is the mayor here?” I asked.



“Yeah, and why do you look like Hilary Clinton?” Drake added to the woman beside Schneider.



“Now that he mentions it, she does remind me a lot of her,” I thought.





Erickson gave a sinister laugh.





“All will be answered in due time,” he told us. “ Now, would someone be so kind as to show our guests where they’ll be staying?”





At that, we were both struck across the face with batons, making everything go dark. I can’t accurately say where I was taken. I faded in and out of consciousness as they were dragging us away. What I did glimpse, shakes me to my core to even describe. There were windowed rooms with different zombies.





I thought what we’d encountered thus far were abominations. These go against Mother Nature herself.  The worst ones I saw were a fused zombified family and one guy without any skin clawing at his window. He was moaning as he did it and I got the harrowing sensation it was due to pain. All my weapons were taken away and I was thrown into this room.





It’s similar to the ones in hospitals with a bed and a sink.  I still have my phone on me. I’m not sure why. I guess they don’t realize I have internet access.  Either that or they missed it outright.  





In any case, I’m able to upload this post. There’s a wifi signal down here. The password wasn’t difficult to crack. It was “EricksonIsAGnnuis\_1234”.  I have no clue where they took Drake. 





I can only hope he’s staying strong.  Knowing that Erickson is behind all this and whatever’s in store for us is making my nut hairs bristle.  If I don’t get a chance to update again, I want to end with this message. [No justice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) No Peace.
