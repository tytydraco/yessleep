Everyday, people in the small town of Casino, people line up for a taste of the best burgers to touch the taste buds of mans mouth. The taste is so "mmm" so "augh" just pure perfection. After waiting about an hour it's finally my time to order. "I'll have the Fredrick Burger". I asked politely to the owner Mr. Goldstein. All the burgers have names like Felix, Thomas, Alejandro etc.

He says they're based off of people he'd met along his journey going around the world. The store owner hands me my burger and i head out the store to my job at the local clothing store. My friend Casandra walks in to the store, she also works at the store as the manager. "Did you here the news?" She asked with rather wide open eyes. I'm very intrigued to what she's going to say. "Alex was just attacked on Croke lane. 

&#x200B;

A rather tall man with full black clothing and mask attacked him with a machete. He took a wack to the arm before storming off like crazy. Have you seen his arm! It was half torn off" She rambled. I was flabbergasted. I live just on the street next to it. With such a small town it will be considerably easy to solve who the assaulter was.

 But anyways, I say my condolences and then continue my shift til 6PM. I clock out and walk home, fast. I don't want to be spotted and become his next victim. I hear scattering in a bush next to me. Without looking i send myself flying as i run all the way home, i was only a street or two away. As soon as i get home i tremble as i scatter through my keys looking for the front door key. When i do i quickly unlock the house door, slam it shut and then lock it.

I am panting and sweating like crazy. I start to have a panic attack, crying and on the verge of vomiting due to the sheer fear put to me. I could've been murdered for crying out loud! Eventually i stop crying but i still have an aching sickness in my stomach so i run to the toilet. And just after waiting over the lid for a little while i spue up all chunks of food I've had.

Just the burger and a little bag of chips is all I've had recently. I flushed the toilet and grabbed a cup of water. As soon as i take the first sip i hear the door just silently and slowly creek open. As soon as i hear it i jump and screech as i drop my cup. The glass shatters. I run over to the couch and wrap my blanket over me. I am shivering like crazy and can't stop, but i keep telling myself to stop. I hear footsteps of a large, titanic sounding person. This must be Alex's assaulter, maybe even the man in the bush. I hear them coming closer to me. I let out a little whimper. 'SHIT, FUCK' I think to myself. Then the blanket is slowly pulled open, showing me the last pair of eyes I'll ever look at...  
  
  
  
The next day a new burger is added to the menu, people recognise it as the name of the person who works at the clothing store near by. The manager of the store finds it quite interesting, maybe the store owner and her are friends. Casandra heads to her employer/friends home the same day wondering where she is. She has a spare key she gave her because they're so close. Casandra walks in, and she isn't there. Weird. She walks out to the back door and looks for the backdoor key, but it isn't there...
