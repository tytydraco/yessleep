Hi, There I’m Oz 

I once knew a man that went walking everyday of the week no matter the weather. His name was leon. Leon was a man of integrity, compassion, and willpower and everyone who knew him respected him. Yet, for some reason that was all they knew about him. They know his character, habits, and the fact they respect him that's all. Why? Everyone from the young to the old knew him yet knew nothing of him. So, when I was thinking about it I asked myself how do I know leon? I don’t remember ever introducing myself to him before, and yet I know him and he knows me? I kept this thought in my head for quite some time, thinking I probably just forgot. Then an opportunity came upon me while I was walking home; Leon was walking his usual route. So, I just asked him. 

“Hey, Leon, can I talk to you for a second?” 

“Sure, Oswald, how have you been?” 

“I’ve been fine, But I’ve been thinking about something lately.  I know this may sound weird, But how do we know each other?” 

After asking him the question that had plagued my mind for the last couple of weeks I had finally asked him. He stood there perplexed as if I asked some kind of deeply moral question. Then after some time had passed he looked at me and smiled.

“Oswald… You are an interesting person aren't you?”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Nothing just stating a fact, and to answer your question we met when I came over to speak with your father when you were young.” 

“Hmmm…So, we met when I was young? I guess that makes sense. Maybe I had just forgotten.” 

“Yup, well I am going to finish my walk. You have a nice day alright Ozzy.” 

After that interaction he left to continue his walk , and I went home. For some reason even though what he said sounds reasonable it left me feeling uneasy. My memories of the interaction felt fuzzy, and cloudy like I had a daydreaming or something. It feels like my body and mind are fighting each other. My mind at one end is trying to make me forget, while my body is forcing me to remember the interaction between me and him. I just don’t understand why I am feeling this way. The remainder of the day I fought this unsettling feeling of me losing something, but I don’t know what I am losing to begin with. So, I stayed in my room on my bed listening to some music. Trying to think about what I am forgetting. Without realizing half the day is gone, and my mother is calling me down for dinner. While eating I asked my father about how he knew Leon out of curiosity. He looked at me for a moment, like I asked an obvious question everyone would know. 

“Don’t you remember, he was your little league coach.” 

“What do you mean dad I have never played baseball before?” 

“Hahah of course you have ozzy. Boy, you have a bad memory.”

After that I just stayed quiet eating my food, and I guess my parents felt that I wasn't feeling. They were looking at me with worry, and concern in their eyes. So, I told them I was going to bed after I finished eating. So, I did exactly that I went to bed after eating. I didn’t speak about Leon and how I felt about him after that. Nevertheless, I still watched him and how he interacted with people. He was never the one to start the interaction, but always the one to finish it. And, why do I feel like I’ve lost something? Something is not right. I don’t feel right. I feel like something is coming. 

“....I’m scared.”
