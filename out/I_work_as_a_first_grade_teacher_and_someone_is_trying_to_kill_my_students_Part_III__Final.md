Once back inside the classroom, I saw Jerry and Leon chasing something.

“What’s going on? Why are you running?’ I asked, while staring at the window. It had been fixed over the weekend, just as promised. The new glass was even thicker than the old one, and it remained untouched. The TV screen was dark now, ever since I had taken out the DVD and turned it off. No one had come inside the classroom since I had been standing right outside its door. So what could possibly have happened now?

And then I saw the mouse. A small, gray, scared-looking mouse, running around the classroom in a panic as the boys descended on it.

\*\*\*

There were mouse traps set around the classroom, the kids were instructed to avoid touching the mice and warned against bringing any food in, while the new custodian was instructed to clean it vigorously. But while the mouse had been a nuisance, the other happenings were something more sinister. As the day ended, I asked Sally if she could go with me to the principal’s office and tell Doug what she had told me, but she had adamantly refused.

“I don’t want to get them in trouble,” was all she would say.

“But Sally, they already *are* in trouble,” I said. “What you will do will only help them.”

But Sally shook her head.

“My dad’s waiting to pick me up,” she said.

So I went to Doug’s office alone, with the fake DVD in my hands. My only evidence.

“Come in,” Doug said as soon as he heard me outside his door. Usually he preferred scheduling appointments, but made an exception for me just like he had done the previous times. On his face was an expression I couldn’t quite decipher.

But I had no choice. All I wanted to do was to keep the remaining kids safe. So I told him about the DVD and what Sally had said. He listened silently, keeping his expression neutral.

“You know, when I was a little kid I had an imaginary friend,” he said as soon as I finished. “We had just moved because of dad’s new job and I was lonely at my new school, missing my old friends. So my mind pretended they were there with me, even when they weren’t.”

It took me a second to realize what he was insinuating.

“You think Sally was…hallucinating?”

“I wouldn’t use that word choice, but…let me put it this way. Kids have a fertile imagination. Sometimes it’s good and can protect them from trauma. But other times…it can backfire.”

“Should I let Sally’s parents know?” I asked, surprised by his reaction.

“You know, I think you’ve made enough waves already,” Doug said after a long moment. “I’ll have someone else get in touch with them…if needed,” he quickly added. “As for the DVD…it is certainly disturbing.” He reached for it, as I handed it to him. “I’ll have our technicians look at it. Anything else?”

He held my gaze with his cold gray eyes, so different from my first day of school when I had bumped into him in the hallway and he had enthusiastically congratulated me on being the newest member of their faculty. And now, a little over two months later, it had all gone to hell.

“No,” I said, shaking my head.

“Good. Then it’s my turn.”

I stared at him nervously.

“I think it’s time we stopped sticking our heads in the sand, and confronted what’s really going on.” He paused and stood up abruptly, pacing back and forth. I involuntarily shuddered. His current expression made it crystal clear that this conversation would not end well.

“And what’s that?” I asked, unable to keep myself from trembling. Feeling forced into saying…something, even though all I wanted to do was to turn around and leave his office.

“I recently talked to Henry’s and Barry’s parents—“

“Not to their lawyers?” The words rolled out before I could control them. Back when I was meeting with the parents, I had been strenuously warned to avoid any contact with them. Doug raised an eyebrow, but took it in stride.

“No, I don’t do lawyers,” he said after a pause. “They called me themselves and left a message on my answering machine.” He looked at me. “So I called them back. Do you know what they told me?”

I shook my head, though the answer was on his face.

“That they would be willing to drop their litigation…if you were no longer here.”

“Excuse me?”

“Basically, they don’t feel comfortable with you staying on as their sons’ teacher.”

“But I had nothing to do with what happened. I don’t know who planted those fake Smarties anymore than their sons know.”

“And that’s the problem right there. You’re the teacher, not them. The onus of responsibility is on *you*.” Doug paused, giving me a searching gaze. “By the way, Kelly’s parents made it clear that they are on board with this as well.”

“Now hold on a minute…surely they can’t blame me for the drone incident? I was inside the damn classroom when it happened! There’s no way I could have known something like this would happen!”

“And if what happened…had been limited to just that drone I would have wholeheartedly agreed with you,” Doug said, his cheeks getting redder by the minute. “But combined with everything else that had taken place…well, I can’t really blame them, can I?”

“I don’t understand,” I stuttered.

“Okay, let me make this more direct. The candy incident happened on your watch. The car which abducted three of your students looked remarkably like…your car. We have this on video by the way, so don’t go denying this. The—“

“But it’s not my license plate!” I stammered, growing just as red as him now.

“The car’s license plate was covered up,” Doug said, irritated. “So there’s no proof it wasn’t yours. As for the DVD—“

“This is outrageous!”

“I can believe you at your word that it had been tampered with by someone else, but there’s no proof is there?”

I just stared at him, completely lost for words, as Doug twisted around every single thing that had happened. And then, as he held my gaze, it hit me. It didn’t matter what I said or did, because the final word was with the parents. If they would drop their lawsuit against the school, he was only too happy to get me out of the way.

“And then,” Doug added, as if reading my mind, “even if these all were just…unfortunate coincidences, one does have to wonder why the victims were all from *your* class specifically? I have yet to hear about any bad things happening to anyone else, and we have quite a big school.”

He got me there. I did everything I could to keep myself from crying.

“Here’s what we’re going to do,” Doug said slowly. “You’ll be finishing out the rest of this week, but that’s all. We already have a replacement in mind, but we have to talk to them first. As soon as the change-over is complete, we’ll let the parents know.”

\*\*\*

“Have a moment?”

It was the next morning and I was just about to enter the school when I was startled by someone calling my name. The speaker, noticing my reaction, calmly put his hand on my shoulder. It took me a minute to recall where I had seen him before, but once I did, I relaxed. It was Chaney’s gorgeous brother Cannon.

“What is this about?” I asked him.

“Is it okay if I tell you when we’re inside?” He pointed to his car, but I shook my head. “What about if I buy you coffee?”

I hesitated.

“I can buy my own coffee,” I said.

“It will only be a minute. Promise.”

I gave him a look. Five minutes later we were at the Starbucks across the street.

“I just wanted to thank you for supporting Chaney,” Cannon was saying as I sipped on the espresso. “She’s always had a hard time making friends, and you’ve always tried to shield her from the others.”

“I know what it’s like,” I said. “I have my own memories from elementary school.”

“I wish all of Chaney’s teachers were like you.”

I smiled at him, with the truth on the tip of my tongue. Soon, it would be someone else in that classroom. But I didn’t want to upset him, so I didn’t say anything. He would know soon enough.

\*\*\*

I had barely started the lesson when it begin again. The weird terror of being in this classroom. A certain sense of dark foreboding which I couldn’t quite shake.

“Let’s go over your homework from yesterday,” I began. The kids had been tasked with matching letters to pictures of various objects. An assignment that most of them had ignored, except for Chaney and Sally, who, as it soon became clear, had copied Chaney’s answers.

“Who would like to go first?” I began. “Leon?”

He rolled his eyes at me.

“Jerry? Caleb?” I winced as I noticed that Caleb still had his makeshift dagger from yesterday, which had placed on his desk so the whole class could see it.

“Jack?” I tried. To my surprise, he nodded and began to respond when the floor began to give out. I stared down as my feet began sinking in it like quicksand.

“Help!” I yelled to my first graders, but they stared at me motionlessly. As I tried to keep myself from falling down, a cluster of bats descended around the classroom, making shrieking noises. One of them fluttered over my head, touching me with its wings. I tried to bat it away, but was no longer upright.

Jerry starts patting one of the bats, and it bites him.

“Don’t touch the bats!” I yell to the students. “Jerry, you need to see the nurse! Do you know where the nurse’s office is?”

He stared at me, confused. A moment later the student desks started toppling down like dominos.

“Get down!” I screamed at the students, as giant ants began to climb out of the desks, running around the floor. I screamed, as I tried to unsuccessfully stomp them out.

Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, Caleb grabbed his dagger and headed towards me.

“All of this is your fault!” he said in an oddly deep voice, sounding like he was decades older. But when I stared at him, his lips didn’t move.

“Caleb, I—“

And then he plunged his dagger in.

\*\*\*

I don’t know for how long I was out, but I came to in Doug’s office, with the school nurse at my side.

“What happened?” Doug’s face was red, lips pulled together in irritation.

I looked at my body, expecting to see blood…but there was nothing there.

“That’s it! You’re obviously not fit to teach here. We were going to wait at least until next week, but this obviously can’t wait. You’re a danger to yourself and to our first graders. As of this moment, you’re free to go.”

I stared at him.

“We’re a drug-free workplace,” Doug suddenly said as soon I stood up.

“And I am drug-free,” I said.

“Not according to Mary,” he pointed to the school nurse. “Don’t bother arguing with us. She tested you after you blacked out.”

“What?!” I froze mid-movement. I had never taken anything during my entire life. This school was driving me insane.

“So any litigation on your part would be a waste of time,” Doug said in place of a goodbye.

And then, he pushed me out the door.

\*\*\*

The new teacher that replaced me was a young blonde called Miss Sunshine. That was her actual last name. Sunshine. Through an old acquaintance at the school, I learned that things calmed down considerably after I was no longer in the picture. The previously missing half of the class all came back. There were no more odd happenings. The parents stopped with their threats. Even Chaney suddenly transformed from an outcast to the class’s most popular kid.

Meanwhile, no schools wanted me. Word had gotten out, and despite my vehement denials about being involved in anything untoward, it all fell on deaf ears. I was the crazy one. The druggie. A danger to the children. It got so bad that I suffered a nervous breakdown.

I spent months in therapy, trying to figure out what the hell happened and why I was blamed for circumstances that I had nothing to do with. At one point, I considered ending it all. I was living on the eleventh floor of an apartment building, and waking up facing the balcony each morning. Imagining how easy it would be just to end it all.

And then one evening, there was a knock on my door. I was half-asleep from the TV, wanting nothing better than to immerse myself in the senseless reality show drivel. But the insistent knocking proved hard to ignore.

When I opened the door, I gasped. Chaney was standing in the doorway, looking much happier than the last time I saw her. Her body language was now one of confidence, her eyes alive and ablaze instead of their former forlorn selves. One thing was clear: this Chaney was much different than the one I had been used to.

“Can I come in?” she asked, pulling at her designer-looking scrunchie a tad nervously, as if seeing me reminded her of who she used to be.

“Of course, but is there anyone with you? How did you find me, anyway?”

“I googled your address,” Chaney said, as I closed the door behind her. There was no one else there.

“Juice? Soda?” I asked her, biting my mouth which had been about to say ‘coffee or tea?’

“Orange juice, thanks.” She studied my digs, while I opened the fridge. There was nothing much to look at, so she quickly switched her attention to her hands instead. She was wearing nail polish, I noticed with a surprise, as I poured her Minute Maid orange juice, pairing it with a plate of Oreos.

“So, what are you doing here?” I asked as soon as she finished eating. And then, as it occurred to me: “Who dropped you off?”

“My brother,” she said, looking uncomfortable.

“How is school?” I asked her.

She perked up. I listened as she gave a glowing review of Miss Sunshine and all the fun things she did with the other girls in the class at recess. I tuned out, until she finally got around to why she had visited me.

“I just felt so bad about everything….you were always so nice to me!” she said, as I gave her a hug. “Miss Sunshine is great, but I like you more.”

“Don’t tell her that,” I said.

Chaney gave me a sad little smile.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

“Sorry about what?”

And then—with absolutely no warning—Chaney confessed to everything. She had been the one to hide most of the candy and replace it with the poisoned Smarties. She had also been the one to steal the DVD off my desk and replace it with the monstrosity on the screen.

“But why?” I asked, feeling my cheeks flush like they were on fire. If Chaney had been adult, I would have probably lost it.

There was a long pause. Just when I thought she wouldn’t respond, Chaney said:

“Cannon said the other girls would like me more.”

“Your BROTHER put you up to this?”

Chaney blushed. And then it all came together. During my last morning at the school, I had coffee with Cannon. He must have drugged it—hence my wild hallucinations before blacking out and skewed drug test result.

“But why?!” I asked, still in too much shock to properly believe it. “What did I ever do to him?”

“More like what you didn’t do!”

I almost jumped, as Cannon stepped out of the shadows. With an alarm, I suddenly realized that I had failed to properly lock my door after letting Chaney in. He had been here this whole time. And he had heard it all.

“You were never able to stop the bullying,” Cannon said slowly, with his handsome features suddenly marred by something very dark. “So it fell to me to deal with the bullies for her.” For a moment the darkness lifted, as he glanced tenderly at Chaney, before it returned the moment he turned back to me.

“The drugged candy, the drone, the abduction, the creepy DVD—that was all YOU?” I was still trying to get my head around it. It was just that up close, Cannon, still in his early twenties, looked so handsome and charming. A devoted brother. A loyal family member.

“The best way to control someone is to scare them,” he replied, without breaking eye contact. “Bring them down to earth. It’s no big deal. No one died or anything.”

“But they COULD have died!”

He shook his head.

“The candy just made them sick. The drone did not seriously injure that little girl. The abduction was just me and my pals goofing around. We let them go the very next day. As for the DVD, well, the others had to share some of the suffering too, don’t you think so? You should have seen their faces!”

And then, before I could react, Cannon pulled out his cell phone and showed me the pictures. Henry and Barry throwing up on each other. Kelly covering her eyes as the drone lay in front of her, having peed in her pants. Harriet, Sara, and Jill dressed in embarrassing outfits and bawling with terror, looking the complete opposite of their normal cool selves. Some of the remaining students with their mouths open in screams, as the TV in the background played out the sinister DVD.

“And those loud voices that suddenly came on in the middle of one the lessons?” I suddenly asked, remembering another disturbing detail about my time in the classroom. “That was you as well?”

“That was an accident. I bugged the classroom, but forgot to disable some of the microphones when I was hanging out on the roof. So as a result, I not only heard you, but you heard me as well. I took care of it as soon as I realized what happened.”

“You BUGGED the classroom? Is that how you got all those pictures?!” I gestured at his cell phone, knowing I would be unable to get the repugnant images out of my mind.

“That was the whole point. Now those little assholes won’t say a bad word to Chaney. They know if they’ll ever do, I’ll make sure the entire school sees those photos of them.”

“You’re blackmailing first graders?” My jaw dropped.

“And it’s obviously working!” He pointed to Chaney, who was clearly flourishing in her new environment. I swallowed hard. This guy was clearly insane.

“And how did drugging me play into the picture?” I asked.

“The school was looking for a scapegoat. I provided one to them—and kept them off my own back in the process.” He shrugged. “Nothing personal.”

As he closed out the photos on his cell phone, another picture—one he hadn’t showed me—suddenly caught my eye. I had only seen it for a second, but the image was cemented in my mind. Cannon in an embrace with…Miss Sunshine? I recognized her face, having looked her up online after she had become instantly popular. The way he had his arms draped around her and her skimpy outfit in the photo made their relationship clear.

“Miss Sunshine is your girlfriend?!” I barely managed to get the words out. “Was she your accomplice in this too?”

Cannon suddenly looked nervous. I had hit a nerve.

“Accomplice in what? Trying to give these bullies a taste of their own medicine?”

And then, before I knew it, we were out on the balcony, with Cannon trying to push me off the ledge, and me attempting to return the favor. Unfortunately, he was much bigger and heavier than me, which meant I was instantly losing. As I felt the weight of his body on mine, the ground got closer and closer until---in one fluid moment—Chaney leaped on top of both of us.

“Stop it!” she cried, her face suddenly morphing back into the old, insecure version of Chaney.

“Get back into the apartment!” Cannon barked at her, before giving me his strongest push of yet.

I don’t know what kept me from falling, other than a blind feeling of rage that steadied me at the very last moment. As I regained my breath, Chaney jumped on Cannon, trying to get him off me. In response, Cannon tugged her off him ever so gently, but with a little more force than was called for.

Suddenly, Chaney lost her balance, sliding over the ledge and going down with a scream. In a split second, as Cannon realized what happened, his face turned into an expression of pure agony. And then, before I could properly process what was happening, he jumped off the ledge after her, with his lithe body disappearing eleven floors below, coloring the ground with blood.
