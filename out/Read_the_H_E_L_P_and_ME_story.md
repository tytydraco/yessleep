I got no time to focus at lodge of complaint on them (my secondary schoolmates, all 17/18M who just joined my school this January)

I, 20M held student leadership position in my school for 2 years. I held Peer Support Leader and Bridge Leader CCA. My classmates and my friends, 19M to 22/23M and 18/19F to 21F fare supportive in me making friends with them and holding student leadership positions so that I can be better than my secondary schoolmates. I have been friends with my CCAmates and classmates for 2 years and I have no problem in getting along with them

When in this January, back to school, I am in school together with a few of my classmates and friends for project work that start in October last year till this February. Me and my friends saw one of my secondary schoolmates that I don't know on the first week of school as I have move on from them when I join my school 2 years ago. One of my secondary schoolmates was looking at me twice/thrice during lunch hour. I told my friend about it and they think that he's a bit suspicious

They're sort of harassing me btw, invading my privacy, time and life and stop stalking me. They are to look at the shadowside of themselves,PLEASE they need to do it! They stalking at a specific distance, describe me as their friend, next to me, ruin my future, career and my friendship/future relationship with other people. -_-

I am going to lose interest on them, shape-shifting and being a liar to everything that pisses Me, attack me, i cannot live their toxicity. I hate them so much, They are completely and...Absolutely Disgusting. i am very angry against them because they are a moron. I really don't want to them to be in the same path as me and I really don't want them to follow the same path as me. They are not allowed in my life. They have to stop framing me like being a bastard. I got very scared when their everything are the same as mine. Shame on them. Their mindset sucks, me and my friends rules!!

LISTEN. I don't have any time to actually answer all their shit out because my brain is packed of things. What angers me the most is they are repetitive. To them, Just stop being immature of themselves and get over it, revenge me and my friends’ things. Enough with their shit already. 

Update (14 Feb): My lecturer has literally talked to me today about their harassment and their attempted relationship and friendship with me. They didn’t understand the word ‘harassment’ and I don’t think they will believe it as I know their secondary school teacher would never teach it and the teacher will just teach it based on school values. They always had this mindset that all ex secondary-schoolmates must still contact or/and friend with each other to create 1 whole universe congregate/world that involves bribery or/and corruption instead of their classmates and CCAmates in which it might be part of the school values they know. 

Conclusion: me and my friends don't feel very comfortable seeing/eating with my secondary schoolmates even with one on one and me and my friends dun rlly wna hang out/seeing/eating with my secondary schoolmates at this moment. I also hope they get suspended from my school and not graduate. Me and my friends deserves the graduation than them 

srry not srry that this hurts them. So long, bear well to them. To them, My parents seriously hate them and I find them doing ugly and scary behind and suspicious, To my secondary schoolmates who just joined my school, DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?! 

Update 2: this week, a couple of my friends from my school that trust and friend me  blocked me on Instagram and I noticed something fishy that my secondary schoolmates that joined my school has messaged them to force block me on Instagram for no reasons. Even they apologize to me few weeks before I finished my project, they still continue their actions again and they have been tracking my friends and I felt they are way too much especially when I notice they are having a gathering at my ex-school mate that used to be my secondary schoolmate's house for some 'Dragon' party and I want my secondary schoolmates and their own friends to stop all the actions immediately. 

As their actions are intolerable and unacceptable, I block my secondary schoolmates who just joined my school on Instagram. Even their own friends who attend gatherings and parties with one another also get blocked too
