If you're not familiar with Australia or the city of Brisbane, I doubt that you would be aware of the tucked away little suburb of Wacol. There's not much reason to go there unless you're involved with the prisons or feel like checking out the animal shelter.  If you're into the paranormal or local Brisbane history. Then the supposedly haunted Wolston asylum might be a draw to you. Otherwise there's not much around but bushland that borders on suburbia, and a small industrial area.

My commute back from work takes me off the highway and past the prisons on Wacol station road. So I'm pretty familiar with this area. There's plenty of kangaroos around this area, so you end up nearly plowing through at least one of the things on a weekly basis. Due to this, seeing or smelling a dead roo isn't exactly an uncommon occurrence. However my experience has left me dreading the smell or sight of that familiar lump on the side of the road.

The first incident happened about a week ago. It was around 10:30pm after a night shift at work. I had only just passed the prison when up ahead I spotted something hanging off the powerlines on the side of the road. Fearing a downed line, I slowed to investigate. To my horror I saw at least 3 kangaroos draped over the lines. Most of their midsections completely missing. I didn't get a much better look as I put my foot down after realising what I was seeing.  I tried rationalising this as probably the result of a large ute or truck having flung them up there in a particularly unfortunate collision. However I wasn't able to shake the feeling that something was very wrong.

Much to my dread, I knew I had agreed to take my partner to her volunteering at the shelter in the morning. And would likely be faced with the gore once more. However when we passed the spot with the mangled roos, there was no evidence of the bloody mess that I had witnessed the previous night. This struck me as odd, as I could assume that at least some evidence would be left if the power lines were cleared during the early hours of the morning. 

No further incidents had occurred until earlier tonight, only a few hours ago. And so I've decided to write this all while it's still fresh in my head.  I had only just passed the prison. Once again I caught sight of the thing I had dreaded hanging over the power lines. This time It was a single kangaroo, suspended in midair by the power lines. Or so I thought at first. Just under the body I saw the thing that will keep me off this road for the rest of my life.  I thought it was a tree or a trick of the light at first. As I pulled in closer and flicked on my high beams. I saw an elongated human form. It was as if the midsection had extended itself up like a cherry picker. The top half of the body was pulling chunks off the roo off, and shoveling it into its mouth. I didn't get a good look at the face or the rest of it, but there was no mistaking the human hands and head. 

As soon as I comprehended what I was looking at, I floored it. As I raced past, the figure entered my rearview mirror. It suddenly collapsed back down on to itself, reverting to a regular human silhouette.  I lost sight of it seconds after. 

I don't know what the hell I saw. But it will forever keep me off that road.
