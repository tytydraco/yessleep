It started like any other night—a drink in a half-empty bar, the world muffled under a haze of old regrets and neon lights. The kind of night where everything feels just one drink away from falling apart.

Lucky’s. A dive so worn down that even the walls seemed to sigh. It had seen better days—maybe. Now, it was a mausoleum for lost causes, where the light was dim and the air was thick with the ghosts of bad decisions. I sat at the far end of the bar, facing the wall, trying to avoid the reflection in the mirror behind the bottles of liquor. I didn’t want to see what I’d become.

The place was practically deserted. A couple hunched over in the far corner booth, mumbling low and heavy like the words themselves were struggling to stay in the world. The bartender, an older guy named Jimmy who looked like he hadn’t smiled since 1985, polished the same glass for the fifteenth time in a row. He didn’t look at me, and I didn’t look at him. We both knew why I was here.

I had sold everything—my TV, the watch my father had given me when I turned eighteen, even the last of my furniture. My mattress had gone for just enough cash to keep the lights on for one more week. My apartment was a hollow box now, the echoes of a life that never turned out the way I thought it would. Everything was gone except for the voice in the back of my head, the one that whispered, “You’re just one more step away from losing everything.”

And the thing about debt is—it doesn’t care if you’re trying. Loan sharks don’t care about your redemption arc. You can quit gambling, go to rehab, get a job—whatever. You still owe them. And I owed them more than money. I owed them time, bone, and, probably, a couple of fingers if I didn’t get my shit together soon.

Jonah slid onto the stool across from me, a glass of whiskey in his hand, the pity in his eyes plain but hidden behind a half-smile. He was one of the few who hadn’t cut ties completely. Maybe he still saw the version of me from back when we were kids. Back when things seemed like they might actually get better.

“You remember senior prom?” Jonah asked, leaning in a little too close, but I could tell it wasn’t from nostalgia. It was just habit. We were both clutching onto anything we could. “You got so drunk you thought the DJ was hitting on you.”

I laughed. God, I laughed. It was a pathetic laugh, the kind that comes out too loud because it’s trying to cover up the gaping hole underneath. "He was hitting on me. He gave me his number."

Jonah’s smile didn’t fully reach his eyes. He shook his head like he could somehow clear away the years of disappointment. “Man, I miss that guy. The one who thought he could beat the system. Thought he could get away with anything.”

I nodded. My chest felt heavy, and I was just tired. Tired of pretending. “He died somewhere between a bad bet and a worse idea.”

Jonah didn’t argue. He didn’t need to. Instead, he laid a twenty on the bar before I could even reach for my empty wallet. It felt like charity. It felt like pity. But it was all I had left.

“I wish I could help, man,” he said, standing up. His voice was softer now, more like a confession than a conversation. “I really do.”

And then, just like that, he was gone. Walking out the door without another word, his back to me like he was trying to leave without looking back.



But he didn’t see him.



I didn’t see him walk in. One moment, I was alone. The next, there was a man standing beside my table—impeccably dressed in a black suit, clean as a knife, smooth as an oil slick. He didn’t have a reflection in the mirror behind the bar. I remember that now.

He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “You’re in quite a bind, aren’t you, Michael?”

My stomach dropped. I felt cold wash over me like a wave.

“How do you know my name?” I asked. My voice was hoarse. Tired.

The man’s smile widened slightly, like he was amused by the question. “Names are easy. You’ve left your name in too many places. Loan applications, overdue rent notices, police reports. You’ve whispered it to the bottom of too many glasses.”

“That doesn’t mean you—”

“I know more than your name,” he interrupted smoothly. “I know the first lie you told your mother. I know the last dream you had before giving up sleep. I know that you cried last night and didn’t remember why.”

He leaned in, his voice dropping. “I know you think you deserve to die. But you don’t want to. Not really.”

I froze, breath caught in my throat.

“I can offer you a way out,” he continued, sitting in Jonah’s empty seat. “A series of tasks. One per week. Four tasks. After that, your debt disappears. No interest. No more calls. No more threats. Just... freedom.”

“And if I say no?” I asked, forcing the words past dry lips.

“You won’t. But if you did, they’d find you soon enough. They’d make an example of you. Skin off. Teeth gone. Eyes last.” He smiled again. “I’m the merciful option.”

I looked around the bar, suddenly desperate to find someone—anyone—watching us. But it was like time had frozen. No one moved. No one blinked.

“What are you?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer. Just stood. “You’ll say yes. Whether you remember it or not.”





The morning came like a punch to the face. The kind of morning that hits you before you even realize you’ve been asleep. I woke up in my bed, or at least, what was left of it. The sun slashing through the blinds, and I felt… wrong. The air was too still, too silent. My head pounded like a drum, each beat echoing through my skull. My mouth was dry—like I hadn’t drank water in days. I reached out for the glass on my nightstand, but it wasn’t there.

Everything felt… off.

My clothes were off, but my jacket was neatly hung across the chair in the corner of the room. My shoes were lined up by the door, a perfect little arrangement I hadn’t remembered making. The front door was locked. The chain in place. And then I looked at my pillow and saw my phone resting there.

I didn’t remember coming home. I didn’t remember leaving the bar.

The night was fragmented, like a dream where the edges blur and everything slips through your fingers. The only thing I could grasp was the memory of Jonah’s face—fading, like the last image in a Polaroid. And then, the man. The one in the black suit, sitting across from me like he already knew everything about me.

But I was too tired to process any of it. Too tired to think. I grabbed my phone, hoping for some clarity, some explanation. But there was nothing.

No calls. No messages. Just one new notification.

A message from an unknown number.

I opened it. There was no text. Just a location. Coordinates. And a name: David Wyler.

I stared at the screen, my mind foggy. I didn’t know how I knew, but I knew what it meant. A sinking feeling crawled up my spine. 



This was the first task.

The beginning of something I couldn’t walk away from.

And without thinking, I slipped on my jacket, grabbed the knife from the drawer, and left.

The city buzzed outside, but I didn’t hear it. I didn’t feel it. I was just moving, my feet carrying me toward the next thing, toward something I knew would change everything.



The coordinates led me to a suburban neighborhood just outside the city. Normal houses with porches and wind chimes and trimmed hedges. A place where people waved to each other in the mornings and watched TV together at night.

David Wyler lived at the end of a cul-de-sac. His house was modest. Beige siding. White trim. Two-car garage. A garden gnome by the mailbox with a chipped nose.

I waited outside his house for nearly an hour, pacing the sidewalk with the weight of my thoughts pressing on every step. My thoughts spiraled—what if he had kids? What if he was someone’s husband, father, son? What if this was some kind of mistake? But the more I waited, the more I felt that strange sense of inevitability settle over me again. I wasn’t here by chance. I was here because something decided I would be.

He was in the backyard when I finally worked up the nerve to approach. Tending to a small row of tomato plants. Kneeling in the dirt, humming a tune I couldn’t place. He looked… kind. Middle-aged. Balding. A bit overweight. The kind of man who probably grilled burgers on Sundays and paid his taxes early.

I moved along the side of the house slowly, heart hammering, hands damp. I took the long way around, coming through the neighbor’s yard, ducking behind hedges and fences like a thief in my own skin. The knife sat in my pocket like it had always belonged there, its cold metal a constant reminder of what I was about to do.

He didn’t see me approach. I stood behind the lattice fence, heart pounding so hard it hurt. My stomach was twisting into knots.

But something pushed me. Not a voice. Not a command. Just a pressure. An instinct. A nudge that said: Go.

I stepped through the gate.

“Hey,” I said. My voice cracked.

David turned, startled but not afraid. “Oh—hello there. Can I help you?”

I nodded slowly. My fingers curled around the handle of the knife. My voice caught in my throat.

“I think… I think I’m lost.”

He smiled gently. “Well, you’re not far from the main road. I can show you.”

He stood, brushing dirt from his knees.

I moved then.

The knife flashed.

David gasped, the breath leaving his lungs in a sharp wheeze. His eyes widened in pain and confusion. He stumbled backward, clutching his side where blood bloomed fast through his shirt. He tried to speak, his mouth working around words he couldn’t form.

His knees buckled. He dropped into the dirt, landing hard among the tomato vines.

I moved in a blur, stabbing again. And again. Not out of cruelty—out of panic. Desperation. I wanted it to be over. I wanted the horror to stop. The sound of the blade sinking into him was soft. Too soft. Wet and wrong.

He looked at me as he died. His lips moved, maybe in prayer, maybe just searching for breath.

And then, he stopped.

The garden was silent. Blood soaked into the soil. My own breath was ragged. I stared at my hands, the knife, the lifeless man I had just murdered.

And then I ran.

I vomited in the alley behind a gas station ten blocks away. My body heaved, and bile burned my throat. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. My heart felt like it was trying to tear itself apart.

And yet…

As horrifying as it was—

It was less than I anticipated.

The guilt was there. Heavy. But not unbearable. It didn’t crush me the way I thought it would. It slid into the cracks of my soul and settled there, quiet and cold.

  


The next message came with less ceremony than the first. Just a name. An address in the industrial part of the city. No explanation. No instructions. But I understood what was being asked of me.

The man’s name was Gerald Keene. His place sat behind a rusted fence near a lumber yard, tucked away in a part of the city where no one looked too hard at anything. Crows circled the power lines like they knew something. It felt like a place where bad things happened often and quietly.

I watched his building from a rooftop across the street, crouched behind a weathered HVAC unit. The city below was a breathing machine—lights, steam, metal groaning through the night. I watched the entrance for hours. He came and went at regular intervals, like a man with nowhere to go but still needing to go somewhere. Always alone. Always tired. A shadow moving through the gears of the city.

That night, I followed him.

He moved like someone with nowhere left to be. Stopped for takeout at a window with bulletproof glass. Smoked outside his building under a flickering security light. Then headed out again, down toward the scrapyard. That’s where I cornered him.

The air was thick with rust and oil, metal stacked like tombstones. The shadows swallowed our silhouettes, and the silence hung like a question.

“Hey,” I called out.

He turned slowly, brows furrowed. “You need something?”

I stepped into the light. My heartbeat was steady, but my fingers twitched. The knife felt heavier this time. Less foreign. Almost familiar.

He squinted. “Wait… I know you?”

“No,” I said, and lunged.

The first strike hit his arm as he raised it in defense. He screamed—a raw, wet sound—and stumbled back into the junked skeleton of a car. I didn’t stop. My mind went blank. My body moved on instinct, each movement precise, brutal. He kicked at me, tried to grab my jacket, but he was already bleeding too much. Too fast.

His breath hitched. He fell onto the hood of the car, trying to crawl away, slipping in his own blood.

“Please,” he gasped. “Please—I didn’t do anything—”

But it wasn’t about what he did.

It was about what I was becoming.

I stood over him, blade in hand, heart pounding in sync with the drip of blood on metal.

He looked up at me. “Who sent you?”

I didn’t answer.

The last cut was quiet. Clean. His body twitched once. Then nothing.

I stumbled away from the body, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The knife clattered to the ground as I wiped the blood from my hands on my jeans, but the image of Gerald’s face—the shock, the confusion—still hung in my mind like a fog. The weight of it pressed down on me, thick and suffocating. I thought I’d feel the same crushing guilt that had almost swallowed me whole after the first kill, but it wasn’t the same.

It was still there—the unease, the sinking feeling in my stomach—but it was… quieter. Less jarring. Like it was slowly being smothered under something else. A sense of detachment. Like I was watching someone else make the mistakes, and I was just caught in the current, powerless to stop it.

I could still taste the copper on my tongue, feel the residue of Gerald’s blood clinging to my skin. I wanted to gag, to tear the weight off my shoulders, but... it wasn’t as intense. It didn’t feel like the world was crashing in on me the way it did after the first kill. It was a dull ache now, a persistent throb in the back of my mind that I couldn’t shake, but it didn’t holler at me. 

I wanted to vomit again. I wanted to scream. But instead, I just stood there for a moment, watching the blood pool beneath Gerald’s body, the world around me eerily still.

I didn’t feel better.

But I felt something else. And maybe that’s what scared me more.



The third kill came faster than I expected. The name was familiar, though I didn’t know why. Was it because I had seen her face somewhere, or was it something deeper? I couldn’t tell. All I knew was that her name burned into my mind, making it impossible to ignore.

Lena Marcotte.

Her coordinates led me to a high-rise building in the financial district. A swanky apartment. The kind of place where you could almost smell the money oozing from the walls. The elevator ride was slow. The doors opened with a soft, metallic ding, and I was immediately hit by the fragrance of fresh lilies and expensive perfume.

Lena was on the balcony, sipping wine as if the world outside didn't exist. I stood in the doorway for a moment, unsure. But then, I saw her face. Her profile, the way the breeze caught her hair, the way she turned the wine glass between her fingers. I couldn’t help but watch her for a few more seconds, lost in a sense of familiarity that gnawed at the back of my mind. She was so beautiful, effortlessly graceful. Not like the others. Not like the ones I had stalked before. This one... this one felt different.

I had to remind myself why I was here.

I stepped inside, my footsteps echoing on the polished floor. She turned when she heard me.

“Oh,” she said, her voice light and welcoming. “I wasn’t expecting company.” She didn’t seem surprised, though. It was almost as if she knew I’d be coming.

“I wasn’t sure if you’d want to meet, but your name was on the list,” I said, my voice shaking, though I tried to keep it steady.

She raised an eyebrow. “The list? What list?”

I didn’t know why, but I lied. “It’s a charity event. I’m here to talk about donations. Thought you’d be interested in hearing more.”

She smiled, the warmth radiating off of her. “Well, I’ve been known to be generous,” she said, taking another sip of her wine. She held out the glass to me. “Drink?”

I almost refused, but something in her eyes made me pause. “Sure,” I muttered.

She poured me a glass, the deep red wine catching the light as it filled. She didn’t seem to notice the way I was shifting, the way my hands were clenched at my sides. She handed me the glass, and I took it—my fingers feeling cold around the delicate stem.

“Tell me about this charity of yours,” she said, smiling, her voice full of that soft, unguarded kindness. “I haven’t heard of it before.”

The words came to me like they always did, rehearsed, hollow. “It’s for underprivileged youth. We help them with education, training... opportunities.”

“Sounds wonderful,” she replied, her gaze lingering on me. But there was something else in her eyes—something sharp, as if she knew I was hiding something.

“Yeah,” I muttered, taking a sip. The warmth of the alcohol didn’t help much. It wasn’t calming me the way it had before. My heart raced again. The closer I got to her, the more I hated the man I had become. But I couldn’t stop myself. I had to follow through.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to donate,” she continued, oblivious to the turmoil within me. “But maybe I can help in other ways. Do you have a card?”

I nodded and reached into my jacket pocket, feeling the cool metal of the weapon hidden inside. I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears as I pulled out my business card. My hand trembled. She didn’t seem to notice.

Lena reached for the card with an easy smile, but I grabbed her wrist before she could take it.

Her eyes widened, and for the first time, something shifted in her expression. A slight flicker of realization. But it was too late. I was already pulling the knife out of its sheath.

Her mouth opened to scream, but I was faster. The steel sliced through her flesh. A deep, clean cut along her throat. Blood spurted, dark and warm, in a crimson line that stained her skin.

She collapsed, a choked gasp escaping her lips. Her body crumpled to the floor in a heap, wine splashing across the marble tiles as she fell. Her eyes were wide, filled with shock and disbelief. She couldn’t understand. Couldn’t process it.

I stood over her, watching as she bled out. The sound of her desperate gasps—the way her fingers twitched. Her life drained from her in the most agonizing silence, the blood pooling beneath her body.

And something in me... changed.

It wasn’t like the first kill. Not like the second. There was no fear, no nausea. The violence felt... thrilling. The rush coursed through my veins like fire, and it ignited something I didn’t want to name. It was a sickness, a hunger. But the hunger wasn’t for redemption anymore. It was for the act itself. It was the power. The control.

I didn’t just feel relief. I felt... alive.

I stood there for what felt like hours, watching the life fade from her eyes. The apartment was eerily quiet, save for the sound of my breathing and the occasional drip of blood hitting the floor.

When I finally turned and left, I did so without a backward glance. I didn’t look at her. Didn’t need to. She was gone, and I had already forgotten her name.

As I walked down the hallway and out into the night, the hunger gnawed at me. It felt like an itch I couldn’t scratch. Something deep inside that would never go away. It wasn’t about the debt anymore. It was about something darker.

Something I had become.

  


Days passed with no word. No coordinates. No name. Just silence, stretching like a noose. I checked my phone every hour, screen always blank, the ghost of blood still sticky in my mind. I thought maybe it was over. Maybe I’d passed some test and been spared the rest. But the stillness wasn’t peace—it was pressure, coiling tighter inside my ribs with every tick of the clock.

I couldn’t sit still. I couldn’t rest. The quiet wasn’t relief—it was maddening. I found myself listening for something that hadn’t arrived yet. Watching the door. Pacing. Every hour felt like a coiled spring buried under my skin. I started to feel… prickly. Like my own nerves were turning on me.

I cleaned. I rearranged things. I walked for miles through the city with no destination. My eyes twitched to every shadow, every face. Each second stretched itself thin, each breath drawn longer than it had any right to be.

But on the 10th day, the final message arrived. The message had been simple. Too simple, almost. There was no name this time. No coordinates, no cryptic instructions. Only an address scrawled on a piece of paper, tucked into my coat pocket.



I stood in front of the building, the place where it would all end, the one place I couldn’t avoid. A warehouse district on the outskirts of the city. The kind of place where time seemed to be suspended, where the air was thick with the scent of rust and decay, and the silence was heavy enough to press against your chest.

I hesitated before walking in, the usual thrill of the hunt absent. Only emptiness remained, stretching between my ribs like a hollow cavern. The building was massive. A cavern of steel and concrete, swallowed by shadows. It smelled of old industrial grime, of things left behind and forgotten.

I stepped into the darkness, my footsteps muffled by the thick layer of dust. The building felt abandoned, though I knew it wasn’t. My hand instinctively reached for the handle of the knife I’d carried through every kill. It had become an extension of myself, a cold reminder of what I had become, what I was about to do.

As I moved deeper into the building, I could feel the air shift. It was as if the place had been waiting for me, watching me from the dark corners where light couldn’t reach. The silence stretched on, suffocating. My skin prickled. Every instinct in me screamed that I was being watched, that I was stepping into something much bigger than myself.

I found the room at the end of a long corridor, the door slightly ajar, just enough for me to slip through. My heart hammered in my chest, a rapid drumbeat that echoed through my body. I could hear my breath coming in shallow gasps. Was it fear? Or was it something else? My hands were trembling, but not from fear. No, it was something else entirely. Something darker.

I pushed the door open.

Inside, the man in the black suit stood by a table. He didn’t look at me immediately. He was staring down at something, his face partially obscured by the shadows. There was something eerily calm about him, as if everything was already decided, as if nothing I did would change the outcome.

Finally, he turned. His eyes met mine, piercing through the shadows, and for a moment, time seemed to stretch out between us. The world narrowed to just the two of us in that empty room.

“I’ve been waiting for you,” he said quietly, his voice soft, almost soothing. He didn’t move. Didn’t offer me a seat, didn’t gesture toward the table. He simply stood there, like he was observing a piece of art. Something beautiful in its own way.

“I’m not going to do it,” I whispered, though I wasn’t sure if I meant the words, or if they were just something to fill the silence.

He smiled, that cold, empty smile that never reached his eyes. “You already have.”

The words hit me like a punch to the stomach. I felt a wave of nausea sweep over me, my knees buckling for a moment before I steadied myself against the doorframe.

“I told you there would be one more,” the man continued, his voice calm and detached, as if he were discussing something entirely trivial. “One more task. One last person you have to erase from your life.”

I took a step back, my mind whirling. I knew what was coming. I knew what he was going to say. But I didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t want to admit it. Not after everything I’d done.

But he already knew.

“Jonah,” he said, his voice soft but unyielding. “Your friend. The one who stuck by you when no one else did. The one you have to kill.”

My stomach dropped. The room spun. I took a step back, away from the man, the words crashing over me like a tidal wave.

“No,” I whispered, my voice barely a breath. “Not him. I can’t.”

But the man didn’t answer. He just stood there, eyes steady on mine. “You already know what you have to do. You’ve done the rest. This one is no different.”

I couldn’t breathe. My throat was tight, my chest constricted. Jonah. My friend. The last person left in my life who still cared. The person who’d watched me fall apart and still offered a hand to pull me up.

The thought of it made my stomach churn. I wanted to scream, to throw myself at the man and beg for mercy. But I knew better. I knew there was no mercy left in this game. I had made my choices. I had crossed the line a long time ago.

“Jonah is the only person who can undo everything you’ve worked for,” the man said, his voice almost like a whisper. “But you can’t go back now. You’ve come too far. You’ve sacrificed too much. You can’t stop.”

I felt a strange pull in my gut, like something inside me had shifted. The hunger, the need, the desire to finish it gnawed at me once more. It wasn’t even fear anymore. It wasn’t guilt. It was something deeper. Something primal.

I walked out of the room without saying a word. My mind raced. The task was clear. But how could I do this? How could I kill the one person who had been there for me, who had stood by me when I had no one else?

The answer came quickly. I had to. There was no choice. No other way out.



Jonah sat at the small café, his usual table by the window. He looked the same. The same warm smile, the same casual way he leaned back in his chair. He was the same Jonah I’d known for years, the same person who had laughed at my dumb jokes and stayed up late with me talking about everything and nothing.

I sat down across from him. For a moment, there was silence. He didn’t notice the tension in the air. He didn’t notice the way my hands were shaking.

“Hey, man,” Jonah said, grinning. “I was starting to think you’d forgotten about me.”

I forced a smile. “Nah, just been busy.”

“Yeah, I get it,” he said, still oblivious. “You’ve been through a lot. You know, if you ever want to talk…”

I swallowed hard. My heart was hammering in my chest. I could feel the cold edge of the knife against my ribs.

I didn’t say anything. I just nodded. The silence stretched on, and then Jonah spoke again.

“You know, I always thought you’d turn it around,” he said, his voice soft but filled with a kind of hope. “You’re not the same guy you used to be. You’ve been through a lot, but I know you’ll make it.”

His words hit me like a slap. I almost lost it. I almost couldn’t take it anymore.

But I did.

I stood up suddenly. Jonah looked confused as I reached for my coat, pulling out the knife with practiced ease. He didn’t even have time to react.

In one fluid motion, I grabbed him, forcing the blade into his side. He gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief, with shock. But there was no time for that. There was no time for words, for apologies, for anything.

I twisted the knife. He tried to push me away, but it was too late. The blood started to pour from him, staining the floor beneath us. Jonah’s eyes were wide, his mouth opening and closing as though he was trying to form words, but no sound came out.

When it was over, I stood over him, the lifeless form of my best friend sprawled in front of me.

I stared down at Jonah’s body, his eyes locked in a final, confused expression. His blood stained the linoleum around us, sticky and still warm beneath my boots. And yet, I felt no grief. No regret.

Instead, euphoria surged through me like wildfire. My hands trembled with adrenaline. My breath came in sharp, ragged gasps, but I was smiling. Smiling wide. The final task was complete—and it felt like something inside me had finally clicked into place.

The hunger, the urge, the sensation that had grown with each kill… it exploded now. A pulse of heat flooded my veins, like my body had been holding back something ancient and raw. My skin itched. My bones ached. My vision blurred.

I stumbled outside the café, the night air rushing into my lungs like cold fire. My heart pounded faster, faster. The shadows grew deeper, the stars overhead spinning in a chaotic dance. Pain bloomed along my spine, fiery and electric. I fell to my knees, choking back a scream.



Then—crack.



My fingers curled, stretching into claws. My mouth widened, jaw cracking open as sharp teeth pushed through my gums. Hair sprouted along my arms, chest, neck. My bones twisted, reshaped, reformed with sickening snaps. My ribs stretched outward, expanding as if my chest had to make room for something greater inside. I felt tendons coil like springs beneath the skin, muscles swelling with new strength.

The sounds of the city became clearer. Crisper. I could hear the flutter of wings blocks away, the hum of power lines overhead, the quickened heartbeat of a frightened cat slinking under a car. I could smell the grease from a food cart three streets down, the sweat of a man hailing a cab, the faint perfume of a woman walking alone.

And underneath it all—the pulse. That delicious, rhythmic beat of life. So many lives. All of them glowing in the dark, waiting.

I understood now. This was it. This was my payment. The debt was as good as settled.

I wasn’t running anymore.



And I howled.



The sound tore through the night, wild and furious. A beast’s cry. A declaration. A birth.

I rose on new limbs—stronger, heavier. My body towered beneath the moonlight. The city lights flickered below as if in fear.

I was no longer Michael. I was something more.

Something free.



And the hunt had only just begun.
