Those aren’t the words a six-year-old girl wants to hear from an old, disgruntled man in a fast-food restaurant. I remember the sudden coldness of his emaciated hand on my shoulder. The vicious voids in place of his eyes. The anger on his lips as he nodded his head at the beef burger in my hands. I’d never felt such fear, and I started to quiver in terror. Fortunately, my dad aggressively shooed the creeper away, and I found myself eyeballing the burger.
  

  
“Fucking arsehole,” My dad muttered whilst my mum consoled me. “Why was he bothering Amelia?”
  

  
“What’s wrong with my food, Dad?” I asked, sniffling.
  

  
He smiled, ruffling my hair. “Nothing, sweetheart. That was just... an unwell man.”
  

  
But my dad was wrong, as I would learn over the coming weeks. After eating that burger, my sense of smell drastically improved, I didn’t need as much sleep, and I found myself craving food that I knew I shouldn’t eat. I imagine you’ve started to put things together. My traits changed with every piece of meat I ate.
  

  
Only meat.
  

  
The primary horror was the sudden onset of uncontrollable, animalistic urges. I often felt my intelligence slipping away after assuming an animal’s mindset. It was hard to rationalise and process thoughts. And I was too afraid to tell my parents. I know that was stupid, but I was only six, and I thought I’d done something wrong. But I was smart enough to put the pieces of the jigsaw together, and I decided to become vegetarian after a week of experiencing transformations from meat-based meals.
  

  
The strange thoughts, feelings, and sensory changes vanished after a week or so. My humanity returned, and I put the terrifying experience out of my mind. But a terrible thing happened last weekend, nearly twenty years after the torture that I half-convinced myself to be a figment of a child’s overactive imagination.
  

  
I accidentally ate meat.
  

  
“I love you guys,” Paul drunkenly announced.
  

  
I was enjoying a wonderful camping trip with my friends, and Paul secretively cooked dinner, refusing to let anyone intervene – he wanted the dish to be a surprise. He clumsily handed out plates of colourful food, and I exchanged a concerned look with Rachael, my best friend.
  

  
“What is this?” She asked, smirking.
  

  
“That’s for me to know and you to… I don’t know…” Paul snorted, losing his train of thought.
  

  
As soon as I swallowed that first mouthful of food, I knew something was wrong. It was a sickening sensation I hadn’t felt since childhood. Something was taking control of my mind and body.
  

  
“Paul…” I groaned, plate trembling in my hands. “Is there… meat in this?”
  

  
Mike’s eyed widened. “Paul! You idiot! You know Amelia's a vegetarian!”
  

  
“Oh, shit…” He gasped. “I forgot.”
  

  
“You forgot?” Rachael cried incredulously.
  

  
“I’ve not been friends with her for that long,” He muttered sheepishly. “I’m sorry, Amelia.”
  

  
“You don’t understand,” I growled, wrestling with the bombardment of overwhelming thoughts and desires. “What meat did you feed to me?”
  

  
“I wanted to impress you guys,” He said sadly. “It’s… Nile Crocodile meat in a roasted vegetable stew. I bought it online and had it imported. Costed a fortune, but–”
  

  
“Fucking moron!” Mike interrupted. “Amelia, are you going to be… Wait, Amelia...?”
  

  
I was crawling on my hands and knees towards the tent. When I consume meat, it’s never an outwardly-visible transformation, but one of the mind. That being said, there were physical changes beneath the surface. Changes more terrifying than any transformation I’d ever experienced before. Of course. I’d eaten crocodile. One of Earth’s deadliest animals. Often unreasonably cruel creatures. Do I know that from reading about them? No. I know it because I *felt* it.
  

  
“I’m sorry, Amelia,” Paul sniffled, stumbling around the campfire to help me. “Are you gonna be sick? Is that what’s wrong?”
  

  
*I’ll play a game with him*, I thought, but it wasn’t *my* thought.
  

  
Driven by urges beyond my control, I found myself turning to look at Paul – softening him with crocodile tears. Rachael and Mike were watching me with worried expressions, but Paul was too inebriated to be wary of my erratic behaviour.
  

  
“I feel awful,” He said. “Let me give you a hug.”
  

  
I didn’t want to lull my friend into a false sense of security, but I was helpless in the face of the horror that was stealing my body from me. And for a fleeting moment, between the blackened trees of the forest, I saw him.
  

  
The haunting man who cursed me twenty years ago.
  

  
*Has he been watching over me for all of that time?* I fearfully wondered as the wicked wizard took the reins. Internally screaming, I could only watch as my body lunged at Paul and my teeth sank into his forearm. All I could think was that his surprise tasted sweet, but, again, it wasn’t my thought. I don’t even think it was the thought of a crocodile. No, it was the man. The man who had been following me for twenty years.
  

  
Paul wailed at the gaping wound in his arm, and I joined him. They weren’t crocodile tears – I genuinely felt a harrowing sense of horror beyond words. After all, I was trapped in my own body, helplessly watching the blood trickle down Paul's arm. And then I watched my friends run away, leaving me to contend with the terrifying man in the trees. They didn’t even seem to notice him.
  

  
“You are what you eat,” The spectre whispered. “Oh, Amelia. You were being well-behaved for so many years…”
  

  
I sobbed intensely. “Please… Stop this… Help me…”
  

  
“Yes,” He smiled. “I can make it stop. Why don’t you eat this?”
  

  
The elderly, crooked man held something small in his left hand. It was a dark object that I couldn’t distinguish.
  

  
“It’ll make everything better,” He cooed, striding towards me. “You are what you eat, and this is *death itself*.”
  

  
I screamed, or attempted to scream, but could only feebly gasp for air as I crawled backwards. I wished my friends hadn't fled. I was alone in that blackened forest, staring into the face of Hell incarnate.
  

  
“I don’t want to die,” I pleaded, blubbering as I had in that restaurant.
  

  
“Then you must accept your fate,” He said, smiling.
  

  
There’s a hole in my memory after the perturbing man’s final line. When I woke in my bed, I had no recollection of returning home.
  

  
What did I do for the rest of the evening?
  

  
I’ve no idea what’s real anymore. Did I hallucinate my encounter with the demonic man in the forest? I don’t think so. But I definitely know the horror at the campfire was real because my friends won’t reply to my texts. I don’t blame them. I pray that Paul simply ghosts me, rather than getting the police involved.
  

  
The cravings are crippling. I feel violent. *So* violent. And my sense of empathy is dwindling. I’m wrestling with the very concept of morality – do I even care about what happened to Paul? That’s the terrifying question.
  

  
If I avoid people for a few more days, my mind and body should return to normal. But what then? I have to live the rest of my life in fear of eating meat. I fear for those around me, but I also fear the man who inflicted this nightmare upon me. Why me? Why not any other meat-eater in that restaurant? I was just a child. An innocent child. I don’t know what kind of message he was trying to send.


  
I fear that he might make me do something much worse next time.
