In the spring and summer of 2001 there were a series of bizarre murders in the Milwaukee area.

The first body was found on a sailboat in Door County. Female. Cause of death: blood loss. Two weird details. The victim had lost a lot of blood (see: cause of death), but there wasn’t any blood at the scene of the murder. Second, even weirder, weird thing: While examining the body, the coroner discovered a small, perfectly rectangular piece of skull was missing from the back of the victim’s head.

Two weeks later a second body was found in a bathroom at the Potawatomi Casino Hotel. Male. Same cause of death. No crime scene blood, and a missing rectangle of skull.

Two bodies. Two disfigured heads.

A serial killer was loose in eastern Wisconsin.

Two more men were killed, one in July and the other at the end of August. No connections were found between them. It appeared the killings were totally random. There wasn’t any physical evidence left behind by The Skull Peeler (courtesy of a local newspaper), which meant no tangible leads, which meant the investigations didn’t go anywhere. Wisconsin murder police closed the case by Halloween.

Fast-forward to December of last year.

Baltimore, Maryland. A body was found in an alley behind a pawn shop. Female. Blood loss. Missing a piece of skull.

A week later a male body was found at a rest stop outside of Tucson, Arizona. Same modus operandi as the other five.

My name is Elliot Skill. I was on a transport job when I made the connection between Milwaukee, Baltimore and Tucson.

The guy in back of my armored van killed a couple prisoners in a county jail. Failed jail-break turned riot. Things got out of hand and he lost his mind. Apparently did it with his bare hands. I was bringing him from East Texas to a high-security prison in Colorado to be locked away forever.

On the way there, in the middle of the night, somewhere in the middle of Nebraska, I got a call from one of my college buddies at the FBI. He said America might have a new serial killer. The killer’s signature was cleanly and precisely cutting out a small, rectangular piece of skull from the back of the victim’s head.

I recognized it instantly. My dad is from Milwaukee, obsessed with The Skull Peeler. I got off the phone with my buddy, and made two phone calls. One to the woman in charge of the investigation, and another to my dad, now living the retirement life in Marco Island.

My dad still had a “Skull Peeler” folder on his computer. He sent it to me, and I passed it on to FBI Special Agent Gina Ortega.

My partner, Deputy Marshall Luke Brady, riding shotgun, didn’t even look up from his Nintendo Switch throughout all of this. “What do you think?” I asked him.

“About what?” Brady finally looked at me.

“I’ve been on the phone for like an hour.”

“The Skull Peeler? Fucked up, man. Fucked up shit.”

There was a song I had been hearing lately. On the radio, in TV shows — it was following me around. We Gotta Get Out Of This Place by The Animals. I thought of that song here, in the armored van, in the middle of Nebraska, brutal killer in back, idiot partner next to me, incurious, clicking buttons and cursing under his breath every so often.

***We gotta get out of this place***  
***If it's the last thing we ever do***

\*

The way these things go is that if you provide the breakthrough insight, they keep you around on the off-chance you do it again.

I was brought on to the inter-agency task force. They called it Project Y.

What this amounted to, at the start, was more of a discussion group than an investigation. Like twenty-three years before, there just wasn’t much to go on. The small team, led by Gina, worked out of the cafeteria in the Armstrong building. Falls Church, Virginia. FBI mostly, some state police with serial killer experience.

I had never been part of an investigation. I was a Deputy U.S. Marshall. Marshalls work for the federal courts. They protect judges and transport prisoners. They sometimes go after fugitives. They certainly don’t hunt serial killers.

The change of pace was invigorating. I felt a new sense of agency. Work meant something again. The truth was, I wanted to quit my job. I’d been thinking about it for two years. I was good at what I did. I was comfortable. But there was something missing. I didn’t particularly like the people I worked with. I saw the path laid out in front of me, the promotion tree, and I saw the way the higher-ups lived their lives, and it bored the hell out of me. I didn’t want to turn out like them.

The problem was figuring out what I was going to do next. I felt stuck. I had experience with this one thing, and it was so specialized I probably couldn’t move laterally into some other profession. I would have to start over. But doing what? What did I like to do? If money weren’t an issue, how would I spend my days? These are the questions I avoided. This is why I still hadn’t quit.

What I needed was a nudge, some outside thing to show up out of nowhere and kick me in the nuts.

What I needed was a serial killer, and an investigation that had me working, finally, at the height of my intelligence.

\*

The team working out of the Armstrong building cafeteria, like the rest of America, had two theories. This was the same killer from Milwaukee. This wasn’t the same killer, it was a copycat.

We worked around the clock. We went through every detail of the Milwaukee murders, every statement, every note, every photograph. We cross-referenced with Tucson and Baltimore. We asked why Tucson and Baltimore? Why two cities on opposite sides of the country when twenty-three years earlier all the murders took place in one metro area?

We came up with nothing, and because we came up with nothing, nothing was happening. We were in the mud. We were spinning our wheels. The sum total of our work was a whiteboard with four questions on it. All of the questions related to the killer’s signature — the only real clue we had to work with.

***Why the precision?***  
***Why rectangles?***  
***Why that part of the head?***  
***Why wasn’t there any blood at the murder scenes?***

Then, on a rainy Sunday in late March, we got a call from Maine. A young woman had escaped a bizarre kidnapping. She told police that a completely bald woman drugged her, brought her to an old cabin, and tried to tie her to the kitchen table. She fought off the woman and ran.

The young woman was missing a small, rectangular patch of hair on the back of her head. At the cabin, they found a bone saw in one of the cupboards.

\*

“What made you want to be a U.S. Marshall?” Special Agent Gina Ortega was riding shotgun, and I was behind the wheel in a soaking wet crewneck sweater. I’d left my raincoat in Dallas. It was Sunday afternoon, and it was still raining.

“I don’t know,” I said. The rental Toyota Camry smelled, I realized at that moment, like stale cafeteria coffee.

“Well, it wasn’t random. There must have been a reason.”

We were headed to Dulles International. Gina, me, and a few others were going to Maine, to a little town an hour outside of Portland. Gina offered to have her semi-retired husband Mark watch my German shorthaired pointer. I dropped Riley off at the Ortega family brownstone, and picked up my new, temporary boss.

Looking at her, you wouldn’t guess FBI. Her gray hair was only slightly longer than mine. This afternoon’s fit: Trench coat. Hoodie. Shit-kicker combat boots. Baltimore Orioles adjustable baseball cap. She was, in short, a cool motherfucker.

“I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I needed a job. I couldn’t find a job. I applied to all these places, all kinds of things. The Marshalls got back to me, scheduled an interview — that was it. Ten years. Hasn’t exactly been The Fugitive.”

“You’re bored.”

“Not anymore.” I played it Gina-cool. Or tried to. I was nervous. What I really wanted to do was beg Gina to do everything in her power to get me a job at the FBI, or in a State Police department. But for now, I focused on proving myself.

“Maybe we’re thinking about the skull thing the wrong way,” I said, flicking the windshield wipers into hyper-speed.

“You’re not into the trophy theory?”

“This is a variation on that,” I said. I paused, still not comfortable sharing my ideas, especially one on one with the boss. “I’ve been thinking about chakras. You know, like yoga. Sacred or supposedly sacred or energetic parts of the body. Parts of the body as representations of emotions or higher powers — that kind of thing.”

“I didn’t peg you for a yoga guy.”

“Maybe that part of the brain has a symbolic meaning.”

Gina smiled, knowing where I was going with this. “The brain,” she said.

“We’ve focused on the missing piece of skull.”

“The killer doesn’t care about the piece of skull. The killer is really after the brain-area behind it. Why?”

“Ritual?”

“The brains are intact. What’s the ritual?”

We fell into silence and listened to the windshield wipers, the rhythmic swish.

\*

Gina sat next to me on the plane. We went over the new case on her iPad. Incident report, statements, photographs. We listened to the recorded 911 call. An older couple, driving home from the hardware store, saw the young woman stumble out of the woods. Picked her up, and gave her water and Swedish fish.

“She came out of the woods. Just past mile-marker twelve.” The man had a pack-a-day rasp. He was calm, in control of the situation. “Doesn’t seem hurt. But…”

Meanwhile, from somewhere behind the man, the young woman could be heard muttering, “Something terrible has happened… Something terrible.”

The recording ended and I said, “Game cameras.” Gina looked at me. What did that have to do with the 911 call? “Hunters are setting them up now, even on public land,” I said. Gina kept looking at me, expecting the punchline. “The search team should get footage from all the game cameras in the area. In case one of them picked up the bald woman.”

“You hunt?”

I shook my head, then typed something in my iPad Notes app. Gina was still looking at me, a hint of a smile on her face.

\*

Three hours later, Gina and I were in another rental car. Black SUV. Maine plates. The Pine Tree State. The dashboard touchscreen said the outside temp was eleven degrees Fahrenheit.

We drove deep, deep, deep into the north woods, turned off the highway onto an uneven dirt road, and followed the smoke. The old cabin was on fire.

“Now what?” I said, getting out of the SUV. The cabin was small. One level. Big porch. Yesterday it was light blue with off-white shutters. Any minute now it would groan like some mythical beast, then collapse into a pile of dust and ash.

Gina came up beside me, watching the firemen. They weren’t fighting the fire, exactly. Just making sure the evergreens didn't ignite. Yes, forest fires can happen even in the freezing cold. “Now we get some sleep.” Gina said, turning back for the car.

I shivered, suddenly feeling out of my element in more ways than one.

\*

The next morning we went to see the victim, while the other members of the task force travel squad joined the hunt for the mysterious bald woman.

The hunt: Local police, state police, sheriff's department, volunteers, hobbyists, retirees looking for something to do. Roadblocks on highways and county roads. Every helicopter in Maine, plus a handful of hobby planes, scanned the forests around the old cabin. Fifty mile radius. She couldn’t have gotten far. How hard was it to notice a bald woman in a county with a population smaller than the average high school?

Gina knocked on Lucy Narcova’s door. I stood at the base of the chipping-to-pieces porch, looking around the neighborhood. Chain-link fences. Yards full of junk. Car parts. Sun-faded toys. Broken trampolines. The houses in Vincent, Maine were old and small and every one of them needed a paint job. Across the street, two local deputies watched us.

Narcova. Russian. She was native-born, with immigrant parents. Lucy worked at the county library, checking out books and, two nights a week, teaching English to immigrant teens and adults from India and the Philippines. She didn’t go to college. She lived alone.

“You sure she’s home?” Gina, to the deputies. One of them was actually picking his nose.

“Hold on just a second,” the nose-picker said. “I have a key.”

\*

There weren’t any lights on. The blinds were drawn. Disembodied voices, frequent laughter — a TV somewhere in the darkness was playing a morning talk show on low volume.

“Lucy?” Gina said, climbing the stairs, dodging folded clothes and Amazon boxes.

I was downstairs opening blinds when I heard my name called. I followed the sound of Gina’s voice, up the stairs, down the short hallway, to the bathroom. Gina stood in the doorway. Lucy Narcova sat in the bathtub, hugging her knees and having a staring contest with the green-tiled wall.

“Go find coffee,” Gina said. I looked at the young woman. She wore candy cane pajamas, matching tops and bottoms, and looked like she hadn’t slept. Big eyes, set wide on a narrow face. Black hair, with hints of faded red dye.

“Elliot. Coffee. We’ll be right down.”

\*

The kitchen table was covered in books. None of the chairs matched. Lucy sat across from me. Gina leaned against the sink. Everyone had a cup of coffee except me.

“Where could she have gone?” Lucy said. “It’s just trees. Dirt roads.”

“I’m not sure. But a lot of good people are out there looking. We’ll find her.” Gina blew on her coffee, then took a sip and made a face. She pointed her Bugs Bunny coffee mug at me. “My partner is going to ask you some questions, Lucy. Is that okay?”

“Will his questions be better than his coffee?”

Gina laughed out loud. Lucy smiled for the first time this morning, and settled into her chair. The ice was broken, for now.

I gathered my thoughts. I hadn’t expected Gina to hand the questioning over to me. “Can you tell us what you were doing Friday night — before you were kidnapped?”

“You read my statement?” Lucy said.

“Yes.” I shifted in my chair, and the creak-noise it made filled the room.

“Then you know. I finished closing up at the library, just after nine. I stopped at the grocery store for a few things. On my way home, I realized I had a flat tire. So I pulled over. I got out. I don’t know where she came from, but suddenly she was there — the bald woman was there.”

“Do you remember what she looked like?” I said, glancing at Gina to see how I was doing. She wasn’t looking at me. She was staring out the window.

“Besides no hair? No. It was dark. And later… Everything is a blur. It’s all a blur.”

“And you didn’t see a car?”

“Didn’t see. Didn’t hear.”

“What do you remember next?”

“The dirty kitchen table. I don’t think anyone was using that cabin. Animal shit everywhere.” Lucy took a sip of coffee. “I remember running through the woods.” She took another sip, then looked at me with something new in her eyes, something alive. “Something just came to me.” She ran it back through her head, trying to make sense of it before saying it out loud.

“What is it?” Gina, coming toward the table.

“I heard her speak. Once. I don’t know when. On the road, in that dirty kitchen — I don’t know. Maybe I was half-conscious or something. Maybe I dreamed it. She had this strange, low voice. Like, it didn’t match her face, if you know what I mean. I heard her say: ‘There can only be one.’ There can only be one. What could she mean by that?” She looked at me, then Gina, then me again, for an answer. And when we didn’t offer one, she lost her nerve, became hysterical.

“What could she mean by that?” Lucy wailed, again and again and again.

\*

“You don’t drink coffee?” Gina said, putting on a pair of Oakley sunglasses that made her look like an FBI agent. Or, at least, someone who frequents gun ranges.

We were walking to the black SUV with Maine plates. The deputies hadn’t moved.

“I had a cup already. Can only do one a day. Sensitive to caffeine.”

“No shit?”

I shrugged.

“You did good in there. You were calm. Asked the right questions. Let her talk. What are your thoughts about doing the press conference too?” She said this with a straight face.

I smiled. It felt good to be teased by the boss. “We’re late, by the way,” I said.

“I’ll drive.”

I tossed her the keys.

\*

The press conference was on Main Street. Outside of a peeling-white building the size of a studio apartment. The original Vincent County courthouse. Now a historical site. Apparently it had the biggest parking lot in the downtown area.

Gina, backed by a row of solemn, long-bearded mountain men, representatives from every law enforcement branch in the northeast, addressed the gathered reporters, news crews, concerned residents, unfazed residents passing by, curious about the hubbub. There were cameras broadcasting to local and national news networks.

“...a lot of good people are out there looking,” Gina was saying, sunglasses off. Gina-cool.

I was in the crowd next to a woman wearing a CNN-branded parka and aviators. I wasn’t paying attention to the speech. I was thinking about the bald woman. Was this woman really in Tucson last month? Baltimore before that? Was she bald, then? It seemed so unlikely that someone, this single person, was running around to the most random corners of the country cutting rectangles into people’s heads. How old was she? If she was the Milwaukee killer, she must be middle-aged. What if she was younger? A copycat? What if she was a copycat of whoever was in Tucson and Baltimore? What if they were all copycats?

I thought I felt something. Then I felt it again. My pocket. My phone, buzzing with a message. I took it out and looked at it. There was a message in the Task Force Chat:

***We got another one, folks. North Dakota!***

A chill ran down my spine. “North Dakota?” I said this out loud.

“North Dakota? What about North Dakota?” The woman in the CNN parka asked, hush-hush, looking at me sideways.

Speechless, I couldn’t wrap my mind around it. The woman sensed this state of confused panic. She interrupted Gina. “Excuse me. Hey!” Everyone looked at CNN Parka. She spoke up. “I think something happened,” she said, with a look at me.

Gina saw my face. She stepped away, quickly walked over and got between me and the reporter, and said very softly, “What’s wrong, Elliot? What’s going on?”

“It happened again.” I swallowed a lump in my throat. “North Dakota.”

A silence followed, Gina just staring at me like I was speaking Canadian French. “What do you mean?” She said at last.

“There’s another body in North Dakota.”

By now, the news was spreading through the crowd like winter wildfire. Whispers turned into shouted questions. No one in charge, not even Gina, could find words.

Finally, the guy representing the Maine State Police told the cameras: “We’re doing everything in our power to figure out what’s going on.”

\*

“What is that?” Gina behind the wheel, going at least fifteen over the limit, and me next to her on my iPad. We were heading back to Portland International Jetport.

“Reddit.” I showed her the iPad screen. “I started posting about the cases there.” Gina gave me a look. “Just guiding discussion. Call it crowd-sourcing.”

“You’re posting details about an ongoing investigation on Reddit?”

“Anonymously.” I said, thinking, now, that I should have kept this to myself.

“What are the message boards saying?”

“Nothing we haven’t been saying for the past month. Except…”

“What?”

“There’s been chatter about copycats. Plural. Which… Has that ever happened?”

“More than one copycat? Not that I know of.”

“That conversation about copycats has turned into a discussion about cults. Ritual murder. There’s a new theory gaining steam about how this isn’t one killer, or one killer and a copycat, or two copycats, but all different killers, connected by some shared ideology.”

“That’s good.” Gina hit the turn signal, took the exit toward the jetport.

“Initiation ritual, for example. A way to prove yourself to the leader.”

“Copycats. Cults.”

“The bald woman isn’t in North Dakota. There’s no way,” I said.

A message notification popped up on the iPad screen. From the Task Force Chat:

***Another body in Ohio***

“What’s it say?” Gina asked.

“Another body in Ohio.”

Gina barely reacted, as if she were expecting this. She thought about it for a moment, then with urgency said, “I’m going to Ohio. You’re going to North Dakota.”

“I’ve never processed a crime scene. I’m not trained.” Doubt.

“You don’t want to go?”

“I do. I really do. It’s just… am I even allowed?” Fear.

“Training. Credentials. Who gives a shit? I couldn’t care less if you got a badge or a diploma. Are you smart? Intuitive? Creative? Are you present? Do you pay attention? I mean, really pay attention? That’s all that matters.”

“Okay.”

“You haven’t done this before, but you’re capable. I promise you. You can do this. And I know you’ve been wanting to ask me about working at the Bureau. This is your shot.”

I wondered how she knew that. I hadn’t told anyone. “Okay,” I said again.

“I need a little more than that, Elliot.”

“Send me to North Dakota.”
