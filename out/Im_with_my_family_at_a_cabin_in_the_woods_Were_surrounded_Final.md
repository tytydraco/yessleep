I awoke to screaming. The lights had gone out, everything was dark. I guess the headlights on the cars finally gave up because nothing was coming through the window. Delma was screaming bloody murder though, and it took me a moment in my half-asleep state to figure out what she was saying. 

“THEY’RE HERE!” 

I reached for the lantern at my side, flipping the switch on and getting a full view of the horror unfolding in our little cabin.

Three of the smaller creatures were standing over Pete, one with a hand deep inside my uncle’s chest. There was blood all over the floor around him, and though it seemed like he was trying to scream, I don’t think his lungs were working as they should. The creature standing above him was looking right at the act as it happened, big white eyes wide with intrigue. It’s like… like they were examining him. It was feeling around inside his chest cavity, getting a feel for how our insides worked. The sideways mouth in the middle of its face was practically smiling with the glee of discovery.

”Let go of him!” Delma shouts, jumping towards one of the creatures and slapping it hard. It didn’t even move, only looking at her and letting out one of the terrifying, metallic roars just like the big one. My head hurt again, ears fizzling as the sound threatened to break my eardrum from this close. The thing flicked a finger in Delma’s direction, sending her flying through one of the bedroom doors as it broke from the force of her moving body. She barely let out a grunt before crumpling a couple of feet inside the doorway.

“Leave my brother alone!” Dad screamed, raising the shotgun and firing off round after round, furiously pumping between each one before the gun began to click empty. The things weren’t phased, only looking at him before raising a hand in his direction. The gun flew from his hands as if something invisible snatched it right away, throwing it across the room. The one with a hand inside Pete began to withdraw, now looking at dad with great interest as it moved closer. He shouted, pulling a knife and brandishing it at them as they moved with determination, each one approaching him from a different direction, flanking their prey.

I can’t even begin to describe the whirlwind that was happening around me. Ray and Sutter both awoke but were stuck gawking at the sight in front of us just like I was. The creatures began to grab for dad, the three of us unable to do anything as two of them grabbed his arms, one each, while the third grabbed him right around the ankles. They began to walk out, and I noticed our formerly cluttered barricade was stacked off to the side of the room, somehow moved without a sound as we were all sleeping. 

They carried my father out the door without so much as a sound other than his desperate screaming. He was cursing at them, throwing every insult imaginable as they took him into the darkness, away. from the shattered safety of the cabin. As they disappeared into the night, his screaming began to steadily fade.

”What the hell do we do now?” Sutter whispered, though I don’t know if he wanted an actual answer or not. Whatever we do now, we’re not safe anywhere in these fucking woods.

I got up, closing the door and looking back at the two of them in the lantern light. Ray was… well, Ray looked like a shell-shocked soldier from those old WW2 photos. Sutter was just whispering to himself, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Pete… whatever they did to Pete got him out of this mess, and honestly I think he’s lucky that he got out this early. The blood around him was beginning to pool, and his chest was no longer rising or falling in sporadic rhythm as he stared lifeless at the ceiling. I reached over, closing his eyes, and bowed my head before making my way to the bedroom. 

Delma was still alive, though unconscious. There’s no telling how many broken bones she has though. Her arm was twisted in a bad direction, and her breathing was ragged, pained, likely thanks to a few broken ribs. I could only hope she didn’t have a punctured lung. Her head was bleeding slightly, I’m assuming from where she hit the door on her express flight into the bedroom, and I reached for one of the nearby blankets to try and hold to her head. 

“We need to run.” I said. 

“How the hell we gonna do that?” Rayasked, sounding like he had already given up.

”Well, there’s enough of us that we’ll fit in your car now.” I shot back.

”You mean we’re just gonna leave without Danny?” He asked me, now a little more present than before. “I can’t leave my big brother behind.”

”Fuck him. We still have a chance to live.” I said, anger welling up in my throat. Not like he would give a second fucking thought about going after one of us if we were taken. 

“He’s got a point…” Sutter mumbled, and his dad didn’t even try to argue it back.

“Where are the masks downstairs?” I asked, trying to turn lights on but getting no response from flipping switches. “Must be something wrong with the fuse box…”

“Hanging up at the bottom of the stairway..”  Ray said. “I guess we could hide down there. The fumes are probably still bad though.”

“Good. There’s propane tanks down there, right?” I was trying to put everything together in my mind. We could set a trap for these things and get everyone still alive out of here at the same time if my plan goes right. Or I could end up torching us all to cinders in the process. Either way, we don’t stand a chance in here or out there, so might as well go down swinging, right?

“Gotta be honest, pa. Colin is right.” Sutter said now, standing up and looking to me for guidance. “There’s about four small tanks and one big one right next to the cellar door. What’s the plan?”

“Where’s your car keys?” I started laying everything out for them as I dared to peek outside. Through the window, the moon was shining bright over the little clearing the cabin was in now. It took my eyes a moment to adjust after being in the lantern light for so long, but after a moment the horror of our situation was completely visible.

At least a dozen pairs of milky white eyes were staring at us from the tree line. I couldn’t see the rest of them, but they were there. Judging by the height the eyes were at we were dealing with a bunch of the smaller ones, with no telling where the massive beast from earlier could be. Maybe it had enough for the night after flipping the truck. I could only hope. Ray pulled some jingling keys from his pocket, getting ready to toss them to me before I shook my head.

“You’re driving. I’m going to lure them in here while you and Sutter get Delma in the car.” I said, turning back to them and away from the window. “Don’t know how much time I’m going to be able to buy so be as fast as you can, okay?”

They both nodded, each moving to either end of Delma to grab her legs and arms. After they heft her up, I motion for them to wait for another minute. Moving to the back door, cracking it open just slightly to get a look outside, I poke my head out. It’s clear back here. Maybe they didn’t think we would go out this way since the cars were out front. Whatever reason, this was going to be the best way for them to get around.

“Okay, you guys come out this way and go around to get her in the car. I’m going to lead them into the basement and blow it once I can get most of them inside.” I said, turning back to them.

“How you gonna get out, though?” Sutter about shouted. He thought I was going to try for the sacrifice play, I think, but there was no way in hell I was dying in a fucking meth cabin.

“Just trust me. Pull the car around to the cellar door and I’ll meet you there.” I said. Shit, there was still something missing. I hefted the lantern, looking all around the room before my eyes finally landed on it- the shotgun. It was dropped on the floor where one of the things ended up throwing it from dad’s hands, sitting empty with no more shells. Should be around here somewhere…

Rooting around in the kitchen cabinets for a minute turned up half a box of them. I had a little experience shooting from just being out here with dad as a kid. He would set up old beer bottles and fire them off on the last day of each trip, and inevitably ended up having me shoot at some too while we were at it. Usually while going on a tirade about my mother or whoever he had just ended a recent relationship with. Great environment to grow up in, right?

Whatever though, I have what I need. Now it’s time to get going. I pushed the others out the backdoor and closed it so the things wouldn’t go that way when they came in. Quickly, I ran down the basement stairs, grabbing the gas mask off the peg by the last step and situating it over my face. It was one of those with a whole face shield on it, so everything fogged up for a moment as I adjusted to the dim light down here. 

Hefting the lantern, I looked around and got a feel for the way I would need to go. The path through the lab was straight through, with counters set up along either wall of the cellar filled with tubes, trays, beakers, and burners that all kept dad paid before tonight. Now it was going to get a little revenge on the fuckers that took him. One by one I found the propane tanks, popping off the rubber hoses that led them to burners and twisting the valves wide open. I could hear the slight hiss as gas began leaking into the air, filling the cellar with deadly fumes. It’s time.

Walking back upstairs, over to the front door, I took a deep breath, cocking the shotgun and saying a brief prayer to whoever might be listening before flinging it open.

They just watched me. Filmy eyes studying me in the doorway as they slowly began to creep forward from the shadowy woods. My stomach sank. Jesus, this is basically suicide. These things carried my dad away like it was nothing and now they were coming back to rip me to shreds right here on the front porch.

No time to think about that now though. Got to get moving or else they really will tear me to pieces. Have to at least try to make a difference here. I’m not going to die being pathetic.

They were all out in the sunlight now. It was uncanny how they all looked exactly the same. Leathery skin, asymmetrical bones jutting through it like canvas stretched over some horrific sculpture. Those white eyes that looked totally blind but somehow saw every little move. I could feel them staring me down, waiting for the sign to all strike at once and rip me apart limb from limb. That would probably be lucky. Worst case they start poking around in me like they did to Uncle Pete. His corpse was still resting right there in the living room behind me, a stark reminder of what could be my fate.

“Come on, fuckers!” I shouted, firing off a shot at the closest one. It didn’t even wince, if that was something they could do. Instead they all let out that metallic roar at the same time again, making me shut my eyes briefly and grit my teeth. Felt like my skull was going to shatter into pieces from the frequency, and it took everything in me not to just run off into the woods, hoping for safety in the trees. 

When my eyes came back open they were rushing the porch, each one clambering up the steps and pushing over each other to get to me. I stepped back, pivoting to turn towards the basement door. A few big strides and I made it, looking back to see all of the creatures clambering past each other to try and fit through the door. For a second I wanted to laugh at the sight, all of these terrifying things trying to come through the same narrow doorway, pushing each other and desperately trying to rush past before finally all getting stuck. The humor was quickly killed when the first one fell through onto the ground, quickly standing without a struggle. It was like it floated to its feet right off the ground, ready to come after me again, and it started moving fast.

Taking the steps two at a time, I adjusted my mask. Have to go fast. Fast. My breathing picked up, fogging up the visor on the mask more and obscuring my vision. Behind me, one of the lead creatures stumbled down the last couple of steps, letting out another roar that almost made me trip in return from the ear-piercing pain. More followed it, all joining in the chaos and squalor with their own screams. I hit the ladder leading through the cellar door, hearing it creak and fearing I would fall right through, before clambering up and bursting through out into the open. 

From my new vantage above the cellar door, out in the open moonlight, I could see them starting to scramble at the rickety ladder below me. I heft the shotgun, taking aim at the first one, right at one of the milky white eyes, and squeezing the trigger.

The shot hit, blowing away a chunk of the things eye as it screamed even louder in pain. This was worse than the roar, I think. So much more shrill, hundreds of different frequencies activating at once. God… my brain is going to pop if it doesn’t stop. 

Squinting hard and gritting my teeth with enough pressure to break them off at the root, I raised the gun again, taking steady aim, or at least trying to as all my senses felt like they were bleeding and breaking down. I got it though, squeezing the trigger one more time and blasting it in the same spot I already hit. Guess the eyes were softer than the rest of the skeleton, because some of the pieces of buckshot tore right through it, spilling out neon blue fluid and causing the thing to fall to the ground, twitching. Before I could celebrate my victory though, more of them began to swarm, grabbing the ladder to try and climb up to me. They were different now, though. Before it was… well, they were definitely running at me with a goal in mind. Determined, calculating, I would dare say calm. Now that one of their own was fucked though, they were angry. The eyes were changing, going from milky white to a deep indigo hue. Their mouths were wide open in screams of rage and mourning, sharp pins inside showing as their long, clawed hands reached towards me.

I fired again, but this time not at the creatures. A bottle of whiskey dad had left on the shelf by the ladder, only half drank. Somehow, despite years of being the shittiest human on earth, he managed to save me just this once. Not that he planned or would ever know about it, but goddamn, for a second, I felt grateful to the old bastard. 

The shot was right on the money, blasting apart the glass bottle and splashing whiskey all over the place. It landed mostly on the monsters, dousing them for a brief moment before the rest of the pellets hit the metal shelf, causing a spark that lit them all up. 

Of course, that wasn’t their only problem. The propane leaking out into the room was already thick, and caught almost immediately. The heat from the sudden explosion knocked me back from the cabin, or what remained of it at this point, nearly knocking me out cold. Ray and Sutter had just begun to drive the car around, and as their headlights came around the corner, I could have sworn it was the light of heaven opening up to take me. I half expected to hear a voice telling me to go into the light, but before I could do anything else I felt rough hands hauling me to my feet. Looking over, through the now fogged and soot covered mask, I could see Sutter carrying me to the car, opening up the back drivers side and tossing me in right beside a still unconscious Delma. As soon as I was in he slammed the door shut, jumping into the passenger side before Ray floored it towards the dusty dirt road. 

I laid back in the seat, letting out a huge sigh of relief. I don’t know how that actually worked, but we made it out, somehow. Dad and Pete were dead but… well, I’m honestly too relieved to be alive to dwell on mourning them at this point. Don’t really think I’ll be mourning dad, anyway, when it comes down to it. 

As we drove I looked off behind us, moon hanging low in the dark, starless sky above the car as we went. The flames from the cabin were enough to appear on the horizon, even over the tall trees that lined the road on each side. To my surprise though, something else was glowing in the sky. A loud, mechanical hum began to vibrate the car as we fled the scene, and I’m not sure if it was just us shaking or everything around. But slowly, a huge, purple glow began to rise above the treetops, faintly pulsing in the night as it hovered before going over the flames, unleashing a massive beam of light over it. 

“The hell is that?” Sutter whispered, staring at it along with me. Ray began to slow down, too distracted by the happenings in his rearview to focus on not running us through a tree. 

“Fuckin’ aliens.” Ray whispered. The huge beam of light was beginning to attract something from where it was shining on the burning cabin, limp, long-limbed bodies floating up through the air in the beam. The remains of some floated beside them, no longer attached thanks to the force of the explosion. Over the night air, even through the humming of the craft’s engine, I could hear the roar of rage coming from the creatures.

“Just fucking drive, Ray.” I shouted, finally ripping the mask off my face to get a more clear look and breathe fresh air. The purple glow was blindingly bright, and suddenly the beam of light shining on the cabin faded, leaving just the dull, pulsing purple to hang in the sky. Then, suddenly, not even in the blink of an eye, it zoomed off, straight up into the sky until it was out of sight, just a speck of purple in the moonlight. 

I collapsed in the back seat, aches and pains already flaring up from the beating I took in the explosion. Probably some broken ribs, but all told, that was better than whatever those things would have done to me. 

We drove on in silence, only the occasional pained grumble from Delma breaking the still air. I don’t know where I’m going to go or what I’m going to do. Dad is dead, and I doubt he left me anything or had any kind of will. Maybe I can move in with Ray and Sutter but… god, no, that’s a terrible idea. 

Well, whatever the uncertain future holds, at least my days at the cabin are finally over. Maybe I can actually go to college without hearing about how awful it would be now, too. Honestly… this might not be so [bad](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/JxDJxjX3ol).
