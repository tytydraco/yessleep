Honestly, it’s absolutely insane how we haven’t been shut down yet. The health inspector didn’t even come back into the kitchen last time he visited–he just sniffed at the air and said, “Wow, something’s definitely cooking!” and then LEFT. Just shot a thumbs up at someone, put his cap back on, made a signature on a clipboard, and LEFT. 

MEANWHILE, AGATHA WAS GETTING COOKED IN THE OVEN AGAIN. THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS SMELLING.

This time, she’d fucked up the potatoes for one of our regulars; the order on the receipt that got pinned said *no skin, please,* and as she was skinning the potatoes, she’d cut her thumb, and I’d gotten her a bandaid and told her to please be more careful. We’d been in a rush, though–everyone and their mothers seemed to want to come to our place at two in the morning–and so the potatoes had gotten moved over to get boiled and served. The thing was, though, Mr. Lobo could sniff out anything from a mile away, and management ended up having to refund the whole meal. Of course, they weren’t happy with Agatha. 

Into the oven she went. This time, they’d been generous enough to let her wear mitts as they started the timer for half an hour. Burnt Bartholomew made an experience, poking his head out from under the sink just to laugh at her as she was getting crammed in. I ran the faucet on him, and he yelped and disappeared. 

Agatha survived, but now she’s permanently red and is currently in a psychiatric hold.

That meant it was up for me to train the new part-timer. I briefly wondered if I could take a bereavement leave and kill myself. Management already arranged the grave plot and stone for free a few months ago, but the engraving costs nearly a thousand dollars, and I’d like for it to be more than just my name. Maybe it can say “\_\_\_\_, 20, died in pursuit of her GED.” 

Anyways, he came in on Thursday. So far, he’s only screeched and snarled at me, and at first, I thought they were antisocial. But I asked Chad to try to talk to him when he came in for the weekend to mix the dough, and he said the same thing, which means there’s a communication problem, and I’m gonna have to go home and crack open three billion encyclopedias. Also, his pincers tore open all the plastic gloves, which meant there was a three-hour window during Sunday where we could’ve gotten sued for lack of sanitation.

I’m calling him Hermit, just because calling him some variation of a name with *crab* in it would result in me getting visited by HR in the middle of the night on my one day off, the bitches. 

Hermit loves cinnamon rolls, so I’ve let him just…handle all of the dessert orders. Anything with fish, I handle, because he goes fucking crazy. Don’t even get me started on how he starts to chitter every time I bring up the fryer.

The last straw to break the proverbial camel’s back was yesterday morning, when I had just opened. One of our customers, Mr. Doe, who always insisted we call him Johnny, and was maybe of semi-regular status came in with about thirteen hands and noses skewered on his antlers. 

He stank to high heaven, and I had to excuse myself for a minute to legitimately stick sprigs of eucalyptus up my nostrils before I could come to the counter to take his order. While doing that, I must’ve been sniffling and sneezing too much, because he asked me if I was okay, and then suggested I should take a day off, because apparently *I was looking a little punch-drunk and shouldn’t be on my feet, sweetie.* 

I told him his hair was looking particularly nice. 

He ordered a cow brain, which was my second clue something was wrong. Up till this point in time, Mr. Doe had always ordered a vegetarian entree, usually a sandwich with alfalfa grain or a wheat-grass smoothie. I didn’t make a big deal of it, though, just told him we were out of stock, and asked if there were any other organs she would like to order. He leapt over the counter and tried to kill me with my own cash register. I mean, it was seriously crazy how he’d gotten so aggressive all of a sudden, and he dashed his own brains out against the walls roughly three seconds later. 

I got stuck with an unwanted paint job and stuck *in* a HAZMAT suit for the next two days; they said something about a pry on, and quarantine, and management stuck me with a bunch of needles. One of the junior managers tried to take my blood, and let me tell you, that was a real struggle. Ultimately, he got a talking-to from HR and sent home with a blood bag and a demotion to “satiate his urges”.

THEY NEED TO TAKE OFF HIS INVISALIGN AND REPLACE HIS FANGS WITH DENTURES. IT WOULD BE SAFER.

Typing in an outfit of clunky plastic sucks. It’s like a weird air cushion, but deflated and smelling of old popcorn. For the past twelve hours, I’ve been stuck in the back of the restaurant with my cellphone and a dead body. When I first saw it, I hyperventilated so hard I almost threw up, because things were wrong with it. God, typing this out feels like I’m playing a really vulgar game of spot the difference, but instead of pictures with old ladies on chairs, the catch is that it’s about dead bodies. 

Anyway.

It was someone who had a nose just as pointed as Burnt Bartholomew’s, and another commonality seemed to be their lack of brains. Someone had literally sawed this poor woman’s head apart. The left hemisphere was *gone,* girl. Her mouth was open in a horrible grimace, and there was salt sprinkled all around her in an oval.

As far as I understand, she was either trying to keep something out, or someone was trying to keep her *in,* and I really don’t know which option I prefer.

Option A is she was trying to get rid of something, and since I have absolutely no faith in management, that thing is probably still in *here,* which means I won’t even get to customize my gravestone. 

Option B is somehow worse, because if she was trying to be kept in, someone had killed her pretty brutally and then took her brain, which meant that along with every other illegal thing I've been knowingly or unknowingly aiding and abetting, the restaurant now engaged in organ trading, and THAT IS A WHOLE NEW CAN OF WORMS. 

I’m thinking of just calling the FDA, but now I’m worried they’re going to disembowel *my* head too. They’d probably call in a no-good part-timer who can’t even wash their hands to do it, and it’s just too offensive for me to consider. Plus, there’s a good chance that part-timer would be Hermit, and I guess since I’ve spoken to the guy–crab–I have a bit of a soft spot for him. I don’t want him to get harpooned in the back of his shell right after and served to Mr. Lobo :(

It’s really just a lot, and I’m allergic to something in here, because I keep sneezing. Everyone, what should I do?
