I’m static. Lying upright in a hospital bed, my eyes are unfocused. I wonder how I can think my way out of this, but that’s the irony, isn’t it? A brain tumour. Corruption in the very place where logic and reason reside. A nurse appeared, smiling. 

“Morphine?”

“Sure.”

I opened my mouth like a baby bird and she fed me, then she fluttered around the room, attending to other patients. One protested, as he had done all week. He was old, overweight and slumped, with a dark scar caterpillaring its way from his temple, around to the back of his ear. 

“Not having that. Don’t know what’s in it. I just want to go home. Do you hear me? H-O-M-E. That’s where I want to go, and do you know why? Because you’re trying to poison me. I know you are.”

“Don’t be like that, John. We need that infection to clear up before we can discharge you. Now, can I get you a cuppa?”

There was no reply, and the nurse left the ward. I touched the line of my own scar, which was a deep ridge, high and central. 

“You can barely see it.” Fran had said, holding my hand while a tear rolled down her cheek. I’d tried to own it, joking. But in the companionable solitude of the ward? Under the flickering strip lights? Amongst the lunatic beeping of medical machines? No. There was nowhere to hide. It was a prison where the chief crime was the betrayal of inmates by their own bodies. The smell of bleach used to clean my vomit from the floor still lingered. Thankfully, the morphine was beginning to take the edge off my senses. I settled back further into the pillow. 

More powerful than the nurses were the doctors. How mysterious they were. I could discern no pattern in them whatsoever. They turned up at my bedside randomly, looming and omnipotent. Well-dressed or dishevelled, sympathetic or curt, rushed or relaxed. Deep down, I was grateful for their attention, but nevertheless, I feared them. 

I clicked the lock button on my phone. Fran and I posing in front of an Italian castle appeared. She was beautiful, inside and out. I looked good too. Tanned. Lean. I was no longer that person, and yet I was. 

“Poison.” John muttered from the next bed.

I lolled my head to the side and saw him curled up, facing away, and rolled my head back again. My left arm and leg didn’t work anymore. I’d even tried to get Fran laughing about that, but things were really fucked, weren’t they? How do you even begin to comprehend something like this?

“Home! Discharge me!” John growled.

“They won't. They told you why.” I said.

I closed my eyes and images from a terrible semi-consciousness returned. The operating table. Seizure. Convulsion. BREATHE! Breathe! Breathe. Masked faces above me, like approaching meteors in an apocalyptic night sky. I saw my pulse quicken on the heartbeat monitor as the flashback played out. No escape. No way to reverse things. My eyes slid closed.

My dreams took me to the beach with Fran. She sat in the lee of a dune, laughing as I ran towards the sea with a surfboard under my arm.

“Watch! Keep watching! I’ll know if you look away!” I shouted. 

The water was cold, but I knew better than to prolong the discomfort. I dunked myself backwards under the waves, bounced to my feet and prowled the waters, chest-to-board. I saw an approaching swell and paddled to meet it. Both arms and legs foamed the water as I tried to get the timing right. I popped up and almost fell. The wave began to curl over me, so I crouched lower and picked up momentum. Fran leapt to her feet, cheering me on. Always speeding toward the light, I cast a glance over my shoulder and saw the ravenous maw of the collapsing wave. It was catching up.

“Keep watching! Fran!” I yelled, my voice echoing off the watery walls.

A curious glow appeared beneath my board, and I realised something was changing. More specifically, the water was changing. Purple tendrils reached out. Ever more purple. Then red. 

“Blood. It’s blood.” I muttered. 

My knees knocked together and my stomach lurched. Fran stood motionless on the shoreline, clutching her sun hat beneath her chin. She wasn’t clapping anymore. The wave darkened to the colour of merlot, utterly opaque, and I fell from my board. The current buffeted my body and I feared to open my eyes. I had to, though, to orientate myself. Lungs beginning to protest, I scoured the darkness for the surface, but all I could see were two lighter spots in the red. Dual glowing pink patches above. I kicked viciously towards them, while black spots flashed in my peripheral vision. The pink patches grew, and grew, and grew, until I saw them more clearly. On the verge of unconsciousness, I burst through the surface of the blood ocean. Eyes. Not pink patches, but bloodshot eyes. I looked into them now, not six inches away. They belonged to a pale man wearing a white shirt. His hair was black and oily, styled to frame a narrow, serious face.

“What happened? Where-” I said.

The man cleared his throat, wiped at the corner of his mouth, and backed off. “Just doing your observations. You were sleeping.”

His voice was soft, but not gentle by any means. He consulted his clipboard. 

“Any pain?” He asked.

“My neck…”

I touched the fleshy part of my neck, due south of my right ear, and the tips of my fingers came away bloody.

“Pardon?”

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Your doctor. Your surgeon, to be exact. Given that question, I assume you don’t remember?”

“No, everything was so hazy.”

“Good. That means the anaesthetist did their job correctly because you were quite engaged and cooperative during the procedure. Of that, I can assure you.”

“Was I?”

The man, still ticking boxes on his clipboard, chuckled. His laugh sounded like the rattle of a spider-bitten insect caught in a web. He ran his tongue over both sets of teeth. 

“Oh yes.” He said.

I prodded my neck again and found the flesh swelling into a pronounced bump. 

“My neck hurts. I think I’ve been bitten.”

The doctor’s eyes flicked up at me. “Odd. Your neck wasn’t involved in the procedure, and I can say with confidence that this is a sterile environment. Regardless, I can have the nurse bring you additional painkillers. Good night.”

He ghosted out of the gloomy ward, his silhouette tall and imposing. The room was a comfortable temperature, but I felt cold.

“Poison and lies. Lies.” John groaned from his bed. 

I can’t understand why my neck hurts so much. Any ideas?
