The title is strange, I know, but it's nothing short of the truth. 

To explain the whole story, I need to back up to last Christmas. It was about mid December when my grandmother "memaw" and I went to visit a family member in the nursing home. We had stepped out of their room so other visitors could go in when my memaw handed me an envelope. 

This is nothing out of the ordinary as she often likes to show me the sweet cards and letters she gets. I pulled out a card from the already opened ivory envelope. It was a beautiful Christmas card that displayed a small cabin in a snowy setting lit up by multicolored lights. I smiled as I opened it. It had your standard "Merry Christmas" greeting printed inside of it. Underneath that though was a handwritten message in cursive: 

"Lost out in the woods, no God to hear. He was too busy processing slabs of meat. 

Signed, 
Dogmeat" 

I felt my smile twist into visible confusion as I looked at my memaw. "What is this?!" I asked or more so demanded.

"I don't know. There is no return address but I received that in the mail today." I looked again at the envelope and saw my memaw's full name and address scribbled across it in the same cursive writing. 

"It has to be some sort of prank." I said as I stuffed the now tainted-feeling card back in the envelope and handed it her. 

"That's what I thought too, until I saw the letter your dad received." 

My dad had apparently received a letter from Dogmeat about a week prior to my memaw receiving this card. He kept it but told no one until my memaw had showed him this strange card earlier.

The next day, I went to visit my parents and wasted no time asking about the letter. My dad brought out a larger white envelope that, again, had no return address but had my dad's full name and address scribbled on it in that cursive writing that is now burned into my brain.

I pulled out a folded up piece of paper that this time had a longer message typed on it. It read:

" Help! Help! I cried.
Shut up and take the pill! Said the doctor.
Help! Help! I cried.
Shut up and take the pill! Said the nurse.
They stared at me. Pill in hand.

Help! Help! I cry. 
The pill goes down my throat. 

Signed,
Dogmeat"

I could feel tension in my head as I stared at the letter. "Who is doing this?!" I almost yelled. 

"I thought it was Mike at first." My dad said. I immediately thought of our hateful neighbor we had had many sour experiences with. My dad and him had exchanged words a while back after he was caught on our property.
"I bet it is that creepy old man!" I said as I again stuffed another weird message from Dogmeat into an envelope and sat it on the kitchen table. 

"Mike isn't here anymore. Moved about a month ago to Chicago with his son. I reached out to Greg (Mike's son) and he said his dad isn't doing well. They have called hospice in. I don't think it's him at this point." My dad said sounding sure of himself.

"We are not the only ones getting these either. Anita received one this week as well." He went on. 

Anita is my great aunt that lives a few towns away from us. Mike did not know her as far as I knew. 

"What did hers say?" I asked.

"I'm not entirely sure. She said it mentioned processing meat and something about a hospital. It too was signed Dogmeat." He said flatly. 

We discussed this repeatedly for days after this. We turned up with no answers and eventually it was a very weird occurrence that faded away as we didn't receive anymore creepy mailings from Dogmeat. 

Until today. 

I pulled up to my house after a long shift at work and got out of my car. I marched back up my driveway to check my mail as I have been expecting an important package to arrive any day. 

I pulled out several envelopes and was disheartened to find no package. I disappointedly scanned through what mail we did receive. Electric bill, bank statement, junk mail, junk mail and then I felt my body freeze as my eyes landed on my full name and address scribbled across a white envelope in all too familiar cursive with no return address. 

"No way!" I said out loud. 

I quickly tucked the other now very insignificant mail under my arm and tore open the envelope and pulled out a piece of folded notebook paper. My eyes quickly darted over the cursive words after nearly ripping the paper opening it up so fast: 

"The grass is green. The mailbox is red at the road. The meat is rotting. It's time to process.

Signed,
Dogmeat"

My blood ran ice cold. Could it be a coincidence that my mailbox is red and is placed by the road? 

It's been hours since I opened that blasted letter. I cannot sleep. What does it mean that "the meat is rotting and it's time to process"? 

I have told no one about this letter. Not even my husband. I'm sure I will eventually but I feel like talking about it somehow makes this situation more dangerous. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel Dogmeat is a real threat. 

I want to believe it's someone resuming a cruel prank but in my stomach I feel that this a person with very malicious intent. 

It's worth mentioning Mike did pass away shortly after Christmas last year. 

Will I get another letter? If not me, then who in my family is next?

These are questions that plague me to my core. I dread checking my red mailbox tomorrow.
