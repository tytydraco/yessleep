When I was young, every summer vacation, my parents would take me to visit my grandfather at his old house. The house was located deep in the countryside, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. It was a two-story wooden house surrounded by a large garden and towering trees. The atmosphere was calm and serene, but something about it always gave me a sense of unease.

 

Grandfather had a set of strange rules that I had to follow when staying in the house. These rules were written on an old piece of paper kept in a framed picture on the wall in the living room. He said these rules were established for everyone’s safety.

 

The rules were as follows:

 

1. Do not leave your bedroom after midnight.

2. Do not open the basement door.

3. Do not look out the windows after midnight.

4. Do not talk to anyone who isn’t invited into the house.

5. Do not enter the storage room in the attic.

 

At first, I thought these rules were just meant to scare me into behaving, but as time went on, I began to notice strange things happening in the house.

 

 

 

Do not leave your bedroom after midnight.

 

One night, after midnight, I heard faint whispers coming from the hallway outside my bedroom. I tried to ignore them and follow the rule, but curiosity got the better of me, and I opened the door to look. What I saw made my skin crawl. A shadowy figure stood at the end of the hallway, staring at me. I quickly shut the door and retreated to my bed, my heart pounding in my chest.

 

The next night, I heard the whispers again, but this time they were clearer. “Help me... Someone, please help me...” I stood by my bedroom door, listening to the whispers that seemed to come from all directions. Fear gripped me, and I quickly locked the door, determined not to open it again.

 

 

Do not open the basement door.

 

One day, I decided to open the forbidden basement door. I descended the stairs into the darkness, feeling a chill seep into my bones. When I turned on the light in the basement, I saw old photographs of my grandfather's family. One picture shocked me—it was a photograph of my grandfather standing next to someone who looked exactly like me, but it couldn’t be possible because I wasn’t born yet.

 

While exploring the basement, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned around, but there was only darkness. Then a cold voice whispered, “Remember the rules...” I hurried back up the stairs and closed the basement door tightly.

 

 

Do not look out the windows after midnight.

 

One night of my summer stay at grandfather’s house, I heard a knocking at my window. I woke up and looked outside, forgetting the rule about not looking out after midnight. What I saw made me nearly collapse—a man who looked exactly like the one in the photograph stood outside the window, staring at me with a chilling smile.

 

I quickly shut the curtains and returned to my bed, my heart racing. I tried to sleep, but the knocking continued. I attempted to ignore it, but eventually, I couldn’t stand it anymore. I opened the window again, and this time the man was gone, but muddy footprints were left on the windowsill.

 

 

Do not talk to anyone who isn’t invited into the house.

 

One morning, while I was playing in the garden, I saw a strange man walking towards the house. He looked at me and asked if my grandfather was home. I felt uneasy about him, but before I could respond, my grandfather came out and told the man to leave immediately. Grandfather then told me, “Never talk to anyone who isn’t invited into the house,” and wouldn’t let me ask any further questions.

 

But the man didn’t leave easily. He stood there, staring at me, and said in a chilling voice, “You should heed my warning...” I felt a cold shiver run down my spine and quickly ran back into the house without looking back.

 

 

Do not enter the storage room in the attic.

 

Finally, I decided to go up to the attic, the place my grandfather had forbidden me to enter. I opened the door to the storage room and found old items and collections that looked eerie. I found an old doll with a pale face and eyes that seemed to follow me wherever I went.

 

As I explored the room, I heard a faint whisper, “Don’t... don’t go into this room...” I turned around and saw a shadowy figure standing at the door. It watched me and said, “You shouldn’t break the rules...” I quickly put the doll down and fled the room in terror.

 

 

After breaking every rule, I started to feel that something in the house had changed. The whispers and shadowy figures appeared more frequently, and my sense of fear grew stronger each day.

 

On the last night before returning home, I woke up in a panic and found myself passed out in the living room. I thought it was just a nightmare, but when I got home, every night thereafter, I heard strange whispers in my own house. “Help me... Someone, please help me...” The voices grew louder each night until I began to feel constantly terrified.

 

I realized that my grandfather’s rules weren’t just meant to scare me—they were to protect us from something terrifying that still lived in that house. And even though I was far away from my grandfather’s house now, the fear still haunted me.

 

Whenever I went back to visit my grandfather, I followed the rules strictly, knowing that something horrifying was lurking in that house, waiting for another chance to come after me again.
