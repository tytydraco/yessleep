I’m writing this from a shitty hostel in Bali, the kind with peeling paint and a fan that rattles like it’s mocking me. My hands are shaking—not from the cheap vodka, but from the realization that I’m not as free as I thought. I don’t know how long I’ve got before she finds me. Or it finds me. I need to get this out, because if I disappear, someone has to know what she did—what they did.

Call me Miles. I was married to Vivian Laurent, the billionaire empress of Laurent Parfums, a global perfume dynasty that smells like roses and bleeds money. She’s 48, all sharp cheekbones and sharper eyes, the kind of woman who walks into a room and makes it hold its breath. I was 32 when we met—her marketing VP, a smooth-talking nobody she plucked from the ranks because I could sell her scents like they were sex in a bottle. And yeah, we fucked like it too—hot, messy, her pinning me against her office desk while she whispered how I’d never leave her shadow. I didn’t mind at first. The penthouses, the Ferraris, the way she’d trail her nails down my chest while signing deals worth millions—it was a drug.

But Vivian didn’t just want a husband. She wanted a possession. My suits? Her tailor. My ideas? Her brand. My life? Hers to orchestrate. She’d parade me at galas, her golden boy, while behind closed doors she’d dissect me—every word, every glance, every fucking breath. “You’re mine, Miles,” she’d say, her voice like velvet over a blade. I started drowning in her—her control, her wealth, her paranoia. She had enemies—rival CEOs, jilted lovers, journalists—and she saw threats in me too. I’d catch her watching me sleep, her perfume lingering like a noose.

I met Emily at a dive bar—a 24-year-old bartender with chipped nails and a smile that didn’t demand my soul. She smelled like spilled beer and freedom. We fucked in her cramped apartment, and I told her half-truths: Vivian was suffocating me, maybe dangerous. Emily believed it, her eyes wide with pity. I didn’t love her—not really—but she was my ticket out. Divorce was a death sentence—Vivian’s prenup was ironclad, her lawyers sharks. She’d ruin me, smear me, leave me with nothing. So I hatched a plan: I’d die.

No drugs, no sci-fi bullshit—just a clean, brutal exit. I’d been siphoning cash for months, funneling it through shell accounts tied to fake ad campaigns. Vivian’s empire was too vast for her to notice a few million missing—she trusted me to sell her lies, not steal them. The plan was simple: stage a drowning, vanish with Emily, live free on some beach where her scent couldn’t reach me. I picked a stormy weekend at her Hamptons estate. Told her I needed air, walked to the cliffs alone. The wind howled, waves crashed—perfect. I tossed my jacket into the sea, left my phone pinging on the rocks, and slipped away to a rented car where Emily waited. By morning, we were on a flight to Thailand under fake names—James and Claire. The news screamed: “Miles Ravenscroft, Husband of Perfume Mogul, Presumed Dead in Tragic Accident.” Vivian played the widow, all black lace and crocodile tears.

I thought I’d won. Bali was paradise—Emily’s tan legs tangled in mine, the ocean erasing Vivian’s grip. I’d check the headlines sometimes, smirking at her grief-stricken interviews. “He was my everything.” Bullshit. She was just pissed I’d slipped her leash. For two months, I was alive—really alive—until the package came.

No return address. Inside: a photo of me and Emily, laughing on a Bali beach, snapped days ago. My stomach turned to ice. On the back, in Vivian’s elegant scrawl: “You can’t outrun my scent.” Then a second photo—a girl, maybe 18, pale and stunning, washed ashore somewhere, eyes vacant. Caption: “Her name is Lila. She knows you.” I didn’t get it at first. Then the pieces clicked, and the terror sank in.

Vivian didn’t just mourn me—she hunted me. Years ago, she’d found that girl—Lila—half-dead on a beach, a runaway or trafficking victim, no ID, no past. The story was hushed up, but Vivian, with her billions and her twisted savior complex, took her in. Not out of kindness—Vivian doesn’t do kind. She saw a blank slate, a project. She didn’t fix Lila with surgery or tech—that’s too Hollywood. She trained her. Raised her in secret, off the grid, molding her into a weapon. Lila’s not a daughter—she’s a hound. Vivian taught her everything: how to track, how to charm, how to kill if she has to. And now, Lila’s after me.

Emily’s a wreck. She found a third photo yesterday—her, alone, walking to the market, circled in red with “Loose End” written in lipstick. We’ve been jumping hostels, but it’s useless. Vivian’s too rich, too connected. She doesn’t need drugs or gadgets—she has people. Private investigators, ex-military, hackers who can trace a fake passport like it’s a grocery list. She knew I was alive the whole time—probably let me run so she could savor the chase. The siphoned money? She’s frozen the accounts, left us scrambling with what’s in our bags. Emily’s sobbing, begging to go home, but I know Vivian’s waiting there too.

Last night, I saw her—Lila. Across the street, under a flickering lamp, just standing there. Long dark hair, pale skin, eyes like a predator’s. She didn’t move, didn’t blink—just watched. I grabbed Emily, bolted, but when I looked back, she was gone. Then the note came, slipped under our door: “You drowned in my world once. I’ll make sure you stay under this time.” Vivian’s words, but Lila’s handwriting—neat, girlish, fucking terrifying.
I’m not a monster. I just wanted out—out of her empire, her bed, her claws. But Vivian? She’s a queen who doesn’t lose. She built Laurent Parfums from nothing—crushed rivals, seduced investors, turned fragrance into a billion-dollar cage. And Lila’s her shadow, her creation—a girl with no past, raised to hunt me down. I don’t know what’s worse: that Vivian’s coming for me, or that Lila might get there first. Maybe she’ll slit my throat. Maybe she’ll smile while she does it. Maybe she’ll drag me back to Vivian alive, just so her empress can watch me beg.

I’m trapped. Emily’s a liability—Vivian knows it, Lila knows it. I could ditch her, run solo, but where? Vivian’s scent is everywhere—her perfumes in every store, her eyes in every stranger. If I stop posting, you’ll know they got me. If you smell something floral and see a girl with no yesterday, run. She’s not human anymore—she’s Vivian’s ghost, and I’m her prey.
