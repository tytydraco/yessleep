Me and my friends had a sleepover at my house a few years back, it was relatively normal. We had snacks, watched movies, played bloody mary, the usual girl's slumber party stuff. Then, we decided to play some boardgames, one of my friends were rumaging through my family's wide assortment of games until she found a Quija board. She picked it up quickly, not realizing my old, beaten up Furby had fallen out along with the board

Skip a few minutes into the `game`. We decided to go to bed cause it was getting late, we put away the Quija board really recklessly without saying Goodbye. We thought nothing of it cause we thought it was just a silly little joke. Now, let me give you a description of my old Furby for future reference; she had pink fur that had cranberry juice spilled all over it cause I was a chaotic child, her eyes were usually a light pale lavender. Her name wes Hazelnut, remember this cause this'll be important later

2:45 am, all 5 of my friends and me are woken up by feral, almost demonic, screeching. We all looked tk where the sound was coming from and see my Furby. She was screeching;
"RABECCA WANTS OUTTTTTTT" over and over and over again and as soon as I heard what she was wailing, my face went pale. A friend of mine notices this and said
"What's wrong? It's only a stupid little Furby, those things power on in the middle of the night all the time" I turn to my fried
"My Furby's name isn't Rabecca, her name is Hazelnut. Plus, her batteries have been removed when I was 8..." I reply. We all went silent
"RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU" my Furby switched from a feral demon voice to that of a vengeful sounding little girl. If I had to guess, she sounded about the age of 6 or 7

We all sprinted to my parents room. We barged in unannounced, waking my parents
"WHAT THE HELL, [Insert my name]!?" My dad yelled
"DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAZELNUT" I screamed
"Hazelnut? Your old Furby that powered down 8 years ago!?" My mom shouted angrily. Just then, we heard something in the hallway. We all turned to the hallway to see that Hazelnut, or Rabecca, had rolled into the hall looking straight at us. She opened her beak slowly and screeched loud enough for the neighbors to hear
"WHAT THE HELL!?" My dad screamed as he covered his ears "ALRIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE"

My parents dragged us to the front door, Rabecca still screeching. We open the front door to be blinded by poloce sirens and headlights, my Furby had been so loud that we couldn't hear the police sirens outside the door
"FREEZE" A police officer yelled
"Why!?" My mom asked
"We've been called here by your neighbors due to the excessive and agonizing screams. We have reason to believe there is someone in the house who is there against their will" another officer yelled "we need to check the property. C'mon, go back inside. There ain't enough of us here to gaurd all eight of you"

We followed the officers back into the house, Rebecca still screaming
"It's upstairs, sir" one of my friends points to the stairs
"Hm, we're only going up there cause the screaming seems to be coming from up there. This better not be a diversion" the cop said, not turning to face us. All the cops went upstairs to find the screaming Furby covered in juice, and a Quija board lying vacant next to her. The cop goes over to stop the screeching but me and all my friends stop him
"Stop, that'll probably just make her angrier" I stare at the Furby

Me and my friends sat at the Quija board while the cops and my parents watched
"Who are you!?" One of my friends ask over the screaming while we put two fingers each on the clove peice. The peice started moving
"Alright, cops, write this down. R-a-b-e-c-c-a J-u-s-t-i-n-s" my friend announces. As soon as the name is spelt, the Furby stops screeching. It opened it's eyes and we saw that her once pale lavender eyes were now a complete black. Even the white parts of the eyes
"Holy shit" my father mutters
"Why are you haunting us!?" I ask. Then, my Furby makes a clear sound of annoyance
"Y-o-u  a-n-d  y-o-u-r  l-i-t-t-l-e  f-r-i-e-n-d-s  d-i-s-r-e-p-e-c-t-e-d  m-e" my friend spells as the cop writes it down
"We're sorry" another one of my friends say
"S-o-r-r-y  c-a-n-t  c-h-a-n-g-e  t-h-e  p-a-s-t" I spell out

Fast forward a few years later, I still hold the haunted Furby in my possesion. I don't know why the police didn't take it away but I still have it. Now, I have to tue it down, point a cross at it and recite bible verses at it if I want a peaceful night. If I don't excercise it, then it will scream all night long. I learned that the hard way
