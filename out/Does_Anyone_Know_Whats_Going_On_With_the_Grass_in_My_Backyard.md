Hey everyone, I’ve got an issue with the backyard of my new house, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. I thought this might be the right place to share, especially since I’ve never seen anything like it before and it’s kinda starting to freak me out. I’m hoping someone here might have some insight or at least help me feel a little less crazy.

So a little bit of background: I bought this house about a year ago. It’s an old place with lots of character, built in the 1920s, with a decent-sized backyard. Shortly after moving in I noticed that the houses on either side me both had beautiful lawns and mine was mostly dirt and weeds. Now, I’m not a lawn care expert or anything, but the “domination line” (as Reddit seems to calls it) on either side of my lot was making me a little self-conscious, so I’ve been trying to keep it up. Bought some Scotts grass seed and starter fertilizer, hit the weeds with RoundUp, and planted a bunch of grass last fall.

By this spring, everything had filled in nicely. (Not nearly as nice as my neighbors manicured plots, but much less embarrassing). Ever since the grass started filling in, though, I’ve noticed these two parallel strips of dead grass that run from the back porch all the way to the back edge of the property. They seem like they're around 3 feet apart, perfectly straight, and no matter what I do, I can’t get anything to grow there. The rest of the lawn looks fine, but those two lines just stay sickly, thin and brown.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. I figured it was just some old garden bed or maybe a path that had been overgrown, but it was weird how the rest of the lawn bounced back in the spring except for those two strips. It’s like they’re immune to anything I try—fertilizer, watering, even reseeding. Nothing works. When I finally broke down and asked my neighbor his opinion, he shrugged and said there might be something under the ground there that’s preventing the grass from taking properly, and that my hypothesis of an old paver path or something was probably right.

A few weeks ago, curiosity got the best of me. I decided to dig down a bit and see if I could figure out what was going on underneath causing the issue. I grabbed a shovel and started digging.

Not even six inches down, I hit something hard. It wasn’t a rock—it had a metallic sound when the shovel struck it. It was at this point I realized I was being a bit of an idiot, as for all I knew it could be a gas line or sump outlet or something, and the last thing I needed was to blow up the neighborhood by stupidly digging in my yard on a whim. I called 811 and got them to mark all the utility lines in my yard. Surprise surprise, no gas, cable, sewer, or internet lines ran through the strips of dead grass, so I got back to digging.

After I’d excavated a slightly wider area, reluctantly tearing up the new grass I’d worked so hard to cultivate, I cleared away the dirt, and that’s when I saw it: a rusted iron rail, like a piece of an old train track. Confused, I kept digging along the strip, and sure enough, there was another rail about three feet away, running parallel to the first.

I stood there for a long time, just staring at these rails buried in my yard. It didn’t make any sense. First of all, it’s not like I’m in a rural area, my house is in the middle of a pretty developed suburb that’s been around over a hundred years. 

I even googled some old maps of the area, and I can’t find anything about train tracks ever being here. What’s weirder is that the tracks run straight below the back porch and under my house, but don’t seem to continue to the front yard, as the grass grows just fine there.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Why would there be train tracks buried in my backyard? I wasn’t able to fall asleep so I stayed up looking up old city plans, Googling “\[MY TOWN\] railroad” “\[MY TOWN\] train tracks” and other similar terms, but with no helpful results. Finally, I decided that I dig a little more the next day to see if I could figure out how far they went and what purpose they were there for. With a plan in mind, I was finally able to fall asleep.

The next morning, I started digging again, following the tracks toward the edge of my property. As I dug deeper, I uncovered old wooden ties, the kind you see on old railroads, but they were rotted and splintered, barely holding together, and many were missing entirely. The tracks themselves were rusted and pitted with age, like they’d been there for decades—probably over a century.

I dug up both rails all the from my back porch to the back edge of my property where they disappeared under the wooden privacy fence and into the woods that the houses on my block back up against. Now the woods behind my property are incredible overgrown and not really managed at all (and the ground under the trees is full of poison ivy), so I decided rather than go out into the woods unprepared, I’d do a bit more research first. 

I realized I’d missed a great resource to get answers from: railroad enthusiast forums. If anyone would be able to help me figure out more about these tracks, it would be people who have spent their lives obsessed with this sort of thing. Who knows, maybe they’d have access to documentation or resources that I didn’t.

I created an account on the first railroad forum I found, and started a thread where I uploaded some pictures of the tracks in my yard asking for help from anyone who had any idea what they could be for. I’ve posted the thread transcript below:

Hey everyone, my house (built in the 20s) seems to have abandoned railroad tracks leading from house straight through my backyard and into the woods. Any idea what they could be for/from? I’ve checked a bunch of online resources and it doesn’t seem like there’s ever been a rail line running through my area. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

Wow, that’s super cool. Wish I had your house! Lol, not sure what the tracks are for though, that’s certainly weird. Maybe an old abandoned branch line or used for rolling stock storage?

BNSFBoss – That would be very unlikely, any branch lines or yards should be marked on rail maps if they were operating. HelpPlease123, those tracks are super neat, thanks for sharing the pics! without specific info on where you’re at (which I’m not saying you should give us) this is gonna be hard to diagnose.

Fair enough. If they were old enough though it’s possible that they were already in disuse by the time whatever documents OP was looking at were drawn up.

HelpPlease123 can you measure the distance between the rails? They look like narrow gauge to me and if so they might not appear on any main rail line maps you’ve been looking at.

Frankie76 I just went out and measuered them (see attached pic). Looks like they’re just under 36 inches apart, does that help?

>***Frankie76***

***Conductor***  
Yeah, looks like either 3ft gauge or 900mm (but I assume you’re in the US so probably the former). Significantly smaller than standard gauge, maybe related to mining? Is there mining in your area?

Frankie76 Not that I know of…. I’m in \[TOWN NAME\] if that’s not gonna doxx me.

>After some cursory research I’m not seeing any former mining operations in your area, but again, once you start talking private industry 100+ years ago, just cuz I can’t find records on it doesn’t mean it didn’t exist. Don’t wake them.

Yeah my guess is either old street trolley or private mining operation. HelpPlease123 if the tracks disappear into a hole in the ground you’ve got your answer! Lol



What theoiljournal said gave me an idea. What if the reason the tracks didn’t extend to the front yard wasn’t because they ended, but because they wen’t deeper underground in some old mine tunnel or something? My house doesn’t have a basement, just an unfinished crawlspace. I’d only been down their once for like 30 seconds when the home inspector was checking for water intrusion before I bought the house, but half-buried rails would’ve been easy to overlook in the dark.

I grabbed a flashlight and a dust mask and opened the trapdoor to the crawlspace located in my kitchen pantry. I shone my light down the dark cobweb-filled four-foot drop into the packed dirt below. I felt a wave of discomfort, like my reptile brain telling me that what I was about to do was was a very, very bad idea. I briefly debated covering the crawlspace back up and trying to forget the whole thing before the rest of my brain took over with the thought of “what if there’s an old gold mine under your house?”.

I grabbed the edges of the whole, and slowly slid down.

My feet hit the bottom and I crouched down on my hands and knees in the cramped darkness so I could fit under the floor joists of my house. I could feel the slight sticky threadlike resistence of a hundred years’ worth of cobwebs clinging to my arms and hair and crawled deeper into the darkness, sweeping my flashlight back and forth across the dirt-covered ground, it’s beam barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. 

The air felt thick and warm, and a claustrophobic urgency started to rise up inside me and make breathing difficult in the damp mask over my nose and mouth. I took a second to orient myself and slow my breathing, trying to figure out where I was in relation to by back porch. Then I saw a glint on the floor about ten feet away from me in the beam of the flashlight. I started slowly making my way over to it, trying not to panic as the small square of light from the opening to the kitchen grew more and more distant. 

That was when I heard it.

“Hello?”

I froze mid-crawl, every hair standing on end. I couldn’t be sure of what I’d heard past the sound of my shuffling crawling, but I could have sworn that I’d heard a halting, whispered voice coming from the darkness in front of me. I wanted to shine my light around the space in front of me to calm my racing mind, but in that moment it felt like if I moved I’d be somehow giving myself away. I took a deep breath and told myself I was letting the darkness get the better of me, so I carefully aimed my flashlight at the darkness ahead and swept it back and forth.

“Ding!”

A push notification on my phone nearly made my soul leave my body. I felt around in my pocket and double clicked the volume down button to silence future notifications and tried to will my heart to slow down.

I saw the slowly sloping far wall of the crawl space, old wooden beams supporting the house, and the glint along the floor that I could now see was indeed the tracks continuing under my house from outside. No monsters, no ghost children, just an empty, dusty crawlspace. My heart still racing, I slowly crawled over to the tracks to see where they led.

I followed the tracks through the crawlspace for 15-20 ft until they suddenly seemed to disappear. Not end, but simply fade down into the ground. It took my brain a moment to register what I was seeing. They were sloping downwards until they disappeared into the ground. I got briefly frustrated at what seemed like a dead end, until I noticed it. The ground where the tracks disappeared looked different than the ground in the rest of the crawl space. It wasn’t just old packed dirt, it was hard and rough. After feeling it for a second I realized it was some sort of hardened plaster covering a roughly 5 ft wide patch of ground that extended to the top of the sloping crawlspace wall 8-10 feet in front of it.

With growing excitement I reached out and with the butt of my flashlight lightly tapped the plaster. Small pieces chipped and crumbled off as I tapped harder and harder. Suddenly with a sharp crunching sound, the flashlight punched a hole through the plaster into empty space beneath it. A small burst of cold air whistled up through the gap and into my face. It smelled like mold and burnt popcorn. 

I was elated. I’d found it! The entrance to a mine! I was already imagining all the forgotten gold ore that was surely striping the walls of the tunnel behind the plaster that would solve all my problems and make me rich when saw a small plank of wood seemingly embedded into the plaster. I shined my flashlight at it and could just barely make out some letters faintly carved into the plank. I had to tilt my flashlight to cast shadows into the recessed lettering so I could read it. 

What I saw made my blood run cold.

***They are sleeping***

“They are sleeping”? What did it mean? Who are sleeping, where? With rising unease, I tried to shine the flashlight through the small gap I’d created when heard it again, seemingly coming from the hidden darkness behind the hole.

“Hel-lo?”

It was so faint I could almost have convinced myself I didn’t hear it. It sounded dry, fragile and stilted, two very separate syllables. I nearly screamed, jerking my head up and hitting it on the low ceiling. In my panic, I let go of my flashlight, dropping it through the hole in the plaster and into the space beyond. Just like that, I was in pitch darkness.

I panicked. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and rot, and every breath felt like I was sucking in dirt. My heart was racing, my skin slick with cold sweat, and the weight of the earth above me felt like it was crushing me, suffocating me. 

I scrambled backwards, cutting my arms on the rough wooden support beams around me as I frantically scrambled to find the light of the kitchen trapdoor. My throat tightened, and I could feel the panic rising, as the darkness seemed to close in, swallowing me whole. I clawed at the dirt, desperate to back out, but my limbs felt heavy, unresponsive, like I was sinking into the ground itself, and I felt an innate sense deep down that if I didn’t get out now, I never would.

Finally I saw the square of light a few feet over my shoulder and I turned around to face it, crawling frantically. I heard skittering noises across the dirt floor behind me. Was it from my feet kicking up loose rocks and debris, or was something coming for me from the darkness? I willed myself forward and heaved myself up through the trapdoor, sliding it back into place and pulling a shelf’s worth of soup cans down on top of it as though it would keep whatever I’d heard down there from breaking through.

I ripped off my dust mask and crawled backwards out of the pantry, gasping and shaking.

It’s been several hours since I went down into the crawlspace (I’m writing this all from a coffee shop in town to clear my head). I don’t know what’s going on, or what I’m going to do next. Sell my house? Call the police? I don’t know, any advice would be appreciated. I don’t feel safe in my own home, but that’s just me being paranoid right? 

Maybe what I heard really was all my imagination, that’s possible, isn’t it? I can’t just pass up the opportunity to explore a secret mine tunnel under my house, can I? As scared as I am, I feel like I’m being drawn back the house, to the crawlspace, like I can’t leave without t knowing more.

Whatever’s going on, I have a feeling it’s far from over...
