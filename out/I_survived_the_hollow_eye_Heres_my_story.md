They say my village was cursed. I don't know how much time has passed. Days blur in the dark, but the memory... it won’t fade. If you're reading this, don't go near the Dragonfly Pond. Don't even look at it.

I was born in a quiet place, a village nestled between gardens and rivers. My parents adored me. I had no siblings, but I never felt alone—until I started hearing the whispers.

It began in our basement. I was around ten. Faint at first, just a brushing of sound against the silence. But at night, when I tried to sleep, I could hear words. Something calling. I told my parents. They smiled, checked my room, and said I was dreaming.

But it kept happening. Louder. Closer.

I didn’t sleep. At school, I was dead-eyed. My teachers noticed. But I kept it in. I didn't want to scare my parents again.

Then one day... I heard the voice at school. Something broke inside me. I remember screaming, shaking, shouting something about the basement. I ran straight through a window and fell.

They said I was mentally unwell. Traumatized. But the basement was real. And so was what lived there.

Weeks later, construction workers uncovered a stone tablet near the village well. Black, jagged, and ancient. No one knew what language it was in, but somehow, everyone understood it.

> “O you who awaken the Hollow Eye—the ancient mouth of agony—your land shall scream. Children shall be born from silence. And when a child weeps without tears, a bolt shall fall. Only the first to read these words aloud shall be spared.”



Some fool laughed and read it out loud.

That night, a six-year-old girl gave birth.

There was no father. No explanation. Just pain, panic, and silence. The baby never cried. It opened its mouth, and a bolt of lightning struck a nearby house, killing three.

It was only the beginning.


---

More children were born. No one knew how. They didn’t cry. They stared with hollow sockets. Their legs bent backward. They grew rapidly, and soon they had hooves instead of feet. Horns. Their bodies twisted into centaur-like abominations.

Then the elders changed. Old men we trusted—scholars, priests, teachers—were found praying in corners, carving runes into their skin. Their flesh thickened. Their eyes swelled. They stopped aging. They began creating things in secret.

They called them their “children.” Horrid creatures that hissed like rusted metal and clung to walls.

Some villagers, we called them the Tartarus Men, were cursed differently. Every ten seconds, their bones would twist—crack and bend—then reset. Over and over. Their mouths were sewn shut by something not human. Their pain was never-ending.

We couldn’t kill them. We tried.


---

The Hollowborn—those tearless infants turned monsters—and the cursed old men began the slaughter. Paths warped. Time bent. You could run through your front door and end up in the basement.

People turned on each other. Some begged the gods. Some went silent. Most died.

Only a handful of us survived: me, the girl (now a woman though only a year passed), the man who read the tablet, and a few villagers. We hid in the caves.

Food came every day—forced into our mouths by stone-like tendrils. We couldn’t starve. We couldn’t die. We were kept alive to watch.


---

Then one night, she said we had to go to the Dragonfly Pond. Beneath it was the Eye’s heart.

We found stairs beneath the water, leading to a labyrinth. A place where screams echoed before they were made. Traps didn’t just kill—they erased.

One by one, the others died.

In the end, it was just me and her. And then—nothing.

Until the laughter started.

The Hollowborn waited for us. The cursed men stood behind them. The girl turned to me, and I saw it in her eyes—she wasn’t surprised.

I tried to kill her.

She was faster.

I remember her saying: "I’ve done what was asked. I offer myself."

And then it appeared. The Hollow Eye. A god that wasn’t a god. A blinking void in the ceiling of the world.

It said:

> “Be my pupil. Be my center. The Eye must see from within.”



Her body unraveled. Her voice fractured into whispers.

She became part of it.


---

I woke up in the village. Alone. Everyone gone. The eye still watching from the shadows of puddles, tree bark, clouds.

They think I’m alive. They think I’m free.

But I know it’s watching. And I know it’s still hungry.

If you hear whispers in the dark—don’t listen. And whatever you do…

Don’t read the tablet.
