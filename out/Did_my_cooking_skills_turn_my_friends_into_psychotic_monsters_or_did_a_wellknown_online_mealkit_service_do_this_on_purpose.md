First of all, I am pretty sure superpowers are not a symptom of food poisoning. 

These are the indicators according to the CDC website. And below them are the symptoms my friends have experienced:

Diarrhea

Stomach pain or cramps

Nausea

Vomiting

Fever

Levitating (?)

Moving things with your mind (?)

Setting things on fire (?)

Death/Rebirth into something I cannot wrap my head around (?)


All in that order depending on the severity of the side-effects.

Yes, I am serious. I’m currently writing to you in an odd situation, so typos will exist. I’m not in the current position to edit, I just want to get all of this down before either my phone dies or I mysteriously disappear. 

I have limited time so I’m just going to get into it. I am twenty three years old. I’m a student living in the city, and I can’t cook. 

I’ve never been able to cook, and I didn’t really care until my work colleagues pointed it out. I’ve been happy living on cup ramen and hot pockets. Not exactly healthy, but it’s quick and easy. Better than takeout, I guess. Anyway, knowing I am a shit cook, I figured I should do something about it before 2023. I don’t want to start a new year still being inept at a basic life skill. I watch a lot of Youtubers and podcasts—and all of them at some point have recommended the company Hello Fresh. 

Their commercials looked pretty good. I mean, the food looked easy to make and healthy. They made my mouth water. It was always some kind of chicken dripping in a white sauce, sprinkled with vegetables and light garnish. Seeing Hello Fresh ads made me hate my own crummy diet.

According to the website, as well as their influencer spokespeople, it was fresh food made easy. Which was perfect for me. I am not usually one for dinner parties or parties in general, but I guess you could say I wanted… guinea pigs to taste my cooking. I know that sounds shady, but it was innocent I swear. I just wanted people to taste my food and not make a face. I still had slight trauma from when I was fifteen and made my parents spaghetti. 

They didn’t even eat it, just sticking their noses up at it. Granted, I don’t think I’d cooked the meatballs through, and the onions weren’t supposed to be chunks. So, 9 years later, I was determined to make a good impression on my friends. They were less blunt than my parents. Instead of telling me how it was, my friends would smile politely and tell me at least I was trying. Which was good enough for me. I will say I didn’t initially want to experiment with them. The whole thing  started off as a date. I had been casually talking to a girl I liked for a while. Mina.

I met her in class, and friendship turned into something more. It was just flirting followed by real feelings which started to blossom. I asked her out a few weeks ago on the way to class, and I was so nervous I almost spewed coffee. Mina was that kind of girl. The type which got me nervous. 

Cute, but kind of pretentious. She gave off that vibe anyway. With her studying Canadian cinema, I guessed she was some kind of movie buff judging from her obsession with quoting like these super old timey movies and books. Once we started talking, however, I had quickly realised she was a total dork. Exactly the same as me. With the same sense of humor. 

Before the holidays, she asked if I wanted to go out for dinner—you know, like a fancy restaurant. But I had a better idea. (I mean, it seemed good at the time). I didn’t have the heart to tell her I was broke after spending way too much on Christmas presents. I knew a Starbucks salary wasn’t going to cut it, but my family are the type of people to silently judge if you give them something within a decent prize range (10-20 dollars)

So, I had an idea.

I would kill two birds with one stone. Get to know the girl I liked and test out my culinary skills with a Hello Fresh kit I had ordered. Though once it was delivered, I chickened out. I don’t know if it was first-date jitters or I was terrified of giving Mina food poisoning. So, I roped some of my colleagues into coming along. And thus, it became less of a date and more of an awkward dinner party. It was supposed to be a casual after-holidays dinner party. 

Even if we were still stuck in that weird purgatory gap between the 26th December and New Year’s day. Just friends (a potential girlfriend) and drinks. That is what it was supposed to be. Your average Gen Z get together where you talk shit and drink way too much, and then spend hours reminiscing and cringing at your younger years. I had known my colleagues for almost three years, and they were maybe my only two friends I fully talked to. 

Mainly because we shared mutual interests. We watched the same Streamers and podcasts, sharing the same stupid humor. Just like Mina. Except with Mina, I didn’t send her questionable memes at 4am.

I had meant to run through the recipe before my guests arrival, but being the great friends they were, my colleagues decided to head to my place two hours early. They said it was to help me set up and be so-called moral support, but I was pretty sure they were there to watch the fire. Literally and figuratively. I decided to make something easy-ish. I originally just chose chicken on its own with sauce but was told that was too boring—and apparently Mina would think I was an actual psychopath for serving her that. 

So, after scrolling through the website and overthinking every single recipe I saw, I finally decided on one. Crispy cheddar chicken, bacon mash potatoes, and asparagus.

Simple enough, right? I had meticulously read through the instructions. Hello Fresh actually sends you all the ingredients already weighed and accumulated. So, all you really have to do is put them all together and cook them. Mina had been excitedly texting me all day which was giving me at least some confidence. I really hoped she would turn up before my unhinged colleagues. 

No such luck. 

FairyTale Of New York was on the radio for the fourth time, when I was buzzing around my small apartment kitchen, already sweating through the dress I regretted putting on early. The chicken was already cooking, 

the asparagus was ready to be thrown in the pan, and I was staring at the little baggie of grated cheese poking from the Hello Fresh package about to fall off of the countertop, when my broken doorbell rang, which was just loud enough to hear if I cranked down the radio. Maisie, my three year old Tabby, hates noise. She hates humans. Tolerates other cats, and family members. But strangers were where she fully drew the line. Masie had met my colleagues twice. Both times she tried to scratch their eyes out when they tried picking her up.  I caught the fast-moving blur of her tail swiftly diving upstairs as I power walked to the door, wiping my clammy hands on the front of my dress. 

Yanking it open, I came face to face with Gabe, who was casually leaning against my door, the holiday decorations I had strung across my windows illuminating a sardonic smile already quirking on his lips. 

As usual, the two of them looked like they had just rolled out of bed. Which suited them. I don’t think they would ever pull off actual fancy outfits. Gabe was front and centre, while Charlie lurked behind him, his gaze glued to his phone. I noticed Gabe was still wearing his Starbucks apron under his jacket. Gabe and Charlie had been mistaken as twins multiple times. 

I could see it. They had fairly similar facial structures and dark brown hair, but while Gabe was an extroverted joker with a strong Boston accent, Charlie was a soft spoken Brit who we had to force into social situations.

Peering at me through thick strands of dark hair, Gabe cocked his head. A cigarette was curled between his lips. He took a drag, exhaling smoke in my face. “Good evening to the girl who can't make basic meals attempting to have a whole ass dinner party extravaganza."

I could tell from the slight snorts between the cigarette, he’d been waiting to say that line all day.

Instead of replying, I nodded to his odd clothing choice. “You’re still wearing your work uniform?”

He shrugged, his cheeks going a little pink. “I forgot to take it off.” Nudging Charlie, the guy took another drag. “Someone was rushing the last orders.”

Charlie shoved him back. “Behave.” He said, shooting me a smile. “Are you excited?”

“Terrified.” I admitted.

“Relax!” Gabe handed over a bright yellow bag,  grabbing my shoulders gently. “We're here so you don’t burn down your house.”

“Ignore him.” Charlie rolled his eyes, pocketing his phone. “We’re here to help. ” He nodded at me reassuringly. “Everything okay so far?”

My ideal scenario was to have the boys arrive last. Dinner would be ready by then, and they wouldn’t have to open their mouths. I could tell Gabe had foreseen this—and was determined for the exact opposite to happen. I don’t think he was trying to ruin the night, but definitely wanted to make sure things didn’t go squeaky clean. I was 100% sure he was ready to tell Mina my most embarrassing stories—and alcohol would induce that. It was too late to send them away. I had already told Mina they were tagging along. So, I was going to grin and bear it.

I took the gift with a smile. “Convenience store wine?”

Gabe winked. "The very best five dollar Vino we could find."

If we were at work behind the Starbucks counter, I would have hit him by now. But I was trying to stay calm and collected for Mina’s arrival. So, I took the wine with a gritted smile, knowing damn well I was going to make him pay for it once we started work again in the new year.

“Thank you.” I gestured inside. “Come on in!”

The two of them followed me inside. In true Charlie fashion he went to hunt down Maisie.

He was probably the only human besides me she could maybe tolerate if he didn’t overly stroke her. Gabe made himself useful, setting up the table. The two of us vibed to Christmas music. He still wasn’t taking off his apron. I was starting to think he liked wearing it. 

“So, who is this Mina girl?” Gabe set down four plates, side-stepping to a pop song. I was leaning against the counter, frowning at the Hello Fresh instructions. According to them, everything should have been going okay. Though I was worried about the asparagus. It hadn’t specified whether I needed to roast or boil them.

“She’s just someone I met in class,” I said, peering closer at the instructions. There was a weird side section at the back written in a language I couldn’t understand. I shot Gabe a look. “And you’re not going to embarrass me in front of her, okay? Don’t start talking about weird stuff.”

His lip quirked. “Weird stuff?

“Memes.” I said, folding my arms. “The pool-filling videos you make me watch. Those slime Tik-Toks you're obsessed with.”

Gabe scoffed. “You watch them too!”

“Yeah, but I don’t want Mina to know that!” Grabbing a fork, I pointed at him, prongs first. “Also. Don’t smoke in front of her.”

Gabe pulled a face, leaning across the table. “Have you ever considered that maybe Mina likes talking about all that stuff?” He straightened up. “Be honest.” My friend said, his gaze flicking to the food in the oven. Gabe folded his arms across his apron. “Is this going to kill me?”  

I handed him two glasses to put down. “You wanted to come.”  

The boy sent me a look. “You blackmailed me with cash.”

“Which you took.”

Charlie, who was sitting on the stairs playing with a wary Maisie, scoffed. “She paid you? I was threatened! With my life!”

Gabe was surprisingly helpful. He filled glasses and kept an eye on the food for me. “How old is she again?”

“Twenty five.” I muttered. “Which, compared to us, is basically a fully grown adult. So, like I said. No jokes or memes or talking about weird shit.” I turned back to the Hello Fresh instructions. Something about the language at the very back was causing a thrumming pain in my temples. 

Dumping them back in the box, I turned back to him. He had taken a seat at the table. His eyes were stuck to his phone, a smile curving on his lips. I didn’t bother questioning what he was looking at. 

Charlie joined us a while later, and had successfully managed to tame Maisie, who hopped onto his lap when he slumped down next to Gabe. I made a last minute plea to both of them to not act strange, or saying anything weird, or mention any embarrassing stories.

When Mina arrived, the food was ready, and we were all in high spirits. I don’t know what I expected from Mina. I only knew the version of her in classes; the version whose gaze was glued to her books, only talking to me in whispers. Sociable Mina was a totally different person. She arrived in a casual dress. Just a sweater and jeans. The guys didn’t even have to say anything fucked up, because the second she walked in, Mina was already showing them her phone and laughing before even greeting them.

I was surprised at how easy the four of us had come together.  After getting to know the guys, she insisted on helping me serve the food, telling us stories about her travels at a kid. With Mina being part Thai, she had a lot to tell us—and she spared no details while we ate.

“So, Mina.” Gabe spoke up, spooning potatoes into his mouth. I could tell by his smile he was about to say weird shit.

I kicked him under the table, but he just cleared his throat and swiped at his lips with a napkin and asked her generic questions.

When Mina pulled out a pack of cigarettes and asked if she could smoke outside, Gabe sent me a knowing smile.

He was right. But I was never going to admit that. Besides, I was having a great time. The food was good. Really good. It didn’t exactly look like the image on the instruction manual. More of a squashed version. But the taste was amazing. I didn’t realise how hungry I was until I was shovelling bacon mash potatoes into my mouth like an animal. I served pumpkin pie and whipped cream for dessert. 

The pie was kind of soggy, but I could mask it with the cream. I didn’t plan anything after dessert. I guess I expected them to go home. Mina, however, was already making herself at home. She wandered into my lounge and slumped onto my couch, turning on my TV. She wanted to watch a holiday movie (Elf) so we figured why not. It was cosy. 

Mina was still telling her stories, cuddled up to me, while Gabe and Charlie sat on the rug. They reminded me of little kids, the two of them sitting shoulder to shoulder. Charlie had Maisie curled up on his lap, Gabe with his legs drawn to his chest, chin resting on his knees. It struck me that I wouldn’t mind living with the three of them in the New Year. They were quite the catch. It wasn’t until halfway through the movie when Mina’s stories died out and her attention went to the TV.

I didn’t think anything of it until she sat up a little straighter. I noticed she was… hot. Not uncomfortably hot. But I could feel the heat coming off of her. I tried to ignore it, but then she was clearly uncomfortable, wriggling next to me before finally jumping up, fashioning a smile. In the dim glow of the TV screen, her cheeks were significantly paler. “Where’s your bathroom?” She asked hurriedly. I could tell she was eager to get away.

Instantly, my mind went to food poisoning. Mina’s forehead was glistening with sweat, her breaths coming out short and panicky.

“Bathroom.” She said again when I couldn’t find the words.

“Oh, right.” I sat up, my own stomach galloping. Not from poisoning though. Nerves. “It’s down the hall.” I said. “Are you okay?”

My tone must have attracted the boy’s attention. Charlie looked up from his phone, twisting to face us. “You okay, Mina?”

Mina had told me in private that she suffered from anxiety. The more people asked if she was okay, the worse she felt.

She nodded, still smiling, making her way over to the door. “Yeah, I’m fine! I think I just ate too much.”

“Shh!” Gabe’s attention was glued to the TV. He had no filter, especially after a glass of wine. “It’s the best part.”

I kicked him again.

“Ow.”

Gabe didn’t turn away from the screen.

Mina laughed at him, but I could tell from the crease between her brows, the curl in her lip, that she was in pain.

“Down the hall on the right.” I told her again. I made a move to get up and follow her. “Are you sure you’re okay?”

“Yep!” She swiped at her forehead. “I’m okay. I just need… I think I just need some air.”

Before I could question her, Mina was disappearing down the hallway. 

From the stumbling footsteps, I could tell she was running.

Fuck.

My mouth went dry.

I started to second guess myself. The chicken was cooked, right? I’d checked it multiple times. I turned to my phone, already googling food poisoning symptoms and counting how long it had been since she ingested the meal. Maybe an hour? But I felt fine. My stomach was trying to projectile into my throat, but I was pretty sure that it was nerves. I didn’t want to ask the guys how they were feeling, because surely that would cause alarm bells. 

So, with sticky palms and dread coiling in the root of my gut, I leaned into the warm leather of my couch and counted the minutes until Mina came back. She did, eventually. 

When Mina sat down she was shaking, her hands trembling in her lap. But still, she shot me a grin and insisted she was okay. Mina definitely was not okay. Her cheeks were pallid white, strands of her dark hair sticking to her clammy forehead. The girl was sweating. 

Bad. 

When she shuffled uncomfortably next to me, I could feel sweat dripping from her shirt. Her head found my shoulder, and it should have been comfortable. Flirty. But Mina was clearly sick. I couldn’t understand why she was hiding it. The movie credits were rolling when Charlie lifted Maisie off of his lap with a groan. “Alright. I am in need of more wine.”

Gently settling my startled looking cat on the carpet, the brit  jumped to his feet, turning to us. “Want some?”

He stumbled, almost toppling over. I thought it was the wine. But like Mina, Charlie was visibly shaking.

Opening my mouth to answer him, something warm crept back up my throat. Charlie was sweating. Bad. I could see the sheen of sweat shining on his forehead and cheek. Movement must have sobered him up, because suddenly he didn’t look well at all. His smile softened a little when he noticed my face. “Actually…” He laughed lightly, dragging a hand through his hair. I could tell he was trying to downplay it, but it was growing increasingly more obvious that something had gone very wrong with my meal. “I’m actually not feeling that great, Luce.”

I nodded, swallowing hard. “Are you okay?”

He shrugged. “Just feeling sick and shaky.” Charlie was doing his best not to ask the question, but I knew it was choking his throat.

“Yeah, I’ve got some pretty bad stomach cramps.” Gabe tipped his head back, his lips splitting into a grin. “Are you 100% sure that chicken was cooked? Because if not, we’re in for a rocky few days. I had food poisoning as a kid. Not pretty. My ma thought I was dying.”

There it was. Gabe was the blunt one so I was expecting it from him.

“Don’t talk about throwing up.” Mina spoke up with a sicky smile. “I really don’t feel good. I should probably… go home.”

She made a move to get up, but I stopped her. “Do you need me to call someone?”

“No.” Mina whispered. But I wasn’t sure if she could stand up without projectiling from both ends. The girl was sitting stiff in a certain position, her head straight. She shook her head. “No, I’ll be okay. Just… no sudden movements.” She blinked rapidly. “I feel kinda dizzy.”

Dizziness.

Was dizziness a symptom of food poisoning? I wasn’t sure if it was.

Gabe jumped up suddenly, and next to me, Mina’s stomach made an odd noise. He didn’t speak, darting out of the room. I heard the bathroom door slam. Charlie seemed a little less sick. He grabbed Mina a glass of water, and thankfully, she managed to drain the whole glass. I think Charlie was in denial that he too was sick. 

The boy could barely hold his own glass of water. The two of them engaged in casual conversation while I called an Uber. Gabe had been in the bathroom for a while. I’d found myself standing outside waiting for him, but both times I had asked if he was okay, I just got a strangled response telling me to leave. 

Mina was on her third glass of water when I left her and Charlie to see if Gabe was finished. I didn’t hear barfing. Which was good, right? But when I neared the door, however, I could hear the faucet was on. I already knew what he was doing. 

Gabe was trying to mask the sound of his violent puking by blasting the faucet. I only had to press my ear against the hardwood of the door to hear retching and groaning, the sounds of him yelling obscenities into the toilet bowl.

“Gabe?”

“Go away!” He yelled. His voice was different. I’d never heard him sound like that. His voice was strained and croaky. He sounded scared.

I should have left him alone. I know that. But he could have needed the hospital.

Twisting the door handle, I pulled it open and braced myself for what I was about to see. Gabe was kneeling on cold tiles, bent over the toilet bowl. His back was to me, fingers gripping the bowl. 

The boy was shaking violently with every heave wracking his body. Gasping out, my friend groaned. “Didn’t I tell you to leave?” He snapped. I knew he was about to yell at me before he jolted again, his shoulders relaxing. 

I figured he was finished  before he slowly turned around, wide eyes going to the ceiling. At first I thought he was dizzy, struggling to keep his balance. Before he collapsed against the toilet with a choked laugh. Gabe’s gaze was skirting the ceiling tiles, and after a moment of trying to ignore a glittering in his pupils, something which looked almost sentient, alive, wriggling around his iris—I followed his eye.

There was something floating above me. Right over my head. Initially, I thought it was a Christmas decoration which was hanging from the ceiling. That is what logic said, anyway. But the closer I looked, I realised I was staring at… liquid. Worse still, I could still see undigested lumps of chicken. Barf. I was seeing Gabe’s barf spiralling above me like a fucking attraction. There were no strings attached, it was just hovering there. Like it belonged.

I was almost trance-like, staring at this thing in the air, this thing that didn’t make sense, before my friend turned back to the toilet seat, this time speaking through sharp breaths. “I’m okay.” He hissed out. 

Except this time he barfed, bright red escaped his mouth, dribbling down his chin, and he collapsed over the toilet seat. “Okay. Maybe I'm not okay. ” Gabe slurred in a laugh which choked into a sob. His body jolted again, and with him, so did the room. I wasn’t imagining it.

The room began to shake and tremble, shampoo bottles raining down from the shelves. I thought it was an earthquake until Gabe hung onto cold porcelain, squeezing hard. He twisted around to face me with wide eyes.

His frenzied gaze found the corner of the bathroom, and bottles of my body wash were exploding, colourful froth spattering the walls. Before it found the shower, the nozzle growing a mind of its own, twisting itself up the wall before dropping back onto the tiles.

Gabe turned back to the bowl, hissing out a breath. “I don’t think I’m okay, Luce. Fuck. I think you need to… to get someone.”

As soon as the words had left his mouth, the room stopped shaking. 

Ignoring spiralling red spattering the porcelain white of the toilet bowl, I struggled to press wet towels onto his forehead to bring down his raging fever. “I’m going to get you help, okay?” I whispered. "Just hold on. Please. You're okay." 

“Mmm. Just gimme a sec.” Gabe slurred. “I’m okay. I’m gonna be…” He hiccupped, more red hitting white. “I’m gon be okay.”

I could barely breathe.

“How are you doing that?” I whispered.

Gabe weakly lifted his head, his gaze flicking to the state of the bathroom, to tiles still lightly quivering under my feet. “I have no idea. But… fucking cool, right?" He blinked slowly, and the faucet exploded, showering us in ice cold water. 

When his eyes rolled back, his body going limp against the toilet seat, I found myself stiff.

 I couldn’t move.

I couldn’t speak. 

Gabe wasn’t moving. His skin was shining with sweat. He was so pale. So, fucking pale.

“Charlie!” I didn’t realise I was screaming. I was numb.

“Charlie, I need help!” I wailed.

Fuck.

Was he dead? Had I killed him?

No, I couldn’t have killed him! It wasn’t me. I cooked the chicken! And even if didn’t… since when was food poisoning… this?!

“Mina!”

Charlie’s panicked voice cut through my thoughts, and I snapped out of it. I waited for several painstaking moments waiting for Gabe to move—to tell me he was still alive. He did. But not in the way I wanted. Instead, his body writhed. And with that movement came one final quake under my feet. I couldn’t call that a sign that he was still alive, but it was something. Slowly, I made my way over to him.

He was still breathing. But his heartbeat was erratic. Putting him in the recovery position, I noticed his skin was ice-cold. It’s weird. Like his body was dead. His face was white, slight bruising under his eyes. But Gabe still had a pulse. He was alive, and yet it made no sense how he was alive. So much blood. It painted him and the toilet bowl. When I left him, his arms were twitching beneath him, fingers curling into a fist. Gabe should have been dead. 

But he wasn't. 

I was diving for my bag and phone to call an ambulance when I noticed something was very wrong. Charlie was on his knees, coughing violently into blood soaked hands, while Mina lay on her back. Her eyes were flickering, lips opening and closing, a thin line of red seeping down her chin. But looking closer, her body wasn’t quite on the floor. No. It was… hovering. 

Levitating. 

Several feet from my favorite rug.

Mina was unresponsive. When I shook her, tried to pull her back to the ground, her body seemed to shake me off. “Charlie.” I spoke softly, already dialling 911 with trembling hands. “What… what happened to her?”

His next cough exploded from him. And the tissue paper he was spluttering into burst into startling orange.

Flame. I stared for a moment, unsure if what I was seeing… was real.

No, it was real. I was seeing ignited smoulders of orange tearing through white tissue paper.

I found Charlie’s unfocused eyes. There was something alive around his iris. Something twining its way around his pupil.

“I’m okay.” He said hurriedly. “Just feeling dizzy.”

I almost laughed. 911 was taking a while to connect, and I found myself wondering how. It shouldn’t have taken that long.

“Dizzy?!” I hissed, gesturing to the flickering flame.

It took me a second to realise blurry orange was writhing across the tips of his fingers.

I don’t think he was fully aware of what was happening. “You can see it too?” 

His eyes widened, and his head cocked, eyes illuminated, mesmerising flame crawling across his flesh. It wasn't sizzling or burning through his skin. Gabe could make things explode, Mina could fly.. and Charlie was fireproof. “Well, shit.”

He choked out a laugh, swaying slightly. 

“I thought I was tripping.” 

Another bloody cough spluttered from his lips. Behind me, the holiday decorations I had strung across the wall burst into flames. Everything happened in slow motion, and somehow I was reacting like I knew what was going on. Grabbing a glass of water, I put the mini fire out with the phone pressed to my ear. I didn’t see Charlie’s knees hit the carpet. Instead, I was pacing the room, desperate to get to the emergency services. Even when there was no way to explain what I had seen. 

This wasn’t food poisoning. It couldn’t be. This was way more advanced than a virus.  

When a woman’s friendly voice finally sliced into my ear, a shiver rocketed down my spine.  A thud made me jump.

Mina had hit the ground, gravity finally yanking her body down. I crawled over to her. She was alive. Just freezing cold.

“Hello! You’re speaking to Katy at Hello Fresh! Can I have your home address, please?”

What? Didn’t I call 911? I didn’t have time to question it. Before I could choke down the words, I was breaking out into a sob. “

“There’s something wrong with my friends.” I managed to get out. “There’s…. there’s something wrong with my friends!” 

Clutching the phone to my ear, I tried to pry Mina’s eye open. Several feet away, Charlie was completely out. “I think they’re dead.” I whispered in a hiss. “Did I kill them? It was just a chicken recipe. But I can’t understand…” My chest felt like it was on fire. “They’re not experiencing… normal symptoms.” I couldn’t stop myself from crying, then. “Can you help them? There’s something wrong. My friends…"

The woman hummed. She seemed remarkably calm. “No, they’re not dead,” she said. “This is just the ingesting phase. Following that is the Blossoming phase.” Katy paused and cleared her throat. “Which has appeared to have gone wrong. Please provide your home address.”

“What?” I shrieked. “Why do you want my address?”

“For pick-up and extraction.” She said. “How old are they? Are these family members, or are they around your age?”

“I—”

She cut me off. “Just the age category is fine.”

At the corner of my eye, Charlie’s body writhed for a few seconds, and next to him, fibres of carpet began to slowly catch alight.

I stamped it out. “18 to 25.” I told her. “What do you mean, extraction? What’s wrong with them?” I swallowed. “Are they going to die?"

“Just blossoming.” Katy said. “I advise you to stay away from them. If you are in the room with them now, I would like you to step out. Do not make any sudden movement. If they are experiencing any physical symptoms, please restrain your friends with rope or chains."

I could feel myself taking slow steps back.

“What are you… talking about? You did this?”

“Yes. The food your friends ingested is the cause of their current symptoms. I’m talking about the blossoming stage. After ingesting, their bodies will go into a sort of… hibernation, by either going to sleep or simply sitting or standing. They will not be showing any emotion, due to the second stage taking over their brain. They may utter speech but it will be slurred or incomprehensible. Laughing has also been reported.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“I mean…” Katy paused. “Your friends… they won’t exactly be themselves when they break from the blossoming stage.”

“They’re dead?”

“Well… yes and no. Not dead in the brain.”

Another step back.

Her words weren’t registering.

In front of me, Mina’s head jerked from side to side, her eyes snapping open, lips curling into an animalistic snarl revealing incisors which definitely weren’t there before. I took a slow breath, backing away towards the door. 

“Why is this happening to them?”

“Well, miss—”

I cut her off with a frustrated cry. Mina’s dead eyes were on the ceiling. “No, I mean why is it happening to them and not me?”

“Well, I can’t speak for you. I know we have been testing a placebo in control group subjects, but I don’t think its been put into our products,” she said. “As for your friends, there have been reports of a certain… mutation in subjects who consume our products. It is known to cause significant changes in brain patterns. Of course, we knew this. The chemical was intentionally put into our food to create a certain reaction which would not be harmful but help us in the long run. What we hoped for is for customers to become our spokespeople for Hello Fresh.” 

God, I could tell she had said that line so many times. “However, something has indeed gone wrong. Over the last few weeks, we have received multiple reports of this mutation which I can assure we can control. Please do not worry. We will extract them ASAP. Oh! And if you check the instructions we sent you with your kit, we very clearly warned customers of this mutation. We cannot offer a refund.”

She was joking around. 

Surely.

Katy left me in silence before hitting me with a bombshell. “This mutation is rare, by the way. Most customers, such as social media influencers, have been affected in a positive way. We have spokespeople to carry our name with them and spread our product globally.”  

“Spokespeople?” I bit out. “My friend was floating.” The words felt foreign on my tongue. “My friend… she was hovering in front of me!”

“Mmm. Like I said, significant changes in brain patterns include symptoms such as usual flu like symptoms, like vomiting and a fever. As well as bleeding from the nose and mouth, a sudden inexplicable urge to consume human flesh, abilities that cannot be explained, and —-“

Katy’s voice exploded into nothing when something smashed into the back of my head, sending me spiralling.

The smell of fried onions, as well as a sharp, intense pain writhing in the palms of my hands woke me up.

I found myself lying on my back on my dining room table. When I tried to move, tried to get up, I couldn’t. I twisted my head to seek out where the pain was coming from. The first thing I saw through frayed vision was the wooden edge of a knife trembling mid-air. Blinking rapidly, I thought I was hallucinating. Nope. 

The knife was definitely real, and definitely suspended in mid-air. Panic started to ignite inside of me—and before I could speak, the air was moving in front of me. Suddenly, the knife wasn’t as clumsy as I thought it was. It didn’t tremble and shake. It cocked to the left and then the right. Like it could sense my fear. There was a figure blooming behind it. 

Gabe. 

He looked… better. I guessed. There was something messed up with his eyes, but he didn’t look dead anymore. At least that was my logical brain talking. It wasn’t fully registering dead and empty eyes, and a grinning mouth full of teeth ready to rip me apart. I finally found my voice when Mina loomed over me with wide, unseeing eyes. “You’re okay.” I rasped when Mina’s tongue flicked out, grazing her lips. 

She was stiff. When I tried to move, her claw-like fingernails grasped hold of me, like I was territory. The girl didn’t speak. She just shook her head. Gabe didn’t look at me. His gaze was on my legs and arms. I glimpsed a thin slither of drool pooling from his lip.

 “Hungry.” He mumbled. “So… hungry.”

“There’s something wrong with you.” I said. “I’m getting help. Listen to me. Okay? I’m going to get you help.”

His eyes seemed to flicker to life.

“Oh no, I’m perfectly fine,” Gabe shrugged with a smile. “I’m just… really fucking hungry, Luce. We’re all hungry.”

“Mmm.” Charlie mumbled, echoing his words. He was standing close by, panting like a dog. 

“Hungry.”

“Let me go.” I wrenched against the pain holding me.  “Let me go!”

“Shh.”

Gabe only had to blink  before a carving knife was hovering inches from my face. “You need to eat, Luce.” His lips broke out into a grin. “And then we’re eating you! Fun, right?"

Behind him, Mina was standing at the stove. She was cooking onions, humming to herself. The smell was twisting my gut.

I screamed, a deep and guttural screech sending my thoughts into a tailspin.

At the same time though, the knife dropped. But not like it was supposed to. It dropped with purpose, blade first. Pinning my hand to the table, it didn’t stop, this sentient blade digging deeper and deeper through flesh and bone  until it was perforating me. I screamed again, my cry choking between my clenched teeth. This time I barely made a noise, just a breath.

Another knife was hanging, almost comically. Before it followed suite, successfully immobilising my body. I was aware of red spurting, pooling across the surface. 

But he wasn’t finished. A third knife hung above me and made a sweeping motion. I watched it come close to my leg, the blade nicking my skin. Gabe was playing with me. I was aware of Charlie hovering by. I could sense the heat of the flame on his fingers, a fire igniting on the tips. Gabe disappeared for a moment before bending over me. Something was clenched between his teeth. A marker pen. He plucked the lid off, and used the marker, scrawling on my stomach, then my legs and arms. The knives seemed to follow him, eager, like they were ready to get to work. Thankfully, they didn’t.

The three were going to skin me. Eat me. Their eyes held no life except unbridled greed, a craving I couldn’t understand. Charlie held a plate, and Gabe ran his fingers up and down my legs, squeezing excess skin through his fist.

Before they could, however, my door was flying open, a swarm of men and women in black filling the room.

I was helped off of the table quickly, the knives being pulled from my hands.

I barely felt the pain.

Instead, I was watching my friends automatically going for the kill. 

They acted like animals. Like strangers with their faces. Whatever these people have turned them into, they were monsters. Charlie grabbed a masked man, and snapped his neck, before he was shot down. Mina was slower. 

She held up her hands in mock surrender. Her gaze scanned the crowd for a victim. But before she could lunge, she too was taken down. 

This time from the back. 

A man had stabbed her in the back of the neck with a shot. Gabe stumbled back, outnumbered.  He looked like he was going to attack, before the man pulled out a device. To me, it was barely a scratch to my ear. 

But to Gabe, it was torture. 

His trembling hands went to bloody ears—- mouth opening but no sound coming out. When Gabe dropped to his knees with a snarl, a choked ripping from his lips, I started towards him. I wanted to help him. I mean, despite what they had done to me, I wanted to help him. But rough arms were dragging me violently back.

The device, whatever it was, must have been cranked to its highest setting, turning Gabe into a quivering mess, burying his head in his knees.

“Calm down.” The man told him through the mask.

Gabe actually looked human again for a moment, squeezing his eyes shut. If I ignored his eyes, and glistening incisors. “I am calm!” He cried through his teeth. “Turn that off!” His expression crumpled. “Please. I’m begging you. Just please turn that thing off. It... it hurts!"

They did, eventually. And just like that, Gabe too was tranquillised and picked up, thrown over bulky shoulders. 

I watched my friends get dragged out of my house—and thrown into a white van.

“Are you alright, miss?” A woman had bandaged my hand. She smiled reassuringly. “Your friends have some minor food poisoning. We’re just taking them to check them over, alright? There’s nothing to worry about.” 

Her tone was almost hypnotising, turning my thoughts foggy.

I nodded dizzily.

“Are you sure you’re okay?”

I was pretty sure I wasn’t. The woman left me with a promise to contact me when my friends were better. There were two men standing outside the van, watching guards throw Mina, Gabe, and Charlie into the back like trash. 

One of them was smoking. Through a drag, he slapped the doors. “What have we got here?”

“Potentials.” The other man said.  “Take ‘em’ back to HQ. We’ve got potentials! Why the long face, huh? This is what we wanted.”

The smoker chuckled before stamping out his cigarette. “Alright, come on. Let’s load em’ up.”

I did probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever done in my life after that.

I jumped in the back with them. I expected just my friends, but there are more people. All of them knocked out. It’s been several hours since the van arrived at its destination. I’ve managed to hide behind a pile of body bags. They took my friends hours ago, and I’m too scared to see where I am. I’ve checked several times through the gap in the door. I’m in a large parking lot. 

This place reminds me of the dentist.

It’s got that smell, you know? Like… clinical.

If this phone stays alive, I’ll try and update you.

Something tells me Hello Fresh’s “mutation” wasn’t an accident.
