**Just to clarify, I'm not a story teller, It may take a while to get my point across. Please be patient with me!** So, this is actually a real thing that's happening to me, actually for 3 days now, I haven't slept my normal hours cause, I'm scared. I'm frightened. I'm paranoid. I'm doing everything I can to resolve this issue and I feel like I'm never seeing the light of day.

So, It started on March 18th, 2023 around 2am. Me and my friend live in states adjacent to each other, but I don't have a car so I don't see her much, only being an hour away, so instead we call like every night. I'm calling my friend and we're talking, she tells me to talk about the plot of titanic, (I only ever watched small bits) I told her "But I haven't really watched the titanic..." and she says "thats a deal breaker" I'm trying to impress her, keep her interested in me. I explain what I know, and then she tells me to explain 9/11, so I do, but I know nothing about specifics about 9/11.

So I asked ChatGPT to explain, and I read what ChatGPT wrote for me. This is where things start going downhill. So, you know how when you call someone, and they don't pick up, it goes to voicemail right? Voicemail lady says "At the tone please leave your message for (random number) \*beep\*" just so you know what I'm talking about. Her and I are talking- our calls go normally, the ring, the answer, the conversation. But at least 1-3 minutes in when we're talking I hear that \*beep\* from voicemail lady. Mid call, weird right? ***I still can't explain that- so I truly hope someone can for me.***

So mid conversation I hear a voicemail lady, I tell my friend "what are you doing? What's that beep? Why is the voicemail lady talking?" she says "What are you talking about? What voicemail lady?" I say "You know the one that talks when you don't answer the call???" she says "No?? What are you even talking about??" I'm skeptical. "You're messing with me." She says "How am I messing with you???" I say "How do you not know who the voicemail lady is??" I hung up. I texted her "This voicemail thing is getting kind of annoying."

She calls again, I listen in. Voicemail lady again. "IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN?" At this point, i'm just trying to talk to my friend. I'm annoyed. A little scared, but voicemail lady's voice always kind of scared me. Next couple calls voicemail lady's voice glitches. ***"record your-record your-record your-"*** I hang up every time I hear the voicemail beep, I'm frightened. Maybe it was just a one night thing. I hoped it was at least.

The next night, we call, same issues again. This time was different. I finally let the voicemail lady play through. I can't hear my friend, she can't hear me. Silence. Then an unfamiliar stern voice starts talking. "I've been trying to contact you for a while." He claims to be CIA, talking from the state she lives in. He tells me my name, and says I have committed wire fraud? He just straight up accused me of something I've never done in my entire life. He then hangs up on me. I call my friend again and he intercepts my call again.

Voicemail lady then him. He then says I have a warrant out for my arrest, and if I don't pay him the money he's going to dispatch the police to my house. Later on he then claims he did. I'm calling my same friend saying "Did you hear any of that???" she said "No?? Why were you ignoring me??" I said "I WASN'T SOME GOVERNMENT GUY JUST CALLED ME!!" She's witnessing this the same time I am. She isn't hearing anything but I'm filling her in on everything. I'm getting ready in case the police are dispatched to my house, but shortly after I then call the police to find out if I am being sought after.

They assured me that I wasn't and I was so confused. I'm told its a scammer, I don't think it is. What kind of scammer or hacker can intercept a call mid way and talk to me? How? And why is it only when I call her or anyone in her state? I was filled with questions. I'm intrigued. I'm on edge. Today was day 3 of it happening. I made a police report I did everything I could, even called my mobile providers customer service. I searched online for answers, to find if someones dealt with the same thing I did. I couldn't find anything about "voicemail call interception" or anything that could be related to it. I can't call my friends in peace. I can't hear a voicemail beep or voicemail lady's voice without being sent into a fright. I'm paranoid and I know I didn't do anything wrong.

Heres some more insight. I'm being called by my friend, on her number. The voicemail lady, I assume is a way for the "Mystery man" to intercept my call. So if I try to report it, theres no indicator of that call being intercepted. So I can't prove to anyone that it's happening. I have video proof of the voicemail lady talking mid call, I just need proof of the man talking to me. 

I don't know what to do, or how to stop it from happening.

I don't feel safe calling my friend anymore without being scared of talking to that mysterious man again. This is entirely true, and I will provide more updates as I come across them. I hope this story entertained you, but also, if you have any further information about this, please let me know. I am desperately looking for answers.
