K'o uvnn cnkxg!!

It's been a few days since my last post, sorry 'bout that. For anyone who hasn't read the first two posts: my small town has been plagued by disappearing girls sinch March 23rd of this year, and one of my friends was one of those girls. Her name is Calla Dollenganger, and I last said that I'd be talking to her sister, Marie, this weekend. She's the reason I'm doing all of this.

Anyways, I talked to Calla's ex-boyfriend Ben today. That's where this post begins.

He was at the library, and I decided to record our conversations to make writing this easier. (Ben, if you're reading this by some chance, I know I should have told you. Sorry about that, dude). I asked him if we could talk, and he said this. I'll provide the transcript of our conversation now.

Ben: What'd you wanna know, Nola?

Me: What happened in the woods when you went camping?

Ben: \*exhales\* I already told your dad everything. Since when were you a special agent?

Me: Please, just answer the question, dude.

Ben: Alright. Lily said she needed to go get her sunglasses from the car, and I didn't think twice about it. She wanted to take some photos for her Instagram, said the lighting was right. I noticed something was weird when twenty minutes went by, but I thought she found a nice spot.

Me: Twenty minutes? That's faster than usual.

Ben: \*faint laugh\* You know how she is.

Me: Yeah.....When did everyone else notice?

Ben: I think I...I dunno who I told first. Maybe Cheryl or Oliver. I dunno. Just, we all realized she hadn't come back and started looking for her. I don't know how long it took. Maybe three hours, maybe five minutes.

Me: Hmm?

Ben: Time was weird, okay? I just know that it was dark way too soon. I think we were trying to sleep when I heard her voice. She just kept saying, "Ben, I'm over here! Ben, c'mon! C'mon, c'mon." Real eager, ya know? Like nothing was wrong.

Me: I'm sorry.

Ben: It's f.....don't worry about it. I followed her voice, but it kept getting farther away. I remember getting snagged on a branch, and her entire tone changed.

Me: How?

Ben: Like.....it was like she couldn't remember her own voice. She sounded so close but not. W-Why are you doing this, Nola? This was months ago. Why....why?

Me: I don't know. I just want to find her.

Ben: It's useless, okay?

Me: I thought you loved her.

Ben: I do, but \* heavy sigh\* that won't bring her back. Please, just leave me alone.

Me: Alright. I'm sorry, Ben. Really sorry.

Ben: Me too. \*after a brief pause\* One more thing, she and Marie had a fight that day. That's why she came along instead.

After a very depressing realization, I ran into some new people. I didn't even know people had sold their houses, but I guess that's inevitable, right? Anyways, their names were Pippa and Anne McLaren, and they were both maybe college-age or a little older. The weirdest part is that I feel like I've seen them before.

I talked to them for a l'il bit, but they were both kinda spacey and absent-minded. I don't want to call them this because it seems rude, but the word "docile" comes to mind now that I've had some time to think. They both had big, doe-like eyes and sugary-sweet voices, but it didn't feel right. It was like they were trying too hard to come off as polite, but maybe I'm just bad at reading people.

Marie texted me again today, and she said she had a gift for me. I can't wait another day, so I'm gonna move it to tomorew

Guys my mom just came into my room crying. Mitzy was found dead in a ditch earlier today, and she's apparently been there for over a month. If it wasn't for her jewelry and painted nails no one would recognize her. Most of her skin had been removed and her clothes were gone.

I feel sick to my stomach, and it doesn't help that there's a stotm right oitside. I think I'm gonna eat some paper and vomit BRB
