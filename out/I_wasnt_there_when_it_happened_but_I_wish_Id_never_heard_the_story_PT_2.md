Hey everybody, since there was some interest in the rest of my cousin's story, I wrote down the next part. Here it is! We left off with the group members gathered around the campfire, so that's where I picked up.

“Why don’t we try some Freeze Tag to get back into characters?” Mara suggested.

Freeze Tag was one of Mara’s favorite activities. To play, two players must start a scene. At any point during their scene, another player can clap or say ‘freeze’, then take over one of the scene players' parts. 

“Lila, Dan, you two can start.” She said.

Lila stood immediately. Dan was slower. He always seemed a little unsure of these exercises. 

They began a scene that started out as an office vending machine exchange. With Lila playing the part of ‘office vending machine’. 

Mara tagged herself in, and the scene morphed into 

Natalie joined after the scene became just a bit too long. She and Mara turned it into

While they all took turns, Chris sat in his seat, arms crossed. He hadn’t tagged himself into the game even once. 

“Freeze! But, this time, I volunteer Chris to join.” Dan said, pointing a finger at Chris.

Chris didn’t seem to notice this at first. He stayed frozen, not blinking. 

“Chris we all agreed to do this retreat in character the entire time, pl-” Mara started, but she didn’t finish her sentence. 

He slowly stood and walked to the scene that Lila and Natalie had created. Lila stepped away without a word, allowing Chris to take her place. 

He began to speak. This time without any script. 

“You call this play, but it is truth. You pretend at death, but I remember it.” He said flatly, lacking any of the drama he had infused his original monologue with. 

“Uhh.. I guess as the only doctor on shift tonight you would..” Natalie tried to play off of Chris’s words and keep the scene going. 

It wasn’t convincing. 

“This script is older than bone, and the audience, even older.” Chris continued, not even attempting to work with Natalie's words. 

“Okay Chris, we get it, you took a workshop at Julliard, now can you please work with your scene partner?” Mara said. 

At that, Chris dropped low into a crouch, hands touching the ground. Natalie jumped slightly at his abrupt movement. She wasn’t sure what to do to continue this scene. 

“So we’re doing creepy, scary, scenes now. Got it.” Lila said, unfazed. 

Natalie let out a nervous laugh. 

“Uhmm.. let me join you?” Natalie said as she slowly crouched down, mirroring Chris.

“Great, great job Natalie!” Mara said, clapping her hands, pleased that Natalie was able to work around Chris. 

Chris still did not speak. 

They waited, and they waited, for him to add onto the scene. But he did not budge. 

Finally, Dan had had enough. 

“Freeze!” He said, stepping towards Natalie and Chris. 

He tapped Chris’s shoulder, the signal that Dan was going to take his place in the scene. 

Chris didn’t move. 

“Hey man, I’m tagging in.” Dan said gently.

There was no response. Natalie looked at Mara and Lila, who were watching, bewildered.

Dan started to lean forward to speak more directly to Chris. 

At this, Chris’s head snapped towards Dan. He didn’t move like he was turning his head to listen, or even to exit the scene. His head had moved like it was attached to puppet strings. 

“Your name is not yours any longer.” Chris said, voice croaking.

“Alright. Cool. Cool cool cool. We’re doing a scary possessed bit then? I can do that.” Dan said, quickly adjusting himself to mimic Chris and Natalie. 

As soon as Dan had assumed the position that Chris was in, Chris snapped himself up to standing. Again, it was a very jerky, snap movement. 

Once he was fully standing he grinned. The grin didn’t reach his eyes. They remained cold and empty. 

“Wow, he’s really good at committing to the bit.” Lila whispered, leaning over to Mara. 

“Great job, Chris, I appreciate your dedication.” Mara said, giving him a small tap on the shoulder as he walked past her, and headed straight to the house. She swore that as she touched him, she felt a small shock. 

Dan and Natalie continued their scene, both mimicking Chris in their own ways, but never quite nailing it down. Lila joined in as well, the three of them crouching or crawling in the dirt. Mara did not feel like crawling around the ground in the dark. 

“Let’s call it a night guys. Get some rest so we can continue this tomorrow.” She said to the group. 

Dan and Natalie stood, joints creaking. Natalie did a small full-body stretch. She wasn’t used to crawling around like that, and it had hurt her knees. 

“That was great, Mara, I love being able to channel my animal spirit guides.” Lila said as she continued her crouch crawl towards the house. 

Mara, Dan, and Natalie shared a look. This was classic Lila. She didn’t even need the improvisation exercises to do these things. They were just a convenient excuse. 

They made it into the house and headed off to their separate bedrooms, noting that Chris’s room was dark underneath the door. 

**ACT 2: Chapter 7: The Next Morning**

It was 9:04 AM. Breakfast was scheduled for 9 AM. Mara was anxious. 

She was the only one in the kitchen, dressed and prepared for the day, and for their scheduled breakfast. 

As she waited for the rest of the group to come down, she reviewed the day's schedule. 

9 AM - Breakfast

Underneath the last activity of the night, Mara added, ‘by the campfire’. She felt like they had made some breakthroughs during last night's fire, and was hoping to recreate some of that magic.

As she finished updating her schedule, Dan and Lila entered the kitchen. 

“Sorry we’re a bit late Mara, it’s hard to get ready for the day when only one bathroom has a shower!” Lila said.

“It might be easier if we doubled up on showers; you and I can go together.” Dan said, winking at Lila. 

Lila was used to Dan's occasional corny comments, so she did not feel the need to respond. 

“I can create a shower schedule if that helps.” Mara offered, genuinely. 

Dan laughed in response. Mara didn’t understand why Dan laughed at her offer of assistance. 

“I don’t think that will be necessary, Mara. Thanks, though.” He said between chuckles. 

“What did I miss?” Natalie asked as she walked in. 

“Just Dan attempting to conserve water and failing.” Lila replied. 

“Hey, you haven’t even given my idea any consideration. How do you know it would fail?” Dan said, picking up an apple from the counter.

“Has anyone seen Chris this morning? We just need him, and then we can get started.” Mara asked the group.

“I’m sure he’ll be down soon. We can probably get started without him.” Dan offered.

As soon as Dan finished his sentence, Chris entered the kitchen. He looked slightly disheveled and was missing some of his usual necklaces. 

“Good morning, Chris! Still feeling creepy scary this morning?” Lila asked with a smile. 

“What?” He asked, rubbing his eyes with his palms before reaching for the coffee pot. 

“Nevermind.” Lila said, sitting at the table and picking up a piece of toast. 

“Thanks for joining us Chris. We need to get the day started since we’re a little behind.” Mara said, gently wringing her hands. It was 9:08 AM. 

“Let’s eat some breakfast, review today's schedule, and get into character.”

As they prepared for the day, Chris was visibly struggling. He yawned, rubbed his eyes, drank his coffee, and didn’t say much. While Mara, Dan, and Lila debated some of the open-ended activities of the day, Natalie leaned over towards Chris.

“Hey man, doing okay this morning?” She asked.

“Yeah.. yeah. Too much whiskey, I think. I’ll survive.” He responded, taking another sip of his coffee.

Natalie found his answer to be sufficient. She had also woken up with a bit of a headache. She wasn’t used to bonfires, beer, and staying up late. But here she was.

She noticed as Chris lifted his coffee cup to his lips, his hand shook lightly.

Lila offered to lead the breathing exercises to warm up the group. She loved this kind of thing. It was something she did on her own, outside of the retreat. 

They all sat facing Lila, eyes closed, on the floor of the living room. The old wood floors creaked when they moved, and dust had flown into the air as they arranged themselves.

The group was struggling to grasp her explanation of Ujjayi breath.

“I *said*, slightly constrict the back of the throat while inhaling and exhaling through the nose. It should create a soft, audible sound as you breathe.”

Dan let out a noise that was almost a ‘moo’. Mara and Natalie didn’t make any noise at all. 

Chris made a noise that sounded to Lila like a suppressed scream. 

Lila opened her eyes to find the group had already opened theirs and had been staring at her blankly. 

Dan was grinning, trying hard not to laugh. Mara looked tense, knuckles turning white where she had set them on her knees. Natalie looked like she was in a dentist's chair. 

Lila wasn’t sure what Chris was doing, but she was sure that it was creepy, and he was really going above and beyond in his character work this retreat.

Mara stood and went next to Lila.

“Alright, thanks, Lila, for that… helpful demonstration.” She said, clearly struggling for the right adjective to use in this situation. 

“Let’s get even more warmed up with some Mirroring!” Mara told them enthusiastically.

“How about Chris and Lila work together, and Dan and Natalie. Since there are five of us, I’ll moderate and give tips.”

They moved into their pairs, remaining seated on the hardwood floor.

Mirroring was another improv exercise that Mara loved. It involved taking two people, with one person as the ‘leader’ and the other as their ‘mirror’ image. The leader would make movements or gestures, and the mirror image would try to mimic them in real time. It was a good way to build connections in the group and help them find responses faster.

Each pair faced the other. 

While Dan and Natalie each offered the other to begin as the leader, Chris had immediately locked eyes with Lila and began a slow movement.

At first, it’s funny. Chris is doing his usual overperforming approach. Creating large sweeping gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. 

Lila is mirroring him, but the emotion in her movements is not as strong as his. 

They continue in this way for a few minutes until Mara tells them to switch leaders.

Now Lila is the leader, and Chris is her mirror.

Lila is making hand motions that could resemble spell casting, and Chris is attempting to mirror her, but ultimately his movements come at a slight delay behind Lila’s. 

As she holds one hand high above her head, Chris does the same a beat later. Once he’s successfully mirrored that part, Lila decides that she will let her arm fall back down. 

She loved to surprise her mirror.

But as she made this decision, and her arm began to drop with the force of gravity, Chris's arm came right along with it. 

There was no way he could have done that in perfect unison with her; he would have had to have been reading her mind to know what she was going to do. 

Lila continued, now trying to create a disparity between her actions and her mirrors. 

She slowly raised the same hand, arm outstretched. As she did this, she would raise her palm quickly and then quickly flick it down, like she was trying to shake something off her hand. 

Chris moved perfectly with her again. 

Mara glanced at the two of them and wondered who was the leader, and who was the mirror?

Lila tilts her head, so does he.

Lila leans back, so does he.

Frustrated, Lila jumps to her feet. Chris is face-to-face with her when she stands.

“How are you doing this?” She says

“How are you doing this?” Chris overlaps her, his voice very low

This exchange gets Dan and Natalie to look at the two of them. 

“Okay, seriously, Chris, stop, it’s freaky.” Lila says, taking a step back.

“Okay, seriously, Chris, stop, it’s freaky.” Chris again overlaps, speaking in unison with Lila. This time, his voice is high-pitched, and when Lila takes her step back, Chris takes a step forward. Towards her.

“Chris, man, we know you’re good at this game, relax,” Dan says, now fully turning his body to watch what’s unfolding.

“No, this is good stuff, keep it going.” Mara says, eyes wide, unable to look away from Lila and Chris.

“Mara, I don't want to do this anymore.” Lila says, voice shaking, taking another step back towards the door to the living room.

Again, Chris speaks in unison with her, this time it almost sounds as if there are three voices, not just two. 

And again, as she steps back, Chris steps forward.

Lila feels an urge, an instinct, and runs. 

She leaves the living room, runs up the stairs, and goes to her bedroom. There, she shuts the door and steps back from it. 

Chris is in lock step behind her. Not even caring to copy her exact footsteps or facial expressions. His face is blank. 

Mara, Dan, and Natalie are shocked. They’ve never seen anything like this before. They follow the two of them as fast as they can up the stairs.

When they reach the landing and can see Lila’s bedroom door, Chris is standing in front of it, smiling. It’s another wide smile that doesn’t reach his eyes, or the rest of his body, as his hands are clenched tightly at his side, and his breathing is rapid.

From behind the door, there’s a weak voice.

“Pineapple, pineapple, pineapple!” Lila says, getting louder with each iteration.

“Pineapple, pineapple, pineapple!” Chris overlaps again. 

But when they finish speaking, Chris doubles over, almost like someone has punched him in the gut.

He puts his hands on his knees, breathing heavily.

“I didn’t know I could move like that.” He says between breaths.

“Man, what was that? You were moving with her in real time, and you changed voices?!” Dan asked incredulously.

“Method acting to the extreme I guess.” Chris said, standing up and walking towards the three of them at the end of the hall.

As he approaches, Natalie takes a small, almost imperceptible step back. 

“Are you okay?” Mara asks him cautiously as he passes her. 

“Yeah, yeah, I think so.. Was that too much?” Chris asked with mock innocence. 

He stands at the top of the stairs, looking at the rest of the group. Dan leans over towards him and whispers praises of his abilities in his ear.

Mara approaches Lila’s door and opens it.

“The scene is over, Lila, you can come out now.” She tells her.

“What was that, Chris? That wasn’t improv, I don’t even know what that was! That was genuinely scary, Chris, what the hell?” Lila says, taking a step into the hall.

“Sorry Lila, I swear I thought we were still doing the exercise..” He says, holding both hands up.

“Okay so now we know Chris’s character is some creepy Olympic demon I guess.” Dan says with a chuckle as he starts to descend the stairs. 

“Is it too late for me to try out for next year's Olympics?” Chris asks sarcastically, following Dan down the stairs. 

“There aren’t any Olympics for another 2 years Chris,” Mara says flatly, not turning to look at him.

“Great sense of humor Mara, really top notch.” Chris shouts from the bottom of the stairs.

Natalie follows behind Chris, keeping her eyes on him as she does. 

Lila lightly grabs Mara’s wrist as she turns to begin to walk away.

Mara stops.

“Hey.. that was like..really weird, right? I’m not overreacting?” Lila asks her, eyes big, on the verge of tears.

“You weren’t overreacting, Chris was doing his usual *overacting*.. But you have to admit his abilities in that game were out of this world.” Mara said.

“Yeah.. yeah. He’s really good at it.” Lila says, letting Mara’s wrist go.

Mara follows the rest of the group down the stairs, dollar signs in her mind, thinking about Chris’ performance.

Lila stands at the top of the stairs and looks down. 

She is almost afraid to join them. 

“I’m okay. I just wasn’t prepared for his intensity, that’s all.. He was just playing the game. And he’s really good at it.” She tells herself, before facing her fears and going downstairs.
