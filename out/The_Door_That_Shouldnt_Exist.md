I had lived in the same small apartment for three years. I knew every creaky floorboard, every annoying draft, and every spot where the paint peeled just a little too much. However, one morning, as I walked down the short hallway toward the kitchen, I stopped. There, on the left-hand side of the hall—where there had always been a blank wall—stood a door.

It was old, its wood splintering, its handle rusted. The paint was peeling, revealing layers of colors underneath—gray, red, black. I touched it, half expecting my hand to pass through, as if this were some hallucination. But no, the wood was real, rough under my fingers.

I stepped back, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

This door hadn’t been there yesterday.

I pulled out my phone, snapped a picture, sent it to my landlord, and then called him.

“There’s a door in my hallway,” I said, my voice unsteady.

A pause. Then laughter. “Of course there is.   Every apartment has doors.”

“No,” I yelled, glancing at it again. “This one wasn’t here before.  It just appeared out if nowhere”

My landlord sighed and with an annoyed tone asked, “Have you been drinking?”

I don't drink and with clenched teeth I told him to just forget it.  I hung up and stared at the door.

I should just ignore it. That’s what any sane person would do. But something about it felt… wrong. The air around it was thick, heavy, like stepping into a room where someone had just been smoking. I leaned in closer.

A faint scratching sound came from the other side.

I jumped and stumbled back.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Absolutely not.

I turned, grabbed my car keys, and left the apartment.

Nightfall

I spent the whole day out, trying to convince myself that when I returned, the door would be gone. But when I stepped inside that evening, it was still there.

Worse, it was slightly open.

Darkness seeped from the crack, thick and unmoving. The air smelled stale, like old books and damp earth.

I should leave. Move out. Call an exorcist. But instead, I found myself stepping forward.

My fingers brushed the door, and it swung inward with a low groan. Beyond it was not another room, not the other side of my apartment—but a hallway. A long, impossibly dark hallway.

Something in that darkness shifted.

I felt my breath hitch as I saw movement—shapes that weren’t quite human, too tall, too thin, their limbs stretching unnaturally.

Then the whispering began.

It wasn’t a language I knew or had ever heard before, but I understood it all the same.

“Come inside.”

I staggered back and slammed the door shut. My chest heaved.

For a long time, there was silence.

Then, from the other side, something knocked.

Once.

Twice.

Then a slow, deliberate third time.

I never opened the door again.

But every night, just as I was about to fall asleep, I would hear the knocking.

And every night, the door opened just a little wider.
