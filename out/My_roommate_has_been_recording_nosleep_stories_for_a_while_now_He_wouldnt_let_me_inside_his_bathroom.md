The Sleepaway Show was popular on my college radio. 

JJ Savrin, Nicholas Mayflower, and Elena Fisher. 

I was a big fan of their horror narrations. 

“Yoooo, and welcome to another episode of The Sleepaway Show! I'm your host, JJ Savrin! I'm here with Nick and Elena, and we’ve got a crazy story for you! It's by Reddit user Broken-but-not-bent, and it's called Metal Baby. Now, this story is horror, but it's got a liiiitle bit of M. Night mixed in. It's one of my faves–”

“Hey!”

I flinched. It was too early for jump scares.

My ‘YouTuber’ roommate was in front of me, waving his arms. I pulled out an earphone, already anticipating the kind of conversation we were going to have. 

The second he opened his mouth, I was ready for the complaining. 

“I got a bad comment.” Connor grumbled, slumping down in front of me. “This one is threatening to strike my channel. They're relentless.”

He waved his phone with a scoff. “Shouldn't authors be happy they're being recognised?”

I forced a smile, resting my chin on my fist. “Do you think… maybe it's because you're using their stories without asking?” I said. “I mean, you did get a whole channel taken down–”

Connor rolled his eyes. “Nah. They're public domain, so I can use them if I want.” He pulled out a pack of chips, stuffing a handful in his mouth. “Also, the AI voice sounds human.” He prodded his phone. “See? Listen.”

When he started the video, a human-ish voice began the story, immediately pronouncing a typo. 

Connor was right. It did *sound* human, but it wasn't human enough. It was too perfect, with the exact same drone-ey tone. Admittedly, AI had gotten better from text to speech to an *almost* human voice. But it wasn't the real thing.

Connor studied me with slightly manic eyes. 

“Well? What do you think?”. 

“It's good,” I said. “But why don't you read them? You have a good enough voice.”

My roommate shrugged. “I dunno. It's easier to just run it through an AI. I just copy and paste the story, and it's done.”

I regarded him with *the look*. 

 “Uh-huh.”

I corked one headphone back in, bleeding back into my favourite show.

JJ was in the middle of a monologue, his raspy voice immediately embodying the character. I could hear every piece of his voice, every breath, every time he messed up and choked on a laugh, or quietly correcting himself. But *he* was human. His mistakes, his awkward breathing and the cheap microphone letting in outside ambience. Even his stuttering, the way he mispronounced words and fucked up accents. All of it was painfully and *beautifully* human. 

Metal Baby was a great story, and it ended with some of the best voice acting I had heard from The Sleepaway Show. Elena and Nick sounded insane, and JJ made the perfect unreliable narrator.

Especially for the Shutter Island type twist. 

When it was over, Elena thanking their college patrons, I tugged out an earphone and settled my roommate with a smile. 

Connor was glaring at his phone. When he caught my eye, he scowled. “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”

Instead of answering him, I held up my phone, displaying the show. “Why not try finding a *real* human voice?” I said. 

“You have cash from your job, right? Dump the robot-sounding AI, and pay a voice actor.”

I watched my roommate's expression crumple. 

“Fuck.” he tapped his phone, a smile curving on his lips. 

“You really think it'll work?”

“Well, yeah. The Dark Somnium. Mr Creeps. Lighthouse Horror. What do they all have in common?”

Connor’s lip twitched. “Millions of subscribers? Listeners who are obsessed with rule -based stories?”

“Human voices.” I said. “AI channels do exist with stupid amounts of followers, but they don't get nearly enough traction.”

Connor hummed. “So, what I need is a human voice?”

“Bingo.”

When I got home that night, I got a text from Connor. 

**Don't come into my bathroom! Narration in progress.**

Bathroom ambience, I thought. 

Sure. 

The next day, though, to my surprise, The Sleepaway Show wasn't broadcast. On the college website, the page was offline. 

Elena published a post a few hours later explaining that the three of them were still hungover from the night before, so there would be no show. I was bummed. 

I was looking forward to JJ’s narration of a new cosmic horror story they were teasing. 

Days went by, and still no show. 

Elena had stopped posting updates. 

Her last one simply said: **PLEASE stop asking! We’re sick lol. No show this week.**

That was weird. Especially when the three had managed to do a show suffering with food poisoning from bad shellfish. 

I was checking for updates when I got home around 5pm.

No sign of Connor. 

His laptop was open in his room. 

He was editing. 

I couldn't help it, risking a peek at his latest narration. I always get curious about the stories he chooses. Connor is a big fan of psychological horror. 

Getting comfy in his chair, and taking an awkward sip from his lukewarm coffee, I pressed play on the edit. I'm not sure what it was that twisted my gut. 

The coffee tasted kind of weird, and it was too hot in his room. 

But, as I fast forwarded the edit, I realized I was listening to a familiar voice. I wasn't expecting JJ’s Savrin’s tone to bleed from the speakers. 

So soon, too. It's not like I was doubting that he'd say yes to narrating, but he'd been sick, right? I twisted around, studying my roommate's room for recording equipment. Nothing. 

Just a broken microphone on his floor, the one I accidentally stood on. 

JJ’s narration sounded normal, at first. 

But further into it, I began to notice something was *wrong* with it. The charm was gone, his smooth, velvet murmur had been airbrushed, perfected into a horrifying, AI-like robotic drone. There were zero mistakes, or breaths, or laughter. 

*It was late when I left the restaurant.” 

JJ’s voice was too perfect, skipping over the voice of the character, the atmosphere he put into his tone. “I was locking the door when I noticed something was behind me.” 

The period at the end of the sentence was too noticeable. 

Not natural. 

“Oh no.” JJ continued in that same robotic drawl. “Did a customer want to kill me?”

The AI voice faltered, and this time, I *did* hear a gasp. 

It sounded like pain. 

Running through the edit, there were still chunks of recording, untouched. 

“I… ice… cream…I…”

The sudden sharp inhalation of breath exploding from the speakers sent ice sliding down my spine. It was too human. I could see it in the levels, the way they hit red. 

“It's so… dark. I can't see... anything."

The voice splintered into a cry, and this time, in the footage my roommate was trying to remove, to cut away, JJ did sound human. His shaky breaths shuddered through the speakers. 

“Please, can someone help me? I don't know where I–” The edit skipped, bleeding back into the story. I was already backing away from Connor’s laptop, my heart in my throat. 

I remembered stabbing the off switch on the laptop, but the voice continued, spluttering and crackling. 

This time it was coming from behind me. 

The bathroom. 

“Is… someone there? I'm locked in the bathroom, man. I want to go home.”

JJ Savrin. 

Was in our house. 

Worse, my psycho roommate has kidnapped him, attempting to steal his voice. 

When I stepped back, his cry was louder. 

“Fuck! Is someone there? Answer me!"

“JJ?” I found myself in a daze, walking towards my roommate's bathroom. 

“What... did he do to you?”

The guy let out a strangled cry. “Your psycho friend locked me in the bathroom! I think I'm blindfolded. I…I can't see anything, “ he paused, “Can you get me the fuck out of here?”

I swallowed down something slimy. “Did Connor do this to you?”

He broke out into a sob. “He knocked me out. I think he wants me to narrate for him. Which isn't happening, by the way. The lunatic is trying to steal my fucking voice!”

With shaky hands, I grabbed the icy handle, which turned, to my surprise. 

“The door isn't locked,” I said. “Did he tie you up?”

The boy groaned. “Obviously! I can't fucking move!"

Opening the doors, I stopped, paralysed, and JJ’s voice faltered, breaking into a sob. 

The contrast of red and white made my head spin.

”Can you… take off my blindfold? I'm… fuck, I'm terrified of the dark, man.”

I found my voice, stepping directly into warm red. It pooled between my toes. 

“Sure.” I said. 

I’ve been talking to a therapist about my reaction to what I found in my roommate's bathroom.

She says it was my mind trying to both deny and deal with trauma, but I'm pretty sure I had lost my fucking mind. 

“I love your show.” I hummed, pulling out my phone and dialling 911. "You're a talented narrator."

9123.

9223.

912.

9013.

It took me five tries, and I think I threw up all over myself. 

The toilet bowl was splattered with blood. 

“I… thanks?” The boy let out a spluttered laugh. 

I was aware of the ice cold steel of my phone pressed to my ear. 

“You're welcome.” 

”You've found me.” JJ whispered, when my gaze found the trash can overflowing with deep red, fleshy mounds of pink and white. 

I wasn't staring at JJ Savrin. 

“I... have.” 

I was looking at his remnants. 

Stuffed into the toilet bowl, a single lump of pink, wires protruding from it. 

The thing pulsed, JJ Savrin’s cry collapsing into a robotic drone. 

JJ’s voice didn't make sense. 

It was alive. While he *wasn't.*

“So, why… why can't I see you?” His voice stuttered. "I can't see *anything*."

When I couldn't physically reply, he started to cry. 

I heard every wet, human sounding sob. 

“Are you… still… there?” He asked me, over and over again. 

I didn't reply. 

But he kept going, and I could hear them getting progressively more hysterical. 

When the police surrounded me, JJ spoke again. “What's your... name?”

The sheriff shook his head, but I couldn't stop myself. 

“I'm Sadie.”

A pause, before, “Can you stay with me, Sadie?”

I nodded, on my knees, struggling to breathe. 

“Yeah.” I said. “I'm here, JJ.”

The rest is a blur. 

It still is a blur, and this was almost a year ago. 

Whatever was left of the narrator was disposed of. I wasn't even fully conscious, sitting in the back of an ambulance, my roommate's laptop squeezed to my chest. 

The cops said it was evidence, but I didn't want to give it to them. 

Due to the horrific nature of JJ Savrin’s murder, the full details were never released, and his full name was covered up. Nick and Elena have dumped the show, and the show itself has been wiped from existence. I heard Nick tried to kill himself a month ago. 

Elena published a blog exposing what really happened to JJ, warning Youtube narrators. 

It was deleted, of course, but she wasn't wrong. 

I don't think people will go to extremes like my roommate, but human voices are precious. 

Connor was taken away in cuffs, and he genuinely doesn't understand what he's done wrong. I think my roommate was so obsessed with views and comments, he would do anything to get them. And I was the one who pointed him to his victim. 

The last thing he said to me was, “What? You told me to use a *human* voice!”

Crazy bastard.

In a way, though, this *was* my fault. And I'll live with this shit for the rest of my life. 

I still have Connor’s laptop, and JJ is still with me. 

At least, I like to think he is.
