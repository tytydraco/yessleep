I know it hasn't been that long since my last post, and I'm sure that you all have a lot of questions. I wanted to get this all written while the memory was fresh. A lot has happened since my last post, and in such a short time.

I must have sat in that car for hours, but the sun never came up. Since my car keys were now in that infernal house, and my phone was going back and forth between working and not working couldn't say what time it was. The only thing I knew (and I dreaded it with every fiber of my being) was that I needed to go back into that house and get my keys. I couldn't walk back to the nearest road, especially not with those beasts lurking in the woods. It was only a fit of blind insanity that the thought of them was pushed out of my mind long enough to get back to my car.

I sat in that driver's seat for hours trying debating what I was going to do, but I only had one choice. I needed to go back into that god forsaken cabin. Even with those beasts in the woods, it was my only option really. I finally figured that I could die in my car like a coward, or I could face the challenge in front of me, and quite possibly die doing so. I finally made a decision, and I grabbed what was left of my backpack, and I got out of my car.

The crip air of the pitch-black night shocked my senses a little when I got out of the car. I quickly looked around as if it would help me any. It was so dark outside that I could barely see two feet in front of me. The starts shone through the canopy of trees, but it was almost like the area around me was devoid of their light, or of any light. I took one big, deep breath and started walking.

It sounds crazy, but I swear I could feel the pull of the building guiding me back to it, like some unseen rope was tied around me. That was the deceptive nature of the building. It offers a guiding hand in unfamiliar terrain, and then ensnares you like a Venus Fly Trap. I was about three-quarters of the way there when I heard a low growl. I now knew they were watching me. Unsure of whether they intended to harm me or not at this point I continued cautiously walking. The low growl was soon replaced by crunching leaves behind me, and I quickened my pace.

As soon as it came into view my heart sunk. The beast had left a large scratch mark on the door right above the door handle. I wasn't quite sure before but could now see how close the beast actually came to grabbing my hand instead of ripping a hole in my backpack. I could see where the contents had spilled out onto the porch, and in a vain attempt to save myself a trip inside that building I frantically searched for my keys. No luck. I had to prepare myself for the journey ahead now. I had to go back inside. I turned around to see something that shook me out of my pensiveness. The beasts were there again, but this time they weren't just sitting there. They were coming closer to me. I quickly stood, grabbed the handle, and entered the building.

The long hallway was before me now, and that glow from the other side of the hallway sent chills down my spine. I cautiously advanced, looking everywhere for that creature I had run into last time. I came upon the cells I was shocked. There were more cells there this time. Where last time I could count maybe nine or ten, there were easily twenty cells lining the walls now. What was happening? Who or what were these things in the cells? Both questions that would have to wait for now. I heard a noise coming from the opposite side of the hall. I quickly ducked away and slid onto the wall. My hope was that it was dark enough that whatever made that noise couldn't see me.

I was searching through my backpack trying to see if I had anything I could use against the unseen threat, and eventually I found a can of pepper spray. An odd choice, I'm aware, but you can never be too sure of who you'll see in the woods. I also didn't own a gun, so this was all I had. I also had some hope that it would enough to stop a bear, but that was just me being cheap, so I didn't have to shell out more money for bear spray. As I grabbed the can, I saw something at the end of the hall. It looked like a person, but unlike last time I thought I saw a humanoid silhouette, it didn't change. It kept walking towards me, and I prepared myself to use the pepper spray in the hope that it would give me enough time to run at least. "That won't do you much good here." Came a gruff, old sounding voice from the direction of the silhouette.

I held up the can, ready to spray it in a moment's notice, and I began walking toward the figure. "Who are you? What is this place?" I asked, hoping my attempt at confidence would somehow dissuade the figure from attacking me. "Neither you or I have time for me to be answering questions." The reply came. knocking away any hope that I had that I would get any answers. "I assume you've become well acquainted with the beast, which also means, that I assume you don't want another run in with it, so we have to get moving before it finds you." The man's comment had a double-edged effect of reassuring me that I wasn't crazy, but also reaffirming that what I was experiencing was in fact real. "What is it?" I asked, hoping to get any answer. "It is known by many names, and it speaks in many tongues that are not its own." His reply came, shocking me not only because the man actually answered my question, but because his response meant that the voice that I heard before wasn't just me imagining things.

"Quick, we need to get going now. It knows you're here and it won't take long for it to find you." said the man. He turned around and began walking toward the orange glow, and against my better judgement, I followed.

As soon as we entered the realm beyond the hallway I had come to know, what I saw nearly made my knees give out. It was like an underground city. The place was lit in orange by some unseen light source. The buildings around the city looked dilapidated and out of place in the massive cave-like area. "We must go." The man said. I could now see him clearly. He was a Native American man and looked to be about in his sixties. He wore what looked to be a shirt made of hide, and there were beads strewn about it. He had his grey hair pulled back and braided, and in the back was a single feather. He carried a bag, its contents unknown to me. I think he noticed me studying him, because He quickened his pace and said, "We have to hurry. This beast is a true hunter. It will not take long for it to locate us, even on the move." I matched his pace, and we continued on our way.

"How did you get here?" I asked the man, hoping his answer wouldn't come in the form of silence or another scolding reminder to keep walking. "I was sent out into the wilderness to hunt the beast by my tribe elders." He replied. "I was among the best of our hunter. I could track a deer for miles with but a few tracks and my wits. I was sent with several other, but none of them made it this far." He replied. "Time moves different in here, so truly I do not know how long it has been." His reply came with a hint of sadness. We went on in silence for about another thirty feet, then he said, "Stop. This is the place."

It was an area that narrowed out around the odd-looking buildings. It seemed to be an odd place to stop, as it dead ended not too far in front of us. The man took off his bag and began searching it. He pulled out four items: some sage, a flint, some other rock I didn't recognize, and what looked like a very shiny metal knife. It almost looked like the knife was made of silver. As he laid them out before him, I heard something spine tingling. "Help!" Cried a voice from somewhere in the direction we had just come. I instinctually got up and began heading toward it, but I was stopped by the man. "Don't!" He yelled, his yell making me freeze in place. "It is trying to draw you to it." He said, as he stood up and looked me in my eyes. "We must make it come to us." He said. "Hold on a minute." I said, shocked to hear his plan. "I thought we were staying away from it, not trying to take it on. Last time I even saw this thing, I barely got away with my life."

He stared at me, his ayes piercing my soul. "You cannot run from this creature. Many have tried, and I myself have even attempted to do so. It hunts without tiring. It will not stop until it catches you." His words frightened me to my core. How could I escape this thing if it never stopped looking for me. A feeling shot right through me then and there, and I then made a decision I was sure to regret. "Alright, what's the plan?"

He described how the creature would come to us, and he would wait for it to get close. He would light the sage, which he believed would ward away the creature. I would then come around the creature with some sage as well, essentially trapping the creature. He would then advance and stab the creature in the heart with his knife. It was a bit of a half-baked plan if you ask me, but I hadn't been able to come up with a better one. He handed me the sage, and just as he did, I saw something round into view.

It looked like a child, which was different then last time. It had me fooled at first. The child was crying, but when it went to say something, its voice distorted into something hellish and only barely reminiscent of a child. "Can you help me?" As it said this, the tears stopped, and the child began smiling. Its head cocked to the side the same way it had during my last encounter with the creature. I began hearing sloshing and the cracking of bones. the childish figure began distorting and stretching, the skin tearing from its increasingly exposed grayish limbs. By the time it had finished its transformation, the creature was close to fifteen feet tall, the skin of the child hanging from its frame. I was horrified to say the last at what I had just witnessed. The creature began sprinting on all fours at me, its speed even more astonishing than during our first encounter.

I couldn't move. I just stood there frozen. "Move!" the man yelled, and when I could not, he reluctantly lit up his sage and ran toward the creature. It must have had a weaker effect than he had anticipated because I could almost see fear growing in his eyes the closer he got to the creature. He didn't stop. He began slowly circling the creature with the sage. I still couldn't move. With one swift motion, he lunged at the creature with his knife. He missed and the creature swiped its massive claw at him, tearing the flesh on his back. He screamed in pain, but never let up.

He gained his position again, and this time he lunged at the creature's chest. The creature barely had to make an effort this time. It grabbed his hand and pulled him up until his feet were no longer touching the ground and his face and the creature's face were level. It looked at him with its cold, red eyes and in one swift movement, it shoved its other clawed hand right into his chest. He dropped the knife, and I just stood there. I went to drop the man, but with his last breath, and with everything he had left in him he shoved the sage directly into the creature's face.

It reeled back screaming, each second bringing a new voice with it. The sound was even more horrifying than the sight of the creature dropping the man's limp body in front of it. I don't know why, but I knew this was my opportunity. I gathered everything I had in me, and I ran over to the man, finally breaking my paralysis, and with his dying breath he uttered the words "Finish the job."

I grabbed the knife from beside the now lifeless husk of the man that had been so kind as to save me from a similar fate. I knew what I had to do. I ran up to the creature, which was still screaming and reeling. I ran up, and before I could even get to it, it swung its massive claw at me, sending me flying to the side. I dropped the knife as I soared through the air, and it seems my approach was all the creature needed to gain back some semblance of composure. I had sage of my own, but it was probably useless unlit. I stood up and the creature was staring at me. Rage filled its eyes as it focused on me. I began running toward the knife, but it beat me there. I tried turning to avoid the worst of it, but the creature swung its arm at me and the feeling of its claws tearing my flesh made me scream.

It bolted toward me and bolted to where the man had left those two rocks. I grabbed them and struck them together, making sure the sage was position in the line of the sparks. The creature was upon me now, the smell of rotting flesh filling my lungs. I almost gagged because of this, but my focus kept me from doing so. Just in time, the sage lit. I looked up, and it was one bound away from reaching me. I mimicked the dying actions of my friend, and I grabbed the sage and shoved it forward, hoping that I would be able to make contact. It ran directly into my hand, snapping the bone with the sheer impact. I screamed in pain, but so did the creature. My hand was bent completely backwards, the bone very visible. I didn't have time to focus on the pain. As quickly as I could, I ran over and grabbed the knife. The creature looked more in pain this time than last, and the screams of a thousand men, women, and most chilling of all, children rang throughout the area.

I grabbed the knife and ran to the creature, which was reeling in pain on the ground. I saw its chest was exposed, and I took the knife and did exactly what the man had planned to do all along. I stabbed the creature in the heart. Must've done it at least twenty times. All I know is that by the end of it all, the creature was no longer screaming. I saw my keys on one of its antlers, and it was almost a funny sight. I had come so far just get these damned keys and look at all that ensued.

I grabbed them and ran for my life. I ran all the way back to the accursed hallway, and through that infernal door. The beasts were no longer along the tree line and bolted in the direction I had burned into my memory. I must've been running for hours, but it didn't matter. There was enough adrenaline in my system to kill a full-grown elephant. I got back to my car and the pain of my arm came back to the forefront. I took my belt off and tightened it as tight as possible to staunch the flow of blood. I had done all I could with that. I turned on my car. The sound of it starting almost sounded like a choir. I drove as quickly as I could to the nearest hospital.

I arrived at the hospital, and they rushed me into surgery. They were surprised that I had arrived alive from all the blood that I lost. I got my arm all put back into place, and they put a cast on my arm. Said I had to wear it for like six months for the bone to heal properly. I got out of the hospital and went home. To be clear I went to my familiar, third-story apartment, not that hell hole that led me to all of this.

I listed the house for sale and told the realtor that I would pay whatever needed paid, but I was never going back to that house again.

It's only been a few days, and I know I have a lot to deal with now, but I have noticed some strange things happening. Call me crazy, but I could swear I could smell rotting flesh around my apartment.

Anyways, I should rap this up. My eyes have been getting really bloodshot recently, and I think it's best if I get out of the apartment.
