I run a horror/mystery podcast and people submit their 'true' stories to me either my emails or actual letters sent to me by post.  
I mostly get the disoriented, mad people going in and about with their ramblings which make utterly no sense.  
It really is a pain in the ass to organize and read all that stuff.  
But I received this.. interesting tale, via letter.  
The part on the letter itself where it's supposed to state the address from where it's sent seems to be.. blurred and unrecognizable.  
Like someone dropped water on the letters, the words are smudged.  
The rest of the letter is readable, and I thought I might share the tale with you guys.  


  
  
*Hello. My name is Jack Wilfred.*  
*I heard your program collects all kinds of paranormal encounters to urban legends.*  
*I have an ongoing tale to share; hence I sent you this letter.*  
  
*It all started on the start of New Year.*  
*As you know, it was January and everyone was in a festive mood, including myself.*  
*I hosted a house party at, January 3rd.*  
*Being the extroverted person I am, most of my colleagues and a few of my old friends were there.*  
*We were getting pleasantly drunk, while some of them were smoking pot.*  
*Yes, I know, weed is not exactly legal in our city.*  
*But that's the whole point of a home party, isn't it?*  
*Getting high and enjoying ourselves.*  
*Anyways, back to my tale.*  
*My point is that while I was a bit tipsy from wine, I wasn't on any drugs.*  
*No, not weed.*  
*I left the living room and into my kitchen to fetch my phone.*  
*It was sitting on my table, right next to some poor lads' tipped booze.*  
*Luckily my phone wasn't particularly damaged by the alcohol, and I wiped the droplets off my screen.*  
*When I turned my phone on, I noticed that my mother sent me a few messages.*  
  
*It was the usual pleasantries, how are you doing, how's work, happy New Year and all that stuff.*  
*I called her, since I was drunk I couldn't really text an understandable sentence.*  
*We talked for a while, about nothing that important.*  
*The subject of my relatives came up, and I asked mother how one of my cousins, Elizabeth Moore was doing.*  
*We were great pals when we were younger, she and I.*  
*We don't really kept in touch over the years, but I was curious how she was doing.*  
*Then something weird happened.*  
  
*Mother replied who she was.*  
  
*I frowned.*  
*She knew Liz well, how could she not remember?*  
*Liz came over to my house all the time back when we were in elementary school.*  
*I asked again.*  
*She really.. didn't seem to know her.*  
*I asked a few more times, but it seemed mother couldn't remember a single thing about Elizabeth.*  
*I quickly ended the call after that.*  
  
*She definitely used to know Liz.*  
*It was all too weird, and I felt that uncanny feeling growing in the pit of my stomach.*  
*I tried to shake it off with a few more bottles of booze.*  
*I slept on my sofa, along with my friends sprawled in my living room.*  
  
*The next day, I felt a better, despite my hang over.*  
*I went to work clutching my aching head and well, that was that.*  
*Despite all that strangeness, well, life still carried on.*  
  
*Days passed and the incident with my cousin seemed to fade in my memory.*  
*Unfortunately, something out of the ordinary happened again.*  
*One of my colleagues from work was missing.*  
*Their whole desk was cleared, like they never worked there in the first place.*  
*Same thing as Liz.*  
  
*I asked around, even cautiously asking my boss about them.*  
*Nothing.*  
*They weren't even in our company records.*  
  
*This time it shook me much more than Elizabeth's disappearance.*  
*They worked with me, even the day before they disappeared.*  
*They were a nice guy, they always made the best coffee.*  
*They just... disappeared, one minute they're there, complaining to me about their wage which never seems to rise, then poof! Out of existence.*  
  
*I freaked out, of course I would.*  
*I wondered if they were really nonexistent or if I'm hallucinating or something.*  
*I even went to a psychiatrist for that.*  
*Of course, the experts chalked it up to a mental disease.*  
*Told me to take meds and whatnot.*  
*Aside from that, I came up empty handed, without an explanation.*  
  
*It all went worse from then on.*  
*Things escalated quickly.*  
*One day my niece, a week later that kind young man owning the flower shop, my ex-girlfriend....*  
*On and on.*  
*People blinked out of existence.*  
*I swear, I was sober and probably sane through it all.*  
  
*I could see the lights blinking out from the apartment building next street.*  
*One night the windows from one flat would be lit, and then the next day they wouldn't.*  
*They never returned.*  
*Every night I would watch it from my room, counting how many windows were lit after the sun fell.*  
*Hell, I even took pictures.*  
*They confirmed me what I suspected.*  
  
*Everyone near me, it seemed, to be becoming nonexistent at frightening speed.*  
*The apartment became completely dark, devoid of any life.*  
*I barely met people when I went out to the streets.*  
*It was about a month ago when my father disappeared.*  
*A week later, my mom too.*  
  
*I still have her number.*  
*I still call it sometimes.*  
*The voice responder tells me that the number does not exist.*  
*I have to embrace the fact that she simply does not exist in this world.*  
  
*It's almost the end of October.*  
*Today, my neighbor next door disappeared.*  
*I met the old lady almost every day.*  
  
*I knocked on her door.*  
  
*I slammed my fists on her door.*  
  
*I screamed.*  
  
*No one came out, and no one complained about the noise.*  
  
*Of course no one would.*  
  
*My whole flat is fucking empty.*  
  
  
*Am I imagining things?*  
  
*Did they even really exist?*  
  
*Or have I made them up, just so I wouldn't lose my mind in this desolate place?*  
  
***Am I.. the one being forgotten?***  
  
*Lost, in this empty, hollow wasteland?*  
  
*I don't know.*  
  
*I am so fucking scared.*  
*The whole city is black during the night.*  
*I don't think I can be saved at this point.*  
  
***Please, I hope I am not too late.***  
***Remember my existence.***  
***I am Jack.***  
***Jack Wilfred.***  
***I hope my letter reaches you on time.***
