I don’t know if this belongs here, but I’m posting it anyway. I don’t know where else to put it without sounding like a lunatic. If this gets deleted – fine, so be it. If you think I’m paranoid, please say so plainly.

My name is Daniel, a 36-year-old divorced accountant. Two kids, Noah (10) and Grace (7). I have them every Wednesday and every other weekend. I’m not dumb, I’m not dramatic, I don’t drink, and I didn’t used to be the kind of person who checks the window lock twice at 3 a.m.

I keep telling myself I started this. I made the call.

But it was nothing. That’s the part that makes me want to throw up: it was nothing. Someone scratched my car – with keys, I think – three vertical scratches on the driver’s door. There was also a folded paper under the wiper that said, “keep quiet.” No name, no signature. I don’t even have anyone to “keep quiet” about. I do spreadsheets for mid-market manufacturing firms. The loudest thing I do is yell at QuickBooks.

Nonetheless, I had Noah and Grace that night. They were asleep in their room (my two-bed rental), and in my head it spun out: ‘what if someone had tried the door?’ What if someone was watching us? It was late, and my ex-wife, Natalie, would have told me to be sensible and go to bed, but I wanted to be responsible. Be the kind of dad who doesn’t shrug off weird notes.

So I called the non-emergency number. They said they’d send someone if there was a car free. Twenty minutes later, there was a tap at my door and a man with a warm smile and a police hat.

“Evening, Dan,” he said. The name snapped me to attention. I hadn’t told him my name yet. “Officer Michael Green, but everyone calls me Mike.”

He shook my hand, very firm and kind of warm. He smelled like clean wool and coffee; I don’t even know why I remembered that. My heart rate dropped. I don’t know how to explain it, but he radiated ‘handled.’ Like, you know, if a fight broke out in a coffee shop, he’d stand and everything would go quiet. I felt stupidly grateful.

We walked down to my car and he shone his torch and took some photos. He picked up the paper with two fingers – like they do in movies – and asked, “Anything come to mind that’d make someone want to rattle you?”

“I do taxes,” I replied simply, and he laughed once, like a short warm bark.

He was very nice to my kids when they shuffled into the hall in their pyjamas to see who was at the door. He immediately went down to a knee like kids were his native language and said, “I’m just helping your dad make sure everything’s safe. Back to bed, okay? Big day tomorrow.”

They were starry-eyed. When I tucked them back in, Grace whispered, “Daddy, he looks like a superhero.”

“He’s a good guy,” I whispered back, and I meant it.

At the end of the night he gave me a white business card and then scribbled his cell on the back. “If anything feels off, call this number,” he said. “Dispatch can be quite slow. I’d rather you woke me. You’ve got kids. You did the right thing.”

And it may sound hilarious and maybe even embarrassing, but that line – ‘you did the right thing’ – I don’t know. It went through me like a heat pad on a bruised muscle. After the divorce, there’s always this specific kind of shame I carry around – like I’m made of thin glass. Natalie never meant to make me feel small, but in the end we did that to each other anyway. So hearing that I’d done something right from someone like him, someone who seemed like what I think of as an actual man – it was embarrassing how much it mattered to me in that moment.

He winked at me. “Get some sleep, Dan. I’ll swing by tomorrow and make sure your car’s here.”

“Thanks,” I said, and again, I meant that one too.

For the first week it felt like being looked after by a friendly neighbour who happened to wear a uniform.

He called the next afternoon just to “check the temperature” – his phrase. “How’re the kids? Everybody eating?” He said it like he knew the answer would be “yes,” but asking was the point.

Two days later, when I got home from a client meeting, there was a brown paper bag on my doormat with a bottle of Coke, granola bars, and a small note: ‘You forget to eat when you’re stressed. – M.’ I actually laughed. I texted a photo to my friend Pete and he texted back, “kinda weird but also extremely nice??” I texted Natalie that someone from the department had been really helpful and she wrote back, saying: “see? there are good people.”

When I had the kids that Wednesday, a cruiser idled on the curb out front for about twenty minutes. After bath time, Noah pressed his face to the blinds and whispered, “He’s watching over us.” It made me choke a little. I waved at the dark windshield, and the headlights actually blinked twice.

“Coincidence,” I said, laughing slightly, and he smiled and said, “I’m everywhere,” and it was obviously a joke, obviously, but I thought about it later while watching TV, and it didn’t feel like a joke when it echoed.

He remembered things I didn’t even remember telling him: my usual run time (I jog sometimes around the park at 6:30 when I don’t have the kids), Grace’s dentist appointment, that I put spinach on scrambled eggs. Sounds weird written out, but it flattered me. I felt like I was being seen.

“I wish I had your calm,” I told him once, and he squeezed my shoulder and said: “You’ve got it. You just forget it when it matters. That’s what I’m for.”

It sounds like flirting typed out, but it didn’t feel that way. It felt paternal. That’s the part that gets me. He was like a dad to me, except we were the same age.

The first time I felt something slip was so small I almost ignored it. He stopped by on a Tuesday, said he was nearby, and I let him in and offered some coffee. He did a walk-through like it was a rental open house. “Windows latch okay? Deadbolt flush?” He lifted the bathroom window – latched – and set it back down. He looked in the kids’ room but hadn’t touched anything.

“Everything’s right.” He said the words like it was a blessing. “Everything’s right.”

He left. Ten minutes later I realised I hadn’t used my key when I came home. I had buzzed my own intercom, which is something I never do. The door had been unlocked when I got upstairs.

I texted him: “hey, did I leave the door open?”

His reply came instantly: “I saw it was unlocked. I just pushed it shut so it wouldn’t swing open. Call me if you want me to run by and get it checked again.”

Reasonable. Kind. My chest was tight, but not with fear. With shame, mostly, because he was doing so much and I had left the door open.

Next Friday I came home early (the client had cancelled). The apartment smelled like coffee and lemon cleaner. Mr. Green was in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, leaning over the window latch.

“I knocked,” he said, and lifted his left hand so I could see my spare key between his fingers. “Your landlord gave me a set in case you weren’t home. We had a report of someone rattling mailboxes on the block.”

I think my face made a shape I couldn’t control. He read it and softened. “I should’ve texted first, Dan. That’s on me. It’s on me.”

“It’s okay,” I said. “I appreciate you. Really. It’s… weird, but I appreciate it.”

He looked directly at me like we were in a meeting room. “Weird is okay. You’re a dad under stress. I’d rather be a little weird and have you alive than give you space and come to regret it.”

I nodded, and I… kinda meant it. But that evening when I put the kids to bed and went to brush my teeth, I looked at the fogging mirror and the words ‘weird is okay’ wrote themselves there without steam.

You can call this the moment where objectivity completely left. I told Natalie I was going to keep the kids with her for a while. “Just until everything settles,” I said, and she said, “What is ‘everything,’ Dan? A keyed car? Some nice cop checking on you too much?” We escalated. We always do. I get self-righteous and she gets cold. But then she surprised me: she said, “Look. If you want, let’s have coffee tomorrow. No sniping. I’ll listen.”

So we met at the quiet bakery by the elementary school. She took my hand and said, “Tell me this ‘everything’.” And I did. I told her about the calls and the bag of snacks and the landlord key and the feeling that my perimeter had changed shape and it wasn’t mine at all anymore.

She listened. She’s always been excellent at that, unlike me. She did this thing with her mouth where she presses her lips together tight and nods when she’s aligning her empathy with her scepticism.

When I finished, she squeezed my hand and said, so gently, “That’s exactly what Mr. Green told me you’d say.”

I pulled my hand back and just shockingly asked, “What?”

She didn’t flinch. “He came by on Wednesday. We talked. He said you might start feeling hemmed in because of the trauma. He said you’d feel like he was everywhere because you’re thinking about him. ‘Availability bias,’ he said.” She said the last words like she owned them. “He said you might feel watched, and that you might send the kids back to me, and that if that happened, I should keep things calm and not let you spiral.”

“Natalie,” I said, quietly, “he told you what I would say before I said it.”

“Yes,” she said, and smiled a sad but still kind smile that made me feel like a child. “Because that’s what happens. It’s normal. He’s good at this, Dan. He’s trying to protect you from yourself until it’s over.”

I walked home that day with my spine frozen. I almost texted him to say thank you for caring enough to talk to her, and then I didn’t, because some pocket of me had lit on fire. Knowing what I would say doesn’t make you wise, I’d thought – it makes you the author.

That night there was a break-in.

I woke to the soft wrong sound of a screw in the wood. I sat up and listened and heard the window in the living room whining on its old sash. Something flexed, then gave. I didn’t grab a weapon – I didn’t have any – I just grabbed my phone.

I called Mike’s number, of course I did. Two rings, “Dan. I’m here. Don’t move.”

I lay on the floor beside my bed like a child hiding from a thunderstorm. My hands shook so bad I could hear the bones in my wrists clicking.

Footsteps. A shape. A man in a hood, a hand gloved around a crowbar. He pushed my bedroom door open, and the hallway light made a halo around him – I just said “no no no” in a whisper, and then there was a crash and a shout. Officer Green was there, bursting in, tackling the masked man in a slow-motion documentary way, clean and vicious and fluid, cuffing him like he’d practiced on a CPR dummy a thousand times; which I guess he had.

“Breathe,” he said to me while the man on the floor moaned. He didn’t look at me when he said it. He said it to the room, I felt like he did. Repeating, “Breathe, Dan.”

So I breathed. This is the part I hate admitting because it makes everything that comes after look ungrateful, but: I just cried like a child. I put my face in my hands and cried it all, and he let me. The man on the floor swore and tried to kick him, but Green didn’t look angry. He looked like he was made out of iron.

When it was over, when the other officers had taken the handcuffed man down the stairs and everyone’s radios had stopped crackling my name, Green took me to the kitchen and made some tea like it was his kitchen; like he knew where the mugs were, which I think he did.

He slid the mug to me and touched my wrist. “You were right to call me,” he said. “You did everything right,” and I hated this phrase so much now.

But I still managed to say, “Thank you. I’m sorry if I seemed suspicious about you. I’m sorry, Mike.” The shame of it flooded me. The suspicion about the key and the shoulder, snacks, kids, all of it.

“I could feel offended,” he said, smiling softly, “but I know you, Dan. I get you. Trauma makes your world seem small. You try to control the people in it, and it’s just my job not to take it personally. It’s my job to be around.”

I believed him. Of course I did. I slept sitting up on the couch with my hands together like I was praying, and his car idled downstairs in the bluish light. And I felt safe for the first time in weeks.

The next morning I called Natalie to tell her what had happened and to say, if she maybe wanted to bring the kids to see me (not to stay – God, no – just to see), that it was safe now, because it was over. They had caught him.

Her number rang once and then a recorded voice said, “For safety reasons, and with the recommendation of Officer Michael Green, I’m not accepting calls from Daniel at this time. Please contact the department if this is urgent.”

I hung up and pulled the phone away and stared at it like it was a bug under glass. I tried again. Same message. I texted ‘please’ and the message immediately turned green and said not delivered.

I called 911, because what else do you do when you don’t know what to do. The dispatcher answered with a practiced calm that took me back to the first night. I said my name and she said, “Hold a moment, Mr. Hart,” and then there was a clunk that felt like a throat clearing and a different voice said, “You’re panicking again, Dan. Just breathe.”

“Did you… did you just transfer me to him?”

“This is a flagged case,” Green said. “It routes to me when your number comes up because I’m your point. That way you don’t have to tell it to three different people. You’re all covered.”

“You blocked my wife from me,” I said, and hated how small my voice sounded.

“Your ex-wife. I asked her to set a boundary while we get things quiet,” he said eventually. “You call from a place of fear and then you escalate. It’s not good for the kids to hear. You can talk in a couple of days.”

“What about the man from last night? What’s his name? Is there a case number? I want to know!”

“There’s a case number,” he said. “It’s in intake with the District Attorney, so it won’t be public. The booking’s sealed because of the overlap with other local cases. I’ll bring you the incident log.”

“Bring it? No. I’ll just come to the station.”

“I’d rather you stayed home this week,” he said. The tone had changed, and I only recognised it since my father used to lower his voice exactly one step when he wanted to end an argument without ending it. “It’s a bad week. Crime ticks up when the weather snaps. I’ll bring what you need. You’re better off inside your apartment.”

He did bring the papers, though. He wore an expression I can only call ‘clinical compassion.’ He showed me a one-page printout that had my address and the time and possible burglary in progress and one male detained and a blank where a name would be. Before I’d even ask, he said, “I know that blank looks like a void,” and smiled like it was a joke, “but it’s temporary. We’re good. You’re good.”

I put the paper on the table and looked at his hands. They were big, the nails neatly trimmed. He had an old scar at the base of his thumb, a pale semi-circle.

That afternoon a box arrived with my name on it, and inside were cans of soup, protein bars, and a fleece blanket that smelled faintly of someone else’s laundry. There was a note: ‘Let me carry this for a week. I’ll take the best care of you. – M.’

When he came back by that night I finally had the audacity to say: “Did you stage it?”

I had planned to say it like a statement, with an accusation’s stupid little chin – but it came out with my voice breaking on the ‘did.’

He didn’t blink, didn’t flare. He just sat down on my couch and set his hat on his knee and said, “I could’ve felt very offended by that, you know. But I know you, Dan. This is how our minds cope. They can’t reconcile the idea that something really almost happened, so they look for a more controllable story. That’s alright.” He tapped the printout on my table. “Here’s the CAD log. Ms. Halvorsen in 3B called 911 at 01:17. Check her doorbell camera. She told me she’d share the footage if you want to see it. We arrived at 01:19. My body cam was on the whole time. I can’t release that without a request, but it exists. You’re not crazy. You were in danger. I’m here.”

It was too perfect. Every sentence had a blanket around it. I could hear the rustle of it when he spoke. I wanted to yell anyway. I wanted to say, ‘Then why can’t I find it online?’ But I had checked, and he had an answer ready for that: ‘because it’s sealed for now.’ I wanted to say, ‘Then why did my wife block me, why didn’t she text me herself,’ and he had an answer ready for that too: ‘because it’s calmer for the kids if you calm through me.’

Every objection I raised, he set down gently on a shelf and labelled it. He never said I was wrong. He never raised his voice. He said things like, “It’s okay for you to feel that way” and “This is the part where you want to run” and “We’re going to ride this out together.”

I hated him for being so right about me.

I hated me for needing him.

Two days after the break-in, he stopped doing the friendly wave from the street. He just sat in the car, engine on, headlights off, watching my window with that forward lean that cops have like they’re about to stand up into the world. When I peeked through the blinds at 3:12 a.m., he was there. When I peeked at 4:27, still there. When I woke at 6:00, still.

I went to work the next morning because I’m not a ghost. HR called me within an hour, saying, “We heard about your situation,” her voice being so smooth just like Green’s. And of course, she said, “Officer Green reached out to recommend a wellness week. We’ll mark you as paid sick leave. Take care of yourself.”

“But I didn’t authorise that,” I said.

“We’re here to support you,” she said, “we value your well-being more.”

When I got home there was another box on the mat. This one had a toothbrush, razor, and deodorant. The note said, ‘Sometimes brushing helps. Eat. Shower. Small things. – M.’

I put the note in the drawer and found it again twenty minutes later on the table without remembering I’d put it there. That scared me more than anything else.

I started talking to myself, just under my breath, just to make some sound. I made lists out loud of what was real. “Noah is ten. Grace is seven. The car is a Honda. The couch is gray. The man outside is a police officer.” If I said “the man outside is a police officer” enough times in a row, the words stopped being words and became a chant.

I thought about walking downstairs and telling him to go home. To go home to his own kids (did he have them, though? he never said). I thought about telling him I needed him to step back. Then I pictured him tilting his head and saying, “You’re pushing the help away, Dan.”

I tried calling Natalie again. Straight to that recorded message. For safety reasons…

I called 911 again, and again, got him. He said, “Dan, the more you call, the more this becomes the story. Let’s keep this quiet. You’re alright. I’m right here.”

“Are you right…” I said, and hung up before he could reach through the phone with his calm.

That night, the lights flickered. It was a storm. It was nothing. But in the flicker I saw his silhouette through the curtains: him not moving, not checking his phone, not looking away. Waiting for the entire world to calm down. Just looking straight into my window.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take being protected. This was getting more and more insane.

I waited until Sunday morning when everyone’s attention was elsewhere. At 6:45 a.m. he finally took his thermos and got out of the car and walked toward the corner for reasons I will never know; not that I really want to. So I slipped into jeans, shoved my wallet in my backpack, and went down the back stairs through the laundry room where the lock sticks. I had planned to drive, but, being honest, the very idea of him seeing me turn the ignition made me anxiously nauseous. So I just tried to walk as fast as I could. I walked like a man late for a bus – not too suspicious, and not wasting any second. I turned my phone off, and turned it on again, then turned it off again, and finally threw it in a trash bin because the sound of even the possibility of it ringing made my skin crawl.

I cut through the alley behind the bakery where Natalie and I had sat and talked about ‘availability bias’. I walked to the bus stop and got on the first one without looking where it went. It went to the transit centre. I bought a ticket with cash and got on the first regional train. The whole time my mouth kept making the shape of sorry.

On the train I was sure every man in a dark jacket was a cop. I was sure every woman was Natalie pretending not to cry. I was sure every kid was mine recognising me and being told not to wave.

You can laugh at that. It’s okay. I would have laughed a year ago.

In the next city I found some random motel that disgustingly smelled like wet carpet and cigarettes. I slept there for two hours with one shoe on. I woke up and ate some crisps from a vending machine, and then – you may call it as stupid as possible, but what would you do being in my place – I went to the police station because what else do you do when you’re running from the police? Who else do you go to when you need to say the sentence I needed to say: ‘Please make a police officer stop protecting me.’

The front desk officer was younger than me. She listened. She didn’t interrupt. She took notes. “I’m not here to make any trouble,” I said. “I just want to be like… I want to be a person inside my own perimeter.”

“That makes sense, sir,” she said, and I swear to God, I almost cried at those four words. ‘That makes sense, sir.’ She typed a little more, and asked, “What’s the officer’s name?”

“Officer Michael Green,” I said, and spelled it like it might be a trick word.

She typed. She looked up. She looked down. She took the breath you take when you’re going to say something that will make a person think you hate them when you don’t – and I already knew exactly what she was going to say, for Christ’s sake.

“Mr. Hart,” she said – using my last name felt so weird from her – “Officer Green has already briefed us about your case. He said you might come here confused. You’re paranoid and traumatised. Don’t worry – he’s handling you.”

I started laughing. There were three laughs and then a sound came out of me I didn’t know was in there. I just said, “He’s here?”

She didn’t answer because she didn’t need to. The door opened like a quiet stage cue and he walked in with his hat in his hands, not looking victorious, not looking anything – just looking like he always does; like the weather. And behind him, so small because the room was big and echoey, were my kids.

“Uncle Mike!” Grace shouted, and ran to him, and in that moment I understood that he was not ‘Uncle Mike’ to them, he was just ‘Mike’, and the word ‘uncle’ had attached itself like a barnacle because you need a word for a thing.

Natalie stood in the doorway with her fingers around her purse strap. She looked tired, and kind, and resigned. She looked like a woman who has had exactly enough drama for one lifetime and will take no more. She nodded at me like you do at someone who has said something difficult in a conference.

I said, “How are you even here,” but the question did not end with a question mark. It was a sigh.

Green set his hat on the counter and put his hand on my shoulder, not too heavy, not light, like a thing being put back where it belonged. “See, Dan?” he said in the voice he uses when he wants the world to sit down. “You don’t have to be afraid anymore. I’ve got you.”

I almost threw up on the words ‘I’ve got you’. I looked at the young officer and at Natalie and at my kids and at the hat on the counter and at the notch of a scar at the base of his thumb and at the fluorescent light whining above us and at the paperwork on a clipboard that probably had my name on it and I felt something that wasn’t fear, not exactly. It was like I’d been arguing with a mirror for six weeks and only just realised it.

I said, not to him but to the air because speaking directly to him is like talking to your own reflection and expecting it to go first, “What if I asked to have a different officer.”

“That’s not how it works, Dan,” he said gently. “You’re flagged as a high-risk victim. It’s best practice to have one point of contact. Too many voices make you spin. I am your voice.”

“Am I a victim?” I asked, but my voice cracked on the ‘am’ – and that was the whole answer.

He squeezed my shoulder, looked at the younger officer and she looked down at her keyboard, and I understood: looking down is a kind of loyalty. He looked at Natalie and she nodded minutely. He looked at Grace and Noah, and they climbed up on the bench and swung their legs because kids don’t care about the shape of a man’s soul. They care whether the adults are calm.

I know how this reads. I can hear the parts where my brain is an unreliable narrator. I know I asked for this. I called that stupid number and said, ‘please help me’ and the man arrived who knows how to arrange a life in rows and columns. If this is paranoia, it is very organised.

If this is protection, it’s the kind that turns a person into a room so that other people stand in and decide how to arrange the furniture.

He drove me home. He had already checked me in. He had already told my employer I would be out another week (“we all agreed it was for the best”). He had already bought the groceries I like. He had remembered the spinach.

When we pulled to the curb he turned off the engine and didn’t look at me. He looked at the building like he was measuring it.

“I’m going to ask you something and I want you to answer without explaining,” he said. “Do you want to be safe?”

“Yes,” I said, because who says no to that.

“Then let me carry this,” he said. “You do the small things. Brush your teeth. Eat. Breathe. I’ll take the rest. I know you, Dan. I’m here.”

I’m posting this now because my phone is back, and my calls to 911 go straight to him. My calls to Natalie go to a recording, as well as all my other friends – he says that’s good for the kids and me; and the sergeant in a different city says it’s good for me – and every ‘I’ in this paragraph feels like an exaggeration. I can’t tell if the break-in was a play. I can’t tell if Ms. Halvorsen even exists – I’ve lived here eighteen months and my neighbours are email addresses. I can’t tell if I’m seated in the theatre or on the stage. I can’t tell which details are small and which are the whole story.

He is outside now. He is parked under the tree. He is not looking at his phone. He is not looking away.

If you think I’m paranoid, tell me. Be honest. If you think I’m right, tell me that too. I don’t know which answer would calm me, but I think, maybe, it would help if someone – other than Mike – told me ‘you did the right thing’ or ‘you did not’. I would like to be a person inside my perimeter again. I would like to know where the perimeter is.

But by now, I have exceeded my phone limit.
