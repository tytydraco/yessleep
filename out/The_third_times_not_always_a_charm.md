I was in my room listening to a scary video. One of those where you listen to scary voices that say creepy things or eerie children laughing or a creepy woman crying or something like that. Don't ask me why I like to scare myself like that but I do. There's something about that adrenaline rush you get from being scared that I find super fun. The video I listened to was a Five Nights at Freddy's video where the animatronics were talking in a creepy way and saying creepy things, nothing more than that. I lay in my bed while I listened to it. Suddenly the lights went off. Hmm, that's odd I thought to myself. I paused the video getting scared. I brushed it off thinking it was probably a natural explanation to it. I had to check the fuse box, I went out of my room and the whole house was dark. I pulled out my phone from my pocket and put on the flashlight. 

I started to make my way towards the fuse box but while doing so I couldn't help but feel like someone was watching me. The entire house was engulfed in silence. I brushed the feeling off reassuring myself that I was just scared. I got to the fuse box and flipped the switch, the lights came on and I sighed feeling relieved. The feeling of being watched disappeared and I felt much better. I got back to my room and resumed the video. After 1 minute in the video, the lights went off again. What in the world is going on? I thought to myself. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. I made my way towards the fuse box once again. This time I felt more scared than I did the first time. 

I opened the door to my room to find my house was again pitch black. It was night time so there was no sun outside. I made my way cautiously towards the fuse box feeling like someone was watching my every move. I suddenly got the feeling of someone standing behind me but when I checked there was nobody there. I looked around to see if I could spot something. There was nothing. I stopped to listen for a while but I couldn't hear anything either. I got to the fuse box and flipped the switch again. The lights came on once again. I stood still for a moment, listening. Nothing. Even though the lights came on, the feeling of being watched wouldn't go away. 

I got an idea to tape the switch, that way the power wouldn't go out again. I went downstairs and looked in the kitchen drawer for tape. To my luck, I found some in the drawer. I got back up and taped the switch so it would stay in its place. It made me feel a little better but still, I couldn't quite manage to shake the feeling that someone or something was watching me. I got to my room again and sat on my bed, my room was just the way I had left it. Nothing suspicious. I listened for a while longer. Nothing. I'm probably just scared and that's why I keep imagining that I'm being watched I told myself. I tried to calm myself down by saying that it was just my imagination. After all, it was impossible that someone was watching me. I live alone, no wife, no pets and no kids, just me. 

I moved out of my parent's house when I was 20 years old and now I live in another town far away from them. That's the way I like it. I liked being alone, focusing on myself and doing exactly what I wanted to. I pressed play on the video again, I was still feeling a little on edge. I kind of thought that it was super fun but at the same time, the light incident freaked me out. I listened to the video for about 5 minutes when it happened again. 

That damned light went off for the third time. I paused the video and got really scared. This time I knew that someone had to be in the house. I grabbed a pair of scissors that was on my bedside table., I don't really know why I had scissors on my bedside table but right now I thanked myself for it. I was going to use the scissors in case there were burglars in my house. I pulled out my phone and switched on the flashlight again. 

I slowly made my way to the door and listened. Nothing. I listened a little while longer. Still nothing. I opened the door quietly, everything was dark, the only light came from my phone. I stood in the doorway with my guard up, I tightened my grip on the scissors and listened. Nothing. I looked around but couldn't see anything. I decided to check my fuse box to see if maybe the tape wasn't as strong as I had thought. I tried to reassure myself that the tape must've fallen off on its own or something but to no avail. I couldn't get rid of the feeling that someone or something was in my house. 

I made my way to the fuse box steadily with the scissors in one hand and my phone in the other, I looked around for the slightest movement but found nothing. I had a gnawing feeling that someone was watching me, mocking me in the corner of my eye. I turned to look. Nothing. I couldn't hear anything other than my heart pounding loud in my chest. I just knew that someone was in my house. I got to the fuse box to find that the tape was gone. I searched all around for it but I couldn't find it. 

That's when I heard it. The most awful sound I've ever heard in my entire life. A loud screeching sound. I covered my ears thinking that I was going to die. It stopped after 10 seconds. I stood still, listening. Nothing. I was too scared to move. I stood holding the scissors and my phone. Listening. Waiting for something else to happen. I waited for what felt like 1 hour. I suddenly heard footsteps coming towards me, and a little girl's voice saying: Wanna play?...
