  
I’m a therapist working out of Goodland Kansas, which is the last remotely major town before you cross across the western KS border into Eastern Colorado. I’ve been working out here for about 20 years now. I’m out here for a couple reasons. Firstly, I figured the people out here need help just as much as people in the city, and second, the shrewder side of me figured there were a lot of rich ranchers who would be happy to pay for someone to talk to. For those that don’t know, Western Kansas, Eastern Colorado, Eastern Wyoming, Western Nebraska, and the Oklahoma panhandle share a lot of similar characteristics. There is a LOT of flat ground in this part of the country. It’s primarily used for ranching and farming, with giant sections of grassland or crop fields only broken up by dusty roads and farm equipment. It is not the most exciting place in the world to live, as there is very little to do in the small towns that serve as shopping hubs for the farms that dot the landscapes, and even less to do in the country itself. We all know the small town cliches of getting drunk in fields and harassing the cattle because there’s nothing else to do and they aren’t exactly inaccurate. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen a group of teens lurching down a country road as dusk falls, the rattle of empty cans coming from the bed of the truck, giggles coming out from a cracked window. It’s a quiet life, and I enjoy it. I’m just coming on here to talk about some of the weirder things I’ve heard about in my experiences as a therapist and see if any others have experienced them. Obviously, I won’t be using any of my clients’ actual names, but their experiences are so specific to this region of the country, I felt the need to share them. 

  
After talking with other therapists from similar areas of similar states at various professional development conventions that, we’ve come to call this type of phenomena that our patients experience “Midwest Dread.” Talking with these therapists, we’ve seen a common undercurrent of paranoia and anxiety around a certain feeling that people who live in these parts of the country sometimes experience. It manifests itself in different ways as you’ll see in upcoming posts, but I thought it would be best to kind of outline the basis for all of these delusions.   
I had patient named “Derek” who was lineman, working all around Goodland, who described the feeling of Midwest Dread best. I’ll quote him directly here from an audio recording of one of our sessions. 

  
D: “Have you ever like been at a National Park, like the Grand Canyon, or Black Canyon of the Gunnison?”  
T: “Oh yeah, love going to visit whenever I can find the time.”   
D: “Ok, so you know that feeling you get when you’re staring out at these gorgeous views, and you’re so high up, and like, seeing so much that your brain just struggles to take it all in. Like it feels like your eyes are seeing too much and your brain can’t take it all in?”   
T: “Yeah, I know what you mean, you’re just taking all of the beauty in right?”   
D: “Exactly, but eventually, your eyes find something to focus on, like a few trees on a ledge, or a bird flying, or the river burbling down below, or something, and that feeling goes away.”   
T: “Mmhm.”   
D: “Anyway, sometimes, when I’m out working, I’ll be on a road, or on top of a hill or something, and I’ll just start looking. You know how it is out here, there’s no mountains or tall trees to speak of, just flatness. I’ll look down the hill or across the field, and that same feeling wells up. It’s like your simultaneously seeing everything and nothing at once. Sometimes, that feeling just overwhelms me and it feels like my eyes are getting bigger, and my brain is just filling up with nothingness and I can’t find anything to look at to break myself out of it. Once, I almost got fired because I stood staring for three hours, and my boss found out I hadn’t gotten anything done. I remember that I only managed to break myself out because a rattlesnake passed in front of me.”   
T: “So is this interfering with your work.”   
D: “Not so much anymore, I keep my eyes on the ground or the road. And always have music in my ears to give me something to focus on.”   
T: “So why are you telling me this? It seems to me like you’ve got a good handle on a little idiosyncrasy.”   
D: “Ever since the day that I stared for that long, I haven’t been able to kick the feeling of emptiness. It feels like I have this wide space inside of me, that can only grow if I look and stare. It feels like it wants to grow, like I don’t have any control of it.”   
T: “Ok.”   
D: “Work has become a constant battle, I’ll feel my eyes drawn towards the nothingness of the plains, and it takes all my willpower to pull them back and focus. Like I said music helps, but its getting hard.”   
T: “Hold on, I thought you said that it didn’t interfere with your work.”   
D: “It does, I don’t know why I lied there, but it really does.” 

  
I’ll stop transcribing here, as I then try to get to the root of Derek’s feelings, to see if they’re related to any other facet of his life and so on, but if I’m honest, I was being a bad therapist and missing the point of what he was talking about. I wish I had pressed on coping with the feelings instead of trying to make it relate to some element of his past, because then it might’ve helped him. Two months later, after quitting sessions with me on the pretense of needing to save money, Derek fell at a site where he was working. He didn’t die, but he was paralyzed from the waist down, having severed two vertebrae when he hit his climbing spikes on the way down. His wife had to leave him at home to work her job at the local dentist’s office, his living room and bedroom having full view of the crop fields behind him. One day, according to town gossip, his wife came home to find him staring out the window, his eyes completely black. He didn’t die, but apparently his pupils had widened so completely, tried to take so much in, that they had effectively made him blind. They moved away from Goodland after that. I have another patient coming in, so I’ll finish this log later, but I want to tell y’all about some of the things I’ve heard from other therapists, so I’ll be back in a little while.
