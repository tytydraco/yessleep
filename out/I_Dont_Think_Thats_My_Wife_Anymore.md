This isn't easy to write about. Not after everything. My hands shake so much I can barely type without having to retype whole sentences, and my mind… it’s a spiderweb of shadows and whispers. But the doctor, the one who actually seems to believe me – or at least, pretends to – says letting it out might help. That maybe, if I can put it into words, I can finally untangle the knots in my head.

They call it PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I call it living in a permanent nightmare, a reality stretched and torn until it barely resembles the one I knew.

Before… before it all started, my life was good. Not just good, it was perfect. I had Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Just writing it down makes my throat tighten. She was everything. Her laugh, bright and clear like wind chimes. Her eyes, the color of warm honey, always crinkling at the corners when she smiled. The way she’d hum while cooking, or tuck her feet under her on the sofa, a book resting open on her chest. We lived in a small, two-story house, tucked away on a quiet street in the suburbs. A little slice of heaven, we called it. We’d bought it together, painted the walls, planted a garden. It was our sanctuary.

It was our coffin.

It began subtly. So subtly that for weeks, I dismissed it. Attributed it to stress, to my imagination, to the house settling. A faint smell, at first. Like damp earth, or maybe something a little sweeter, but cloying. I’d sniff the air, wander through the rooms, checking for leaks, for forgotten food. Sarah would laugh, say I was being paranoid. "It's just the old house, Liam," she'd say, her voice warm, familiar. "Breathing."

Then came the sounds. Rustles from empty corners. A faint scratching, like nails on plaster, deep within the walls, usually when the house was quietest – late at night, or early in the morning before the world woke up. Sometimes, I’d swear I heard a soft, wet squelch. I’d freeze, heart hammering, straining to hear it again. But it would be gone. Just the creak of the floorboards, the distant hum of the refrigerator.

Sarah didn't seem to notice. Or if she did, she didn’t mention it. She’d sleep soundly beside me, her breathing even, undisturbed. And I, being the rational man I thought I was, tried to be like her. To ignore the growing prickle on my skin, the sense of being watched even in our own bedroom.

The first noticeable change came with the air. It grew colder. Not just a draft – a pervasive, bone-chilling cold that seemed to emanate from the very walls. I checked the heating, sealed windows, but it didn't help. Sarah started bundling up, wearing extra sweaters, but still, she dismissed my concerns. "It's just winter coming, Liam. You're getting soft," she'd joke, but her smiles seemed a little… thinner. A little less genuine.

I told myself it was my imagination. I told myself I was tired. I told myself I was being ridiculous. I told myself a lot of things. And every single one of them was a lie I desperately needed to believe.

The house began to feel… wrong. Not just the cold, not just the smells or the phantom noises. It was a subtle shift in its very essence. The shadows seemed deeper, more alive. The natural sunlight, which used to pour in through our kitchen window, felt muted, filtered through something unseen. The wallpaper in the hallway, a soft floral pattern Sarah had picked out, seemed to warp just at the edges when I wasn't looking directly at it.

And Sarah… she started to change too.

It wasn't overnight. It was a creeping, insidious alteration. Little things, at first, that I wrote off as stress or fatigue. She’d always been a morning person, chirpy and bright. Now, she lingered in bed, often not stirring until I nudged her. Her movements, once graceful and fluid, became… precise. A little too precise. Like she was thinking about each step, each gesture.

I remember one morning, she was making coffee. She always used to hum a little tune while she ground the beans. That morning, she stood perfectly still, her back to me, the grinder whirring. Her shoulders were hunched, and for a split second, I saw a strange, almost convulsive twitch in her left arm, quickly suppressed. When she turned, her smile was there, but her eyes… her eyes were flat. Like the light in them had dimmed.

"Everything alright, love?" I asked, a knot forming in my stomach.

"Perfectly fine, Liam," she said, her voice a little too even, a little too saccharine. "Just thinking."

But what was she thinking about? She never elaborated. She used to share everything with me. Every thought, every worry, every silly dream. Now, there was a wall. An invisible, impenetrable barrier.

Her habits shifted too. She stopped reading her paperback novels, something she used to do every night. Instead, she’d sit in the living room, often in the dark, just staring at the television, which wasn't even on. I’d walk in, and she’d jump, startled, then offer that same unnerving, flat smile.

"Just resting my eyes," she'd say. "Long day."

But her days weren't long. She didn't work. She was supposed to be designing our new garden layout, filling her time with things she loved. But the garden remained untouched, slowly becoming overgrown.

The smell intensified. That earthy, sickly sweet scent, a mix of damp soil and something else… something organic and decaying. It clung to Sarah. I’d try to hold her close, to smell her familiar scent – her shampoo, her perfume, her unique skin musk – but it was always there, underneath it all, that terrible, cloying odor. It made my stomach churn.

"Are you feeling okay, Sarah?" I asked one evening, trying to sound casual as she sat across from me at dinner, barely touching her food.

She looked up, her spoon halfway to her mouth. Her eyes were wide, unblinking. "Why, Liam? Do I not look okay?"

Her tone was unsettling. Defensive, almost aggressive. And for a moment, just a flicker, her face seemed to contort. The muscles in her jaw tightened, her lips pulled back too far, revealing a flash of teeth that seemed too long, too pointed. Then it was gone, replaced by a perfect, bland expression.

"You just seem a little… quiet," I stammered, my heart thumping against my ribs.

"People change, Liam. Don't they?" she said, and then she went back to pushing the food around on her plate.

I couldn’t eat. My appetite had vanished days ago. I started losing weight. Sleeping became a luxury I couldn't afford, perpetually on edge, listening to the house, listening to Sarah. I found myself watching her, scrutinizing every move, every blink, every breath. And the more I watched, the more I saw.

The way her fingers would sometimes clench, almost convulsively, when she thought I wasn't looking. The subtle, almost imperceptible tremor in her right hand as she held her coffee cup. The way her eyes would occasionally drift, focusing on something far beyond the walls, a look of chilling vacancy replacing the familiar warmth.

And then, I found it. In the utility closet, tucked behind some old paint cans. A small, dark, viscous puddle. It smelled of that same sickly-sweet earth, but stronger, more pungent. I touched it with my finger. It was thick, gelatinous, and left a faint, disturbing stickiness. I wiped my finger on an old rag, but the smell clung to me. I scrubbed my hand raw, but I could still feel it, deep under my skin.

I tried to talk to her about it. "Sarah," I said, holding the rag, "what is this?"

She barely glanced up from the blank TV screen. "What's what, Liam?"

"This," I insisted, bringing the rag closer. "This… goo. From the closet."

She finally turned, her stare unnervingly direct. Her lips curved into that thin, unsettling smile. "Oh, that. Just a bit of damp, I suppose. The pipes are old."

"It's not damp, Sarah. It feels… organic."

Her smile widened, her eyes fixed on mine. "Organic? Silly, Liam. It's just water. Or maybe… maybe something from the garden, tracking in."

But she hadn't been in the garden in weeks. Never mind the garden. She hadn't been herself in weeks.

My mind raced. Was she sick? Was it a breakdown? But the way she looked at me… it wasn't Sarah. It was something else. Something pretending to be her.

The terror, cold and sharp, began to truly sink its teeth into me.

The breaking point arrived with a memory. Our memory.

We had a ritual. Every year, on our anniversary, we’d revisit the little bakery where we’d had our first date. We’d order the same two lemon tarts and share them, reminiscing about that awkward, beautiful day. It was our secret, our special thing.

Two days after I found the black goo, I tried to bring it up. "Our anniversary is coming up, Sarah," I said, trying to inject some warmth into my voice. "Remember the bakery? Lemon tarts?"

She was in the kitchen, washing dishes. Her back was to me. She paused, and for a long moment, there was no sound but the quiet drip of water. Then she turned. Her face was blank.

"Lemon tarts, Liam? Why would we get lemon tarts?" Her voice was devoid of recognition, devoid of the usual playful exasperation she’d express at my sentimental attachment to the ritual. Her eyes… they were too wide, too still.

My blood ran cold. "Sarah. Our first date. The bakery on Elm Street. We got lemon tarts. Every year since."

She frowned, or rather, a perfect imitation of a frown creased her brow. "I don't recall that, Liam. We prefer apple pie."

Apple pie. Sarah hated apple pie. She was allergic to cinnamon.

A sudden, dizzying wave of nausea hit me. This wasn't her. It couldn't be. My wife, my Sarah, would never forget something so profoundly personal, so utterly us.

"Sarah," I whispered, my voice trembling. "What are you talking about? You're allergic to cinnamon, you hate apple pie."

Her eyes narrowed, and the perfect imitation of a frown deepened. "Don't be absurd, Liam. I've always loved apple pie."

And then, I saw it again. A flicker. In her eyes, a momentary shift from honey-brown to something darker, something opaque and utterly alien. Her skin, which had always been soft and warm, seemed to ripple for a split second, like water disturbed by an unseen force. The sickly-sweet odor intensified, thick and suffocating.

"You're not Sarah," I croaked, stumbling backward, hitting the counter.

Her smile broadened, stretching her mouth impossibly wide. Too wide. It wasn't a human smile. Her teeth, previously just a fleeting glimpse, now seemed to elongate, to sharpen, gleaming wetly in the kitchen light. The honey-brown of her eyes swirled, shifting to an inky black, reflecting the light like polished obsidian.

"Of course I am, Liam," the thing that looked like her hissed, the sound not quite human, a sibilant whisper that seemed to come from everywhere at once. "Who else would I be?"

And then, it moved. Not like Sarah, not like any human. It glided across the kitchen floor, its feet not lifting, but sliding, like a slug across wet stone. It was too fast, too smooth. In a terrifying instant, it was directly in front of me, its face mere inches from mine.

Its breath was foul, the putrid smell of decay mixed with that cloying sweetness. I could see the tiny, almost imperceptible twitching under its skin, as if something was writhing beneath the surface. And its eyes… they were no longer Sarah’s. They were bottomless pits of pure, malicious intelligence.

"I am better," it whispered, the voice no longer even trying to mimic Sarah’s. It was a guttural, rasping sound that vibrated through my bones. "I am perfect."

My scream caught in my throat. I pushed past it, shoving it with all my strength, no longer caring if I hurt Sarah. But it didn’t budge. It was like pushing against solid rock. And as I looked, my horror ratcheted up another notch.

From beneath the hem of its long-sleeved shirt, at the wrist, I saw a flash of something utterly abhorrent. Not skin. Not fabric. But a fleshy, multi-jointed appendage, thick and pale, like a tendril, retracting swiftly back into the sleeve.

This wasn't my wife. This wasn't human. It was something that wore her skin, wore her face, wore her memories like borrowed clothes. And it was here. In my house. With me.

Panic, pure and unadulterated, seized me. My mind screamed, Run! But my legs felt like lead. The thing, this grotesque mockery of Sarah, simply stood there, watching me, its black eyes burning.

"Where are you going, Liam?" it purred, its voice a chilling parody of concern. "Don't you want to stay with me?"

I stumbled backward, my heart hammering like a trapped bird. The kitchen, once bright and welcoming, felt like a cage. The air was thick with that putrid, sweet smell, and I could hear new sounds now – a faint, wet sucking from the walls, a low, rhythmic throb that seemed to come from the very floorboards beneath my feet. The house was alive. And it was hostile.

I bolted. Not for the front door, not yet. My instinct was just to get away, to find a weapon, to find a way to understand. I ran into the living room, heading for the old fireplace poker. But the moment I reached for it, the room shifted. No, not the room. My perception. The shadows deepened, twisting into grotesque shapes. The familiar furniture seemed to lean in, to watch me.

The thing that was Sarah was suddenly there, blocking the doorway to the hall. It moved with an impossible speed, a blur of motion. Its face was no longer attempting to hold Sarah’s beautiful features. The skin was stretched taut, almost translucent, revealing the dark, writhing mass beneath. Its jaw unhinged, dropping impossibly low, a black void from which that wet, sibilant hiss emanated.

"You can't leave, Liam," it slavered, a string of viscous fluid dangling from its chin. "You belong to me now."

I screamed, a raw, terrified sound. I grabbed the heavy brass poker, swinging it wildly. It hit something soft, yielding, and I heard a wet thwack. The creature staggered back a step, a low growl emanating from its throat. For a horrifying moment, a section of its chest, where the poker had connected, bulged unnaturally, then seemed to shrivel inward, only to reform, slowly, sickeningly, as if its very flesh was fluid, adapting.

I didn't wait. I turned and ran, desperate. Not for the front door - the thing was between me and it. I ran up the stairs, two at a time, my mind screaming for an escape, any escape.

The upstairs hallway was a nightmare. The wallpaper had peeled in places, revealing not plaster, but a dark, fibrous, almost fungal growth beneath. The air was thick and heavy, like breathing through a wet cloth. I could hear the faint, rhythmic pulse again, stronger now, as if the house itself had a heartbeat, a monstrous, alien pulse.

I tried the bathroom door, locked. Our bedroom, locked. Every door, every escape route, sealed. A chilling realization struck me: the locks weren't just engaged, they were fused. Melted into the doorframes. This wasn't just a creature; it was integrated with the house. The house was part of it.

I was trapped.

Then, a glint of light from the end of the hallway, from the old linen closet door. It wasn't completely closed. It was usually tightly shut, crammed with blankets and towels. Why was it ajar? My mind, in its terror, grasped at any deviation from the norm.

I pushed it open. It wasn't a linen closet anymore.

The small space had been hollowed out. The back wall was gone, revealing a dark, uneven tunnel, smelling intensely of that sweet, putrid earth. It was narrow, barely wide enough for me to squeeze through. A raw, gaping maw in the heart of my home.

And from within that darkness, a faint, almost imperceptible sound. A muffled, desperate whimpering.

My heart stopped.

The whimpering. It was faint, barely audible over the thrumming, squelching sounds of the house, but it was there. A human sound. And it sounded like… recognition.

My mind, screaming for answers, for Sarah, propelled me forward. I squeezed through the narrow opening, the rough, organic walls of the tunnel scraping against my skin. The smell was overpowering now, a suffocating miasma of decay and something else, something metallic and thick like old blood.

The tunnel twisted downwards, a crude, unlit passage. I plunged into absolute darkness, relying on my hands, feeling the damp, slimy walls. They weren’t plaster. They were… fleshy. Pulsating. Like the inside of some colossal, diseased organ. I could feel tiny, almost imperceptible cilia brushing against my skin, hear soft, wet sucking sounds from deeper within the walls themselves.

The whimpering grew louder, closer. And my blood ran cold, because now I recognized it. It was Sarah. But it wasn't her strong, vibrant voice. It was broken. Terrified.

I crawled through the suffocating darkness for what felt like an eternity, but could only have been a few minutes. Then, the tunnel opened into a small, irregular chamber. It was completely dark, but a faint, phosphorescent glow emanated from the walls themselves, a sickly green light that pulsed with the same rhythm as the house’s horrific heartbeat.

And in the center of that glowing chamber, chained. Not with metal, but with thick, ropy strands of that same organic, pulsing flesh that formed the walls. Chained to a pedestal of dark, oozing stone.

Was Sarah.

Or what was left of her.

My breath hitched. A guttural sob tore itself from my chest.

She was naked, her body emaciated, covered in a thin, translucent film of that same black, viscous substance I’d found in the closet. Her skin was pale, almost gray, stretched taut over her bones. Her hair, once vibrant and thick, was dull and sparse, clumped with the dark goo. Her eyes… her beautiful honey eyes were open, wide with terror, but they looked dull, lifeless, utterly defeated.

She whimpered again, a thin, reedy sound, and tried to lift her head, but she was too weak. The fleshy ropes held her fast, digging into her decaying flesh.

And then, I saw it. The true horror.

From her mouth, from her nose, from her eyes, from dozens of minuscule orifices that had opened on her skin, thin, black tendrils, like roots, extended into the walls and the pedestal. They weren’t just holding her. They were feeding. Sucking the life, the essence, the very Sarah-ness out of her. She was a husk. A battery.

The thing upstairs. The mimic. It hadn’t just replaced her. It had grown from her. It was using her.

My Sarah. My beautiful, vibrant wife. Reduced to this. A living, dying vessel for some unspeakable abomination.

Tears streamed down my face, hot and stinging. My heart was a frozen lump of lead in my chest. Rage, a primal, all-consuming fire, roared to life within me, momentarily overriding the terror.

"Sarah!" I cried, my voice raw, broken. I scrambled forward, reaching for her, desperate to free her, to touch her, to tell her I was here.

But as my hand reached out, a soft, wet pop echoed in the chamber. One of the tendrils connecting her to the wall pulsed violently, then snapped. And from the small, gaping hole it left in her skin, a thick, milky white fluid, mixed with dark red, began to ooze.

Her eyes, lifeless moments before, locked onto mine. A flicker. The faintest, most fleeting spark of recognition. And then, slowly, agonizingly, a tear formed in the corner of her eye, crawling down her cheek, leaving a clean streak on her grimy skin.

And then her head slumped forward. Her breathing, already so shallow, ceased. The light in her eyes extinguished.

She was gone. My Sarah was truly, utterly gone.

The monster had taken her. It had consumed her. And I was too late.

A deep thrumming shook the chamber. The phosphorescent glow on the walls intensified, bathing everything in an eerie, sickly green. I heard a sound from the tunnel I’d come through. A shuffling. A wet, dragging sound.

It knew. It always knew.

It was coming for me.

The air in the chamber thickened, becoming almost gelatinous. The stench of decay and something else--something metallic and sharp, like ozone--choked me. The walls pulsed faster, the sickly green glow intensifying to an almost unbearable brightness. I could hear it. The thing that had worn Sarah’s face. It was in the tunnel, moving with that sickening, unnatural glide.

My every atom screamed for me to run, but my feet were rooted to the ground. I couldn’t leave her. Not now. Not like this. My Sarah. My beautiful Sarah. Reduced to a husk, her essence stolen, her body a feeding ground for this… this thing.

The rage, hot and blinding, returned. It was a desperate, suicidal impulse, but I didn’t care. If I was going to die, it would be fighting for her. For what was left of her dignity.

I grabbed a jagged piece of the oozing stone pedestal, surprisingly sharp. Its surface was warm, wet, and pulsed faintly in my hand. I turned to face the tunnel, my eyes burning, tears mixing with the sweat on my face.

The first part of it emerged from the darkness. Not its face. Not its hands. But a limb. A thick, pale, segmented arm, dripping black fluid. It extruded from the tunnel opening, feeling its way, like a blind worm. Then another. And another. More than two arms, more than any human should possess. They seemed to retract and extend with each pulse of the living wall around them.

Then, its head emerged.

No longer a grotesque parody of Sarah. It was a true nightmare. The skin was peeled back in places, revealing raw, red musculature beneath. Its mouth was a gaping maw, rows of needle-like teeth glistening in the green light. Its eyes – multiple, gleaming black orbs – were set into its misshapen head, tracking me with terrifying precision. Its neck stretched, elongating, twisting, as if trying to get a better view. And from its back, where Sarah’s spine would have been, a series of thick, chitinous plates had erupted, pulsating with that internal green glow.

It was a monstrosity of raw, organic horror. A creature born of human flesh and something utterly alien.

It hissed, a sound like a thousand angry snakes, and began to pull itself fully into the chamber. Its body was a mass of writhing, glistening limbs and distorted flesh, too large for the space, yet it seemed to flow, to contort, to fit. It moved with a horrifying fluidity, like a slug made of human nightmares.

"You took her!" I screamed, my voice cracking, "You took my Sarah!"

I lunged, swinging the jagged stone with all my remaining strength, aiming for its head. It moved with incredible speed, a blur of pale flesh and black tendrils. The stone connected, but not with its head. It struck one of its many thick, segmented arms.

A wet CRACK echoed in the chamber. The creature shrieked, a sound of pure, unadulterated pain that was somehow worse than its horrific appearance. The arm, where I’d struck it, shuddered violently, then began to dissolve. Not bleed in a normal way, but to melt, to liquefy, the organic matter bubbling and steaming on the stone floor. It was like striking a column of acid.

But then, as if in retaliation, the arm re-grew. A sickeningly fast regeneration, tendrils spurting out from the wound, weaving together, forming new flesh with unnerving speed. It was already healing.

I stumbled back, horrified by the impossibility of it. It was invincible.

The creature lunged. It wasn't the slow, slithering creep of a moment before. It was a terrifying, inhuman burst of speed. Its monstrous limbs shot out, enveloping me. Thick, pale tendrils wrapped around my arms, my legs, my torso, squeezing, crushing the air from my lungs. The smell of it was overwhelming, acidic.

I thrashed, I screamed, I fought, but it was useless. Its grip was immense. I could feel its numerous eyes boring into me, a chilling, intelligent gaze.

"You are mine," it hissed, its voice no longer even remotely human, but a chorus of guttural clicks and slithers, resonating directly inside my skull. "You are just like her. A vessel. A host."

I felt a sharp, searing pain in my side. One of its smaller, needle-like appendages had pierced my skin. It wasn't a claw or tooth, but something like a hollow proboscis. I felt a cold, burning liquid being injected into my flesh. My muscles spasmed uncontrollably.

It intended to do to me what it had done to Sarah. To consume me. To erase me.

My vision began to blur. Black spots danced before my eyes. The chamber pulsed violently, the green light flashing. I heard a distant, almost forgotten sound. The siren of an emergency vehicle. Faint, outside, in the real world. Someone must have heard my screams. Or perhaps a neighbor, alerted by the prolonged silence from our house, had called.

The creature paused, its black eyes flickering, sensing the disturbance. For a fraction of a second, its grip loosened.

It was all I needed.

With a desperate, primal surge of adrenaline, fueled by the image of Sarah’s lifeless body, I pulled, twisted, and tore myself free from its grip. The pain was immense. Flesh ripped. A burning sensation spread through my entire right side. But I was free.

I didn't look back. I launched myself into the tunnel, scrambling, clawing, desperate to escape its grasp. I heard a roar of pure, frustrated rage from behind me, and the sound of the creature tearing itself through the narrow opening, its body scraping, squelching against the organic walls.

I didn't stop. I crawled faster than I ever thought possible, pushing through the suffocating darkness, the horrifying stench, the wet, pulsating walls. Up and up, until I burst back out into the ruined hallway, gasping for breath, my lungs burning.

The house was screaming now. Not just through the creature, but the very structure itself. Walls weeping black fluid, floorboards bulging and cracking, windows rattling violently. The emergency sirens were closer now, wailing just outside.

I could still hear the creature behind me, scrabbling through the tunnel, its bulk too great for the small space. It was enraged.

I stumbled down the stairs, ignoring the agony in my side, ignoring the blood that soaked my shirt. The front door. It was no longer fused. It was ajar, splintered, as if someone had tried to force it open from the outside. The fresh, cold air of the outside world, so different from the suffocating rot within, hit me like a physical blow.

I burst out onto the porch, collapsing onto the lawn, gasping, shaking, sobbing. The world spun. Police cars, an ambulance, flashing red and blue lights. Neighbors peering from their windows, their faces etched with shock and fear.

And behind me, the house. Our house. It was a living, breathing horror. Black, viscous fluids oozed from its windows and doors. The very bricks seemed to writhe. A low, guttural roar emanated from within its confines, a sound that would haunt my nightmares forever.

Then, with a final, shuddering groan, the house seemed to implode, sending out a wave of black, putrid smoke. The structure twisted, collapsed inward, dissolving into a mound of smoking, wet earth and organic mass. It didn't burn. It didn't explode. It just… disintegrated. Like a putrid, rotten organism finally giving up the ghost.

The last thing I saw before blacking out was a single, long, pale tendril, twitching in the smoking ruins, before it too, retracted into the earth.

They found me, half-dead, bleeding, incoherent, raving about monsters and a wife that wasn't a wife. They found the smoking, unidentifiable mound where my house used to be. They found nothing else. No bodies. No trace of Sarah. No evidence of what I had seen, beyond the physical trauma to my body and the utter, undeniable madness in my eyes.

The police investigated. They called it an "unexplained structural collapse." They looked for accelerants, for gas leaks, for sinkholes. They found nothing. Just that strange, dark, incredibly fertile earth that seemed to pulse faintly under their feet for days afterward. They wrote me off as a survivor in shock, delusional, suffering from severe trauma.

I was hospitalized. First, for my injuries. The wound in my side was deep, strangely cauterized, and they couldn’t quite identify what had caused it. It healed with an unnerving rapidity, leaving a raised, purplish scar that sometimes throbs and tingles.

Then, for my mind. They tried to tell me I imagined it all. That the stress of life, the natural aging of an old house, my grief for a wife who must have simply vanished – that it all conspired to create a vivid nightmare. They gave me pills. Lots of pills. For the nightmares. For the anxiety. For the paranoia. But none of them silence the screams in my head. None of them erase the image of Sarah, chained and consumed, or the monstrous thing that wore her skin.

I’m out now, living in a small, sterile apartment. Every creak of the floorboards makes me jump. Every shadow sends my heart racing. I check the locks obsessively, multiple times a night. I can’t sleep without the lights on, and even then, I see them. The eyes. The black, glistening eyes of the creature.

I don’t trust anyone. Not fully. Every face I see, every gesture, I scrutinize it. Is that a flicker? Is that a nuance of emotion that seems off? Is that a smile that stretches just a little too wide? Is that familiar smell I just caught, just a trick of the mind, or is it that sickly-sweet decay?

They say I'm getting better. That I'm coming to terms with the "loss." But I didn't lose Sarah. She was taken. She was consumed. And a part of me believes… no, knows… that it’s still out there. That it didn't die with the house. That it simply moved on, or found a new host, or perhaps, lay dormant, waiting.

Sometimes, when I’m alone in the dead of night, I swear I can still feel it. That cold, burning sensation in my scar. A soft, wet squelch from the walls of this new, unfamiliar apartment. And that faint, cloying smell, just on the edge of perception, like damp earth and something sickly sweet.

And sometimes… when I look in the mirror… I see a subtle shift in my own eyes. A glint of something cold. Something that wasn’t there before.

And sometimes… I still hear her. Not Sarah’s laugh. Not her voice. But that low, guttural hiss. The one that told me, "I am perfect."

And sometimes… just sometimes… I wonder if a little piece of that perfection came with me. Deep inside. Waiting.
