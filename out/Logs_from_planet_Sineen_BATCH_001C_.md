**Day 6 footage resumes - UTC: 12:15 PM (15 past noon) - Transcribed video log.**

**\[The footage of the drive has been edited out for brevity. Camera view is still from Hector's head mounted camera. Footage resumes when they have exited the buggie and are walking up a large, loading ramp, on the S.S. Forager. The ship is massive; the size of 2 small towns. There is a semi-truck coming down the ramp, passing Hector as it exits the Forager.\]**

(Hector is slightly up the ramp when he turns to see Lin jogging to catch up. He continues walking as she says-)

**Junior AB Lin:** Are you sure we should be using the loading ramp like this?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Eh, it’s fine. Besides-

(Hector taps his head mounted camera.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** We’ve got important cargo.

(Hector looks to his left, seeing Lin walking beside him and leaning a little close to examine the camera.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Uh, it’s still on.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Oh.

(Hectors hands appear over the camera, dismounting it from his helmet. The view goes lower and faces the ground, filming Hectors legs as he walks up the ramp.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Ok.

**Junior AB Lin:** No, it’s still going.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Ack, probably these gloves.

(The view shifts to the left a little and shakes. There’s a leathery rubbing noise. Presumably Hector is trying to remove one of his gloves.)

**Day 7 – We’re not giving up – UTC: 7:40 AM – Transcribed video log.**

(Video is filmed in a 16:9 smartphone ratio. Filming from a selfie perspective. Hector is wearing a black helmet, a blue visored gas mask and a black shawl over his shoulders. The view is of the S.S. Forager’s interior hallway. He’s walking.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hey everyone… We held a funeral, yesterday, for Dr. Gram and Louis. Louis was the other guy… The families are still holding out hope for the 9 missing.

The video footage from yesterday has also been sent to everyone on the ship. It’s important to be honest, especially during times like this…

Crew’s definitely nervous now, but… Everyone and the families who joined this expedition, all 14,000 of us, we didn’t come here just to give up if things got rough and we’re not going to.

That being said, losing 11 people in 1 day was pretty bad… So there’s a new rule in place: No exploration missions are allowed without an armed escort, 2 riflemen minimum.

On today’s itinerary, we’re “turtling up.” Chief Grove and I recommended a defensive perimeter around both the Forager and the Colony Base with rotating guards.

(Hector is now walking into a more open area, there is the sound of people talking, a busy environment, and distant trucks. By the looks of workers passing behind him, it appears to be a loading dock.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Captain Suyf agreed and also suggested we should move the Forager closer to the base, since it’s 16 kilometers away and it’s easier to maintain 1 defensive perimeter, than 2. So, this morning the ship lifted off and we landed it close to the colony base.

(Hector looks to the left and waves at someone. He then switches the camera to film forward and mounts it to his head.)

(Hector is walking off of a large ramp, about 8m across.)

(He exits the ship onto a vast area with teal grass and more of the blue pine-looking trees with black trunks in the distance. He looks towards an incline that’s about 2 kilometers away, there appear to be trucks driving to and from the incline. There are also several tent camps and a couple of small trailer camps. The sun is up, but the sky is cloudy.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Still building the foundations but, that’s where the colony base is gonna be. Some guys also wanted fresh air so, they’re sleeping outside the ship. Although uhh…

(Hector waves his hand in the direction of the tents on the outskirts of the incline, as a truck passes by him on the ramp.)

(Hector raises his voice to shout over the passing truck.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** These guys are gonna have to pick up and get behind the defensive perimeter! There’s also been an “Everyone sleeps in the ship” order issued by the Captain; stays in effect for 1 week, due to yesterday’s incident!

(Hector lowers his voice as the truck passes and sits at the bottom of the ramp, letting his legs rest on the grass.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** I’m also taking a scout team back to the floating ruins; mostly to set up surveillance cameras. When a guy can magically cut you from a distance, you wanna get as much info on the guy as you can before taking him on.

(Hector rubs his neck where the injury is.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** … We’re not giving up. So I don’t want you guys looking at this and losing hope, OKAY? We’re going to figure this out.

…

(There is the sound of 2 pairs of light footsteps coming from behind Hector. He looks over his shoulder.)

(Lin is there, about 3 meters away. Black hair and a white lab coat with semi-professional clothes underneath. Beside her is an older woman, looking to be in her mid 40s with black hair as well, in more casual clothes, and the same height as Lin. She’s also holding a small, plastic bag.)

(Lin and the older woman wave. Hector waves back and stands up to face the older woman as the 2 approach.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Morning Mrs. Hagiwara. Lin.

(Lin smiles.)

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Good morning, Lieutenant.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Please, Hector is fine.

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Hmhmh\~… I just wanted to come by and say, thank you again for saving my Lin.

(Mrs. Hagiwara pinches Lin’s cheek and gives it a little shake. Lin smiles at her mother.)

(She let’s go of Lin’s cheek and says-)

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Yesterday was so busy what with the video footage and the funeral, we didn’t have time to thank you properly. So, I’ve brought you some tangerines\~.

(She holds the bag out to Hector with both hands.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Thank you but, are you sure? We’re still rationing our food until farming and ranching gets started.

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** It’s fine, we grow some of our own food in a little hydroponics basin we keep in our room\~. Besides, what do you guys eat anyway? Heh, wood? Go on, take them.

(She shakes the bag a little and he takes it.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Thank you, ma’am.

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Make sure you eat those soon, helps fight colds\~.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Will do.

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Alright, come on now Lin. He’s going to be very busy today.

(Lin and Mrs. Hagiwara turn to leave, but Lin stops halfway and looks back at Hector.)

**Junior AB Lin:** You’re just going back to have a look, right?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yeah, just surveillance for now.

(Lin nods and smiles. Mrs. Hagiwara has also turned to look back at Hector again.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Oh, Lin, can I ask a favor before you head off?

(While Hector is saying this, 3 buggies are coming down the S.S. Forager’s ramp. All with security troopers manning them.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Sure, what’s up?

(Hector dismounts the camera from his helmet and appears to hold it out to Lin. The camera is pointing up to the cloudy sky and no one is in the camera view now. There is the sound of buggies moving and stopping close by.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Today’s just supposed to be an update on what’s going on and we’re beaming the first batch of logs back to earth. Can you drop this off at the studio?

(The camera shakes a little as it moves away from Hector. Lin has taken the camera and is now pointing it at Hector. Behind him are the buggies with the security troopers. Most of them are looking at the camera too.)

(Hector is wearing a black helmet, a black shawl over his shoulders, a gray shirt, black pants, uniform, black gloves, and a gas mask with blue lenses. The security troopers are wearing the same uniform, some with gas masks, some without.)

**Junior AB Lin:** We have a studio?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yeah, we got a small video crew on board. Uhhh…

(Hector strokes where his chin would be on his gas mask while looking at the ship. He begins waving his hand like he’s about to give directions.)

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** I know where it is, I can take her there.

(Hector looks back at the two.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Oh, thank you ma’am.

**Mrs. Hagiwara:** Of course.

(Hector nods and looks back at the camera.)

…

(Hector raises his right fist to head-height… and some of the troopers throw hand gestures too. Some giving thumbs ups, some waving.)

(Lin pans the camera to all the buggies, giving all the security troopers a chance to wave. Some of them chuckle softly.)

(Lin then pans the camera back to Hector.)

**Junior AB Lin:** You all be careful now, ok?!

(Hector slaps his right hand onto his chest.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yes ma’am\~.

(The other troopers join in, all slapping and planting their right hand onto their chest. They all call out variants of “Yes, ma’am”, “you got it”, “understood”, or “yes.”)

(Hector turns and approaches the first buggie’s driver seat.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** I’ll drive, I know the way there better.

**Trooper 1:** Yes sir.

(Trooper 1 stands up, steps over the center console and sits down in the passenger seat.)

(Hector hangs off the side of the buggie and calls out.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Alright, remember that this is just a recon mission! Avoid being spotted and avoid getting into a fight! Everyone got it?!

**Troopers:** Yes!

**Lieutenant Hector:** Good, let’s move it out!

(Hector turns to face forward, drops into his seat, shifts gears, and waves again to the camera. Lin waves back and Hector drives off with the other 2 buggies following behind him.)

(Lin is following the buggies with the camera as they drive towards the tree line.)

(The camera shifts slightly to the left and is gently swaying. There is the sound of ruffling clothes. This is likely Lin’s arm, which is not in view, waving at the buggies as they leave.)

…

(The camera points down at Lin’s legs and shakes gently.)
