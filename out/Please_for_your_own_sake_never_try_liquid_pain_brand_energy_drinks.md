A month ago, the strangest thing happened to me, and I think I should post it here, I wanted to find a more appropriate but my post got rejected by r/energydrinks and r/drinks so this is my last option.

As I said, a month ago I went out shopping at a small store before going to my usual 8 hours of school, that's where I found something unusual, a singular can, labelled "liquid pain".

The flaming red can was completely blank other for the label and a writing on the back, unfortunately I didn't keep the can so I don't remember it word for word, but it was something along the lines of "the only energy drink made entirely of liquid pain! Must be taken in small portions" At the time, I thought nothing of it, I've seen stranger advertising.

I decided to buy the can, but the cashier told me that it was not an item they sold, so they just gave it to me, it was a ginormous red flag, which I should have taken seriously.

Once at school, the first 5 hours went normally, then it became lunch time.

I slid my finger along the lid of the can, the metal somehow didn't feel right, it was extremely smooth, but at the same time, bumpy.

I opened the can and took a sip, it tasted like slightly sugary water, "So this is what pain tastes like?" I thought to myself, but before being able to take another sip, a classmate of mine took the can thinking it was coke and drank it all, I know it was kind of scummy but it's something to be expected when you go to a school famous for its ease, either ways it saved me.

The classmate says something along the lines of "this doesn't feel right" and then shrugged it off, not even a minute passes, and he asks for an ambulance to be called, but it was too late.

What happened next left me shocked.
He started puking what can only be described as the energy drink mixed with lots of blood, then he collapsed to the floor.

School was dismissed early and he was declared dead an hour after, reason of death? Shock due to extreme pain.

I cannot imagine what would have happened to me if I drank the whole thing, either ways the sip I took was enough to make me regret ever taking that can.
The moment I got home, I had a really bad stomach ache, the worst of my life, I felt like I was about to burst, and then it just disappeared within a minute.

I went to the doctor, he said I was fine, I felt like I was not, so I insisted on getting some further examinations which showed no sign of the energy drink in my stomach, strange.

If you happen to find a liquid pain brand energy drink, for your sake throw it away, or don't, either ways, DO NOT DRINK IT, you really do not want to taste it.
