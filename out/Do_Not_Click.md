I don’t know why I clicked.

I should have known better. 

I certainly do now.

I’ve been crawling the dark web for years, not for anything illegal, just curiosity. Information. Weird shit you won’ t find anywhere else. The kind of things that make you doubt the world you live in.

But that night, I wasn’t looking for conspiracy theories or leaked government files. I was looking for something darker.

It started as a joke. A challenge between me and a buddy of mine, Darren. He was the one who sent me the link.

DO NOT CLICK.

That’s what the page said. No other description. No preview. Just those three words.

“Red Room shit?” I typed back.

Maybe. Check it out.

I hesitated, staring at the blinking cursor. Red Rooms weren’t real. Or at least, not in the way urban legends made them out to be. Live-streamed torture, pay-per-view executions? The FBI would have those shut down in minutes. More often than not, Red Rooms were just elaborate scams designed to sucker in sickos who wanted to feel powerful.

But something about the DO NOT CLICK link made my fingers twitch over the trackpad. I should have stopped right there.

Instead, I clicked.

The screen went black.

For a moment, I thought I’d been had, that it was a dead link, a joke. But then, words flickered into view.

WELCOME, VIEWER #1.

I frowned. No way I was the first person here. Even the deepest dark web links cycle through thousands of curious idiots like me. The number should have been higher.

The black screen flickered, and suddenly, I was staring at a room.

Concrete walls. A single, flickering lightbulb. A metal chair bolted to the floor. The camera angle was fixed, slightly distorted, like an old security feed. The chair was empty. No signs of life. No sounds.

I waited.

The chat window popped up beside the video feed.

MODERATOR: Welcome.

I stared at the text, fingers frozen above the keyboard.

Another message appeared.

MODERATOR: Why are you here?

A chill crawled up my spine. The room was empty, but the chat wasn’t. Someone was watching. Someone who expected me to reply.

I hesitated, then typed: Just looking.

No response.

The video remained unchanged, just the empty chair under the dim, buzzing light. But then, in the chat:

MODERATOR: Are you sure?

My fingers twitched over the keyboard.

I was about to respond when the camera feed glitched. The screen tore for half a second, lines of static distorting the view, and then…

The chair wasn’t empty anymore.

A man sat there, head down, hands tied behind his back.

I flinched so hard my knee slammed into my desk. He hadn’t entered the room. There was no door, no sound, no transition. One frame he wasn’t there. The next, he was.

The chat updated.

MODERATOR: Do you recognize him?

My stomach twisted. The man in the chair was wearing a hoodie. Jeans. Shoes scuffed and dirt-stained, just like mine.

A sick feeling took root in my chest. I shifted in my chair, glancing down at my own hoodie, my own jeans.

The chat flashed again.

MODERATOR: Look closer.

My throat went tight. The video was grainy, but I could make out details.

Same brand of hoodie. Same watch on his wrist. Same scrape on his left knuckle.

I raised my hand slowly. The same scrape.

A cold, crawling pressure pressed against the back of my skull.

I wasn’t breathing.

I wasn’t moving.

But in the video, the man in the chair lifted his head.

His face was my face.

Not similar. Not close. Mine.

My vision blurred at the edges. The chat updated.

MODERATOR: Now streaming to 1 viewer.

I lunged for my power button.

The screen didn’t turn off.

I yanked the laptop’s battery out, heart slamming against my ribs. The screen remained on.

The camera feed was closer now, zoomed in on my face, his face, my own terrified expression staring back at me.

I shoved back from the desk. The walls of my apartment suddenly felt too tight, the air thick. I needed to leave. Now.

My phone buzzed.

I shouldn’t have looked. I should have run. But I looked.

A text from an unknown number. Just one sentence.

DO NOT RUN.

I turned toward my front door. My apartment was silent. Too silent.

Then I heard it.

From the other side of the door.

The sound of a chair scraping against concrete.
