Random question. Has anyone ever been to a poppy field before? 

Well if you haven’t no worries I’ll tell you all about it. First of all I live in California and poppies are everywhere here as well as being our state flower. Cool right ? Well I guess it's not that cool. Anyways poppies are quite abundant here, more so in the mountains if you ever drive through California during spring the mountains look like they are covered in a gold carpet of flowers. Those are the poppies. While they can be found everywhere there's something special about those golden poppies in the mountains. So, special in fact, the government in California protects that variant of poppies more than the other types.

 If you so happen to live near the mountains in California all of this is something you would already know. There's one thing that only people who live in the poppy fields know about, and that is the poppy queen. The poppy queen is an even more special poppy, because there is only one per mountain. The only reason I’m pointing this out is because this flower is something you do not want to get near. The mountain people of california call this flower by a different name they call it “The Mountain Siren”. The name if you can’t tell is a type of warning. The parents of children that live in the mountain regions tell their kids when playing in the mountains always go in pairs, and if you hear someone calling you come straight home. The thing is no matter who you ask, one thing is a constant, and that is if you hear someone calling you. Go Home. That is all you are ever told to do, they don’t give a reason, and they don’t tell you why. 

So, me being the rebel that I am. Lol. I decided to do the opposite. I planned to go with a couple of friends just in case. We planned where to go, and when we would go, all we told our parents was that we were going hiking and that's all. The day of the “Hike” three out of the five of us bailed out. So, it's just me and a guy, one of my friends knows he looks chill I guess. After talking about which route up the mountain we’re going to take we left. We talked for a while too…you know, get to know each other better and stuff. It was a long hike, but after an three hours of hiking we heard it. Someone was calling us up the mountain further, so we followed after the voice. It took us up the mountain a bit, and everything was fine until Mark, the guy that was with me, said we passed the same tree again. We looked at the tree for a minute not because it was interesting to look at but rather it felt like we couldn’t look away. Then I heard Mark start to whimper. 

“Sss..Sam something is behind me.”

“I feel something behind me sam.” 

I can’t turn to look at Mark. My eyes are stuck on this weird tree. I want to look back to look at him, because I can feel the dread in his voice and words. 

“Sam…I’m scared..I..I can’t see it but I know it's there.”  

“It's ok, just take a breath.” 

“Ok.”

I can hear his breathing starting to calm down. I tried to look away from the tree again to no avail. My eyes are glued to this ugly ashen tree with dagger-like branches. 

“ Hey Mark, are your eyes also stuck looking at the tree?”

“Ya, mine are too, I don’t know why but I can’t look away.”

I can look away from the tree, but now I understand why he started panicking. I can feel something caressing my back with sharp jagged nails. My heart is racing and hairs on the back of my neck are on its ends. Then I asked a question and I was terrified to get an answer too. 

“Who are you, and why are you messing with us?”

Mark screamed and then started crying. I heard him fall to his knees, and In his erratic crying I can hear him say he can’t see. After a few seconds I heard his voice break as he said he can’t hear anything now. Then I felt something run up my spine. It felt like fingers, carving its way up from my lower back to my shoulders. Then a whisper into my ear. 

“Would you like to see me?” 

“Would you like to look at me?” 

Its voice was a beautiful raspy voice, but it felt empty. I know it's talking to me but it feels “empty” that's the only way I can explain it. 

“Do you think the boy on the ground would like to see me?” 

By instinct I replied.

“No! I don’t think he would.”

“Ohhh. So,now you talk back sammy.” 

“How about we talk some more SAMMY?”

The way it's saying my name… I know it's grinning while it says my name. 

“Sure..I’ll talk with you, but can you let my friend go please?” 

There was a pause for a few minutes. There was a frustrated walking sound behind me as if it was mad at my response. 

“Fine. Under one condition Sammy.”

“Ok, I’ll do it. What's the condition?” 

“You’ll have to look at me that is all. Can you do that SAMMY?” 

That creepy way of saying my name again sends a cold sweat down my spine. 

“O..ok, I’ll look at you.” 

“Good, now look away from the tree, Sammy, and look at me.”

Look away from the tree? Wasn’t it the one making us look at the tree? I said quite for a moment thinking about what it just said. 

“What are you thinking about sammy? Don’t you want to protect your friend?” 

“Sammy?”

“Sam?”

“S-A-M?” 

I didn’t want to respond to it. 

“FUCKING LOOK AT ME SAM! LOOK AT ME! NOW!”

Its voice was different now; it was like several different voices yelling at me at once. 

“I’m sorry sammy. I didn’t mean to yell at you.” 

“Can you look at me please?” 

Now it was back to the voice that I heard originally. I can still hear Mark's low whispering so he must still be fine, But why? Can it not actually harm us physically if we don’t look at it? 

“I know what you are thinking sammy.” 

“ Are you sure you can risk your friend's life with that little conclusion? Can you sammy.” 

“If not”

“WHY DON’T YOU FUCKING LOOK AT ME NOW SAMMY!”

“TURN THE FUCK AROUND NOW!”

*BANG….BANG*

What in the world was that loud sound…A gunshot? I think it was a gunshot coming from the same direction of the town. 

*Bang..Bang..Bang*

“BOYS ARE YOU THERE?”

That sounds like the town sheriff, so with every ounce of strength left in my body I yell, I yelled with everything I had. From the distance I can hear barking and the footsteps of a dozen or so people. Then it spoke again, this time its voice was no longer empty; you could feel the anger, rage, and bloodlust in its voice. 

“Just you fucking wait sammy.”

“YOU ARE FUCKING MINE!” 

Then it went silent. 

I can feel the ground shaking with the amount of people that came to find me and Mark. When the shariff grabbed me, and turned me around by the shoulders. I realized I can no longer hear anything. Looking around I can see Mark crying in his father's arms then I tried to gesture what had happened to no avail. When we got to the sheriff's department I wrote down everything that had happened. When I was done the Sheriff just looked at me not the kind of look you would give a crazy person, but the look you would give someone that you would grieve for.

It's been over a decade since then and I’m now a park ranger for the area that I live. Obviously, I’m not going to tell you where this has happened for safety's sake. 

But if you ever visit california and go hiking up the mountains:

1. Go in pairs
2. Tell people your location
3. Bring a map 
4. If you hear someone calling you just go home.
