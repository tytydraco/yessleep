For about nine years now, I’ve had nightmares every time I sleep. It doesn’t matter if it's ten hours or a thirty-minute nap during the day. I don’t like talking about them usually, the last time I tried to describe a mild one to a friend they told me it sounded like “a cool idea for some messed up horror movie,” so I pretend not to have them anymore. When they first started, they would wake me up in a cold sweat and stay in my mind all day. I thought I was losing my sanity and pulled a few all-nighters, attempting to dodge the dream part of the sleep cycle by sleep deprivation and hopefully reset my brain. I did manage to exhaust myself to the point of practically passing out in a class, but still had a nightmare during those few minutes.
  
As the years have passed, the dreams still terrify me and wake me up multiple times each night, but now I can push them out of my thoughts and get on with the day. Every now and then there’ll be a bad period where the idea of falling asleep at all horrifies me. It’s during these times that the characters in the dreams take on a different attitude, as if they are actors showing the malice behind parts of their masks.
  
I try not to take my dreams too seriously or think that they mean there’s something wrong with me. It’s been happening long enough to almost get used to the cycle of it all, even the somniphobia.
  
It seems to have progressed recently, or at least I think it’s been quite recent, and it’s changed my mind on the whole thing. To reiterate, I don’t think it means there’s something wrong or that there’s some deeper meaning to anything, but it’s made everything in my life confusing to understand.
  
Usually, I’ll have about three to five dreams every night and wake up in between them, either fully or partially awake enough to drink some water and go back to sleep. The dream scenarios are also usually plausible in that there aren’t a lot of supernatural elements in them, which is sometimes why they disturb me. I can’t be sure how often it happens, but the ‘new’ dreams are normal enough to where I can’t distinguish them from real life. It’s taken a long time to figure out that this is what’s been going on, and it’s put a strain on a few relationships with friends. I don’t argue with friends or family a lot, and if we do, we manage to resolve it within a day or two.
  
A little over a year ago, I went to stay with a close in London for a night and we went to see a small show locally. Everything went great, I took a train there, we saw the show and then went back to her place and talked for hours. Then the next day we walked around, and I caught the train back home. From what I remember we had a great time, and she confirmed this to me in a call. During the phone conversation, I brought up how awful I felt for what happened at the library and that even though we sorted it out at the time, it felt rushed because I had to leave so soon to catch my train back. She paused for some time, then asked me “What are you talking about? I don’t understand,” so I reminded her about the other time I went to see her. I stayed the night there again, and the next day she had to pick up a book from the library, so I went with her. I don’t remember exactly how it started, like many arguments when two people are tense generally, but I made a joke, and she took it to mean something else. I knew as soon as I said the words that it wasn’t a good idea and hoped that she didn’t hear but the situation just snowballed. My friend didn’t remember any of this or any of the rest of the things we did during that second trip. This was the first time that I caught my dreams mixing with reality like this.
  
There was another time when I was staying with my family during a break from studying, and I got ready to leave one morning to collect some medication for a family member, but they stopped me and said that they never asked me to do that. They had already gotten the prescription that month. We had to talk about it because I wouldn’t give up and say that I was wrong straight away, I even put a reminder on my phone calendar that I showed them. About a week passed before I brought it up again, only to find that the conversation we had was also a dream. The reminder in my calendar was gone, and I got déjà vu from having to explain everything again, adding the conversation I thought we had.
  
It doesn’t seem like it should be a big problem, at least not to me. As long as I act normally in both reality and the dreams, then does it really matter what happens? Most of the time, it just seems like there might be some misunderstandings.
  
There is one thing that concerns me though. Obviously, if a particularly bad nightmare and the reality element combine, then that might become a problem for my own well-being and the people around me. However, what scares me more is that whenever I go to sleep, I can feel something nearby. Every time I wake up or ‘wake up,’ there is always something that is open. Usually, it’s a closet door, but sometimes it’s a drawer or a tub of something like my moisturizer or tea.
I check my closet every night before bed. I walk up with something heavy in hand, stop breathing and press my ear against the door for thirty seconds. Then I steady my nerves, my heart pounding and my hands going cold and sweating. I swing open the door and try to distort my face, thinking that if there ever is something inside then I can catch it by surprise and hit it before running away.
  
There are still some other things I think I should talk about, but for now, I’ll leave it there. Hopefully I don’t wake up tomorrow to find this all gone.
