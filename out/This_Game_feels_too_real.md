I'm a gamer, I love playing RPGs and the classics, like Sonic, Mario, Assassin's Creed, the list could continue but you get the point. I sometimes livestream my playthroughs of games, even if it doesn't gain many fans or followers.

But honestly, I don't know if I'm glad I streamed my playthrough yesterday.

It was like noon-ish when I got a DM from a random user on Discord, the message didn't say much but, "You need to play." With a link attached to it, I didn't open the link and just ignored the message. 

I went to make myself some lunch but just as I got to the pantry door, my computer started going crazy with notifications. Annoyed, I sat down again and saw that it was the same user, spamming,

"You need to play"

Over and over and over again with the same fucking link! I was getting kind of pissed off at this point, but kept my cool and blocked the user for spam. 

I began to close Discord, but it sparked an idea. People love mysterious and creepy content, so I started a live stream. I waited a couple of minutes for people to join and explained my situation. 

The people in the chat had mixed opinions some saying to open the link and some against opening it, to help with the decision I posted a poll. I was actually against it, this was some creepypasta Ben drowned or Sonic.exe bullshit. And I gave me the creeps nonetheless, but God was giving me the fattest middle finger as I looked at the poll results.

Opening the link, I made a silent prayer and scrolled up to the links and pressed on one.

The screen went black, 

"What the fuck...." I said, but I mean it was normal for the screen to go black for a couple of seconds, but this went on for almost 10 minutes before the title of the game came on screen.

"The Harbor" the letters were in all a deep red and music began to fade in, it was slow and grainy, with no specific melody. It ticked me off, and the people in the chat were also complaining about the sound design.

I collected my nerves, "Relax it's just a game. Plus you have witnesses if you die playing!"

The play button loaded and it kind of looks like a hand-drawn star...great. I press the button and the screen glitches a little but the scene changes to a town. It's pixelated like an original Sonic or old arcade game, there was a little player on the bottom left of the screen. It was kind of cute, 

"That dude kind of reminds me of Pok√©mon!" I say and laugh a bit, as I do so I look at the chat and they keep on saying that the character looks like me, I take a closer look. He actually kind of did!

Same brown hair, same outfit, well almost everything. But the name floating on the head, read Mark and my name was Noah. It was probably just a coincidence, a lot of people had brown hair and I mean my outfit was pretty basic just a white tee and black jeans.

I began to move "Mark" using the arrow keys, and I began to notice that the houses in the town on screen looked similar to my neighborhood. But I did live in an average suburban neighborhood so I didn't take it too seriously.

"Mark", stopped suddenly, and the same grainy, slow music came back on and I saw my viewer count go down from 103 to 67 in a flash. Then, another character came on screen, and my heart did a nervous flutter as I saw the name and design. 

"Grace" is the name of my girlfriend, and she shares the same appearance as she did the last time I saw her. Grace had long auburn dyed hair and she was a traditional goth girl. I tried to keep my cool and reason to myself, "

Grace is a common name! Yeah, and plenty of people dye their hair Auburn!" Yup, Yup. The only thing I couldn't reason was the outfit, even though pixelated I could recognize the Lolita dress mixed with her traditional goth style. I wanted to shut the game off, but I trudged on.

It was a cut scene, and "Grace" was acting like a generic bimbo clutz, but it irked me since she shared her appearance with my real Grace. Then suddenly, the game glitches again this time I could make out the quick flash across "Grace's" face, it was an uncanny wide smile, that was gone in the blink of an eye. 

My viewer count went down a bit to 65 people watching. Who wouldn't leave? This shit was creeping me out. As I was about to say something, another character swooped in on screen, it had a human appearance but with too long limbs and a head. It scurried across the screen, with this wet and gross sound effect, and snatched "Grace". 

This kind of set a bit of panic in me, and I jumped as my phone rang. It was Grace's mom. What did she want from me?

I paused the game and answered, "Mm, Hello? Mrs. Himori?"

Mrs. Himori sounded panicked, her voice light and fast, "Is Grace at your house?"

"What? No?" I say, I hear a hushed, "Fuck..." on the other end of the line, 

"Well, Grace went to her room, and when I checked on her she was gone!"

Panic began to settle in. There was no way in hell that this was a coincidence anymore, this game was somehow linked to reality, 

"Oh my god... did you call the police?" I asked my heart pounding as I stared at the screen, in a moment it glitches out again but I can't see it. The chat is going wild, wondering whether or not this was some kind of sick joke on my part or if this was all real.

Mrs. Himori explained that technically Grace isn't a missing person, or whatever but I have already hung up. I need to save Grace.

I began doing all the things needed to, but this included fighting people I knew in real life. My friends and family. I began to get numerous calls probably from worried parents but I ignored them. My sole focus was saving Grace. 

And the scenes in this god forsaken game were all places in my town, the elementary school, the park, even Grace's neighborhood.

I didn't even care when the viewer count was at zero, I was like possessed, playing late into the night until I finally met the human-like being that took Grace. I but then I saw in a pixelated mess of blood and guts. 

The creature looked at me, not my character but at me. Text popped up, "I want to play more with you."
Huh? Even in this context it was confusing, play more? This was the "boss fight" and then the game shut off. At this point, I slam shut the computer and begin to cry.

The aftermath of yesterday was terrible, 23 people including Grace were found dead. Their bodies were mutilated but not beyond recognition, which honestly was worse. I was called in for questioning by an officer, since all the victims were friends or related to me. I was no use, the state of shock I was in put me in a psych ward, and that is where I'm typing this.

But when I fell asleep yesterday, I had a dream that just kept repeating, "Share me." I know what it means, share this game with others to play, but I feel this is the second best thing to to.
