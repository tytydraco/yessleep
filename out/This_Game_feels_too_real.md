I'm a gamer, I love playing RPGs and the classics, like Sonic, Mario, Assassin's Creed, the list could continue but you get the point. I sometimes livestream my playthroughs of games, even if it doesn't gain many fans or followers.

But honestly, I don't know if I'm glad I streamed my playthrough yesterday.

It was like noon-ish when I got a DM from a random user on Discord, the message didn't say much but, "You need to play." With a link attached to it, I didn't open the link and just ignored the message. 

I went to make myself some lunch but just as I got to the pantry door, my computer started going crazy with notifications. Annoyed, I sat down again and saw that it was the same user, spamming,

"You need to play"

Over and over and over again with the same fucking link! I was getting kind of pissed off at this point, but kept my cool and blocked the user for spam. 

I began to close Discord, but it sparked an idea. People love mysterious and creepy content, so I started a live stream. I waited a couple of minutes for people to join and explained my situation. 

The people in the chat had mixed opinions some saying to open the link and some against opening it, to help with the decision I posted a poll. I was actually against it, this was some creepypasta Ben drowned or Sonic.exe bullshit. And I gave me the creeps nonetheless, but God was giving me the fattest middle finger as I looked at the poll results.

Opening the link, I made a silent prayer and scrolled up to the links and pressed on one.

The screen went black, 

"What the fuck...." I said, but I mean it was normal for the screen to go black for a couple of seconds, but this went on for almost 10 minutes before the title of the game came on screen.

"The Harbor" the letters were in all a deep red and music began to fade in, it was slow and grainy, with no specific melody. It ticked me off, and the people in the chat were also complaining about the sound design.

I collected my nerves, "Relax it's just a game. Plus you have witnesses if you die playing!"

The play button loaded and it kind of looks like a hand-drawn star...great. I press the button and the screen glitches a little but the scene changes to a town. It's pixelated like an original Sonic or old arcade game, there was a little player on the bottom left of the screen. It was kind of cute, 

"That dude kind of reminds me of Pok√©mon!" I say and laugh a bit, as I do so I look at the chat and they keep on saying that the character looks like me, I take a closer look. He actually kind of did!

Same brown hair, same outfit, well almost everything. But the name floating on the head, read Mark and my name was Noah. It was probably just a coincidence, a lot of people had brown hair and I mean my outfit was pretty basic just a white tee and black jeans.

I began to move "Mark" using the arrow keys, and I began to notice that the houses in the town on screen looked similar to my neighborhood. But I did live in an average suburban neighborhood so I didn't take it too seriously.

"Mark", stopped suddenly, and the same grainy, slow music came back on and I saw my viewer count go down from 103 to 67 in a flash. Then, another character came on screen, and my heart did a nervous flutter as I saw the name and design. 

"Grace" is the name of my girlfriend, and she shares the same appearance as she did the last time I saw her. Grace had long auburn dyed hair and she was a traditional goth girl. I tried to keep my cool and reason to myself, "

Grace is a common name! Yeah, and plenty of people dye their hair Auburn!" Yup, Yup. The only thing I couldn't reason was the outfit, even though pixelated I could recognize the Lolita dress mixed with her traditional goth style. I wanted to shut the game off, but I trudged on.

It was a cut scene, and "Grace" was acting like a generic bimbo clutz, but it irked me since she shared her appearance with my real Grace. Then suddenly, the game glitches again this time I could make out the quick flash across "Grace's" face, it was an uncanny wide smile, that was gone in the blink of an eye. 

My viewer count went down a bit to 65 people watching. Who wouldn't leave? This shit was creeping me out. As I was about to say something, another character swooped in on screen, it had a human appearance but with too long of limbs and head. It scurried across the screen, with this wet and gross sound effect, and snatched "Grace". 

This kind of set a bit of panic in me, I jumped as my phone rang. It was Grace's mom. What did she want from me?

I paused the game and answered, "Mm, Hello? Mrs. Himori?"

Mrs. Himori sounded panicked, her voice light and fast, "Is Grace at your house?"

"What? No?" I say, I hear a hushed, "Fuck..." on the other end of the line, 

"Well, Grace went to her room and I called her for dinner for almost 2 hours.

Yeah yeah, the game is connected to real life through demonic powers and grace is killed. The end.
