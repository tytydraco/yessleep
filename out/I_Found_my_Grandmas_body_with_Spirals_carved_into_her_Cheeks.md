I want to start this out by saying, I've never been a superstitious person.
I don't believe in a higher power, demons, poltergeists, or cryptids. However, that hasn't stopped me from being fascinated by these topics.
I love the concept of the paranormal, and spend most of my free time watching scary movies or reading horror novels. Which isn't unsurprising seeing as I was one of those kids who grew up reading books by R.L Stine and Stephen King.
Never once in my life had I expected to encounter a real life horror as gruesome as this.

The title of this post is correct. I discovered my grandma's corpse with blunt spirals cut into her face.

About a month ago, I texted my grandma asking if she could buy me a suitcase for my upcoming internship. She didn't get back to me right away, which wasn't too out of the ordinary, as my grandma had always been a rampant sleeper.
She'd spend most of the day in her bed, whether that be scrolling Facebook, reading news articles, listening to audiobooks, or just catching some Z's.
She'd been retired for quite some time at that point, having been a nurse for a good portion of her life. 
Something she usually complained of was how none of her children nor grandchildren wanted to go into the medical field.
I, myself, am an art major. My younger brother is into rocket science. And my younger sister is, well, boy crazy.
Sorry grandma, but the stage calls my name, not the hospital bed.

Anyway, after about two days of no response, I sent another message, this time with a link to the suitcase I'd picked out.
I didn't want to come off as too desperate, so that seemed like the simplest follow up.

Another day went by, still no answer.

Okay. Panic is kind of starting to set in.
My grandma doesn't usually take this long to respond to my texts.
I was quick to alert my mom of this situation, and she told me she also hadn't heard from my grandma in about 2 weeks.
Now, my grandma is well in her late 70s. And her health hasn't been the best in recent years.
So, like any good grandchild/child would be, my mom and I kind of start freaking out.
My mom decides to give my grandma a call and, low and behold, it goes straight to voicemail.

Now, a little sidenote, my mom goes over to my grandma's apartment about once a month to straighten up the place for her in return for money.
Like I said previously, my grandma spends almost all her time in bed, and doesn't really have the energy or motivation to clean her residence.
Because of this, my mom has a key to my grandma's apartment.

The two of us decided to make the 15 minute drive to her apartment complex, in hopes of making sure she was okay.

Upon arriving at her doorstep, my mom insisted I stand outside, as she refused to let me witness something that could permanently alter my brain chemistry.
A part of me wanted to argue with her, but as much as I loved horror and gore, I knew the movies were nothing like real life.
I nodded, agreeing to wait for her.

I felt an evergrowing pit in my stomach beginning to yell at me, as I watched my mother slide her key into the doorknob's hole.
That's when that nauseating scent painted the walls of my nostrils, god, I can still taste it in the back of my throat just thinking about it.
The smell is something I'll never be able to erase from the hair follicles growing in my nose.

My mom shot me a look of fear, instructing me to call 911.
I did as she said, pulling out my cellphone to dial the number, while she proceeded into the apartment, cupping a chunk of her shirt over her nose in a weak attempt to mask the stench.
I've never had to call emergency services before, and I've always had an irrational fear of phone calls due to my intense anxiety disorder. How I wish I'd had my anxiety meds with me.

A younger sounding woman picked up the phone, quickly asking me what the emergency was and where I was located. I gave her the address, telling her I believed my grandmother was dead.
She could clearly hear my panicked tone, because she began trying to ease my worry, assuring me that she'd alerted local authorities and was sending officers to my given location.

Suddenly, a bloodcurdling scream buried its way into my eardrums, the familiar swearing of my mother sounding from inside the apartment.
Still on the phone with the operator, I swallowed hard, jetting towards my mom's yelling.
Stumbling my way through the place, I stopped at the edge of my grandma's bedroom, seeing my mom standing in the doorway, weakly clutching her stomach with her free hand.
Holding the phone up against my ear, my jaw hung agape, as I stared at the gruesome display before me, vomit practically forcing its way up my oesophagus.

Sprawled out across her bedroom floor was my grandmother. Her joints had been cracked and contorted in inhuman ways, almost like she was some sort of doll that had been manhandled by a careless child. Her eyes were sunken into her skull, leaving nothing but dark, shadowy pits in replacement. Her face pale with hints of green and blue lining the black holes that were now her eyes.
Her skin was like a flabby mass of flesh. Almost like she'd been sucked dry of all bodily fluids.
However, the most alarming part of the entire arrangement were the deep insitions that had been carved into her cheeks. Spirals. One on each cheek. Like some sick creation from the mind of Junji Ito.
The best way I can describe what her appearance reminded me of is that of Billy the puppet from the Saw franchise, with the spirals on the cheeks, dark eyes, and the sickly pale skin.

I don't think I'd ever puked as much as I had that day. My stomach acids basically stained the carpet beneath my feet, tears streaming down the sides of my face.

How I wish I hadn't followed after my moms screams. I wish I hadn't subjected myself to that devastating display. Maybe if I'd just stayed outside, talking to the 911 operator, I wouldn't have forced myself down such a deep rabbit hole.

While I've been mourning my grandma's passing and contemplating all I witnessed that day, we did eventually get a bit of an update revolving around her death.
About a week ago, we got a preliminary report on a possible cause. 
Any rational person might assume foul play by another, but by the looks of it, that wasn't the case.
Her body was estimated to be around a week old when it was discovered, which explained the rotting odour.
As for carvings on her cheeks, they seemed to be self-inflicted, considering how inconsistent the lines were. It was also determined a scalpal was used to draw them, something my grandmother likely had on hand, since being a retired RN.
Her sunken eyes seemed to just be a side effect of her body decomposing.
Her broken joints, however, were a different story.
We haven't gotten an exact cause yet, but the working theory is that she broke her own limbs after carving out her face, and left herself to bleed out on the floor of her bedroom.
The most confusing part of it all though was the lack of blood flow in her body.
From what Google tells me, while blood can decompose alongside everything else, it doesn't do it in such an accelerated way. I mean, she was dead for a week, yet not a drop of blood could be found in her system.
There was no way she just bled out every ounce while waiting to die. Right?

My family and I weren't sure what to do with this information.
My mom had already made plans to cremate her body once the professionals are done with it, which seems like the best option. I wouldn't want to be buried like that either.

I'm sitting here now on the floor of my room with some boxes of junk that had belonged to my grandmother.
My mom asked me to go through it for her, as she can't bring herself to look through any of it yet. I can't blame her, we both witnessed the same awful picture.
I don't think I'll be able to watch the Terrifier films for awhile, if ever again after what I saw.

Anyhow, the real reason I'm making this post is because I came across a few items labeled 'Caroline Davis'.
I wasn't sure who this was at first, but it seems like she was a friend of my grandma, because there's some old letters addressed to her from a 'Caroline'.
I tried checking my grandma's Facebook friends, but I can't find anyone by that name.
There's a framed photo of the two, with writing on the back that reads- 'June 15th, 1966 - Caroline Davis and Brittney Susan - San Pedro Docks'.
Caroline seemed like a pretty young lady. Long red hair, freckles running from her cheeks down her arms. She wore a yellow, floral print sundress in the picture, a beaded necklace sitting nicely along her collarbone.
She posed beside my grandma, who was obviously much younger then, their arms wrapped around one another in a friendly embrace. Clearly just two friends enjoying each other's company at a boat dock.
Another photo showed the two sitting around a campfire, a pair of teenage boys sitting alongside them. This photo is tagged as 'October 31st, 1968 - Caroline Davis, Thomas Smith, Kyle Clifton, and Brittney Susan - Malarial Werwolf National Park'.

The weirdest part of this all were the drawings I pulled out.
There were 3 drawings of the same hooved entity scribbled onto loose paper.
A tall, horned beast, with a toothy grin. Frail bat-like wings protruding from its lower back, and a pair of raptorial limbs on its upper back, resembling the arms of a praying mantis.
A long, arrow-tipped tail snaked down between its awkwardly bent legs, with scribbles resembling what I can only assume is matted hair.
It looked like something straight out of Hell. A stereotypical demon.
I was about to toss these images aside, but that familiar symbol caught my attention.
Plastered across this creature's cheeks were a pair of spirals. Spirals just like the ones my grandmother had carved into her skin.
Was it a strange coincidence? It had to be.
I threw the drawings far away from me, my heart pounding against my chest. That burning sensation itching up the back of my throat, wanting, begging me to let it out.
I swallowed it back down, refusing to let myself puke all over my grandma's things.

I decided to do some research on this 'Caroline Davis' person. Maybe if she was still around, perhaps she had some answers as to why my grandmother had killed herself?
Sadly, one of the first results was that of an obituary.

'Caroline Rose Davis'
'Born August 24th, 1950'
'Died January 11th, 1969'
'Caroline Rose Davis entered the Silver City on January 11th, 1969 in Los Angeles, California after her body was discovered on her parents' LA farm.'
'Caroline was a survivor of the 1968 Malarial Werwolf forest fire, and was an advocate for burn victims.'
'She was born to Nancy Summer Davis and Gerald Francis Davis on August 24th, 1950 at Dignity Health Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, USA.'
'She spent her youth working on her parents' farm, and enjoyed horseback riding and camping.'
'She lives on in our memories, and her parents will continue to do their part in cementing her legacy.'

While some of the information above is helpful, I was more baffled by the photo used.
It was certainly the girl from my grandma's photos, only she had some grotesquely severe scarring across the left side of her face and down her arms. Not to be disrespectful, but it was sickening to look at.
I scrolled back up, eyes locking on to the 'forest fire' section.
Malarial Werwolf. That was the place listed on that campfire photo.

This led me down another rabbit hole.
The Malarial Werwolf National Park forest fire.

Apparently, back in 1968, a forest fire broke out after a group of teenagers selfishly let a campfire spread across a once lush park.
Those teenagers were-
Kyle Clifton
Thomas Smith
Brittney Susan
Caroline Davis

I reached for the photo dated 1968, comparing it to the information given to me.
No doubt about it. This had to have been taken hours before the fire.

Something Caroline's obituary failed to mention was a cause of death.

I decided to take a look at the letters addressed to my grandma from Caroline. Something I'd been holding off on for a bit.

Whether or not Caroline was that important to my grandma's death, these letters seem oddly vial. Almost like Caroline had been slowly losing her sanity while writing them.
She sounded almost paranoid.
I'm going to upload photos of the letters so I don't have to type out all of them here.

I might do some more research on Caroline later, but I really need to push this stuff aside so I can finish going through everything else.
I'll try and update if I figure anything else out.
