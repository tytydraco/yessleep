Late in the evening of September 20, 1926, authorities answered a distress call from a residential school nestled in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. Upon arrival, they discovered a massacre.



The vast majority of the victims had been disemboweled, dismembered, or otherwise severely mutilated. A few bore the unmistakable signs of being eaten.



A search revealed that no adult on the grounds survived the mysterious rampage.



But to the astonishment of the responding officers, not a single student had been harmed.



As authorities canvassed the property, the pupils congregated in the courtyard to watch in calm silence.  



Despite the commendable cooperation displayed by the students, authorities soon turned on them quite harshly.



Despite investigator’s best efforts, most students refused to offer any explanation whatsoever. The few who spoke were not able to provide adequate or useful information. In fact, the information provided was patently absurd and primarily consisted of claims that the revenant of a dead student and a giant broke into the school to wreak havoc.



Understandably, no one believed this story.



After exhausting all other investigative avenues, authorities determined that the students were the culprits, and had staged a particularly violent coup against the staff in retaliation for perceived strictness.



Due to several factors, there are no extant records relating to the eventual fates of any of the students. 



Disturbingly, a review of school records conducted in order to identify all potential suspects showed that many pupils who were supposedly enrolled at the school were missing.



While no remains of any children were recovered from the scene, authorities assumed that these missing students had been murdered alongside staff.



Please note that the name of this school remains censored to the present day. Other than the record of the distress call and a secondhand reconstruction of the associated incident report, all records pertaining to this school were destroyed shortly thereafter in order to avoid inciting panic or inspiring students at other residential schools to stage similar coups. As a result, any and all extant records involving this incident are either destroyed or sealed.



It should be noted that the students were in no way responsible for the massacre.



Two years later, the Agency of Helping Hands finally located the actual culprits.



Both perpetrators were taken into custody in 1928. The full record of their capture can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gtjhlb/fuck\_hipaa\_if\_i\_dont\_talk\_about\_this\_patient\_im/) .



It must be noted that the “giant” referenced in the incident report is in fact Inmate 1 (Ward 1, “Numa.”)



Numa has been incarcerated in AHH-NASCU since his capture.



Numa has a humanoid appearance, although he is significantly larger than any human being; at his full height, he is nine feet three inches tall with shoulders that measure forty-four inches across. His body is covered in very fine, semi-transparent fur with reflective properties. This provides Numa with natural camouflage. He has large eyes with white irises. Proportionally, his mouth is significantly wider than the mouth of an average human being. His teeth are clearly that of a carnivore, but do not resemble the teeth of any known animal. They fall out and regrow frequently.



His jaws possess extra bones and joints that allow the mouth to open excessively wide. These extra bones fold parallel to the teeth, and are effectively invisible when Numa is speaking or at ease. When Numa feeds or wishes to intimidate Agency staff, he unlocks these joints and opens his mouth to its widest point, baring all teeth.



Numa is a very complicated yet highly delightful individual.



While he regularly expresses an obsessive desire to kill human beings, he has demonstrated trustworthiness and consideration in his interactions with staff members. Numa has gone so far as to express affinity for several AHH-NASCU employees over the years. Recently, he has displayed affection towards T-Class Agent Rachele B., who is currently tasked with the design and implementation of his therapeutic treatment.



It should be noted that Numa’s treatment plan was the first designed by Rachele. He has made substantial progress under her care. As of this writing, the Agency considers her work with Numa to be a resounding success.



Numa is estimated to be approximately 14,000 years old. For many years, he was considered to be the oldest inmate in AHH-NASCU.



Numa possesses an excellent grasp of language. He enjoys engaging in conversations with staff, particularly Rachele B. It must be noted, however, that he redirects all conversations to topics that interest him. Numa will not discuss anything he does not find interesting.



The subject most interesting to Numa is Pup, a direwolf that he bonded with thousands of years prior to any involvement with human beings. His friendship with Pup was the most important relationship in his life, and Pup’s eventual death is a source of extreme trauma for Numa. This trauma directly influences and informs his desire to harm human beings. 



Numa was originally taken into custody alongside an injured young girl who clearly felt highly protective of him. Despite their obvious closeness, Numa has never spoken to anyone at the Agency about this girl. He never inquired after her welfare, even after her death approximately seven months following their capture.



Due to his substantial progress over the past few months, Numa finally decided to break his silence regarding his bond with this mysterious child.



The interview below documents the first time Numa has ever spoken about this child, as well as the first interview he has ever given that has not centered around Pup.



**Interview Subject: Numa**

**Classification String:** ***Noncooperative / Indestructible / Gaian / Constant / Moderate / Teras***

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Interview Date: 1/13/25**





Long ago, I found a pup frozen to the ice. When he saw me, he wagged his tail.



Not quite so long ago, I found a child freezing in the snow. When she saw me, she screamed.



When I was a child, I was cast out of my pack. When they cast me out, my mother screamed. Her screams hurt worse than my own fear. I wanted to stop her screams and stop her pain, which caused them. But when I tried to go to her, our crooked-jawed alpha threw rocks at me. The rest of my pack followed his lead. The rocks cut my skin and broke my bones. Every time a rock hit me, my mother screamed more.



I ran away to stop her screaming, but her screaming never stopped for me. I still hear her, even now. Her screams still hurt my ears.



When the child in the snow screamed at me, I thought of my mother. Those thoughts made me want to stop the child’s screams. 



She was burned from cold. Her fingers and her nose were dark with frostbite. Frost glittered on her eyelashes. Her skin was mottled. She was cold where she should be warm, grey where she should be brown. It must have hurt, being in the snow without fur.



Does it hurt to be cold without fur?



I thought if she left the snow and came into warmth, she would stop screaming. So I picked her up.



Picking her up only made her scream louder. When I put her over my shoulder, I saw that her leg was crooked from a break badly healed.



Even though her screams hurt my ears, her crooked leg made my heart ache. My pup had been crippled, too. Without me he would have died. This crippled child would die without me, too.



Even though picking her up made her scream more loudly — even though her screams filled my head and hurt my ears, my eyes, my teeth — I took her with me because she was like Pup and my mother together.



Even though her screams hurt my ears even now, I could not leave someone who was both Pup and my mother to die in the snow.



I brought her to my cave.



My cave was very warm but very foul to noses like yours. The bones, hair, and gristle of my prey lay around the walls like drifts of snow.



When the child saw the bones of men piled in the cave — some whole, some fresh, some old, others split apart for the marrow — tears came down her face.



I did not soothe her. Tears are not for soothing. Tears do not hurt my ears. Only screams do that. That is why I only soothe screams.



I did not know men back then, except as prey. But I had observed them. I knew of their hairless skin. I knew that back in the days when I had my pup, men wore the furs of better, stronger creatures. They invaded the realms of the great elk and the cave bears, the tundra lions and the giant sloths and the mammoths, and killed them all and draped themselves in the skins of those greater, grander beings. 



Back when I found my child, men no longer wore the strong skins.



Those old skins I could only tear with my teeth with great difficulty. They were thick, heavy hides, made all the stronger by curing and drying. I could eat those skins if I tried. They were not delicious, but I found amusement in gnawing and worrying them until they broke apart in my mouth. 



Men now wore new skins that were fragile and weak. I could tear these with my fingers, and eating them offered no satisfaction. 



But the new fragile skins were the only skins men wore now, so they were the only skins I had in my cave. Although poor and thin, they were the only skins I had to give the child.



I found the heaviest one, pulling it from underneath the bloodied remains of the man it had belonged to, and threw it over her.



She gagged, but at least she did not scream. She scanned my cave as I once scanned the ice for prey.



Then she looked at me.



After a time, she wrapped herself in the foul-smelling skin and stood up.



She touched the blood-spattered walls. She toed the ripe, stinking remains of my prey. She pulled at their blood-caked skins and picked up their hats and gloves.



And when she uncovered a long, rusty rifle hidden under a stinking piece of man, she smiled.



She looked at me with bright eyes and asked a question that I did not understand. I told her I did not understand, but she did not understand me either. My voice startled her. Her eyes became very wide, and she stepped back.



But still she did not scream.



I do not remember how long it took to learn her language, or her mine.



I only know that by the time we could speak to each other, I loved her.



The first thing she said to me that I truly understood was: *You kill people, but not my people. You kill people who kill my people. That is why I am not afraid.*



That is why she smiled when she saw the remains of my prey. Sometimes she called my prey loggers, settlers, fur-trappers, or traders.



Most times, she called them monsters.



She told me many things about her people and these monsters who killed them.



These monsters did not belong. They belonged no more than the men who long ago slunk onto my ice on their hollow, stinking bellies to kill elk and cave bears for fur to cover their own weak, hairless skin.



She told me what the monsters did to her and other children. How they stole children like her from their mothers. Sometimes the monsters sold the children to farmers and shopkeepers and churches as though they were slaves. 



Most times, they locked the children in bad schools.



I did not understand what a school is. My child explained that a school is a place where children go to learn. She said learning my language was going to Numa School.



That made me smile.



I asked what was so wrong about school. What was so wrong about learning?



She explained that the school she went to was not a school for learning, but a school for forgetting.



At this school, she was taught to forget her past, her pack, even her name. She was taught to forget her language. At this school, the children were beaten for speaking the language of their mothers.



There were not many people left who knew her language. She knew of less than one hundred, many of them children, all of them locked inside the school for forgetting.



I think I am the only thing alive that remembers her language now. 



That thought hurts me as deeply as my mother’s screams.



These monsters who stole her punished her for remembering her language.



They punished her for helping the other children remember.



They punished her for remembering her pack.



They punished her for remembering her name.



They punished her for remembering.



They punished her for refusing to forget.



They punished her for her strength.


I do not understand this. I will never understand this. I was punished for my strength, cast out and left to die because I was too strong, and would one day be stronger than all the rest. This punishment was meant to kill me.



But it only made me strong.



The punishment of the monsters sought to make my child weak, but it only made her strong.



They hurt her — hurting without hunting is something else I will never understand — and put her outside in the night, in the snow, where the cold burned her and mottled her skin and turned her nose and fingers black.



They meant to kill her, but she did not die.



She found me.



When she told me this, I knew she was not like Pup and would never be. She was much weaker and softer, too weak even to hunt. Nor was she like my mother. Like the rest of my pack, my mother was too strong and too hard to ever be weak.



But she was like me. Someone who had been cast out for being too strong. For being, simply, what she was.



I had never met anyone like me.



There has never been anyone like me, except her.



Together, we learned to speak. Together, we learned to hunt. Together, we learned to protect each other. 



Together, we learned to be pack.



I had no pack since I lost Pup to the men with their hollow, stinking bellies who came to places they did not belong to destroy. Only destroy, not even to eat.



My child had no pack since she lost her brothers to the new men with their weak skins and the same hollow, stinking bellies, monsters who came to places where they did not belong not to eat, but only to destroy.



These men never change.



And I never change.



My child changed. All of her changes made her more like me. A hunter. A predator who kills for the joy of eating.



But not for the joy of destroying.



I never did that. The people who killed my pup and the monsters who killed her people were the ones who did that.



We were a small pack, she and I. I was content with our smallness, but she was not. She missed her old pack. Her brothers especially, and the other children who spoke her language.



She was afraid they would forget their language. That without her, they had already forgotten it.



I told her not to fear their forgetting, because she and I remembered. She and I could teach them. All they had to do to remember was come to learn at Numa School.



She asked, “How can they come to Numa School if they are trapped in the school for forgetting?”



She was so smart, my child. Had she asked me to go to them directly, I would have denied her.



But instead she asked in this way, a special way only she could ask. It was the right way to make me do what she wanted.



It was the way to make me grow my pack, and rebuild hers.



Together, we set off. She did not remember the way, but my nose soon found smells similar to hers — the smells of other children. Over many, may days, I tracked the smells of children to the school.



The school smelled rotten to me.



Not the ripe, sweet, greasy rot of old prey. That is good rot. Right rot. The rot at the school was wrong. It was a void. A hungry rot eating everything in its path, leaving nothingness behind.



As we crept over the gates under the protection of darkness, I smelled something very much like her. More like her than any of the other child-smells. It did not come from inside the school. It came from under the ground, a smell so strong it bled upward through the dirt and rocks and snow.



And it was not the only smell bleeding upward.



There were many of these smells. Too many, all over the grounds. Smells of children who had been killed, and not for eating.



Only for the pleasure of destroying.



The girl went inside the school to see her brothers. She was smart and quiet as I taught her to be — silent as shadows, quick as light on water. 



She found two of her brothers. She woke them to ask about the third. They told her he was dead. Dead and buried under the snow. 



Her pain was mine.



Her rage was mine.



My bloodlust was hers.



“Numa,” she said. “I think it is time that the school for forgetting is forgotten.”



That is what I thought, too.



I am frightful and I am frightfully strong. She was frightful, and frightfully smart.



We were both frightfully angry.



And we were both frightfully hungry. Not hungry for eating, but for destruction.



Together, we forgot the school for forgetting.



Together, we made everyone forget it forever.



That is the night I learned to enjoy killing for the sake of killing. 



We killed the teachers who taught nothing but forgetting.



We killed the schoolmaster whose hands reeked of all the sorrowful child smells bleeding up from under the white moony snow. 



I tore his insides out in a great slippery cluster. I have always eaten what I kill, but I did not eat him. He smelled too foul to eat. I was afraid eating him would make me sick. Or that eating him would infect me and turn me into something like him. A rotten void that leaves rotten emptiness in its wake.



Together, my girl and I kept killing.



I did not eat one bite or lick one drop of blood from anything we killed. They all smelled wrong. They all smelled rotten. They smelled like an infection. I did not want their infection inside me.



I do not want to be like them.



I do not want to be something that teaches others to forget.



I do not want to be a hungry rot that eats and eats until only rotten nothingness is left\]\]



I do not want to be a thing that slinks along on a hollow, stinking belly. I did not want to be a thing that kills for the pleasure of destruction.



I only want to be where I belong.



Your people came where they do not belong. They took me from where I belonged. They put me here.



I do not belong here.



Only monsters with hollow, stinking bellies belong here. 



You do not belong here. Not yet. But that will change. The monsters here will change it. They will make you belong with them. I have seen it happen one hundred times.



I do not want you to be the one hundred and first.



But you will be.





\* \* \*





If you’re not current on my office politics, this will make no sense. Apologies.



Three days ago, I interviewed an inmate named Camila. 



Camila told me that when she was first brought to the agency, staff put her in a holding cell alongside several other inmates.



One of those inmates was a young girl with mottled, discolored skin and a piercing scream.



Based on Camila’s description, that girl sounded identical to Numa’s girl.



The problem with this is the Agency claims Numa’s girl died of wound complications in 1928, and Camila didn’t come into Agency custody until the 1980s.



So the second I left Numa, I ran to Charlie’s office and threw open the door.



Unfortunately, Charlie wasn’t alone. Commander Rafael, and next to him —



“Christophe,” Charlie said sharply. “Watch it. I mean it.”



The bruises on my arm — bruises Christophe himself had inflicted — twinged the instant I heard his name.



But I didn’t care. I was too mad to be scared. Too mad at Charlie, too mad at the commander, too mad at the director, too mad at the agency, and honestly way too mad at Christophe.



I wanted to tell him as much — I wanted to tell them all as much — but I’ve long since learned that admitting fear is the very last thing you want to do here.



So even though he was taller than ever, even though he was scarier than I’ve ever seen him, and even though his eyes had that flat bright look that always makes me want to cry, I said,  “I’m glad to see you back, Christophe. I was almost starting to miss you. Now, Charlie. What in the everloving hell happened to that girl?”



“What girl?”



“The child the Agency brought in with Numa.”



“She’s alive,” the commander cut in sharply. “But she’s not here.”



“If she’s been alive all this time, why didn’t you tell Numa?”



“Because he doesn’t care about her.”



“Well, based on everything he just told me, he very much does. Where is she?”



“Out on loan.”



“On loan.”



“Yes. Several titan-class inmates are. It’s a major source of revenue for the organization.”



I wasn’t sure if I was going to scream, faint, or explode.



“We’ll talk later,” Charlie told me. “About whatever you want, I promise. But not now.” 



I wasn’t willing to push him, not with a monster-eyed wolfman standing four feet away.



So I left.



Unfortunately, that wolfman started to follow me.



The commander surged towards him. There was something about the way he moved that instantly put me on alert, a hard-to-describe quality I’ve only ever seen in people who are about to hurt other people.



Without even thinking, I got between him and Christophe.



The commander tried to stare me down. I didn’t like his expression any more than I liked the way he’d moved, so I stared back as my bruise began to ache.



“Is something wrong?” I asked.



“We’re in a hurry.”



“No, we’re not,” said Christophe.



“Two minutes,” Rafael said. “Any longer and you’re both in trouble.”



We left the office. I shut the door. “What do you want, Christophe?”



“I don’t know.” He hesitated. “I had a nightmare about you. A very bad one.”



“Yeah? Funny, I had a really bad dream about you, too.”



"I'm sorry. I was not trying to hurt you. I know I did, but I did not mean to."

  
This was so absurd that it actually struck me speechless.



He looked at me for what felt like a long time. Then—



“Did you ask them to keep me here with you?”



“Yes, but that was before I talked to a certain lioness. And between you and me, I wouldn’t have asked if I’d talked to her first.”



“I was wrong to hurt her,” he said. “I’m wrong to hurt all of them.”



“But you did, and you do.”



“Yes. There is nothing else to say that isn’t an excuse or a lie. I have never made excuses, and I hate lies.”



I didn’t even know how to answer. The bruises on my arm hurt worse than ever.



“I would have liked to work with me.” With that, he went back into Charlie’s office.



I stalked back to my quarters to write up Numa’s report, but I didn’t get far because my arm was killing me. I pulled off my uniform jacket to check on it.



And I froze.



The bruises were gone.



The stomach-churning swirl of purple and black flesh had transformed into a shimmering, asymmetrical patch of copper-colored scales.



It’s been eight hours. The patch hasn’t spread beyond the boundaries of the original bruises, but it hasn’t gotten smaller either.



I haven’t told anybody yet.



I don’t think I’m going to.
