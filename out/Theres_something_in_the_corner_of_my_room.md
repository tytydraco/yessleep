Its 3am, I cant sleep. I dont think ill be able to until morning at this rate. 

I think its watching me, but its hard to tell.

You know how when youre in a dark room there's usually enough light to see the dimensions of the room? Like you can usually see the corners right?

Yea usually I can too. My room has a window a little bit aways from a street lamp. Even if its the middle of the night I can make out most vague shapes in my room.

Not tonight, at least not in that damn corner right by my door.

Its pitch black. A void. I cant make out the faintest thing in there.

But I can feel it.

Its watching me. 

It feels like worms are crawling all over me. The hairs on the back of my neck haven't gone down ever since I looked over there. 

My dog saw it too. He was here just a little bit ago. 

Lucky saw it first. He was a good dog. Small but full of courage like you would never believe.

He's gone now.

It was almost like something in him switched. Some primal part of him came out. 

One moment he was curled up on the bed with me. An instant later he was jumping off it, screaming and barking like a banshee. 

Id never heard him make those noises before. 

He sounded like a dying rabbit. Thin throaty sqeals that sent shivers down my spine as he jumped off the bed.

He jumped right off and ran into that corner like a bat out of hell, and then... there was nothing.

One moment he was there, the next it was like nothing ever happened.

As soon as he touched that darkness, it was almost as if he vanished into thin air.

Thats when I noticed it... the void.

Its still there. I dont know how long its been there, but im not sure how much longer I can keep this up.

I cant leave

Not through the door anyways, not with it right there. Not with it still fucking watching me. 

I can feel it.

It wants me to go there

It wants me to try and leave. 

Im not going to. Not that way.

I have one other option, and I intend to use it.

You remember that window I told you about?I'm on the 4th floor of my apartment building, so I think my only option is to aim for the street lamp.

There isn't anything else to break my fall. Just the concrete of the street below. Maybe if im lucky I can grab hold of the lamp and shimmy down.

Either way I dont have a choice anymore.

That darkness in the corner of my room. It's growing. I can feel it getting closer. 

I can tell because I cant see the doorway anymore.

Theres only that fucking thing in the corner.

As soon as I'm done typing this I'm going to make a run for the window. 

I hope I'm fast enough. If you dont hear from me. Please, for the love of God.

 Don't look in the corners of my room.
