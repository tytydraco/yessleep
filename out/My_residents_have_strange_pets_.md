I’ve gone over the way the building itself is weird, and how the residents themselves are strange, but I didn’t touch on the pets that these residents have. You already know that this place is lenient with pets, but when I say pets I bet you think of the typical birds, cats, dog, snakes, hamsters, etc, right? 

Well, just like how most of the residents are inhuman, several of the pets that we house here are also… weird. Now don’t get me wrong, even some of the non-human residents enjoy the same pets we do, but there are also pets that aren’t anything you’ve seen before. 

One resident has something that looks like a cat, but it’s covered in glowing fungus and has three eyes. Its name is Findle, and honestly it’s actually pretty sweet, you just need to be careful when petting it. I want to say it’s roughly the size of a full grown hen. I’ve actually been talking with this resident about setting up a possible playdate between Findle and Soot one day, we’re still working out the details. 

Another resident, the one with the color changing eyes, has a bird-like pet named Gentu. It’s looks like a mix between an African Gray parrot and a peacock, and it has an extra eye on its throat. It’s pretty timid around new people, and even though the resident has lived here for about a year, only last week did Gentu let me get anywhere CLOSE to the cage. The resident did reassure me that it took them about a year and a half to get Gentu to this point, so it’s a slow process.

Some other pets include multi-headed/limbed animals of various types, pets that can turn into pure liquid at will, and even ones that don’t match anything that you’ve ever seen before. For example there’s this one tenant who has a pet that’s literally a pile of ashes, but it can shuffle around and eat on its own, I’ve seen it myself. Weird stuff, but still allowed since the resident takes care of it. 

So yeah, if you want to move here but are worried about whether or not we’d allow you to keep your pet, I can assure you that we will as long as you actually take care of the thing. Had to evict a resident once that refused to clean up after their slime, almost lost an eye over that argument. Just take care of your pet and you’ll be fine. 

Speaking of that, you have no idea how much of a pain it was to try and find a way to allow people to have specific pets that won’t cause deposit-losing damage. We can’t do the usual rules like you see at other apartments because of the wide variety of pets that we can get here. I have been able to optimize the application form to have pretty broad categories of pet so I can find the right lease type, but even then you have people that’ll lie about what pet they have or sneak in a pet after they’ve already signed the lease, and THAT is its own headache. I tend to think of myself as a pretty easy going person, but even I have my limits, and making MY job harder for no reason is pretty up there. 

And don’t even get me started on trying to repair apartments after someone moves out and their pet has trashed it. Do you know how difficult it is to find a cleaning and repair company that WON’T ask questions about what caused the damage? Funnily enough that’s how I ended up delving down the rabbit holes of non-human owned companies, but they’re super finicky to deal with so I tend to just try my best to make up excuses for the human owned ones. 

Overall, I don’t care if someone has a cat, dog, snake, slime, lava snail, whatever it is as a pet as long as they take care of it properly and don’t cause massive damage to their apartment. Hell if you’re not even from this city, I’ll help you look for shops that sell supplies for your otherworldly companion because I’ve heard from other residents how much of a pain it can be. I’ve seen enough by now to give good tips and locations, after all. 

That’s all for now I guess. I need to search the lease forms for a deposit plan that works for a large ink gecko. I think that would fall under the “liquid” category…
