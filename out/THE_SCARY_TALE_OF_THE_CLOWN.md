When I was 12 i was invited to a birthday party which was of my best friend **Nathan,** I was a fat boy at that age and loved to eat, when i went to the party i found it pretty boring till i found out that they ordered McDonald's, while eating my puff i saw a clown wearing a red costume with white stripes showing tricks which is done by a regular clown. I was bored and decided to mess with him, after every trick he showed, I shouted BOO!!, after a while he looked at me smiling, behind his creepy smile i could clearly see his anger towards me, after his show kids decided to play on some slides outside and i enjoyed with them, later i got the **THE URGE TO PEE, and decided to go the washroom inside**.

It was evening and the sun had changed direction, i went inside and in a dark pathway, I met him the clown, he laughed and said "Hey you really liked my show today". I being very rude said " get out of here u stupid clown" after this a heavy blow was felt to my face, He kicked the shit out of me and picked me up and took me to the bathroom, then he put my face into the toilet seat and started peeing on me, and laughed like a maniac, i was able to get out but he caught me by my collar

He threw me to the ground and put his heavy leg on me, then pour soda all over my face, with great effort i ran from there to a nearby pantry and closed it

It had no locks and i was using my body weight to prevent him from opening the door, but he opened it and caught me, Horrified i started crying and he started punching me breaking my teeth, i was almost unconscious, then he hit my crotch with his leg repeatedly and then sat on me.

I felt extreme pain and then he got out his knife and poked it into my nipples, i was horrified, i was bleeding and then i shouted with top of my lungs but he put his hand on my mouth

Then he cut my hair, my head was bleeding and finally i thought i would die he went back and opened my pant, in anger i hit my leg on his face and shouted, in a last chance to run i got up and with full force ran for the door and he caught me pulled me from the neck and slapped me my jaw almost broke when the best friends dad walked in, and said "What's going on here"? and after looking at all the blood he punched the clown and took me from him. The clown picked up the wheat bag which was in the pantry and threw it on the Dad and then ran away.

The clown was never found and the agency from whom the clown came told that the clown they sent had died and his clothes were stolen

This scares me till this day.  I got a surgery done where he had put a scar from my nipples to my stomach, i was lucky to survive, the doctor told if he had cut a little deeper like 1 cm i would have died

Even though i was very rude i don't think i deserved anything as a 12 year old

Later on i grew up as a problematic kid and bullied a lot of children in my school which got me suspended

Now i am fine working as a surgeon with my happy family

The clown is still roaming open in the streets waiting upon his prey
