**Entry 1 – September 3rd**

Don’t know why I’m doing this. I guess I just need somewhere to dump my thoughts. Mom’s been on my case since school started. “Stop gaming so much, Ethan. Go outside. Make friends.” Blah, blah.

But something happened tonight. Something weird.

I was on a forum I found through a link in a chatroom. Sketchy looking, black background, red text. Most of it was junk—fake hacks, creepy pasta-tier horror stories—but one thread caught my eye: *“The Silence Game – Real Challenge, Real Stakes.”*

The post just said: *“Only for those who don’t scare easy. Play with headphones. Follow instructions. Win, and you’re never the same.”* And then a download link.

I should’ve walked away. But I didn’t.

**Entry 2 – September 4th**

I installed it on my old laptop. It doesn’t show up in my files, but it runs. No graphics, just a black screen and distorted whispering. The text said: *“Level 1 – Stay Silent. Don’t speak. Don’t move.”*

Seemed dumb. But I played along. Sat still for five minutes.

Halfway through, the whispering stopped. I swear I heard breathing. Not from the laptop—from behind me. I turned fast, nothing there. But my chair creaked… like someone had just leaned on it.

Game said: *“You moved. Strike One.”*

Then it shut off.

**Entry 3 – September 5th**

Tried to uninstall the game. Couldn’t find it. System restore didn’t work either. When I opened the laptop tonight, the game launched itself.

*“Level 2 – Don’t Blink.”*

What the hell does that even mean?

I covered the webcam just in case, then stared at the screen like an idiot. My eyes burned. Tears streamed. I blinked. The second I did, a loud static burst filled my headphones, like a scream buried in white noise.

Then a message: *“He sees you now.”*

The screen flashed an image for a split second. I barely caught it. A face. Pale. Hollow eyes. No mouth.

**Entry 4 – September 8th**

Things are getting bad.

I keep hearing footsteps outside my room at night. Slow, deliberate. My door creaks open on its own. Last night, I thought I saw something in the hallway mirror—tall, thin, no face, just empty skin where the mouth should be.

I haven’t played again. But the game runs itself now. Every night, midnight. My laptop turns on, even if it's unplugged.

I left it outside in the trash. Came back from school, it was on my desk. Running.

**Entry 5 – September 9th**

No sleep. Can’t eat. The whispering from the game is in my dreams. My ears won’t stop ringing. I asked my mom if she’s hearing things at night. She said I must be stressed.

The game started a new level last night.

*“Level 3 – Feed Him.”*

There were no instructions. Just the whispering, louder now. It sounded like my voice this time, begging. Screaming.

I saw the pale figure at the foot of my bed.

I think it smiled.

**Final Entry – September 10th**

I think I know what “feed him” means.

He wants me to bring someone.

Someone else has to play.

I’m sorry, Alex. I really am. You’re my best friend. But you said you weren’t scared of anything. You said you’d try anything once.

I’m sending you the link.

Don’t hate me.

*Authorities found no trace of Ethan. His laptop was missing. The only thing on his desk was a flash drive labeled “Silence.exe.” The file is unreadable. Multiple attempts to open it have caused system crashes.*
