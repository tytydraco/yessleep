I couldn't believe my luck when I stumbled upon the perfect apartment in the city. I had just moved to a new city for work and was struggling to find a decent place to live. But then, I found it - a spacious apartment with a great view, and the rent was incredibly cheap. At first, I thought it was too good to be true, but I signed the lease anyway. Little did I know that I was about to become a prisoner in my own home.

At first, it was just small things - objects moving on their own, doors creaking open, and strange noises coming from the walls. I dismissed them as my imagination playing tricks on me, but the unease I felt kept growing stronger with each passing day. It was like a constant presence was lingering around me, and I couldn't shake it off.

One day, while exploring the apartment, I stumbled upon a small room hidden behind a loose shelf in the living room. The room was musty and dark, but there was something about it that drew me in. It was like a magnetic force was pulling me towards it. As soon as I stepped into the room, I knew that something was not right. The air was thick and heavy, and I could hear whispers all around me. I tried to leave, but the door had locked itself from the outside. I was trapped.

That's when I saw it - a strange symbol etched into the wall. It was like some kind of ritualistic marking, but I didn't know much about that kind of thing. As soon as I saw it, the symbol started to glow, and it was like a portal opening up in front of me. I could see glimpses of another world beyond it. I closed my eyes and hoped it would go away.

When I opened my eyes again, the room was back to normal. The symbol was gone, and the whispers had stopped. But I knew that something had changed. It was like a switch had been flipped, and I was now living in a world where the paranormal was a reality.

The activity became more frequent, and it was impossible to ignore. I could feel the entity lurking around me, even when it wasn't visible to my eyes. It was like a shadow that was always following me, and I couldn't shake it off. The fear that I felt was overwhelming, and it was slowly eating away at me.

I tried everything to get rid of it - sage, prayers, even calling in a priest. But nothing worked. The more I tried to fight it, the stronger it became. It was like it was feeding off my fear, and it was getting stronger by the day. I was living in constant fear, always lurking around the corner of my eye, I can sometimes feel its faint breath on the back of my neck and I felt like I was going crazy.

I started to see the entity more frequently, and it was always in the form of a shadow. It was like a black mass that was moving around me, and I could feel its presence even when I couldn't see it. It was like it was toying with me, and it was enjoying it.

One night, I woke up to find the entity standing at the foot of my bed. It was like a black mass, and it was pulsating with a strange energy. I could feel its breath on the back of my neck, and I could feel its eyes on me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. It was like the entity had taken away my voice.

After that night, I knew that I had to leave the apartment. It was like the entity was now a part of me, and I couldn't escape it. I tried to leave, but it was like it was following me. I could sense its presence wherever I went, and I knew that it was not going to leave me alone. I'm now living in a constant state of fear, and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

As the weeks passed, I became increasingly paranoid and anxious. The entity seemed to be growing more powerful and its presence was becoming more intense. The slightest creak or bump in the night would send me into a panic, and I found myself staying up late into the night, trying to avoid sleep and the nightmares it would bring.

One day, I decided to do some research on the apartment building. I dug through old newspaper archives and talked to some of the building's longtime residents. That's when I discovered the truth about my apartment. It turned out that the building had a dark history, with rumors of strange rituals and disappearances dating back to the early 1900s. I also found out that previous tenants had experienced similar paranormal activity in the apartment, with some even claiming to have seen apparitions and heard voices. But not as serious as this.

At that point, I knew that I had to take action. I couldn't continue living in constant fear, and I couldn't let the entity control my life any longer. I started to research exorcisms and contacted a few experts in the field. But I wasn't satisfied with any of them. They all seemed like conmen trying to make a quick buck out of someone's misery. But one day when I shared my situation at work one of my colleagues from India told me he knows a powerful tantric practitioner who has helped their community in the matter of paranormal. As usual I was very skeptic, but I was also desperate. So took his contact details.

The guy was a digital ghost and it was a task and a half to just get ahold of him. It wasn't easy, but eventually, I found his place but then it took a whole lot of pleading and begging to make him willing to help me as he repeatedly tried to get me to leave. He was also the first person to not ask for any money but instead he had a list of demands and items. When I was about to leave he gave a pair of white clothes that appeared to be some kind of elongate pajama or a closed robe all the while chastising me for my carelessness and complaining about money he's losing because of me and something about his boss at work at which point he switched to speaking in his Indian language and I left.

I got back and contacted my friend from work and showed him the list as I could not make the head or tail of it except for a few items like coconut, lemons, eggs. I decided to stay in a motel for the day while my friend did the shopping. It was sundown by the time he returned, he had bought some weird stuff like some kind of powders, of different colors, a bunch of dry wood, twigs and leaves, etc. We left for my apartment and when we reached the guy called and told me to have a cold shower and wear the clothes he gave me. I did as he instructed. 

He had arrived by the time I was out of the shower and was already in that room chanting something inside a circular design he made using the colored powders, with a fire burning in the middle of it inside a metallic container. He had place lemons all over the floor and had kept 3 eggs in front of him with some kind of yellow and red powder on the shells. When I entered the room he gestured me to sit on a wooden plate cross legged. After me and my friend put in a lot of effort to get me to sit cross legged, I had decided with great conviction that I will take yoga classes from then on. Then he bound a reddish thread around my wrists and asked me to wear an amulet tied to a necklace made from black thread and marked my forehead with something that looked like talc and then a red powder and then a black stuff that felt like burnt engine oil but smelled like soil after it had rained a little. 

Then he started the ritual by placing a small brass idol inside a plate in front of him and started to chant something while pouring water and other liquids on the idol using a small weird shaped copper spoon that looked like an artefact. The ritual was a grueling and terrifying process, I felt sharp pain in different parts of my body and every time I felt like *that was it* for me. But I continued to follow his instructions no matter what, put stuff into the fire whenever he told me to, squashed some lemons, threw some over my head towards the back where the symbols were. He placed the three eggs in a weird earthen container wrapped in some kind of wide leaf. He stopped chanting for a while and kept staring at them for a couple of minutes, even me and my friend were doing the same.And them we heard them cracking, and a blood like liquid started flowing out from inside the wrapped leaves. Then he rubbed his hands a clapped twice really loud like a couple of gunshots, I shook in terror from the noise. 

He then calmly got up holding the container full of that blood like liquid, took a small dried twig with branches dipped it in the container. He gestured me to stay put and not move. He walked behind me and started drizzling the wall with the etched symbols with that red liquid. He came back and doused a lit camphor in to the container while chanting something, suddenly, the liquid set it self ablaze and burned with bright blue flames with such ferocity  like it was coming from a blowtorch. Then it stopped burning abruptly and when I looked back, the container had a clear water like liquid inside it instead of the blood colored one and also the quantity seemed to have halved. The eggs and leaves had disappeared.

He scooped some of that with his copper spoon and poured it into the fire. A thick white smoke started coming from it. He handed me an earthen pot with some kind of marking around its neck. There was a chunk of black substance inside it that looked like charcoal. Then all the pain in my body disappeared abruptly. I though for a second, was that it, the ritual was done? But then came the sharpest pain in my chest as if my heart was being pierced with a hot iron knife, the pain was so excrucuating, I had my mouth wide open but my vocal cords felt so wound tight that I could barely make a sound. Then I started  to feel really really nauseous and light headed, he gestured me to puke into the container.

I followed through and puked out about a fist full worth dark slimy goop into the clay pot and when I looked carefully it had strands of a substance that glowed with a bright blue hue. He immediately put a lid on the pot and took it from my hand. That was the moment when I felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest, I felt a breeze of calmness and bliss emanating from inside me. I knew I had been release from the clutches of evil. I just looked at my friend with a smile of gratitude and he  smiled back in acknowledgement. Meanwhile the tantrik was rigorously winding the clay pot with a lot of read thread sealing it shut until every bit of the pot was covered in thread and then some on top of it. He then placed the pot in a red piece of cloth and wrapped it with it and bound it tightly. He was putting so much force in to the knot that I was worried he might crush the pot inside.

He said it was over. Then he got up to walk out. Before he left he told me to keep wearing the amulet and thread around my wrists. Gave me couple of spare ones in case I lost the ones I had and gave me the address of a temple where I can get them bound. He gave me a small card with a photo of some deity and some incantation looking things in the back and a little bit of red powder wrapped in a small piece of paper he tore from the news paper and instructed to always keep them on me either in my purse or backpack. He then pointed to my door, and said "Don't come back more than three time, you leave house and find new. Until then stay his house, very good food" as he pointed at my friend, we both laughed sheepishly. I tried to give him some money, he profoundly refused and instead told me "You too curious. Don't. Vet bad habit. Stop" 

And then he gave me a visiting card. It was for a landscaping company. I should have kept my mouth shut, but I said I wasn't rich enough to own a house yet, which duly prompted him to shame me by comparing me to some rich people of my age that he knows of and told me if I don't work harder then no one will marry me, he swore up and down about how good their service was and asked me to refer them if anybody I knew needed landscaping done. We said our goodbye, my friend timidly said his relatives were coming to his house after the guy left, I laughed and told him I wasn't actually gonna move in to his house, he laughed meekly in response. 

I grabbed everything important to me put it all in a large box and moved out. A couple of hours later my friend came back with enough food to feed an entire village for a month. I really had to have him sit down and explain to him that I had zero intentions of moving with him nor I felt bad about it. Even though he told me  I could come back three times, one time was already too many for me.  So I moved all of it to my motel room. A couple of hours later my friend came back with enough food to feed an entire village for a month. I really had to have him sit down and explain to him that I had zero intentions of moving with him nor I felt bad about it. The next day I had a moving company move my stuff into storage. I left that room and the stuff inside untouched.

I moved out of the motel soon after that and never looked back my old apartment again. But the experience left a lasting impression on me. I realized that there are things in this world that we can't explain, and that sometimes we have to confront our fears head-on in order to overcome them.

Now, I'm more cautious about the places I choose to live, and I always make sure to research the history of a building before I move in. I still have nightmares about the entity and the small room, but I know that I'm stronger for having faced them. They also stop if I keep that photo and paper sachet under my pillow, so I've made a habit of that before I go to sleep.

If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are people out there who can assist you, no matter how terrifying the situation may seem. And remember, sometimes the scariest things are the ones that we can't see.
