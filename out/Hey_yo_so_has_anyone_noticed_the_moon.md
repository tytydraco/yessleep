So I was just going through the motions of my day, I had just sent my boss some internal accounting info that I was sure was my best work yet with suggestions that would put me over that jerk Brayden who is another accounting manager at the company I work at when I took out my handy dandy telescope and just took a gander at my surroundings. eventually, my eyes rested on the moon's shiny surface.

Seeing the strangeness that I witnessed I know immediately the situation at hand and couldn't help but snarl at the implications. This was gonna affect my perfect attendance at work, my boss will probably think less of me and forget about the managerial shifts I made during my first few months at the company. They were some of my best work to be clear, I pulled many all-nighters surveying the office and its happenings, documenting things Dont having a paper trail in the office... so on and so forth. It was amazing, I still remember my face that day I gave my boss the first progress report. The reflection in the mirror right behind him showed my pearly whites sticking out like a sore thumb as I handed my boss the report like a dork. My best work was on the fund transfer problem I discovered when I stumbled upon the needlessly convoluted methodology our currently contracted funds-transferring company was carrying out that cost us so much more than a just as reliable company I was aware of from a previous company I interned at the beginning my career. Heh, I love what I do but that being my first major career move was the fire that ignited my work boner. Of course, the rest of my work was pretty standard from then on, but I pulled that achievement out every time that jerk Brayden got on my nerves. "Oh, I'm sorry Brayden. Did you bring the office donuts? Man, that's some good effort there, not everyone can save the company so much money that the whole department gets a raise but hey... you'll get there some time sport. For now, these bow ties will do just fine don't beat yourself up about it." Hehehe the look on that sorry bastard's face hehe. 

Oh yeah, the moon was "tempting" again. Bad stuff. Long story short, something is trying to wriggle out or escape and it has to do with the moon. I don't know ALL the details myself but I do know my life is pretty much over. The fact that things are acting up right now and I'm not seeing any movement from my usual contacts, means whatever it is that's trying to break free/enter is throwing a temper tantrum that has killed off its other guards or something to that affect. The good news is that I caught it with more than enough time to spare and can relinquish my life to delay it but the bad news is that I'm pretty sure I'm the last martyr who knows about this phenomenon so I just need to inform others about the general situation before I go and kick the bucket. 

It's a complicated process but basically, so long as people know about this whole holding back the monster thing, someone by hook or crook will sacrifice themselves. It's a fate thing set up by our ancestors and the particulars are too complicated for me to explain, I'm just a managerial accountant after all. So basically as long as at least some people know this information then by fate, those people will be natural wardens on call, waiting for their time to come. It's crazy amazing isn't it? You can be an unreasonably strong monster that can't be defeated in any conventional sense but just because some old coots in the past made arrangements with fate to facilitate your failure under certain conditions you will suffer being suppressed by beings below your status.

Usually, this isn't a big deal but whenever the thing trying to escape throws a tantrum like this it usually chews through wardens ten times faster than it does when it is docile. This is a family secret of mine but since I don't have a next of kin since I was planning to fully devote myself to work; this is pretty much the next step. It doesn't really matter anyway, it was just tradition after all to keep the honor in the family or yaddah yaddah. 

Anyways just look into the moon while recalling this passage and the steps needed to be taken along with your fate being tied into the process will be complete(the fate thing tying already happened, just the last step makes things a lot more direct for you to eventually become a warden). Umm, thank you for your time. Sorry about mouthing off about work and all that by the way. It's just that I was pretty excited about my career but things aren't going to be getting any better there anymore. Stay safe and keep your eyes out for the moon. Toodles~~~~
