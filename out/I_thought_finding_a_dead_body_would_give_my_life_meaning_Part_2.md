They are calling me “Lucky Wendy” again, thank God! To think that they stopped doing so after last summer’s endless parade of corpses.

  
In any case, my latest search-and-rescue mission should have been another recovery. A hiker had gone missing and was presumed dead near Devil’s Rock Ridge, a place notorious for its sheer drop-offs and dense underbrush. But when we found him — alive, dehydrated, but very much breathing — I let out an involuntary, “Thank the Lord! Hallelujah!”

  
The rest of the POSSUM (Patrol Officers Specializing in Searching for Unfortunate Mountaineers) unit rangers laughed, dubbing it my “ABBA moment.”

  
John Johnny Johnathan (yes, that was his real name) had fallen into a crevice and gotten wedged between a stubborn tree root and solid granite. He broke his leg in the fall and survived by eating mossy bark and drinking rainwater that pooled in the cracks. He was lucky.

  
And so was I, apparently. Another rescue. Another life was saved. Another grim joke at my expense.

  
“Just another Lucky Wendy mission,” they teased, but I could hear the relief in their voices. Me too. Nowadays I no longer think that finding dead bodies is the way to prove myself — to find that one body no one else could. I used to think it was about redemption, about making up for all the ones I never found. But after last summer, I no longer think so.

  
This was after I transferred back to the POSSUM unit near my old family cabin two years ago. I’d pushed for it, convinced that this was where I’d finally prove my worth. They, too, were eager, hoping my so-called luck would rub off.  


“Welcome home, Ranger Wendy Girnt!” Ranger Station Chief Kerry Morgan greeted me with a firm handshake. “Glad to have you back. Maybe you’ll turn things around for us. We’ve been finding nothing but bodies the last few seasons.”

  
I smiled, nodding along, but inside I was giddy.... nothing but bodies!!! This was exactly what I wanted. Then Mitt Scallion disappeared.

  
Mitt was a weekend rancher, an engineer at Rocket Propulsion Labs who had a side hustle growing ‘herbs’— forest ginseng and other legal but sketchy crops. The last person to see him alive was his ranch caretaker, Wiley Jacksons.

  
“He was plowin’ the south field when a BackBroke Cowboy tour group rode by,” Wiley drawled, shifting his chew to the other side of his mouth. “Saw two of ‘em getting all cuddly on horseback, and he just lost it.  
  
Yelled somethin’ about ‘public displays of fornication’ and next thing I know, he’s screamin’ ‘Mother of God!’ and drivin’ straight into the duck pond.”

  
According to him, after Mitt lost control, the tractor didn’t stop. It crawled out of the tar-streaked duck pond, churned up the other bank, and went straight over the cliff’s edge. His still screaming employer with it.

  
Jimmy spat into the dirt. “He’s done for, I reckon. That tractor woulda crushed him good.” 

I fought to keep my face neutral, but my pulse thrummed with excitement. This was it. This was my moment.

  
I led POSSUM Team Alpha down the cliffside, rappelling into the gorge as loose gravel skittered past us. Halfway down, we spotted him.

  
Face down. Motionless. The red-cabbed Jack Deere tractor perched on his lower body like a final insult.

  
“Alpha Lead to Alpha Team,” I spoke into my throat mic. “Looks like a DOD.” Dead on Discovery.

  
“Alpha One to Alpha Lead, copy that. Please confirm life check,” Beck Bernstein, my second-in-command, responded. 

I dropped the last few feet, landing next to Mitt’s crumpled form. His back was twisted at an unnatural angle, his legs completely pinned under the tractor’s weight. I knelt, fingers pressing against his dirt-streaked neck.

  
Nothing.

  
“No pulse!” I reported, maybe a little too eagerly.

  
“Alpha Lead, please confirm.”

  
I opened my mouth to respond — that’s when I heard it. “Kill me! Kill me! Please kill me!” The voice was soft, raw, desperate.

  
My heart jackhammered against my ribs as Mitt’s head turned ever so slightly, bloodshot eyes locking onto mine.

  
“I can’t feel my butthole, my balls, or my cock,” he rasped.

  
A wave of disappointment crashed over me. My first real corpse, my first moment of validation — ripped away.

  
“Alpha Lead to Alpha Team,” I forced out. “He’s alive. Prep for medevac.”

  
My team cheered. Beck beamed as she rappelled the final stretch. “Lucky Wendy strikes again.”

  
I swallowed my frustration. This was a good thing. A life saved. That’s what I was supposed to want, right?

  
We stabilized Mitt, believe it or not, using one of his inventions — a Scallion Mini Hydraulic Rescue Jack — to lift the tractor enough to pull him free. Miraculously, the weight of the Jack Deere, mixed with the thick duck feathers and tar from the pond, had formed a makeshift tourniquet, keeping him from bleeding out.

As we strapped him to the stretcher, Mitt stared at me, something dark and unreadable in his eyes.

“You should’ve let me die.” His voice was barely a whisper, but it sliced through me like a blade. “You’re going to regret this. I’ll make you pay.”  
  
Then the painkillers kicked in, and he was out.

I laughed it off and chalked it up to delirium. But those eyes — black pits that swallowed the fading light — lingered in my mind long after we airlifted him out of the canyon.

It was just another lucky rescue. Just another day as Lucky Wendy. I had no idea what I’d done. But I would find out soon enough.

And I would wish — more than anything — that I had let Mitt Scallion die. Anyway, I am off to celebrate my latest rescue with Beck and the team, more to come later.
