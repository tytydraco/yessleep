Hello reader ,as you might think I survived for another cycle. This time I got some more time to write and I won't try to rush it.

I think we left off after I went to the market and encountered Robert.

I got into my new room and put the salt on the bedside and the cans under the bed.

I was thinking "If this is not real I got a lot of explaning to do to Robert and probably the cops".

It was around 6PM and knew I still had a long time until encountering the assasins.

I locked my room and turned on the TV while trying to ignore Robert's calls.

At around 1 AM I got a little sleapy and decided to grab myself a coffe from the nearby coffe store

I got there and order 1 coffe .While I waited i decided to sit at a table and almost instantly a woman with a black trench coat sat next to me and said"You know you only have about 2 hours until I come yes?"

"Ah shit this must be The Timer ,Do I run?,Do I fight her?,Do I speak with her,Do I just ignore her ?,in the letter I wasn't told that they would aproach me." I was thinking

So of course with my brain full of adrenaline I decided to say "Yea but I will be in by that time."

The Timer said "Of course ,now enjoy your coffe because until 9AM you shoudn't try to get out of the Hotel"

After that she got up and leaved

"This is new information ,so aparentley I have to stay in the building that I am in ,not just in my apartament, we are making progress."

My coffe was ready and right before I started to drink it I started to think "What could she achived from this i wonder?"

Before I got the chance to drink it it hit me"The Frog probably poisoned my coffe".

I payed for the coffe and trew it in the first trash hoping no hobo will try to get it.

I arived at my hotel room with the energy I need it from the adrenaline and encountered 2 classes.Preaty good for a 15 minute walk

I watched some more TV and then my alarm for 3:00 AM went off.

15 minutes in and nothing.

30 minutes in and nothing .

1 hour in and still nothing.

After about 3 and a half hours in the cycle I heard something that made my blood freaze in my veins ,I heard a knock,this must be The Chaser,I hope he is not in the mood to run this night.

I looked at the window after the third knock and saw a lasser in the room.I just have to not close to it since in about 30 seconds the 4th knock will make him go so I don't really get the "pray" part from the letter.

After the 4th knock the lasser disapered and I got in the oposite side of the room to where the door was.

And then the 5th knock came and in the room he came too.

He was a man with his face covered by a surgical mask and dressed in a hoodie and I think some joggers but I didn't realy had time to look at him.

I started to try and evade him but he almost touched me in the first 5 seconds,but fortunately he triped and I sprinted through the hallway .

I had an advantage but he was fast as a bullet .I went to the left and again he almost touched me

After we ran for around 10 minutes he stoped and sprinted for the exit.

I know I was very close to being dead but I kinda enjoyed it ,I felt exaticly how I felt when I was a kid and we played catch.

I quickly got into my room and after about 2 minutes I saw the lasser again in the room.

After about 2 hours the lasser disapeared and I knew I could feel somewhat safe for the time.

Not even 3 minutes after the lasser disapeared I saw something at my window that almost made me faint, I saw The Watcher at my window

Now I didn't knew if I blinked I would die or not but I wasn't about to take any chances.I put my fingers to my eyes to keep them open and I started to count loudly 101 102 103 .... 168 169,why isn't he leaveing?

After about 100 seconds I blinked and I was sure I was dead but he disapeared"So aparentley he won't leave if I look at him "I was thinking to my self

Around 8:30 AM I looked at the window again and there he is again so guess what I did? 101 102 103... 189 and then I turned around and he left .

At 9 AM an alarm went off and I knew I was safe .I got in the bed and got a well deserved sleep

And that is how my first cylce of many went.

Now its about 1AM and I will drink some coffe made by me because after the first cycle i don't realy trust anyone around me and prepare myself for another night of this hell.But at least I will get out soon
