Has anyone ever felt like something just wasn’t quite the way it should be? I don’t mean like a relationship not working out the way you hoped or your sandwich being made wrong at the deli. I mean like you wake up one day and have this sinking feeling that the furniture in your room isn’t arranged in quite the way you remember it every day before. While nothing quite that extreme has ever happened directly to me, I did discover something strange over this year that gives me that uneasy feeling.

I (39f) grew up in the 90s, was big into alternative rock and grunge (bands like Garbage, Tool, Third Eye Blind), and was an outcast with a goth-grunge style. In high school (early 2000s) I discovered a song by Poe that became a favorite and one of my top replay tracks on a burned CD made on my dad’s computer. My husband (31m) and I are mental health professionals, karaoke enthusiasts, and parents to 3 kids (his daughter (8f), my daughter (15f), and my son (18m) that help make up our blended family.

My husband is wonderful at connecting with my kids. My daughter appreciates his openness and uplifting personality, enjoy rides to school together and jamming out to her favorite songs. My son connects with him in a different but still meaningful way. They enjoy long discussions about various arts, movies, pop culture references, etc. These two could literally talk for 2 hours straight, with me usually having to end conversations so we get to eating dinner or whatever. Sometime last year, my son got my husband interested in a book he had collected called House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski.

I showed my son the song by Poe from high school that I had recently rediscovered. That’s when he made me aware that the author of House of Leaves is Poe’s brother. The song is Hey Pretty (2001 Remix), at least that’s what I thought. But as I was listening to it, singing along as I had done so many times before, it came to a part of the song where more lyrics were pouring out of my memory than were being sung in this version that was playing. It caught me off guard, because I knew there was a quite large portion of missing lyrics. So, I immediately started searching the internet for the version I was remembering, but I couldn’t find it, the lyrics, or anything referencing this version in my memory.

Time passed, the inability to find these missing lyrics lingered in my subconscious, but I moved on. There are bills to pay, mouths to feed, and life to be lived. Then, last week, my husband, who has been reading House of Leaves for himself, came across what he thought might be what I was looking for. It was clear that these are the lyrics from the Poe song, but are the missing lyrics I’ve been searching for included in this book as well? As he started to read the words from page 88, I felt compelled to recite the lyrics from memory, cutting him off in the process. I then came to a point where the words did not match, and he continued reading until my memory was triggered again. Each time this happened, I felt the growing sense that what I’ve been searching for is coming. It came to the part where I knew there were missing lyrics, and as I recited from memory, the lyrics that exist in my brain were right there on the paper. I was able to finish out the verse just as I had remembered. Having read the words in black and white, confirming their existence, I felt validated and relieved.

But something still felt off. Why can I not find this recorded version? Why can I not find these specific song lyrics referenced anywhere? Why can I not find anyone talking about the memory of those lyrics? And more eerily, why has every post I’ve attempted to make regarding this topic been removed or just disappeared?

Guys, I don't know what's going on. Please help me make sense of this. I feel like I'm going crazy!



  


Edit:

Someone asked about the title. Those are lyrics from the last line of the last verse in the song. Lyrics below, with missing lyrics included.

Hey Pretty (2001 Remix) by Poe

verse 1:  
Kyrie suggested we go for drive in her new 2-door BMW coupe. In the parking lot, we slipped into her bucket seats. Kyrie took over from there. At nearly 90 miles per hour she zipped us up to that windy edge known to some as Mulholland, a sinuous road running the ridge of the Santa Monica Mountains, where she then proceeded to pump her vehicle in and out of turns. Sometimes dropping down to 50 miles per hour, only to immediately gun it back up to 90 again. Fast. Slow. Fast. Fast. Slow. Sometimes a wide turn, sometimes a quick one. She preferred the tighter ones, the sharp, controlled jerks swinging left to right, before driving back to the right, only so she could do it all over again. Until after enough speed and enough wind, and more distance than I'd been prepared to expect, taking me to parts of the city I rarely think of, and never visit, I heard her say,

chorus:  
Hey pretty, don't you wanna take a ride with me  
Through my world?  
Hey pretty, don't you wanna kick a slide  
Through my world?  
(Do you get the gist of the song now?)

verse 2:  
I can't remember the innane things I started babbling about then. I know it didn't really matter, she wasn't listening. She just yanked up on the emergency brake, dropped her seat back, and told me to lie on top of her. On top of those leather pants of hers, \[missing lyrics 1\], her hands immediately guiding mine over those soft, slightly-oily folds, positioning my fingers on a shiny, metal tab, small and round, like a tear. Then murmuring a murmur so inaudible that even though I could feel her lips tremble against my ear, she seemed far, far away. "Pinch it," she said, which I did lightly until she also said, "Pull it," which I also did, gently parting the teeth, one at a time, down under and beneath, the longest unzipping of my life.

chorus:  
Hey pretty, don't you wanna take a ride with me  
Through my world?  
Hey pretty, don't you wanna kick and slide  
Through my world?  
Hey pretty, my pretty baby  
Rock it through my world  
Hey pretty, my pretty baby

verse 3:  
We never even kissed or looked into each other's eyes, our lips just trespassed on those inner labryinths hidden deep within our ears, filled them with the private music of wicked words, hers in many languages, mine in the off-color of my only tongue. \[missing lyrics 2\] Too bad dark languages rarely survive.

chorus:  
Hey pretty, my pretty baby  
My pretty baby  
Don't you wanna take a ride with me?  
Don't you wanna take a ride with me?  
(My baby)  
Don't you wanna take a ride with me?  
(My baby)  
My pretty baby (Don't you wanna)  
Rock it through my world  
Don't you wanna take a ride with me?  
My baby (Don't you wanna)  
My baby (Don't you wanna take a ride with me?)  
Do you get the gist of the song now?  
Don't you wanna take a ride with me?  
Do you get the gist of the song now?

Now, aside from the chorus which comes from Poe's original song Hey Pretty released in year 2000, these lyrics in the verses come from the book House of Leaves. The words above are word for word from the book besides a few tiny tweaks or cuts made to adapt from the book to the song. They are miniscule changes. The version I remember, however, had a few other lyrics that I remember clearly, and they are in the book, but are in no version of the song that I can find. There are two areas I found with the lyrics cut out. The first is small, but the second is a large chunk of words missing. See below.

missing lyrics 1:  
"extremely expensive leather pants mind you"

missing lyrics 2:  
"until as our tones shifted, and our consonants spun and squealed, rattled faster, hesitated, raced harder, syllables soon melting with groans, or moans finding purchase in new words, or old words, or made up words until we gathered up our heat and refused to release it, enjoy too much the dark language we had suddenly stumbled upon, craved to, carved to, not a communication really, but a channeling of our rumored desires, hers for all I know gone to black forests and wolves, mine banging back to a familiar form, that great revenant mystery I still can only hear the shape of, which in spite of our separate lusts and individual cries still continued to drive us deeper into stranger tones, our mutual desire to keep gripping the burn fueled by sound, hers screeching, mine - I didn't hear mine - only hers, probably counterpointing mine, a high pitched cry, then a whisper dropping unexpectedly to practically a bark, a grunt, whatever, no sense anymore, and suddenly no curves either, just the straight away."

Well, those are the missing lyrics that seemingly vanished from any song version I can find. But what's more eerie is that this version in my memory portrays a sense of increased urgency or anxiety when it gets to that part of the song. So now, these lyrics being gone just makes the memory of that version that much stranger.
