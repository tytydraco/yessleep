Has anyone ever felt like something just wasn’t quite the way it should be? I don’t mean like a relationship not working out the way you hoped or your sandwich being made wrong at the deli. I mean like you wake up one day and have this sinking feeling that the furniture in your room isn’t arranged in quite the way you remember it every day before. While nothing quite that extreme has ever happened directly to me, I did discover something strange over this year that gives me that uneasy feeling.

I (39f) grew up in the 90s, was big into alternative rock and grunge (bands like Garbage, Tool, Third Eye Blind), and was an outcast with a goth-grunge style. In high school (early 2000s) I discovered a song by Poe that became a favorite and one of my top replay tracks on a burned CD made on my dad’s computer. My husband (31m) and I are mental health professionals, karaoke enthusiasts, and parents to 3 kids (his daughter (8f), my daughter (15f), and my son (18m) that help make up our blended family.

My husband is wonderful at connecting with my kids. My daughter appreciates his openness and uplifting personality, enjoy rides to school together and jamming out to her favorite songs. My son connects with him in a different but still meaningful way. They enjoy long discussions about various arts, movies, pop culture references, etc. These two could literally talk for 2 hours straight, with me usually having to end conversations so we get to eating dinner or whatever. Sometime last year, my son got my husband interested in a book he had collected called House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski.

I showed my son the song by Poe from high school that I had recently rediscovered. That’s when he made me aware that the author of House of Leaves is Poe’s brother. The song is Hey Pretty (2001 Remix), at least that’s what I thought. But as I was listening to it, singing along as I had done so many times before, it came to a part of the song where more lyrics were pouring out of my memory than were being sung in this version that was playing. It caught me off guard, because I knew there was a quite large portion of missing lyrics. So, I immediately started searching the internet for the version I was remembering, but I couldn’t find it, the lyrics, or anything referencing this version in my memory.

Time passed, the inability to find these missing lyrics lingered in my subconscious, but I moved on. There are bills to pay, mouths to feed, and life to be lived. Then, last week, my husband, who has been reading House of Leaves for himself, came across what he thought might be what I was looking for. It was clear that these are the lyrics from the Poe song, but are the missing lyrics I’ve been searching for included in this book as well? As he started to read the words from page 88, I felt compelled to recite the lyrics from memory, cutting him off in the process. I then came to a point where the words did not match, and he continued reading until my memory was triggered again. Each time this happened, I felt the growing sense that what I’ve been searching for is coming. It came to the part where I knew there were missing lyrics, and as I recited from memory, the lyrics that exist in my brain were right there on the paper. I was able to finish out the verse just as I had remembered. Having read the words in black and white, confirming their existence, I felt validated and relieved.

But something still felt off. Why can I not find this recorded version? Why can I not find these specific song lyrics referenced anywhere? Why can I not find anyone talking about the memory of those lyrics? And more eerily, why has every post I’ve attempted to make regarding this topic been removed or just disappeared?

Guys, I don't know what's going on. Please help me make sense of this. I feel like I'm going crazy!
