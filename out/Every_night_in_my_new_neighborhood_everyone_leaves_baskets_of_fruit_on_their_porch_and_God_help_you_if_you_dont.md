When you look for a place to live, you take a few things into consideration: cost of living, mortgage costs, price of utilities, all that jazz, right? *Most of the time*, you might not exactly take too much in mind when it comes to shit like the people or folklore in the neighborhood, would you? At least, not when you're me, a 25-year-old scrub who's just looking for a way out of his first apartment that won't force him to smash his piggy bank, right?

So yeah, okay, I'd been on a search for places to move into for at least the better part of oh, two, three weeks, and so far, thanks to today's economy tap-dancing around its grave along with the rest of society, I guess it's no *real* surprise that every house there looked like the realtor must've had a stroke right after his finger hit the "0" key. That is, when it came to places here in town. Eventually, I had the bright idea to look *outside* my town, specifically to an area in the mountains in Terrace County called Grenview Pines.

Now let me tell you that when I first saw the place, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I mean, when you think of dream vacations, you'd think of scenic areas that looked like you'd be able to just ride along through and feel as though you were *actually* there just from looking at it for too long, you know? Somewhere where you wouldn't want to leave, right? Well, my friend, in that regard, look no further than Grenview Pines. I swear, I actually had to take a moment to make sure the pictures I was seeing of the place weren't just a bunch of stock images ripped from some jackass's background wallpaper.

Now obviously, my first reaction was, "Yeah sure, it's pretty and all, but what're the prices gonna be like? Can't be affordable, can it?" Well, my friend, in that regard, let me once more say look no further than Grenview Pines. The first house I saw on the market, $3600 with only a $750 down payment. I couldn't believe my eyes, seriously. This is what you'd call a "Dream house".

Going back briefly to what I was saying earlier about trying to get the hell out of my cramped ass apartment as quickly as I could, understand that I really was desperate to get out, given that rent on it was coming due and my shit-heel ex-roommate decided to flake on me to move back in with his parents *without* having the common courtesy of at least leaving me his half of the rent for the coming month. While I wasn't broke (yet), I wouldn't have had the money to pay it up on time and I sure as hell wasn't about to incur a late fee (You have *no* idea how much extra is added onto the already blown-out-the-ass price). So you see now why I might have been a little more eager than perhaps I should've been to immediately dive into this head-first, no questions asked?

So I called the number for the realtor's office and two days later, I was on my way up into the mountains. I can't express enough just how amazing Grenview Pines looked driving up the mountain range. The pictures were accurate, sure enough, yet at the same time were nowhere near able to show off the beauty of the place. Think of every picture you've seen where your friends are chilling up in the mountains and you see them commenting about how beautiful the scenery is. Now I want you to imagine yourself in a place that would put those pictures to shame. That was Grenview.

The colors were bright, alive, and all-around welcoming. The sun shown over the peak of the mountain range with a smile on its face that may well have said "Welcome to Grenview Pines", cheesy as that sounds. It was true, though. I was driving through a dream spot, and I was going to be able to call it home!

I ended up actually arriving at the spot of the new neighborhood ten minutes later than I was supposed to simply because I couldn't help but to go and slowly drive through a few of the different trails. When I arrived in the neighborhood, I found that it was a slightly more secluded one, choked off all around by the trees, with only about two or three houses on either side of the road. A quiet neighborhood, I figured. Perfect. No loud ass roommates or next door neighbors keeping me up at 2 and 3:00 in the morning.

Well... I'll say right now *that* was a damn lie...

Anyway, I pulled up to the house I was moving into and again, for the criminally low price I was supposed to pay for it, I was pleasantly surprised at the small, yet welcoming looking house I was set to move into. The realtor was standing there on the porch waiting for me. The two of us got to take a tour of the house where I was shown and told all of where the appliances and circuit breakers were, as well as where the cellar was.

Admittedly, the place needed a bit of work on the inside compared to the outside, but that was more than fine with me. The conversation itself between me and the realtor was unremarkable, though at one point I had asked if the neighborhood had any sort of reputation and/or if the residents were fans of new arrivals. I was told that, for the most part, the people in the area had always been rather friendly and welcoming to new arrivals.

Afterwards, the two of us left and scheduled a second meetup to finalize the purchase of the house for the next week. That week came and went, spent mostly with me packing up everything I could take with me and/or selling what I wasn't going to be able to, and I was soon the proud owner of 1568 Clearwater drive, Grenview Pines, N.C. That first night, I remember I didn't even bother much with any shit like unpacking boxes the first night I spent in the new house, save for a few things and the stuff I'd picked up from the grocery store on the way. No, that night was spent just out on the road, enjoying the scenery some more. I really just couldn't get enough.

I actually stayed out until it got dark, so much so that even the high beams on my SUV *barely* lit up the path in front of me. I couldn't have imagined trying to *walk* through this place at night. I soon returned to the house, where I scarfed down a quick HungryMan steak and mashed potatoes dinner before crashing for the night. When I woke up the next morning, I was getting up for the bathroom when I heard a knock on my door. A bit confused -- only ever being used to invited visits back at the apartment -- I went and looked through the peephole to see a middle aged couple standing at the door with a fruit basket.

*Huh... weird...*

"H-Hello?" I greeted, opening the door.

"Well hey there, newbie!" the man exclaimed with a sort of mid-western accent.

His wife, also mid-western and hyper enthusiastic, chimed in, "We just wanted to come by and say congratulations on the move in. You're gonna love it here. Such a beaut, Grenview Pines, ain't it?"

"Uh... Sure..." I replied awkwardly.

"Well we just wanted to stop by and give ya a warm welcome, neighbor." She held up the fruit basket. "Oh and ya don't wanna forget this." I smiled and chuckled.

"Oh, uh... Thank you, I uh, well, guess I *should* have something on my stomach before I--" I stopped, seeing the worried looks growing rapidly on their faces. "What?"

"You don't eat those, there, pal." said the man.

"Oh uh... 'Kay, then what *do* you do with 'em?"

"You leave 'em out on your front porch, here, see?" The wife pointed to the small side table on my porch."

"Oh, so they're decorative?" I asked, still confused as to why the hell they were so worked up over THAT.

"Sorta like that, yeah." the man said, chuckling nervously. I chuckled just as nervously while setting the basket down on the table. We exchanged brief goodbyes after that and I went back inside to cook a proper breakfast -- sorta -- bacon and pancakes that've been *drowned* in whipped cream and chocolate syrup (so much for "eating healthy"...). After breakfast, I decided to go a little further into Terrace County, both to get to know and feel the area a bit more, and as an excuse to get myself lost in the scenery again. I spent most of the afternoon with this.

Terrace County itself is a pretty small enough little area so it wasn't long, maybe two and a half hours tops, before I had seen everything in the town. Now, Grenview Pines on the other hand, THAT was where the majority of time was spent after I'd grabbed lunch at one of the diners. Oddly, as beautiful as the mountain and its trails are, I was surprised when I noted the distinct lack of other patrons walking the trail. I mean, small town, sure, but still, I would've thought there'd be more people, at least tourist wise, you know?

Well anyway, 4:30, 5:00, I headed back home where the fruit basket was still sitting on the side table on the porch. *I wonder...*

I took one of the grape stalks that stuck out from the right side of the basket. They looked, felt, and smelled real. The next thing to try was crushing one of them, which I did, and sure enough, it was a real grape alright. So, okay, then why in the hell were those two yahoos were so skittish?

Getting kind of hungry, I decided to help myself to the rest of the grapes on that vine and an apple while I went inside to start making my actual supper. I had just put my three neat and cheese tater tot casserole into the oven when I started hearing something pounding outside. It was light, faint, and I almost didn't even notice it at all. When I started listening further however, I noticed that there were not only sounds of thumping like from hooves, but there were more than one of them. About ten or more by the sound of it, in fact.

I ignored it at first. Then more and more came in quick succession. I went to the window then to see what was making the noise, and instantly had to shield my eyes. All I could catch in the split-second my eyes were open was a bright wall of ivory light that I swear was two seconds from turning my eyeballs into molten slag right in their sockets. The hoof beats were deafening too. My heart actually skipped two or three beats and my ears rang like crazy for hours following.

This is where things first started to get a little weird because, while I was pretty sure it only lasted about half a minute to a minute and a half, tops, I came out of my little hysteria to find that almost *20* minutes had passed and the kitchen was full of smoke, with the smoke detector screaming bloody murder in my ears. I got up and went back to the window to open it while also turning on all the fans. When I opened the windows, everything outside was as quiet and calm as it could be.

If I wasn't busy hacking up my lungs and frustratingly throwing the charred carcass of my casserole out the fuckin' window, I'd have probably spent the next few hours wondering just what the hell *that* was and how the hell 20 minutes just skipped like that. As it was, I ended up just throwing a sandwich together and calling it quits there. Stranger still was the fact that, despite being perfectly wide awake earlier, and making just a regular sandwich, I ended up feeling extremely drowsy right after the fifth bite of my sandwich. It was like each bite put me further and further to sleep.

Finally, I did pass out on my couch and I was out colder than if I'd been hit over the head with a baseball bat. Not only that though, but I seemed to be almost lucidly dreaming, if that makes any sense at all. To explain, you know how sometimes when you're asleep, and you may not realize you're asleep, you'll be in a dream so vivid that, no matter how bizarre it appears, you'd swear it was real? A sort of dream where you can actually feel, hear, and maybe even smell everything around you and/or anything that happens to you. If you've ever had something like that happen, you'll know what I'm talking about here.

In my case, I was in a dream where I was surrounded all around by walls of white. No landforms, no land to speak of, actually, no windows or anything. Just an empty white space that looked to stretch until the end of time. I remember feeling absolutely numb when I was like this as well, having lost all senses of touch, or at least to anything I tried touching -- that is to say nothing at all. But I had that weird sort of tingly feeling you get when your hand or foot falls asleep all throughout my body.

All around me, the walls glimmered with this radiant sort of tinkling. Imagine the Ivory city from *"The Neverending Story 2"*, but without any of the actual city and just the glimmering walls from the structures. That's the best sort of comparison I've got for it.

It was when I started hearing the hoof beats again that my heart pounded furiously. They echoed from all around me. I swung my head in every direction, but I couldn't see a damn thing.

I heard what sounded like a combination of wolve howling as well as horses whinnying joining this. Closer, closer, closer.

**BOOM, BOOM, BOOM**

Growls and whines from horses and wolves came right on top of me. The glimmering light got brighter and brighter. I was forced to shield my eyes like I did back in the kitchen. Somehow the sounds kept coming even closer still.

**BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM**

I heard one last chorus of the horse-wolf hybrid noises before a deep, yet soft and gentle voice told me "Don't open your eyes, or you'll never see again." When he spoke, I noticed that the sounds had stopped again. Before I could even get the breath to begin asking who the hell that was talking, I heard what sounded like a knife being pulled from a slot on a chopping block. My body seized up hearing this.

"This will be painful." he said in a voice as gentle as a yogi. "Do not open your eyes. Endure, and you'll wake up just fine." My mouth must've been hanging open in place of my eyes because the next thing I knew, I heard him tell me, "Do not speak, else we may remove your tongue as well. Endure, and you'll wake up just fine, child."

For the record, had he not told me that, I wouldn't have *spoken*, per say, probably just would've screamed. Regardless, preferring to keep both my tongue and my eyes right where they were, I did exactly as I was told. "And lastly, child, do not move, no matter how much you may feel so inclined, else your limbs will be stripped from you."

That forced my body to seize up even harder, almost locking up entirely. "Are you ready to receive penance?"

*Penance?!*

In another instant, a cold swipe from something thin and sharp was swept across my chest. It was quick, but like how you may not notice at first when you cut your hand on something, usually out of adrenaline (like it was with me), or because you just weren't paying attention, it wasn't until a few seconds later that the searing pain started kicking in.  Then another swipe came across my right cheek, this one immediately triggering the pain. Then another. And another.

One right after the other, from my chest to my arms and legs, all across my face, and eventually to my *groin*! Obviously, that was when I couldn't take it anymore and I had to scream. For an instant after doing so, everything went completely still, with an icy chill hitting my face. Suddenly, something started burning at the root of my tongue. It was slow, too, intimate and searing.

Imagine having a tooth pulled out *without* anesthetics, and now imagine that it's *not* a tooth, but your fucking tongue, and imagine that whoever's doing it is in no real hurry to pull it out, instead taking their time so you feel every second of the misery. I can't say exactly how long this was going on for. Trust me, when you're in that much pain, you tend to lose track of shit like time. Finally, though, I did feel something of a *pop*, and a flood of blood filling my mouth.

Before I could react in any manner, the voice spoke again, "You had not heeded our warning, and now you may not speak again. Yet, you may now as well never again taste forbidden fruit. You may now go, and speak no more, child. May this be a lesson to you." Then everything went black.

When everything came back, I sat up and found myself in my kitchen again. The sun was shining through the window. I swung my head in every direction, feeling everything in sight just so I could make sure I wasn't still asleep. Getting back to my feet, I looked at my phone which was left on the counter when I was making supper to find that it was 3 in the afternoon -- *three days later!*

I was about to shout "What the fuck?!" when I got hit with another nasty surprise. My mouth felt empty. A hollow hole. I tried to make pronounced sounds and realized; *my fucking tongue was gone!*

Panic rolled right through me like a 150-mph express train. I spent the next minute and a half clawing like a lunatic at the inside of my mouth only to realize that it was worthless. It was gone. I couldn't talk, taste, or *anything!* 

*Oh God, what the fuck happened?! WHY IS MY TONGUE MISSING?!* I looked out the window to see the fruit basket gone. *What the? Where did the fruit basket g--*

It hit me then. 

*"... You had not heeded our warning, and now you may not speak again. Yet, you may now as well never again taste forbidden fruit..."*

That made me immediately think back to meeting with the neighbors that morning. They'd told me that the fruit wasn't for me to eat. They said it was "decorative" ("so to speak") ... 

Naturally, I wanted to ask them what the hell that was, who the voice was and just what the fruit really was to them. Unfortunately, without my tongue, I couldn't easily do that, not directly anyways. It wasn't until the end of that next day that they actually visited my house again, brining yet another fruit basket. I remember opening the door, my face probably looking like I'd seen a ghost (well, more like seen *and felt*). 

"Well good mornin', neighbor!" the man cheered just like he did last time. "We saw that ya hadn't put out your offerin' basket for tonight, so we wanted to stop on by an' make sure you were set." I looked down at the basket.

"Oheerrrihh hhaaahheeh?" I attempted, sounding every bit the dummy I was now. They cocked their eyebrows at me. I opened my mouth to try and cry out, plead, something, but all I could manage was a pathetic moaning sort of sound. 

"You okay there, darlin'?" asked the wife. I continued feebly trying to talk. Finally, I opened my mouth and gestured for them to look inside, wherein their eyes bugged in absolute terror. "Oh my God, what happened?"

"You had your offerin' basket out last night, right?" I nodded. "You don't think an animal might've gotten it, do you?" I shook my head and picked up one of the fruits from the new basket and pretended to eat it. Both of them grimaced before the man exclaimed, "Damn it all, we told ya those *weren't* for eatin'. Oh Lord, son..."

"Whaaah who ah who?" I plead incoherently. Fortunately, enough, probably this not being their first rodeo as evidenced by the fact they *immediately* knew it had something to do with the damn fruit basket, they were able to understand me enough when I tried speaking from that point on. That said, from what they told me, there was no way to actually reverse what'd been done to me. 

When I asked them the best I could about just who the hell it was that took my tongue and the fruit basket in the first place, the man told me, "Grenview Pines is a beautiful place, no doubts about that, but an old and mysterious place with old and mysterious things that've walked this mountain for thousands of years or more. Of these is one we like ta call the 'Passing hunter'."

He went on to explain to me that the "Passing Hunter" was an old sort of Celtic based entity that was known once for butchering anyone that would be stupid enough to dare cross any of the trails here on the mountain. That was, until one day, one bold S.O.B. managed to actually strike a deal with the guy in exchange for freedom of safe travel and lodging on the mountain; that every night, each resident (at least of this neighborhood -- why this in particular, I couldn't tell you) would provide a fruit basket for him as apparently, he was fond of fresh fruit but couldn't pick it his damn self. 

The couple left after that, and it was getting to be dark again. That was just a week ago and since then, I haven't missed a single night of setting a fruit basket out. God knows I never will again after that night, whether I manage to stay here or find another place to stay, not that it really makes much difference anymore. In that time, I've been trying everything I can to search for any information online I can find about the "Passing Hunter", but just as my lick would have it, there's absolutely fucking nothing. Obviously, this is part of why I'm writing this here -- this and the fact that I literally can't tell anyone in person. 

I need help. I need answers. Other than a "Mysterious God" or whatever that stalks this neighborhood in Grenview Pines, who or what the hell is the "Passing Hunter"? 

Whoever he is, one thing I know is for certain, never, EVER, go one night without leaving a full, untouched fruit basket out for him if you live in Grenview Pines. If you do, I don't think even God himself could actually help you.
