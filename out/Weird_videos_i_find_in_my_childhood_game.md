I was playing super mario 64 in a N64 Simulator, i download the ROM from and External links, what i surprised with is when i play and fall in the castel river the game leads me to a " Boting Menu " in this menu they told me to "choose a mirror " they chosed me betwen " Asian and Europe and Other Conteries" i chosed Europe and tge game started normally but in the background of the game intro it shows someone get burned and try to help himself from getting burned. I didn't record any of these its so scary but i will upload it in YouTube if this was took some people interest.


Back to another time when i tryed to re-open the game i tried to do this again and its still working, i asked my self, is this a kind of videos trafficking or something like that? Is someone could do this as a prank? Then why its uploaded in this website, even what its aprank why he didn't give it to hus friend and prank him instead of publishing it. It couldn't be a PRANK as my friends says. This letterly tooks my thinkings and i loved share my story and try to get some kind of explainations.


In this morning i tried to ask people in 4chan and i got no explanation, the only answer that i got is " its a video trafficking", i asked some people in Facebook groups and thier answers was " Its only a prank" or "Some one leaking a private tapes". 


Add to your infos that the video has no sound, and its totally muted, i tried to hear it with speakers and i got no results of sound related to what i see. 


The video contains in general someone who is leaded like a dog and get burned, trying to help himself by rolling in tge sand, the time its looks like at night and the place looks like a forest with a bit of grass and stuff like that. 
I shkwed this to my big brother and he said that this is weird and cannot be someone who make it as a prank, he said also that it maybe a kind of " Leaking premium graffic content". I letterly dont have any clue for this thing its terrible. 


After a while i re-opened the game to see if its still do the same error and its working again, this time i chosed another " Mirror " that named " Asian" it played a video of arabic people riding a horse in a slow motion, then a low quality video of someone try to handle a bow or something, i restart the game and chose another mirror but this time it shows a picture of a pharmacy and random buildings pops up. 


Next, i get an idea to open the ROM files and discover if there is another picture or media, i get surprised when i didnt find any picture even the past pictures and videos that shows in the " Booting Menu" only thing i find is the normal game sprites.
