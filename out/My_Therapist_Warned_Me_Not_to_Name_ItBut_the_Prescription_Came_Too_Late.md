There are things you don’t come back from.

The mind breaks quietly—like frost crawling over glass—never with a scream, always with a whisper. That’s how it began. One whisper turned into a presence. Then a shadow. Then a figure. A silhouette that haunted the periphery of my life like a virus that fed on perception. The more I acknowledged it, the more it bled into reality. I knew it. And I think—somewhere deep down—my therapist knew it too.

"In the past... um... twelve sessions, you repeatedly mentioned that you see a figure. Is there an improvement?" he asked, his voice flat, sterile, like a scalpel cutting into my soul.

His eyes didn’t meet mine. They never did. He always looked slightly off—like his gaze was fixed just behind me, on something I couldn’t see but felt, or more like something I didn't wish to see.

“No,” I whispered. “I still see the figure.”

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t even blink. “Is the said figure in the room right now?”

I turned my head slowly toward the corner, the one where the fluorescent light refused to shine. Shadows bled there like old bruises on reality. That’s where it stood—wrapped in impossibility, draped in a shape that disobeyed physics. No face. No voice. Just a void wearing the suggestion of a man.

I nodded.

He sighed—tired, almost defeated—and scribbled something down. Behind him, a painting on the wall caught my eye. Thirteen chairs in a circle. One marked black.

I don't think I'd ever noticed it before. Or maybe it had always been there, and I was too busy drowning in the icy depths of dread to notice.

He tore the slip free from his pad and handed it to me without looking. “Take this,” he said. “Don’t read it until you’re outside.”

The words didn’t sound clinical. They sounded like a prayer before a grave.

I stepped out into the hallway, the buzz of flickering lights pressing against my skull like static. When I opened the paper, expecting a prescription for sedatives or worse, my breath caught.

It wasn’t a prescription.

It was a confession.

“You are not crazy. I see it too.”

I dropped the paper. My hands were trembling. Not from fear, but from validation. Someone else knew. Someone else was drowning in the same reality-rip I was stuck in.

But when I turned to re-enter the office…

It was gone.

Not locked. Not closed.

Gone.

The hallway was rotted and crumbling, as if it had been abandoned for years. Peeling walls. Dust-choked air. I stumbled back. My therapist’s name—Dr. Glenn Marlowe—sounded like a curse in my head. I Googled it when I got home.

Deceased. August 7th, 2013. Car crash. No survivors.

That was twelve years ago.

That was today’s date.

That night, IT didn’t linger in the corners anymore. The figure stood at the edge of my bed, more real than ever before. Closer than breath. No longer hiding. No longer passive. Its shadow merged with mine. My body felt heavy. My chest was a coffin. Sleep didn’t come. Only static.

In the morning, I found new messages scratched into my mirror—letters forming slowly like condensation.

"The more you see me, the more I become."

Blood dripped from my nose. My eye burst a vessel. I laughed and cried and retched all at once.

That was when the phone rang.

A voice I didn’t recognize—broken, stuttering through static—said just four words.

“You need the Institute.”

Click.

The Orion Institute wasn’t on any public registry. Founded in 1954, long before its name was scrubbed from records, it was rumored to treat “cognitive mutations,” “psychogenic contagions,” and other phenomena that broke the laws of sanity.

I followed a decaying GPS signal through industrial districts and derelict train yards until I found a rusted iron door behind an abandoned warehouse. A handprint scanner long dead. But when I touched it, it suddenly flared up. I jumped back in horror expecting something to emerge from the darkness and drag me away.

After a while nothing happened. I pressed my hand on the scanner again and let it do its thing. 

Inside, the walls were lined with screaming. Not sounds.

Memories.

Echoes of others like me were carved into concrete and flickering lights. Broken people speaking truths their mouths had long since abandoned.

Something unseen guided me—a pull I couldn’t name. I tried to fight it. Failed. It led me down… sublevel after sublevel, deeper than reason, until I stood before Level 13. And then Room 13 found me.

There were thirteen chairs. Twelve occupied.

Each one faced a circle of mirrors, angled just slightly to reflect… nothing.

The thirteenth chair was empty.

When I stepped forward, every head turned toward me.

They were all identical.

They were all me.

"Hey," I said with a nervous chuckle. The strangeness in here was too profound.

One of them stood. The one with missing eyes and skin that shifted like liquid metal.

He pointed at me and said, “We dreamed it too loud.”

"Huh?" I murmured. Or rather, one of me did.

Another version of me whispered, “It wears our guilt. Our attention. It survives because we survive.”

I staggered back. “What the hell is it?”

They spoke in unison. A choir of grief. “It is what you made. What we all made. Every time we noticed it. Every time we feared it. Every time we said, 'I see it.' ”

The door behind me vanished. The mirrors cracked.

And the thirteenth chair screamed.

Not the person.

The chair itself.

It was a scream that pierced my bones and seeped into my being. It was a scream woven from every abandoned corner of the human psyche—anguish, torment, madness, all stitched into sound.

The mirrors began to bleed. The lights flickered into static symbols—runes carved into logic itself. The figure stepped from the mirror world—larger now. Infinite.

It opened a mouth that wasn’t there.

“Thank you… for believing.”

One of my other selves lunged, a broken shard of mirror in hand, and carved a sigil into their own chest. The room buckled. The figure hissed.

“Sit,” said the bleeding clone. “We bought you five minutes. Sit in the thirteenth chair. Lock it out. Lock yourself in.”

“Why me?”

“You’re the original,” he said, already crumbling into ash. “You saw it first. You fed it first. And now…”

“…you end it first.”

Now I sit in the thirteenth chair.

The straps are cold. The lights are dying. The other selves are gone.

The figure watches me through the cracked mirror, its form melting into something older than fear. A truth made flesh. The embodiment of our most intimate dread.

I don’t know if locking myself here will kill it.

I don’t know if it will kill me.

But in the mirror, just before it shatters entirely, I see a child. A boy. Alone. Sitting in therapy.

Looking scared.

Seeing the figure.

Again.

This time, he’s humming.

The same tune I hummed twelve years ago.

In the silence, I suddenly understood many ways a person can die but still be alive.

Many ways a heart can rot inside a breathing shell.

I clench my teeth. Whisper a prayer. A curse. A final hope for the boy sitting where I once sat.

When Death finds you, may it find you alive.

Not broken. Not emptied. Not already buried beneath your name.
