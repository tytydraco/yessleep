Not every prank is a good prank, especially when they go wrong. I'm posting this here because I know my roommate visits this subreddit. Jack, if I live through this I'll never again do another prank. I swear.

It was April first, my favorite day of the year. I'd spend months planning for and setting up for the next best prank, and each year was better than the year before. This year was no different. I began brainstorming as soon as the new year rang in and came up with the best idea ever: a false kidnapping. I know, it sounds so awesome!

I didn't have many friends, too many weak ass snowflakes that couldn't handle a simple joke. My only friend was my college roommate and even that was rocky. I just had to win him over with the coolest prank ever, once this was done we'd be the best of friends. Unless he turned out to be just another snowflake.

It took a few months to find somebody to do it. I sacrificed bonding time with my roommate to hours of online searching before I came across Unseelie Co. Their site proclaimed that they'll do any job you asked of them. “No questions asked, exactly what you ask for a small fee!” The banner screamed at me. I thought it was perfect, at the time.

My roommate left this morning for their class, and shortly after they left it was time to put my plan into action. Right on time the doorbell rang, and I went to answer the door. I thought I knew what was coming, but I had no idea at the time the hell I was about to go through. I know much better now, and I don't think I will see the sun rise again.

A bag went over my head, and I felt many hands grab hold of me. I put up a half assed fight to make it look real for the ring camera my roommate had installed. Then a thump on my head and I went limp so it would look like I had lost consciousness. This was gonna look so great when my roommate got home after lunch and saw it!

They carried me downstairs and threw me in the trunk. I wondered what destination they'd picked out to keep me in, but I lost track after an hour. Finally we got there, and they carried me inside with the blindfold still on. “Guys, it's okay. You can untie me now and take the bag off my head,” I said.

“You get what you paid for.” The voice that answered was musical in a way. Like it wasn't rhythmic but it sounded like a song was coming in the next breath. It's hard to describe really, and even though they're talking behind me now it's hard to put into words.

They shoved me in a chair and tied me in place before they removed the blindfold and I got my first good look around my new surroundings. There was dust and cobwebs, with a couple of old computers and cells. It took me a moment, but I eventually recognized it as the old holding cells before the local department got a new building and location.

“Do you use this place often? It seems wild to have the lights on for a single use,” I observed. A couple of them looked at me sharply before they started digging through my bag. “You don't have to tie me up guys, I am not gonna just run off before its done.”

“It's our experience that humans don't stick to their word, especially when it involves sitting through unpleasantries.” I figured this one was the leader of the group. He seemed the most aloof of the bunch, just reclined in a dusty desk chair as he stared out the window and waited.

There are four of them. The one I still think is in charge had long black hair on one half of his head and the other side was entirely bald, this one I'll call Cliff. Then there was the blonde with short spiked hair that went out of style in the nineties, who we'll call Spike. The long blonde hair we'll call Frost, and the short brown hair we can call Bramble.

You maybe wondering about these names, but I want to make it clear that I could not tell their gender and they wouldn't confide their names to me. At first I was confused but given all that's happen I can understand but like at least fake names would have been fine. They never asked for my name either, they just referred to me as Cryptid. Now that we've all been properly introduced, we can move on with what happened.

My phone rang and I looked over at the wall clock. Right on schedule my roommate had come home and seen the door left open, then watched the footage. Now he was calling to find out if I was okay. Spike answered the phone and put it on speaker.

“Shut up and listen,” they began. “We have Cryptid, and if you don't do as we ask we will hurt him. Understand?”

“What do you want from me? I'm a nobody,” Jack, my roommate, shrieked.

“Not much,” Frost said as they approached the phone, “we're just looking for some laughs.”

“Is this one of your stupid pranks?! I told you I don't want nothing to do with that shit!”

“I said shut up!” Spike said. “Now, all I want you to do, is to run down the dorm hall with nothing but shaving cream covering your personal bits and singing the song She'll be Coming around the Mountain.”

“If I don't? What are you going to do, keep the shithead roommate that doesn't respect boundaries? You'll be doing me a favor then,” Jack said. Rude! Like I'd been pretty nice, and only did little pranks on him. Like hiding his keys, or loosening the salt, or deleting his homework.

“If you don't have it posted for us to watch in one hour, we'll cut off one of Cryptid's fingers. If it's not posted in three hours, we'll remove his right ear. If it's not online within seven hours we'll slice open his stomach and leave him to die on the doorstep,” Cliff replied.

I wanted to suppress a laugh, but something about the way Cliff sounded as he described everything felt real. These guys were good actors, or so I thought.

“Yeah, right.” Jack said before he hung up. There was no post an hour later, and Cliff called him back on video.

“Watch what you've made us do,” they told Jack.

Confusion washed over me, as Bramble approached with a knife in his hand. “Yo, Dudes. I have a finger in my bag.. don't.. what?” I said as they brought it to my left pinky finger. (I am typing this on my phone which, thankfully, only needs my thumbs.)

Jack screamed about it being a stupid prank and hanged up. Cliff then pressed a few buttons. “Continue, it's recording. We'll send the video after.” I panicked and began to struggle. Then I screamed as the blade began to cut through the finger, it was sharp and didn't take long. They held it up to the camera and Cliff sent it off.

I got a very good look at Bramble while they cut my finger. I noticed their face was angled and their ears seemed slightly longer than they should be. It was the eyes that did me in, they were green but not like your normal green eyes. Their eyes looked like pieces of jade. I began to look around at the others, and noticed the same type of features. Frost had silver eyes, Cliff's eyes were like amethyst, and Spike had golden eyes.

“Hey, what the fuck?” I screamed. I'm still not sure what I was asking. Why they cut my finger off, what they are, but I got the answers when they showed me the contract I had signed.

“Exactly what you ask for a small fee,” Cliff recited to me.

That's when I saw it. I never specified the injuries I'd planned would be faked. I never specified any of this would be faked. They removed my ear about an hour ago. I have two more hours for my roommate to post the video before they take the last step. Jack hasn't read the messages, maybe he blocked me or turned his phone off. He doesn't know this is real, hell I didn't know it was real until they cut my finger off.

I've begged and pleaded and cried all to no avail. However, they did allow me my phone so I could post my account as a warning. They think it's good marketing, and have been looking over my shoulder periodically as I wrote this. Cliff likes their names and expressed they may use that for future interactions.

Jack, if you see this. PLEASE have the ambulance waiting when I get home. It's the only chance of survival I have. Don't waste time with the police, I don't think they'll do much good against Unseelie Co.
