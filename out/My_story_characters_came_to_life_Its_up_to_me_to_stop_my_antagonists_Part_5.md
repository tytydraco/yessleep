“I’m never staying in another Motel 6 for as long as I live,” Jake uttered, tenderly rubbing the back of his neck.

“Agreed,” Sidney said, plopping into the passenger seat beside me. 

“Guys, I just got a text from Cole. Here, I’ll let y’all read it for yourselves.”

*Hey, Matt. Thank you all so much for your help. My wife had a checkup this morning, and she’s completely cancer-free. The doctors had never seen anything like it. Oh, and Officer Jenkins says thank you too. His ex-wife contacted him. She wants to reconcile. Good luck on your journey, and if there’s anything I can do to repay you, please don’t hesitate to give me a call.*

“That’s awesome! I guess that means the curse is gone. Now that that’s taken care of, where are we off to next?” Sidney queried. 

“We’re going to Fayetteville. It’s only about an hour from here. I found Rachel on Facebook last night and explained everything. Her and Jeff are expecting us.”

“Matt, can we please please please go to a football game while we’re there? You know how much I love the Razorbacks! Pleaaaase.”

“Jake, you love any football team within a five hundred mile radius. We don’t have time for sports right now.”

Jake pouted and crossed his arms.

“If we kill the wendigo, I’ll take you to as many football games as your heart desires. But we have to find a way to kill this thing first. Deal?”

“Fine. Let’s just go already.”

After an hour’s drive of nothing but cornfields and a pit stop at Denny’s, we arrived at Jeff and Rachel’s house. We rolled down a street lined with pristine cookie-cutter townhouses. The perfect residence for a modern-day trust fund baby. We parked along the street in front of a cream-colored house. A dark red “Woo pig” sign was the only lawn decor distinguishing the otherwise indistinct townhome from all the others. I turned toward the house and noticed someone peeking at us from behind the drawn curtains. They quickly ducked out of sight.

“Alright, I just messaged Rachel and told her that we’re here. Let’s go.”

We all shuffled up the driveway, careful not to disturb the couple’s perfectly cut lawn. 

“Here we go, I guess,” I muttered as I rang the doorbell. 

The door gradually crept open. 

“Come in,” a woman called from somewhere inside the home. 

Jake and Sidney shot each other a nervous glance. I pursed my lips, leading the charge inside. The home was surprisingly well kept for a couple of college students. Rachel obviously had an eye for interior design. A brown leather couch rested before a wide flat screen television along with a matching set of end tables. A mahogany coffee table with a decorative centerpiece brought the whole room together. Little ornamental trinkets were scattered throughout to spruce up the place’s appearance. 

“Quick, close the door before someone sees you,” a girl whimpered from the next room.

“Okay, it’s closed. What’s the big deal? It’s not like there’s a mob with torches and pitchforks out there,” Jake said. 

Rachel emerged from her hiding spot in the kitchen. She looked like a train wreck. Deep purple bags weighed heavily beneath her eyes. Her platinum blonde hair was disheveled, and the roots were beginning to fade to a dark brown. Her deep blue eyes were emotionless, aside from trepidatious anxiety. My heart sunk upon seeing her. It was evident that she’d been beautiful before the incident, but the stress and lack of sleep had really done a number on her.

“You don’t understand,” she squeaked, “everyone thinks that *we* killed our friends. Not some freak snowstorm or Jeff’s uncle or that… thing. We can’t leave our house without being harassed.” 

“I-I’m sorry. I had no idea you two had received so much backlash for this. Something that’s not even your faults. By the way, where is Jeff? He did know we were coming, right?” I asked.

“Oh, he’s in his room trying to take a nap. He’s really not taking things well. I’ll go get him.”

“She really looks like shit. If Jeff’s taking it worse than she is, I can’t imagine what he must look like,” Jake whispered.

“Well, we’re about to find out. Now, shut up before she comes back and hears you,” Sidney hissed, jabbing Jake in the ribs.

He let out a wheeze as he clutched his side. We heard footsteps returning from the back of the home and Jake tried his best to mask his pained visage. 

Rachel trudged into the room, dragging Jeff behind her. He wasn't fairing much better than his girlfriend. His dark brown hair was a tangled rat's nest of greasy curls. It was clear that he hadn’t showered in a few days. His beard was overgrown and dark circles under his eyes begged for sleep. He wearily glanced up at us and waved awkwardly. 

“Hey guys. Thanks for coming. I’m Jeff.”

“Babe, they know who you are.”

He shot her a dirty look.

“Sorry, we never introduced ourselves. I’m Matt, that’s Jake, and this is Sidney.”

We made our rounds, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries. Rachel ran her hand through Sidney’s long brown hair.

“Girl, you are *stunning.* Which one of these lucky boys is yours?”

“Thank you! Um, well, neither of them are.”

Rachel scowled at Jake and me.

“They’re a couple of morons if they haven’t made a move on you. Of course, we can change that if you’d like,” she whispered, trying and failing to keep us out of earshot.

I blushed.

“Alright, alright, you two can have a slumber party and gossip about boys *after* we take care of the problem at hand,” Jeff scoffed. 

“Well, how *are* we going to take care of the problem, babe?” Rachel snapped. 

Jeff sighed.

“I haven't completely figured that part out. You all have impeccable timing, though. Uncle Wyatt actually invited me out to his cabin. We were going to leave later today. Some bullshit about ‘wanting to make amends.’ I’m not stupid. I know he just wants to finish the job…”

“What did you tell him? Are you going?” I asked.

“Yeah. I’m going to make that sorry piece of human filth pay for what he did to our friends. I just don’t know how I’m going to do it.”

“This might be able to help you out a bit.”

I flashed him my handgun. A smile began to inch its way across his face.

“Perfect. I knew you guys would be able to help us. We’d better rest up. It’s about a twelve hour drive to Uncle Wyatt’s cabin. We’re going to get there at night, so hopefully we’ll be able to catch him off guard. In the meantime, make yourselves at home.”

We lounged around the townhouse while Jeff and Rachel prepared themselves for the trip. Once everyone was ready, we piled into our vehicles, Rachel and Jeff taking the Toyota Tacoma, and we set off for Minnesota. The drive itself wasn’t noteworthy, though Jake slowed us down considerably after he ordered a Route 44 Dr. Pepper at Sonic and had to stop to use a restroom every twenty minutes. After what felt like days on the road, we finally pulled into the long driveway of Uncle Wyatt’s cabin.

We arrived around eleven at night, dreary eyed and aching from the prolonged drive. My headlights illuminated a smattering of dense trees, and once or twice, I could’ve sworn I spotted eyes following us high in the treeline. I tried to reassure myself, but apprehension began bubbling in my gut as we slowly approached the cabin. 

“Anyone else think it’s kind of unsettling being this far out in the woods?” Sidney wondered aloud.

“Yeah. It’s definitely a little-” 

*Pop.* 

Both of Jeff’s front tires blew as his truck skidded to a halt. My heart hammered as I parked the car behind them and hurried over to assess the damage. 

Jeff slipped out of the driver’s seat, unscathed. Rachel hopped down from the truck and joined him. 

“I knew he’d pull some crap like this! Look. Nails. He’s trying to make sure we can’t escape so he can feed us to that creature.”

We remained silent as Jeff seethed, attempting to calm himself down. 

“Okay, I know this looks bad, but we need a plan. Maybe he didn’t hear that, and we can still take him by surprise?”

“I don’t know,” I said, “the cabin is within eyesight and that was a pretty loud bang. I doubt he would’ve missed it.”

“You’re probably right,” Jeff muttered, rubbing his temples. 

He turned to Rachel. 

“Babe, can you get the ‘secret weapons’ out of the back please?”

“Sure.”

Rachel opened the back door of the truck and fished under the seat for something. She re-emerged with two sleek hunting rifles. 

“Well, that makes me feel slightly better,” Jake admitted. 

“Does everyone have a weapon? We need to be armed and ready when this thing decides to strike. Who knows how far away it is.”

Sidney meekly raised her kitchen knife. 

“You’re going to need something a little more lethal than that. Wait just a second. Jeff rifled through the back of his truck. He returned with a crossbow. 

“I think I can handle this,” Sidney said.

“Hey, why does she get this crossbow? That thing is badass,” Jake pouted, lazily swinging my bowie knife.

I glared at him.

“One, she had a kitchen knife, while you have something that might actually stand a chance at doing some damage. Two, you probably wouldn’t know how to use that thing anyway. And three, this is *not* the time to worry about who has the cooler weapon. Got it?”

“I guess,” he mumbled, staring at his feet.

We began to make our way toward the cabin, guided by the dim yellow light emanating from within.

“Alright, everyone stay close together. And watch out for nails. They’re all over the place, and the last thing we need is somebody coming down with tetanus,” Jeff said, huddling close to Rachel. 

We tentatively crept toward the cabin, careful not to impale our feet on the rusty nails littered along the forest floor. We were about thirty feet away from the door when it swung open. Before us stood a thin dirty man with a long scraggly gray beard. He sported camo overalls, and the Duck Dynasty hat atop his head told me everything I needed to know about him. He seemed excited to see us. Too excited. 

“Nephew! Good to see you again! And I see you brought some friends along. Perfect.”

“Uncle Wyatt, what do you want with us, you slimy piece of shit?!”

“Come on now, that’s no way to treat your old uncle, now, is it?” 

“You sick fuck. You left us out here to die and you expect me to welcome you with open arms? Fuck you,” Jeff fumed as he spat a fat glob of saliva into the dirt.

“It didn’t have to be like this, nephew. But if you want to do things the hard way, so be it. I think Bessie missed you anyway.” 

A wide manic grin stretched across his face as he said that. He put two fingers between his lips and a high-pitched whistle sliced through the cool night air. Suddenly, a pair of bright glowing eyes appeared, peeking at us from behind the roof of the cabin. My heart pounded against my ribcage.

It stepped into the faint ring of light that surrounded the cabin. I shuddered as a chill wormed its way through my core. The abomination stood at around ten feet tall. Ashen gray skin stretched tightly over its emaciated frame. Pointed claws sharp as razor blades protruded from each digit, primed to shred the skin from our bones. It beamed down at us, running its tongue over its sickening yellow teeth. It was hungry. And we were about to be its next meal. 

A cacophony of gunfire rang out, shattering the tense silence. Uncle Wyatt disappeared into the cabin as the beast unleashed a deafening roar. It ducked behind the cabin, allowing us a moment of repose.

“W-what is that thing?” Sidney stuttered.

She shook uncontrollably, white knuckling the crossbow.

“It’s a wendigo. Hopefully that will be enough to deter it. For now, at least,” Jeff said, voice quivering.

Out of nowhere, the monstrosity leapt atop the cabin’s roof, sending shingles plummeting to the ground below. We began firing our weapons once more. It cried out in agony. All the color drained from my face as it lunged at us, hurtling through the air at a nauseating speed. This was it. We were all going to die. I said a silent prayer that somehow we would end up okay.

“I wish Uncle Wyatt and the wendigo would kill each other and that Jeff and Rachel won’t be suspects!” Jake screamed, holding the monkey paw high above his head. 

I turned to him just in time to watch one of its fingers curl inward. Less than a second before the thing was about to crash directly into Jeff.

I blinked and we were all back at Jeff and Rachel’s house, crammed onto their couch. We all sat in awestruck silence. 

“I-I don’t know what you did back there, but thank you. That thing almost turned me into minced meat,” Jeff said, eyes still wide. 

“Y-yeah. Don’t mention it,” Jake murmured.

We continued to sit there, soaking in the reality of the situation until Sidney spoke. 

“So… does that mean it worked? Nothing bad is going to happen to us for using that thing?”

A look of worry overtook Jake’s countenance.

“Someone look it up. I have to know,” he muttered solemnly, staring holes into the floor.

“I found an article. Wyatt Vandevurst, the prime suspect of the murder of three University of Arkansas college students, presumed dead after fire consumes his Minnesota cabin,” I read aloud to the utter amazement of everyone in the room.

“So, maybe if I wish for something bad to happen to someone, it won’t have any negative consequences for anyone else,” Jake reasoned, his spirits lifted by my revelation. 

“Yeah, I guess so,” I shrugged, “you really saved us with your quick thinking. I’m proud of you big bro.”

“It’s just my genius showing. That, and your promise of unlimited football was a pretty big motivator,” he grinned smugly, clearly pleased with himself.

“Really? *Football* was what got the gears turning and not the fact that we were about to be ripped limb from limb by a ten-foot-tall killing machine?” Sidney chastised him.

“Maybe,” Jake mumbled, cheeks blossoming with color.

“So… it’s over. It’s really over. Baby, we’re free!” Rachel yelled, planting a wet kiss on Jeff’s lips. 

“I guess we are. Thank you all so much. I don’t know what we would’ve done without you.”

It warmed my heart to know that we’d help the pair escape certain death and that soon, everything would return to normal for them.

“I’m glad we were able to help,” Sidney said, “and Rachel, call me.”

“I’ve got you, girl. So, what’s next for y’all?” 

All heads turned to me.

“We’re going to be heading back home. We’ve got a time traveler to take care of.”
