As the title reads, I stayed in one of those trendy, all-over travel vlogs, hotel capsules during a business trip. 

It seemed like a good idea when I was booking it; save a few bucks, and spend the extra business allowance I was given on whatever I wanted. In hindsight, though, it was a terrible idea. 

It was so cramped, the mattress was awful(if you can call stainless steel a mattress lol), I asked for a top bunk but got given a bottom one, there was no soundproofing, and I got absolutely nosleep! 2/10. 

To be fair, I did book it off a pretty shady website that I found off a random ad in Facebookland. So I'm not sure what I really expected. But I definitely thought there'd be fewer bodies and more blankets. 

The body to blanket ratio was definitely off. The sheet to body ratio was alright, but when it's like 4 degrees Celsius, a sheet doesn't do much.... 

I definitely thought it would be warmer, but some people do sleep better in cooler temperatures, I suppose. It's not ALL about me. (Sometimes I like to pretend it is, don't we all?) 

Anyhow, yeah, 2/10. 

The neighbours were mostly quiet, except for some occasional grunting, crying, and scratching. The hosts were the loudest for sure. Always talking to themselves or whoever else was there. No clue. Once you're in those capsules, you gotta wait for them to let you out. So I wasn't really able to see who was talking. I could definitely hear it though, because, like I said, no soundproofing. 

They'd always start off with the date, they said the damn date like 8 times a day during my stay. And then a random name, my guess is other patrons of the capsules. Then they'd make a lot of noise, really weird noises. Sometimes, a buzzing like a saw or something would happen. I've never stayed in one of these before, and travel vlogs are always glamorized, so I just figured this was all normal. Not my business, I'm no expert. I'm just here to save money and sleep. 

I did not sleep. There was nosleep in there. None. How could you? Cold, dark, loud. 

I decided I wanted to leave before check out and started banging on my door. Everything went quiet, and the hosts started opening random capsules, so I knocked louder. They eventually opened the right door,( you'd think if you're running a business like this you'd be more efficient at this.) They appeared quite panicked, asking what I was doing, how I got here etc. 

Obviously, I'm thinking, wow, you guys really don't have your shit together at all. I reserved this capsule ages ago, and while I did let myself in, I assumed that's what you do and that you know I checked in,(like an air bnb) But, I cooperate and tell them my name and all that jazz. They go over their handy little list of guests and can't find me. I don't know why. Poor record keeping on their part, I'm guessing? They confer with each other for a minute, make a couple phone calls and then tell me to get the fuck out. Obviously, I did exactly that and went and checked in at a proper hotel, with a bed and bathroom. And finally got some freaking sleep. 

So, here's my review of Lemor Gue capsule hotel. 

Don't bother. 

You might get nosleep or worse, too much.
