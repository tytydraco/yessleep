It has been a few  weeks since the incident but that face has been burned into my mind. I saw the man's face pressed against my window every time I shut my eyes. I didn't stop watching horror movies after Crybaby Bridge. However, now every time I watch one an eerie feeling forms a pit in me and crawls up my neck raising the hairs on its way up. I became paranoid in the passing days.

I had a recurring nightmare that he went looking for my car. After he found it he would peer in and after he didn't find me there he would check the windows of my house. He would search every window on the bottom level until he finally found my bedroom. The nightmare would end with him pressing against the window slowly dragging his hanging tongue against it. I would wake up drenched in sweat and stare at the curtains until I was convinced he wasn’t out there. After the fifth restless night I nailed the curtains to the wall. My parents thought it was some artistic choice. I let them think that.

Andie and I didn't tell anyone about the man in the woods. This may seem stupid to anyone else but nobody would believe us anyway. Well they would believe Andie that something had happened but they'd assume it was me pulling some prank on her and think I was simply doing what I'd done many times before, dragging out a joke.

Andie and I pretended it never happened but I knew she couldn't stop thinking about it just like me. I could tell by her tired eyes and shortened nails. I wondered how she made them so straight when she bit them off.

Andie suddenly preferred to stay at my house when we had sleepovers. I think it's because we drove my car to her house that night. Whenever she stays over we both avoid sitting by the window. We say nothing about it.

This night lacked the usual tension that had plagued my hangouts with Andie. The solution came in the form of two 16-year-old girls, Alice and Maiah.

"I swear Connor has a crush on you M!" Alice's voice had a southern twang. She didn't grow up in the South but both her parents did. I just rolled my eyes. Alice was always wrong about these things. She is what most people would call delusional when it comes to teenage boys.

"Oh, yeah? What makes you say that? Did he let her borrow a pencil?" Andie wore a knowing look. Alice always said people had a crush on her when in reality they simply had manners or human decency. Although with the pieces of shit she dated it didn't surprise me.

Alice scoffed and glared at Andie. I guess she hit the nail on the head. Maiah looked bored since the discussion ended.

"Why don't we go to the kitchen and raid Lala's fridge?" I threw a hoodie at Maiah in retaliation for the nickname she gave me.

"We can go get food but knock that off, don’t be an asshole." I tried not to show how much the nickname actually bothered me.

"Fine, Delia, let's go." The emphasis she put on my name made me roll my eyes but I held my tongue.

After traveling the 20 feet or so to my kitchen I jumped onto the island opting to sit rather than help rob my own fridge. I wasn't hungry anyway.

As we talked and they ate I felt a familiar chill creep up my spine raising my hair on the way. It's how I felt when that man, at least what I thought was a man, looked at me. How I felt when he was at my window in my nightmares. I didn't dare turn around. It was in my head. It had to be. One look at Andie and I knew it wasn't.

I watched as Andie attempted to stay calm and opened the silverware drawer asking if we had any nectarines. I told her we did. I didn't know but I knew she was looking for an excuse to grab the knife without scaring our friends.

I knew the curtains covered all the windows but I didn't know if it was enough to conceal activity in the house. I heard a loud bang on the window and knew it didn't matter. Another bang came. And another. Alice and Maiah looked terrified. Maiah frantically searched her purse. She carried pepper spray but I doubt she knew how to use it.

We all huddled behind the kitchen island where you couldn't see from the living room. We sat there for about 5 minutes until he gave up. I assumed he just wasn't hitting the window hard enough to break it.

I began to convince myself it had gone away but then the front door knob began to rattle. Its attempts were odd, like it didn’t understand how it was supposed to open the door. Eventually it figured out how. It began to frantically try to turn the knob but luckily it was to no avail.

The thing gave up, perhaps realizing the door wasn’t going to open. Shortly after, I heard a scream from outside that made my blood run cold. It was almost human but there was something wrong with it. It was a strained sound. It was like the vocal cords from some animal had replaced his own but he still tried to produce human sounds with them. Alice and Maiah had begun to cry.

I felt guilty again. Had I accidentally dragged them into this now too?

After about 6 minutes it gave up at the door too. There was a window above the sink across from where we were sitting. I felt like throwing up as I saw a man's palm in the sliver of space where the curtains didn't cover. Then his wide eye peered in. He laughed the same as he had when I begged God to save me from him.

I couldn't cry, I couldn't scream, I couldn't even move. Fear had turned me to stone.

Andie closed the curtains with trembling hands and tears falling down her cheeks. She dropped the knife she was still holding as a series of loud bangs, each louder than the previous one, shook the pane in front of her. A symphony of screams rang out from all of us.

Andie snatched the knife and jumped back quickly sitting down, now shaking worse than before.

The banging caused by the man was terrifying but the sound of shattering glass amplified the feeling.

I still couldn’t bring myself to move even as I watched his fingers curl around the curtain and rip it to the side. His head was tilted oddly like it wasn’t fully attached to his neck. He looked at me as an inhumanly wide grin full of yellow teeth spread across his face. Andie, seemingly realizing I wasn’t going to move, turned back grabbing my arm and dragged me towards the living room.

The next thing I knew I tasted and smelled my own blood as my face hit the ground with a sickening crack. My nose throbbed and I couldn’t breath properly. Andie yelled for me but I barely heard it as my ears rang from the impact. How had I fallen?

I felt myself moving slowly. At first, I thought Andie had tried to drag me forward, but I was met with the grim realization that I was moving towards the kitchen, not away. I felt sharp nails dig into my skin and I began to cry out in pain. I felt searing pain where his yellowed claws stabbed me and I felt as blood ran down my leg from the crescents he was carving.

"Let me go! Let me go! Please!" My words were choked due to the mix of blood and snot in my throat. I wasn't sure if the presence of the snot was because of my broken nose or because of the sobbing.

I thought the most terrifying things this man could do were already happening but he proved me wrong as he spoke.

"Let me go! Let me go! Please!" He had parroted me. It was strangled and broke in places where I hadn't but it was my voice none the less. This awoke me from whatever drowsiness was left over from my fall and I began to kick at the things hand feverishly. I was lucky it had only grabbed one of my legs.

It paid my pitiful attempts no mind as it crawled onto the sink and began to crawl back out the window, taking me with it. The thing didn’t get the chance to escape entirely however as Andie stabbed it in the wrist and twisted the knife while she pressed as hard as she could. She did shot put for field so she could put an impressive amount of force behind it. I was upside down and the thing was almost fully out the window as she stabbed its wrist. I felt the thing pull and cry out in pain. I thought my ankle would come off right then but it didn't. However, the thing still tried to pull its arm away, only tightening its grip in the process. As it did, a ripping and snapping sound made bile rise in my throat. The thing screamed as it ran off.

Its hand was still digging into my skin. I fell hitting my head once more. I felt myself fading away from reality but not before a rotten smell filled my nose. It smelled like the goats my Aunt kept on her farm but mixed with a God awful stench that I couldn’t describe. The weirdest part about the scent was the oddly sweet aroma accompanying it, like a fruit. Like a nectarine.

The next time I awoke I was in a hospital bed. Andie told me that the thing didn't come back again that night. She also told me that the scent I smelled briefly before passing out was that of blood. I already knew the thing wasn’t human but the scent confirmed it. Perhaps it simply imitated one like it imitated my voice. I sit here in this hospital bed and wonder what I should do. How can I fight this thing that is hunting me if it isn't even human?

The police who took our statement assumed my friends and I were either drunk or high when we told them about everything that had happened.They believed that someone had broken in and attacked us but thought the rest of the details were exaggerated tales of drunk highschoolers.

As I sit here with Andie asleep on the chair next to me I am consumed by guilt and fear. If this thing is going to hunt me I need to have a plan for when it next shows up. I fear what tomorrow brings.
