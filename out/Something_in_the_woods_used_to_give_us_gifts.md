I was unpacking my boxes as I was moving into the freshman dorms last week when I found something I don’t remember putting in one of the boxes. It’s a small, hand-carved wooden bird, about the size of my palm. It doesn’t match the quality of anything you would buy, but it also looks too intricate for a child to have carved. I set it on my desk since I didn’t bring many decorations, and I thought it looked better than leaving the desk bare. 

Since then, I’ve been having strange dreams every single night. In the dreams, I’m walking in a forest and I come across a small cabin. The cabin looks abandoned, but not in complete disrepair, like the owners left last year and never returned. The whole place feels… unsettling. Each time I have this dream, I walk in different directions, looking at different parts of the cabin, but no matter where I go, I always end up looking at a window with the silhouette of a person looking back at me, though it’s too dark to see any details. And then I wake up. 

The strangest part is, I know that house. I saw it deep in the woods when I was a child. My mom always told me there was nothing back there, but my friend Caleb and I first found it when we were eight years old. We had been hanging out at his house after school and told his mom, Ms. Carolynn, that we were going to play in the woods behind our neighborhood. Ms. Carolynn told us that if we were leaving, we had to take Caleb’s four-year-old sister Sophie with us, as she had to leave for work and didn’t want Sophie to be left alone. Caleb told her he didn’t want to because he didn’t want to hang out with a baby, but he lost the argument, and ten minutes later, Caleb, Sophie, and I were marching through the woods, Caleb intentionally walking too fast for Sophie to keep up, me in the distance between them so as to make sure she didn’t get lost. 

About half an hour into our journey, I saw something catch the light that filtered through the trees. It was a small scrap of metal with a piece of blue fabric tied around it in a crude knot. It looked intentionally done. I wasn’t sure what it was, but I remember picking it up and putting it in my pocket. It was rare to find not yet rusted metal that far into the woods. No one went out there. My mom always warned us not to go past the edge of the woods behind our houses, but Ms. Carolynn was more relaxed about where we explored. I always thought she was cool.

We wandered for a while longer until the sun got low enough that it began to grow dark. I said we should turn back now since my mom had probably made dinner and was wondering where I was, but Caleb had stopped and was staring at something. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw the outline of something large through the trees. A house. Caleb looked at me, a mischievous look in his eyes, then dashed off towards it. 

“Race ya!” He shouted over his shoulder. 

“Caleb, wait!” I looked desperately between his quickly retreating form and Sophie, who had moved a rock on the ground and was pulling out an earthworm. I grabbed her less dirty hand and followed Caleb. After all, I was just as curious as he was. We had never gone quite this deep in the woods before, but I had never heard of anyone living back here. It was probably abandoned. Thoughts of a new secret hideout spurred me forward. 

We reached the house to find that it was actually an old trailer with faded beige paint and a broken window. The steps leading up to the front door looked nearly rotted and one step near the middle was missing. Overall, though, the place was intact. Caleb grinned at me. “Let’s go inside.” 

“Caleb, I… it’s getting dark.”

“What are you, scared?” He taunted.

I suddenly had a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. “No! It’s just that we don’t have a flashlight,” I lied. “Let’s come back tomorrow.” I reached down for Sophie’s hand, but found only air. I turned and couldn’t find her. “Sophie?” 

Caleb’s smile had dropped and was replaced by a look of worry. We split up, each working our way around one side of the trailer. We met in the back. Still no sign of Sophie. I remember how quiet everything suddenly seemed, like there was a circle around this place that not even the crickets wanted to enter. We rushed back around, shouting her name, to find her sitting on the front stairs, legs dangling through the gap left by the missing step. She was humming and looking at something in her hands. 

“Sophie! What’s wrong with you?” Caleb scolded. “Whatever, we gotta get home. Mom’s gonna be mad now that it’s so late.” 

As we were leaving, I realized what that feeling I had was. It was the feeling of being watched. And it didn’t come from the trees. It came from that trailer.

It was completely dark when I said a quick goodbye to Caleb and Sophie outside of their house, preparing myself for my mom’s anger at how late it was. In the light from their porch, I finally saw what Sophie had been holding. It was a cluster of sticks tied together with one lying perpendicular across the main bundle and two others poking out from the blue cloth wrapped around it. It was a handmade doll. 

I remember not sleeping much that night. The feeling of being watched wouldn’t leave me. It followed me everywhere I went, especially when we would go back in the woods and Sophie would show us the new small objects and sometimes notes that she said she had found when we weren’t watching her. I don’t remember what any of the notes said. We had told Sophie to stop messing with us, ignoring the quiet certainty that someone her age could not have written the notes she was finding. We didn’t want to believe. 

I had dreams back then, too. I don’t remember them well, but I think they were similar to the ones I am having now. That house… I can’t help but feel like it’s calling to me. Wanting me to come closer. Wanting me to come home. 

I haven’t told anyone about the bird yet. Can an object unlock memories? Is it cursed? That sounds stupid. Should I just get rid of it?
