Darren’s grandmother, Loretta, died alone in her upstairs bedroom. Heart failure, they said. She’d been dead for two days before the neighbor noticed her mailbox overflowing and the lights on at all hours. The police broke in and found her upstairs, eyes wide, face twisted in something that looked too intense to be fear. Both police and EMS rushed her body out of the house. 

Loretta lived in that house her whole life. Never married, never had kids of her own, until Darren. Darren was adopted, and she raised him after his parents died in a car crash when he was six. He used to talk about her in this half-affectionate, half-fearful tone. “Grandma Loretta’s got eyes in the walls,” he’d joke. She was a hoarder, a recluse, and deeply superstitious. Always warning Darren about things like “blood memories” and “dolls with souls.” He always just chalked it up to her old age and her mind slowly starting to go. 

The four of us met back in middle school. Darren, me, Jess, and Nolan. We weren’t the cool kids. We were the ones who read creepypastas out loud during sleepovers, explored old barns for fun, dared each other to play with Ouija boards. That kind of group. We stayed close through high school and even after. Same friend group, same dumb inside jokes, even when life started pulling us in different directions. We were a family. 

So when Darren asked for help clearing out Loretta’s house after the funeral, we all showed up without any hesitation. 

The place hadn’t changed in decades. It reeked of mothballs, old dust, and something sour beneath it all, like dried flowers and spoiled meat. We spent the first two days boxing up clothes, books, old photos, and dozens of porcelain figurines. Loretta had shelves of them in every room, most chipped, all creepy.

On the third day, Nolan stepped on a weak board in the attic.

That’s when we found the trunk.

When Nolan stepped through a loose floorboard, the wood caved in just enough to reveal the top of a trunk, iron clasps, leather peeling like burnt skin. Inside was one thing: a doll.

Wrapped in sackcloth, it was child-sized, dressed in black velvet and tattered lace. Her porcelain face was cracked in a spiderweb pattern, her smile etched a little too wide. She wore a bonnet, and her right eye was chipped. But her left one?
It blinked.

“Tell me you saw that,” I whispered, stepping back.

Jess swallowed hard. “That thing just moved. I swear it did.”

Darren, the collector of all things strange, smiled. “It’s probably a mechanical doll. You know, from the 1800s or something. These things can fetch serious cash.”

“Don’t take it,” Jess pleaded. “Just… don’t.”

But Darren had already lifted it out of the trunk. As he held it, something weird happened. I swear I heard something soft. A hum. Like singing. Just a breath of melody in the dust-choked air:

🎵 “Sleepy eyes and porcelain skin,
Let me come and crawl within.
Lace and shadow, stitch and seam…
Close your eyes, and let me dream…” 🎵

We stayed another night to help him finish up. That night, I had a dream. I was standing in Loretta’s bedroom and… she was there! Her mouth sewn shut, eyes bleeding, pointing at something behind me. When I turned around, I saw the doll, eyes gone, arms twitching as it dragged itself toward me, singing that same twisted lullaby over and over, her cracked mouth moving like broken clockwork.

🎵 “Little arms and tiny toes,
Crimson bloom where no one goes…” 🎵

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat. The doll was sitting on the nightstand next to my mattress….I hadn’t put it there.

A few days passed without anything… extreme. Darren took the doll home, and we all went back to our lives. But we stayed in touch more than usual, checking in, joking about the “haunted doll” like it was just another dumb story we’d laugh about later.

Then Darren stopped replying.

We thought maybe he was just grieving, or overwhelmed with cleaning out the house. Until Jess got worried enough to drive over and check.

She found him in his garage. Dead. Neck twisted all the way around, like something had spun it until it snapped, and mouth frozen mid scream.  The police said it looked like a freak fall from tripping down the garage steps. But there, on the garage workbench, sat the doll. It’s eyes clearer than before. Like someone had polished her. Her smile had gotten wider.

And I could hear that damn tune again, faint, like it was hiding in the walls:

🎵 “Buttons, needles, bones that crack,
Lay him down and don’t look back…” 🎵

After the funeral, Nolan changed.

He started acting strange first. Paranoid. He stopped going to work. Covered all the mirrors in his apartment. Said he saw her in them. He said he kept seeing things move in the corners of his room. Swore the doll was following him. “It’s crawling,” he said one night over the phone. “I hear it at night. Dragging those ceramic feet. It sings to me, I can’t sleep. I hear it crawling. And when I do sleep…” his voice trailed off into a whimper. 

I thought he was losing it. Or maybe just traumatized.

Until he stopped answering altogether.

I found him myself. His front door was locked from the inside. I had to crawl through a window to get in. The place smelled like something had died days before I got there.

He was in the hallway closet. Folded backwards. His limbs were snapped at unnatural angles, bones piercing through skin. His mouth was stuffed with fabric, black lace.

The doll was nestled next to him on the shelf just above his body, feet crossed, hands in her lap. Untouched. Clean. Smiling. 


Jess and I left town. We drove for hours until we were out of gas and then walked to the nearest motel. 

Neither of us talked much. We barely slept. We kept the lights on. But even in the light, I’d sometimes hear it. Her lullaby, playing just at the edge of silence, like the room was humming it.

🎵 “Eyes that blink and lips that bite,
I come to play when you turn out the light…” 🎵

We didn’t tell the police anything. What could we say? “A haunted doll is killing our friends”?

After about 4 days, Jess said she had to go home. “I can’t live out of a suitcase forever,” she said. 

I begged her to wait. Just a little longer. Just long enough to figure out what the Hell we were going to do, but she was adamant. She flagged down a passing 18-wheeler and I watched her drive away, getting smaller and smaller until she was gone. 

Three days later, she was dead. She called me on the phone screaming. No words. Just pure terror and raw fear coming through the phone’s receiver. I sprinted to her house and I broke down her door. 

She was in her bed, face pale, mouth open in a scream, eyes missing—just two hollow, wet sockets like someone had used a spoon and scooped them out. Blood was everywhere. I looked next to her, and there it was. The doll sat on her pillow, staring at me, one cracked eye twitching, head tilted. 

That was months ago.

I’ve moved five times since then. Changed my number. Deleted all social media. I live off-the-grid now. Remote cabin. No neighbors. No mirrors. And still…STILL,on the coldest nights, when the wind howls just right, I hear it outside.

Porcelain tapping on the glass.
A child’s whisper.
A lullaby:

🎵 “Four little souls all marked for me,
But one was left, so I could see…
Alone and scared, you’re almost mine,
Hush now, dear… it’s lullaby time.” 🎵

I don’t think it’s over. I…..I think she’s waiting for the final verse.
