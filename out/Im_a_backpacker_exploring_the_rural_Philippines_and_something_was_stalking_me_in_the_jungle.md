Finally, I found an internet connection through roaming data on top of this hill I'm camping for the night. My connection is just terrible here, I hope I will be able to upload this post because something extremely chilling happened to me.

I'm a backpacker traveling through the rural areas of the southern Philippines. This area is covered by either mountainous jungle or farmland and small villages. I travel with a small 125cc motorcycle, older then me but reliable and with very gentle gas mileage.

The locals act very hospitable and friendly towards me, many of them never having seen a foreigner before. Many offering a place to sleep and dine even though I insisted I had my own camping gear. As my trip wore on however further into the mountains ,where the roads became worse and cumbersome to drive, things changed. Wherever I went the people seemed on guard or even totally riled up. The strange looking foreign man traveling through their habitat didn't seem to be their main interest anymore. Many didn't even seem to notice me, caught up arguing and shouting over something. I deduced through the occasional english mixed with the local dialect that the issue was regarding missing livestock and at one village, a missing child.

In the last village I visted three days ago I saw armed men patrolling the outskirts. They shouted at me "Turn around po", "no safe ja". It dawned on me that whatever was going on in this area coincided with me travelling through here, I must be the main suspect. 

I panicked, accelerating away down the trail and I haven't seen civilization since then. I had neither refuelled or refilled my water and food supply for two days since I darted away from the last farm. The night that followed will forever haunt me.

I set up my hammock and downed some pastry that was about to go bad. I knew I just had to follow the trail, it did a large loop through the rural province and I was about halfway through my journey. Then it happened, loud, so very loud.

WAK WAK, WAK WAK, WAK WAK. 
My body froze. The sound was defening, coming from nearby but I couldn't pinpoint from which direction. I was frozen in my hammock, I felt paralyzed. My only weapon, a knife, somewhere deep in my rucksack. I knew I had to reach for it, to face whatever was making this sound. 
WAK WAK, WAK wak, wak wak...
The sound grew fainter, now I heard it came from the south from where I had came along the path.

Then, silence. 
I jumped out off my hammock, grabbed the rucksack and jump right back in the hammock. The rest off the night I spent in fear, looking at the stars and listening.

When the sun finally rose I rode my motorcycle as fast as I dared eastward along the path, soon it would curve south I knew it. And it did, relief filled me, until nightfall fell again.
Wak wak, wak wak, wak wak...
It was fainter now and died out sooner then the night before. I had left behind whatever was making that sound. 

When morning came I darted away again until my motorcycles reserve tank ran dry. I left it behind, it had been cheap but I hung myself up on not getting it refuelled at my last encounter with people. I hiked on, and that's when I found the hill I'm sitting on right now. I can see lights in the distance, looks like a small city. Looks like a one day hike to reach them. It's silent I've heard nothing this night I write here with great relief. Somehow though I got this strange feeling of being watched, I must be shook from the night two days ago. 

My browser loads poorly, could somone please comment if they have any idea of what I encountered in the jungle. The sound is the only thing you'll have to go by I'm afraid as I didn't see anything even though it was so close to me. Now I will sleep in peace for the first time in three days, I'm looking forward what you all have found about the sound tomorrow. Good night.
