Ok, so let's get something out of the way first: I KNOW WHAT I SAW. I don't care what the Drill sergeants said, I don't care what the commander said. I know what I saw, and now I'm telling you: something was there that night.

Let me back up a bit... My name is O'Brian.. yes, I'm giving you my last name. Its what we do in the army, and it's what I'm gonna do here, for privacy reasons.

For those of you in the civilian world, let me start off by saying that Basic training sucks. You wake up in the wee hours of the morning, always before the sun rises, and sometimes, in the freezing cold and pouring rain.  Depending on where and when you go, you could be cold for two and a half months, or sweating to death. Unfortunately for me, I had the former.  One of the things we do is something called fire guard. It's basically when we have two people stay up for an hour, watching over the platoon and cleaning the barracks. Its supposed to keep people from going AWOL, keep an eye out for any danger like fires (obviously) or any other dangers. If you ever get the first two or the final shift,  consider yourself lucky if you get any semblance of normal sleep.

Toss in a random Senior check, and boom, you're not gonna be getting much sleep. Once I heard and entire bay getting smoked at two in the morning. Kind of makes falling asleep hard after that..

The place I was sent to for basic, the rules for fireguard were simple:

*1: Stay up for the entirety of your shift.*

*2: Wake up the next shift 10 minutes prior.*

*3: One person is to stay at the Fireguard desk at all times.*

*4: The weapons cage is to be LOCKED once Toes on Line has been conducted, and must be checked every shift.*

But the thing is, my platoon had extra rules... rules that didn't seem to make sense at first, but I'm grateful to have followed now.

*5: Do a headcount every 3 hours.*

*6: If you hear knocks on the Drill Sergeant's door, ignore them. Only you and your Fireguard buddy can hear them and you alone.*

*7: At exactly 0213, you will hear  the sound of thunder in the stairway. Hide under a bed or in a open wall locker. Don't come out until the next shift.7a) If the door to the stairway opens, and its dark out there, you have two minutes to high crawl to the door and close it. DO NOT STAND UP UNTIL YOU REACH THE DOOR.*

*8: If at any point, you see a blue light come from the bathroom, stand at parade rest and DONT MOVE. Whatever is in there will know... and you will regret it.*

*9: If at any point, rule 7 and 8 are active at the same time, your shift is over. Immediately go to bed. DO NOT OPEN YOUR EYES IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING. IT WILL KNOW.*

*10: If at anytime, you break any of these rules, yell the word "ZONK". You may only do this one time a week.*

*11: If you find any food, leave it alone.*

***THE INCIDENT***

I had the unfortunate luck to be pulling the 0200-0300 shift.  We had just come back from a really long field exercise. We had spent 4 days without showers or proper beds, so all of us were understandably reluctant to even move from our beds. Hell, even the guy I was woken up by was already tucking himself under that scratchy ass green blanket we were all issued.

Anyway, I was the one who had the unfortunate luck of having to mop the entire barracks, while my guard partner was on desk duty.  This guy was one of the worst people  to work with, almost always falling asleep at the desk during his shift, half-assing the job when he cleaned.

&#x200B;

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw him staring at the Drill sergeant's door, a look of confusion across his face. "You hear that?" He asked me, looking over at me.

Shaking my head, I strained my ears to listen. I didn't hear anything at first, only hearing the faint snores of my platoonmates surrounding me. "Maybe it was an echo from downstairs," I suggested. "Second Platoon's probably getting smoked for leaving a bag unsecured, or something."

Shaking his head vehemently, he stood up, eyeing the door and moving away, stepping to the other side of the desk, away from the table.

"Green, C'mon, dude." I said, rolling my eyes. "If you're trying to get out of this, stop. I'm not stupid."

Green looked at me, offended, before sitting down. "How long have we been here?" "About six weeks... give or take a day." I told him, before frowning. "Dude, what gives? you never talk to me during these shifts. You never talk to me during the day."

"I'm just... I'm just tired, man." Green told me, sighing and putting his head down on the desk. "Let me know when it's time to go back to the bunks."

Grumbling, I turned and shuffled back to the back of the barracks, where the mop bucket and water were before.

I was halfway down the room when I heard it. It was faint at first, and I had hoped it was just my imagination, or maybe even a  side effect of being so tired. Then I heard it again, much louder this time.

*Thunder.*

&#x200B;

I didn't even bother looking over at Green. I didn't have to. The sound of the chair screeching backwards was enough of a tell that he heard it too. The sound of the door to the stairway slammed open. How the ruckus never woke anyone, I will never know.  Green and I lay under the beds, staring at each other from across the bay. I didn't have a clear view of the door, but the look on Green's  face said enough.

&#x200B;

Fuck.

To make matters worse, I had to be on the other side of the room, where the door was.

Double fuck.

I used the bed to crawl out, pulling on the legs of the bed to slide across the parts of the floor that were still wet. When I reached the door, I froze, staring out into the blackness.

Imagine the darkest, most secluded corner in your attic. You know the corner, the one corner that never seems to have any light touch it, no matter how many times you change the bulb. That one corner that you absolutely refuse to put anything in, not because it's too far, but because you feel like something's stalking you.

Yeah... Multiply that by five. Thats what I saw when I stared into the darkness. The worst part was, even as I stared down into that nothingness, I saw something. At least, I thought I did. It was like spotting a black cat in a shadow. I almost missed it at first, but then it got closer.

Whatever that thing was, it moved too smoothly. It moved like a snake over glass. There was no jerking, sporadic movements like you see in the books and movies. This *thing* moved like with no sound. No padding, no shuffling.

And the way it looked...

This thing couldn't seem to hold one form for very long, shifting from some horned beast, to a small human, to a undulating, amebous form, like something out of *The Blob.* The strangest part is, this thing seemed to have almost no depth to it. It almost looked two dimensional, like a thin blanket.

&#x200B;

I was so mesmerized by it's movements, I didn't realize how close it had gotten until the door slammed in my face. Rolling over onto my side, I saw Green panting, his nose and chin bleeding as if he were in a fight.

"Bed... NOW." Green told me, pushing my shoulder. I stared at him, dumbfounded, before looking back.

&#x200B;

That living shadow was behind us now, and from this distance, I could actually smell it. The thing didn't smell like stale blood, or rotten meat, or even like an animal. If it actually had smelt like that, maybe it wouldn't have been so terrifying.   No... the thing smelled almost clean, an overpowering aroma of cooked meat and, strangely enough, freshly fired ammunition casings. That smokey smell that is just strong enough to tickle the back of your nose, but just weak enough to make you want to sniff again.

I wasn't worried about the creature, however. What I was more worried about was the blue light  at the other end of the barracks.

Rule 9.

Before I could say a word, I felt Green kick  my knee as I scrambled to get up, causing me to slam back into the floor. The bastard climbed over me, stepping on my head and causing my nose to crunch against the hard floor. I could only watch as Green  avoided the Shadow's extended reach, before diving into his lower bunk, throwing the green blanket over the top of his head.

The Shadow turned towards me, the empty void of space seeming to stare at me, measuring me up. Being that close, I couldn't see any discernable features. No eyes, no mouth, not even a hint of a nose.  I could only lay there, blood oozing from my nose as the thing appeared to  turn its attention to the blue light, which seemed to grow  brighter as the door to the bathroom opened.

Turning it's attention back to me once again, I let out a scream as the shadow closed the distance between us, wrapping itself around me like a starfish. I couldn't move, but I could still breathe. The blackness engulfed me. The thing was, The Shadow didn't seem to try and hurt me. Sure it wasa bit tight.. but it was comfortable, and warm.. like clothes out of the dryer.

I don't know how long I was in that inky darkness for, but when I could see again, I saw Green's bunk, completely empty. No Green blanket, no bed sheets... not even a pillow.  


I turned to look at The Shadow, which shrunk down to the size of a small house cat. I then turned back to the bathroom, where I saw the glow of the blue light slowly fading out.  


I'm now writing this from the safety of my AIT, The Shadow still visiting me everytime I have fireguard.  It likes to hang out in the trees outside the building, or right by the wall of my building, just out of the light's reach. I don't know what was in that blue light, or what it even was, but I know this: there are more of those lights out there. I've seen them. They may change colors, they may even change where they hide, but one thing is for certain:  


You should never leave your post during fireguard.
