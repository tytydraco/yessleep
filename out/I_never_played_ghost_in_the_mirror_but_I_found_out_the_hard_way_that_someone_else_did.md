Why do kids think it’s funny to stuff way too much toilet paper down the U-bend? And *how* do they get poop in places that aren’t the toilet?

I know they talk about me behind my back. Hell, some of them do it to my face. You probably heard stories about *your* elementary school’s janitor, right?

You also probably knew that weird-as-fuck kid who was responsible for fecal matter on the mirror. 

Ever wonder how that shit got cleaned up?

But scraping foulness out of the cracks isn’t the worst part of the job. Not by a longshot.

No, what I hate the most is kids who like conjuring ghosts in the mirror.

You can always tell who they are. Groups of three or four will go in all at once, then come running out, screaming, less than a minute later. Of course, it could always be because that kid Jimmy Fischer peed his pants again – but if Jimmy is still eating lunch by himself, I know they’re trying to find Bloody Mary, or any other host of things from elsewhere.

The thing about that game, though, is that everybody runs away when they think something looks back at them from the other side of the mirror. 

So I’m usually the next person to enter the bathroom.

I don’t know how to describe the way things are *different*. The echoes are always odd in a bathroom, but the hair raises up on the back of my neck when the sounds are muted just the slightest bit more, and the shadows are darker than they should be. The kind of thing that no one would notice unless they spent a great deal of time in an ancient bathroom. 

I usually walk out of the room, put a “caution” sign over the door, and stay away for a full 24 hours. That’s usually enough time for the lights to return to normal. I don’t know where the summoned beings end up, but they seem to get pulled somewhere else. 

That’s what I *usually* do. But one of the kids called up something nasty this morning.

I sensed it almost immediately. The chill ran through my skin like a snowy vortex, and I felt lonely just setting foot on the tiles. Our species learned to be afraid for a reason: fear keeps us alive, and we’re supposed to obey it without asking why.

I wish I’d obeyed today.

But I saw a pair of glasses on the sink in the farthest corner. I moved across the bathroom as quickly as possible; some kid would be looking for them, and I couldn’t abandon a child’s needs because I was afraid of the ghost in the mirror. 

I should have realized that it was taking too long. But I *always* avoid looking at the mirror in those moments, so I was staring at the floor and not paying attention to how far I’d gone. 

When I realized that the bathroom had gotten much larger, I looked behind me, again avoiding the mirror. I’d only moved halfway across. Dread building in my stomach, I stared down at the floor and counted my steps. After nineteen more, I looked back to see that I hadn’t progressed. I gazed back down and counted thirteen more before looking back.

The bathroom now stretched the length of a football field, the door barely visible on the other side. I’d never felt that kind of terror in my life. 

I turned around to see the sink in front of me. The black glasses sat near the dripping faucet. I grabbed them.

“*Ow!* Fuck!”

I looked down to see that the glasses had vanished. A vicious wound had been left in my hand; it oozed blood from teeth marks that may or may not have been human.

I felt several different sets of eyes on me. I wished with every cell in my body that I’d stayed quiet. 

That’s when I turned and ran. I ran until my lungs burned, until it felt like my blood was pumping fire, moving far enough and fast enough to cross the room several times over. But the door only inched closer as the rules of time and space melted, hot and globby, around me. 

I reached the door. It opened inward, so I had to stop my sprint to pull it toward me. That momentary break in momentum was enough for something to grab my calf and dig painfully into it. I felt an explosion of agony and a gush of hot wetness as I yanked my leg away and burst into the daylight. 

I spun around, gasping for breath. My hands were shaking so badly that I was almost unable to use the key. But I found a way to lock the door, throw the “out of order” sign on it, and clock out early.

See, my plan was to get safely home. I didn’t even care if I got fired; I just needed to maximize the space between myself and that damned school bathroom. Once I got inside my apartment, I pulled off my clothes and raced to the bathroom to check my injuries. I was half convinced that they would be gone, proving that the ghost really lived inside my own head.

I was wrong. The bite marks that started on my hand now extended up my arm, forming a line of jagged tooth punctures that reached past my elbow. The fear pulled me deeper as I examined my leg. 

Those tooth marks now spiraled around my thigh like a sadistic barber’s pole. They hand nearly reached my waist. I stared, unbelieving, at the injury. Then I checked my face in the mirror.

I really, really wish I hadn’t looked in the mirror.

There aren’t any words to explain what I saw. All I know is that I didn’t see myself looking back. The reflection had my same size, shape, hair, skin tone, everything – it even matched my movements. But the eyes staring back at me were sentient.

Something is living in my mirror. Something followed me home. And now the ghost I encountered at work is constantly hurting me. The tooth marks have gotten closer to my chest since I started writing this.

I don’t know what will happen when they reach my heart. 

I’ll update if I’m still able. Until then, please be careful and watch your kids. Those who pay the price of stupid decisions are rarely the ones who [make them](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).
