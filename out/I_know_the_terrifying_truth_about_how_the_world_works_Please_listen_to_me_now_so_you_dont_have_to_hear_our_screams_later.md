The truth really does exist. I’ve seen it with my own doubting eyes. It vibrates all around us, begging to be witnessed. My solemn mission in life, from this moment forward, is to share this discovery with the entire world. We are at a very dangerous time, my friend. Collapse is coming and you need to know before it’s too late.

You’re probably like me, honestly. A cautious skeptic. How could you not be in 2024? The world is full of pervasive, fucking lies. Before I saw the truth, I went through life thinking that I had it all figured out. That is until I met Theo, the man who opened my eyes to the nightmare world that we truly live in.

Before I dive in though, I’m awful at recounting events. The only way I really know how to is just to start at the very begging. So…about half a year ago, I met Theo at an investment meeting for a tempting real estate opportunity. He was leading the meeting to a half-full hall at a hotel downtown. I was searching for a way to make more money and finally move out on my own. My current hourly salary as a mechanic just wasn’t keeping up with recent inflation, dooming me to life with frustrating and inconsiderate roommates.

The investment meeting itself was exciting but confusing. I went up to Theo afterwards, not only to ask more questions, but to see if he knew how I could get into more serious investments in the future. Maybe his company was even hiring, I thought.

Theo and I immediately hit it off. The guy is the most sincere person that I’ve ever met. When it was just us, after the remaining attendees left, he told me not to bother investing. The returns weren’t great on the property, and it would be hard to divest. He was only doing this as a final obligation to his employers before his two-week notice was met.

We kept in touch for several weeks over text. One day, he asked me if I could help out and water his plants while he was out on business. I thought it was weird, but I did him the favor. A week later, he texted me and offered to treat me to lunch.

“You seem like a very smart person. Let me ask you this, are you also a spiritual person?”, he asked me. I had never really thought about it before, to be honest. I told him that I thought that I was. I believed in spirits and Karma. I knew there was way more to life than we knew.

“EXACTLY! You can just feel it, can’t you…”, he said. The guy was always enthusiastic. It’s like he could see something in me that others couldn’t.

This is when he asked me a question that would change my life forever.

“Do you know what the Akashic records are?”

The word sounded really strange to me.  Almost like Russian. Maybe you’ve heard of the Akashic records, but this was the first time I had it in my twenty-four years so far on this Earth. The way he said it though, in a slightly hushed tone made me beyond curious.

“The Akashic records hold all knowledge from the past, present, and future. Every single bit of information is stored there in a repository that can be accessed by anyone. A flawlessly optimized database of all of the answers to life’s questions, indexed immaculately for instantaneous retrieval.”

I certainly didn’t wake up that morning expecting to hear something as wild as this. The way he was saying it sounded insane but in an undeniably intriguing way. How could something like this exist, and I had never heard of it until now?

“Do you want to learn how to access them? Dude, I’ll totally teach you…”

True to his word, Theo did in fact teach me. Not right at first but he did show me the path to accessing them. Before you think I’m some gullible sucker, I have to say I did call bullshit on all of this. Why on Earth would he know about this huge secret? Why isn’t everybody talking about these records and how to access them?

It took a little bit, but my doubts soon dissipated away. I mean, think about it, how many people know how to make money?  I don’t mean make a salary, I mean make gobs and gobs of it. Becoming wealthy beyond your dreams. Some people do, they just don’t want to share it. They want people to stay poor, so they can keep all the wealth to themselves…

It’s same with other things in life. Knowledge can be precious. People hold on to it in all walks of life. Training new people, keeping their skills above yours. Once you give people knowledge, you can’t take it back.  It’s why University in the US can be so damn expensive. Knowledge is precious.

Fortunately, there are good people out there who do want to share. Renown scientists and doctors of philosophy with PhDs sharing this information in Akashic literature that you can access even at your local library. People with actual authority in the field of spirituality attest to the irrefutable evidence of Akashic records’ existence. These aren’t some goofy conspiracy theory nutjobs. All of this is based on beliefs from Buddhism and accepted by millions in the past. Just look for yourself at how much there is out there on it.

Theo taught me how to access them after a few attempts on my own. When you try yourself, it’s a tad like stumbling around in the dark. You can tell something is there. You can even see things as your eyes adjust. But it’s no substitute to the clarity of actually SEEING.

Theo explained that the reason he was so good at seeing is that he was able to tap into a more direct path to the Akashic records. Most people use a prayer and meditation that opens the mind to the journey to the dimension where the records are held. Theo uses his knowledge of biology and chemistry, to aid in the journey. A special blend of psychedelic mushrooms that he prepares is the key to his process.

It was in October when he said that I was finally ready. He administered the mushrooms to me in an unusual ceremony that he held in a tent in his backyard. He had devised the ritual based on South American native tribe techniques. Theo acted as my guide as he led a prayer and rhythmic chanting until I fell into a completely relaxed state, ready to experience the awe of the Akashic record library.

Nothing can really and truly prepare for your first mystical trip into the Akashic plane. It was so disorienting at first. It felt like I was floating through a vibrating auditorium in which towering bookshelf after bookshelf whirled past me as I floated uncontrollably. With the help of Theo though, I was able to find my bearings and land safely on the library floor. The books and scrolls extended off farther than my eyes could see. They were endless. I had no idea where to start.

I couldn’t see Theo but he was there beside me. Guiding me to what I wanted to see.

I was able to see all the events in my life from the past in crystal clarity. Written down on immaculately leather-bound books describing everything in painstaking detail. I could see the events of my eighth birthday party in which my parents had hired a scary looking clown that made funny balloon animals. I saw the first time that I kissed my girlfriend in high school in the parking lot next to my beat up first car.

“There is something that I need to show you”, he told me seriously after I must have spent ages reminiscing on my past.

“It’s just down this hall to the main records of Humanity. The world as we know it is in Danger. What people think they know about how the world works is wrong. We are not in charge of our lives”, he said.

The books he showed me were hard to read. I think the mushrooms might have been wearing off or maybe I was just overwhelmed but the text on the pages jumped around in a way that was disorienting. What I could read though scared the shit out of my unprepared mind.

“They are called the Gimoozaabi. They are demons that run the events of humanity. They hide in plain sight in positions of power and influence the course of human history. They arrived a few hundred years ago and their goal is to keep humanity from uniting. They do this by injecting fissures of conflict and doubt into almost every facet of human life, from politics to race. From generations to religions. They are everywhere…”

I was so frightened by the revelation that I snapped out of the psychic state and was transported back to our dimension. Theo calmed me down and said this was normal for my first real journey to the Akashic plane. Next time, the journey would be even easier.

A few hours later, the mushrooms were still in effect, but I felt so drowsy that I had to sleep. I was still at Theo’s but sleeping in his guest room. His house was quiet but I felt uneasy. Like I was being watched. I don’t know what time it was but suddenly I felt a presence outside the bedroom door. At first, I thought it might be Theo, but I realized it couldn’t have been him.  Whatever it was… it was humongous. Creaking the floors as it stood just outside. A deep, gravelly growl started to get louder and louder.

I had no idea what to do. My head was my pounding with a headache, and I was sweating like crazy. It looked like a small amount of smoke was starting to waft in under the bedroom door frame.

Then an incredibly loud series of knocks were pounding at the door.

“FOOL, DO NOT MESS WITH POWERS YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND! YOU DON’T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST US!”, it shouted over and over.

I wanted to get up and run but I was too nauseated to move. I couldn’t even find my phone.

“THEO, HELP!”, I shouted in response.

I think I must have passed out after that. The next morning, I woke up and I felt a bit better. My headache was still there but a lot less painful. I saw Theo and told him about what had happened.

“Damn, I was worried about that. They are starting to notice our presence. We need to work harder”, he said.

“The problem is the process. It’s still not strong enough to maintain a constant psychic connection. We need to buy better mushroom products and processing equipment to refine it. Unfortunately, it’s not cheap but I have a plan”, he said.

His plan was genius. We had to bring him more members, but more importantly, generate revenue so that we could facilitate better Akashic trips. This involved anonymous Crypto investments. He had already set up some preliminary accounts and wallets and provided me with the information. I put my life savings into it as well. It was brilliant. A month later he showed me the numbers. Due to his previous investing experience, the excel reports showed that we had already tripled our money.

We now have over eight members and several more potential prospects. Our trips have shown us more and more details about the Gimoozaabi and their origins. What we know is that their plans involve the destruction of humanity. And I hate to tell you this, but it’s coming soon. But not if we have anything to say about it.

I wanted to come on here and give you all the details that I know but it’s just too public. We’d be exposing ourselves too much. What I can do is provide this solemn warning and to advise you to look out for our messages. We might reach out in person or even in text. I promise you we will defeat this threat to humanity.

I’ll admit all of this is scary. If I didn’t have the guidance of people like Theo, I don’t know what I would do. It seems like a lifetime ago when I was running around doing nothing with my life. The online girlfriend that I was dating that was always too scared to meetup in person. My demanding supervisor at my previous job that had no idea what he was doing, once even sending me on an errand to help buy gift cards for him at the supermarket. Now though I BELIEVE that I have a purpose. And I promise you that I won’t stop until we win…
