Mason died two months ago. Not like it should matter to me, we hadn’t been talking much before the accident. It was the same age old tragedy- some college boy behind a not so steady wheel at god’s most peaceful hours.  The kid survived, barely a scratch. Lord knows one can’t “survive” though when the life you stole comes crashing into your passenger’s seat, so mangled by glass and pressure  that the police labeled him “a wad of fleshy gum”

He died on impact, didn’t feel a thing. Least, that’s what the doctors say. I always wonder how they are able to determine that. There wasn’t just a short burst of agony before the lights went out? A short but fatal hellfire that consumes you right before you’re gone? Maybe I’m pessimistic.

It’s funny- he left the world the same time Annie came into it. 

He was on the way to the hospital when it happened. Even if we weren’t on speaking terms he at least had the sense to come to his daughter’s birth, we’d figure out custody later. 

Nothing to figure out now. 

I didn’t go to the funeral, never got an invitation. His mom has always hated me and I’m sure somehow she blames me for what happened. In all fairness the only reason he was out that late at night was because of me. Because of our daughter. 

I don’t know the first thing about being a mother. It wasn’t my idea to keep her, I would've been content to get that abortion and carried on with my life instead of turning into a walking yoga ball. Could have spent the hospital money on food or rent, I could have found a better man. 

But this is the bed I made I suppose, and now, holding this child in my arms, I don’t know what to do with myself. With her. I work a dead end job, I’m behind on rent, and I can’t even afford to feed myself much less a newborn. 

She hasn’t stopped crying since she crawled out of me. 

I tried to get her to latch onto me- didn’t work. I tried to bottle feed her- nothing. All she does is sob until her voice goes out and her face turns so red she exhausts herself into restless slumber. Then she’ll hit a second wind- a third, a fourth, and cry and cry and cry and I am starting to hear this constant ringing in my ears in the moments I have a second to breathe. 

I don’t know how something that small and pathetic can have such an engine. 

My  small “circle” of friends have offered to babysit her for a night so I can get some sleep. They doubt my abilities as a mother, I just know it. I can see it in their eyes- the way they squint at me when I drag up my eyelids, when I talk about that incessant screaming. They think I’m not capable of taking care of another human being. I bet they are talking about me even as I write this, sniveling and consorting in their hidden group chats devoid of me. 

I’m torn. I want to get rid of her, but simultaneously she’s the only part of Mason I have left, even if I did hate him. No- no I didn’t hate him. He hated me. He hated the nest  of dirty clothes stuffed into every corner of every room, the noxious smell of rotting cardboard and maggot chewed leftovers, the dirt beneath my nails and the itching beneath my skin. He hated my dead end job and my greasy hair and my rotting teeth. 

I can feel that same hatred in our daughter. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop fucking crying and I know she hates me. I know she thinks I can’t take care of her. She knows I don’t want her. 

I saw an ad the other night. “How to get the most out of skin to skin contact,” it read in soft blue letters, accompanied by the image of a smiling young woman with perfect teeth and perfect hair coddling a perfect looking child. The child looked so…peaceful. I clicked on the ad, more curious than anything. An ad couldn’t judge me. Couldn’t hold things over me. It brought me to a webpage with that same woman.

She was looking at me. Smiling. Her teeth so fucking white and straight I wanted to tear them from her gums. 

They were selling a box that included  an instruction manual that guaranteed that the contents would break whatever curse or barrier existed between mother and child. That within, there was a guarantee of peace. Of love. I remember scoffing when I read that. 

I bought it anyway.

I found the box on my doorstep this morning. The packaging was simple. It was a baby blue box with a silver ribbon tied neatly around it like a present. A yellow tag hung on the top: Feel the love! It read in big swirly letters, a small heart drawn at the point of the exclamation mark. 

I took it inside, and almost immediately Annie’s cries erupted through the house. They were shrill, piercing pitches that punctured my skull. The ringing swelled alongside it- I couldn’t hear myself ripping the package open. 

Inside was a velvet pillow with four  items.
A spool of black twine, a needle, a scalpel and an instruction manual.

I’ll put it here in case anyone wants to try this at home, since I don’t remember what the website was called. I’m sure searching up “skin to skin bonding with babies” or something like that will bring up something though.

Annie, of course, was crying for a large part of the process. I’ll admit, I was too. I don’t have any experience with stitching, my mother died when I was born, and it’s hard to work with something that squirms so much. She was going to love me. She didn’t have a choice. I don’t care if the parts of her that were Mason cursed me in hell, I carved them out and threw them away. I kept every part that was mine.

She doesn’t cry anymore. She lays peacefully in her bed, occasionally making a sound similar to a gurgle when she needs something. I have started to bottle feed her since she can’t latch on anymore- she had Mason’s mouth. She is much happier now, I can tell. I’ll raise her right, and she will be perfect. 

Even if she does look like a wad of chewed up gum.
