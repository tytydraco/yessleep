Fair warning, this story doesn’t have a lot of action. Honestly, you’ll probably ask “Why are you telling us this?” I don’t know. 

Well, I kind of know. I think. Let me explain. 

See, there was this guy, I met him when I was real little, probably about eleven? He was nice, in retrospect he was probably mostly sad. He was also in prison.

My dad worked at the prison outside our town, big ol’ building. He used to bring me in when I was out of school and I’d sit in this weird lil’ waiting area reading or doing summer work. I sat in this bit of hallway where there wasn’t enough space for the architect to put a room, so they just left it as a bulge by the offices. Then someone who worked there a while ago put two chairs down to try and make it more interesting, ‘cept it was a prison so nobody ever used ‘em. 

One day I was trying to find any excuse not to read The Lord of the Flies, and excuses were hard to come by in a building where the ‘decoration’ amounted to fluorescent light bulbs. When this guy sat down in the other chair. 

Now I’m older I know that was weird, he wasn’t a member of staff, he shouldn’t have been outside his cell block at all, let alone an area where he could just walk out. As a kid I didn’t know better. He was interesting. My dad was usually pretty busy, and people to talk to were hard to come by. This guy was also wearing the funniest outfit, it was like a soft lavender jumpsuit. I had learned the word “lavender” in English that year so I was mighty proud of myself for being able to recognize it in the wild. 

Anyhow, this guy sat down next to me and nodded at the book. “Any good?” 

I shook my head, looked at the pages lying face down in my lap. “It’s really boring. I hate Simon, he reminds me of my classmate, and Pat already spoiled that Piggy gets crushed by the rock.” The man just laughed, said I’d get it if I read the book again when I was older. He asked if I’d read any other books I liked, and I was telling him all about Matilda and how she developed her psychic powers when my dad came back. 

When he saw the guy sittin’ there chatting with me he got real stony. Not upset, not even disappointed, not with me at least, but he grabbed my hand and pulled me away. He didn’t say anything until we had gotten in the car. He had me sit up from in the passenger seat, that’s how we always sat for important conversations. I thought I had done something wrong, so I started trying to explain about how we were just talking ‘bout books, and I was real sorry. But my dad cut me off. 

He explained he wasn’t upset, “But be careful. He’s a strange one. If he ever makes you uncomfortable you come find me immediately.” The whole time he was talkin’ my pops just stared at the building, not looking at me. 

I didn’t see the guy for a while, but a few weeks later he came back. I had finished the book, and this time was doodling in the corner of a math worksheet. I was so focused I didn’t even look up when I said “My dad says you’re strange.”

The man laughed, and then I did look up. This time I looked at his face real hard, tryin’ to figure out if I could see what made him strange, but it just looked like a normal face to me. He had a couple creases ‘round his eyes where he was laughing, but he looked young. His hair was light brown, like the mouse I saw in the pantry that one time, but his eyes were definitely weird. When he opened them they were lavender, the same shade as his jumpsuit. At the time I didn’t think this was too odd. I thought it was cool, for sure, but I didn’t think it was ‘physically impossible’ cool. He just had a neat eye colour. 

“You’re dad’s probably right,” he said, and now I noticed he had a weird accent, like nothing I’ve ever heard before or since, something in the way he said his consonants made ‘em sharper than knives. “I am a bit strange, but strange isn’t always bad you know.” Then he smiled at me, and I figured he was right. He had a kind smile, like we had known each other years and were sharing an inside joke. I think even if I was an adult I would have been charmed by that smile. 

“Why’ve you got a different outfit than the others?” I asked. This time he took a minute to answer, no smile decorated his face. “I’m a bit special.” He finally said, that grin returning. I thought of Andrew, my dad said he was special and that’s why he got extra help in school. He was allowed to take breaks from learning whenever he wanted, and there was an extra teacher just for him to help explain things. I asked the man if he also had an extra teacher, but he laughed again. “Not that type of special, kiddo.” He said. 

“Well then what type?” I persisted. 

He took a while to answer again, longer than last time. When he finally spoke it was to ask a different question, “You know how when you fall and scrape your knee, your blood is red?”

I was pretty confused, but said yeah. Though I hadn’t fallen off my bike in four months, which was a really long time. 

“Well if I were to fall,” He said, “My blood would come out this colour.” And he gestured at his outfit. 

I thought that was insane. At the time I figured he must have been a wizard or som’ing. Only when I think back to that conversation now do I know the expression on his face was sorrowful, and he wasn’t laughing no more. 

I asked all sorts of questions. Why that colour? Was it always that colour? Did it ever get darker or lighter? Most of his answers amounted to “I don’t know.” and he managed to turn the conversation back to school. 

Later, when me an’ dad were eating dinner I asked him about it. He set his spoon down and looked me dead in the eyes with that same stony face. “Look, Andy,” He started, and I knew it was bad ‘cause he only ever called me my name when it was real important. “That guy, he’s been in the prison longer than I, longer than anyone, has worked there. I don’t know what he did, but it was something really bad, ‘kay?” I nodded silently, but he continued. “Some o’ the guys, they think it was fucked up medical shit, they said his file just says ‘indefinite’ under his sentence. I dunno if they’re right, but I’ve seen him bleed and it’s unnatural. Some crime happened there, a crime against nature if nothin’ else.” 

I knew my dad was serious that day ‘cause he gave me an extra kiss goodnight, and he only did that when he was super worried.

My pops kept bringin’ me to the prison while on holiday, even when I got old enough to be left home alone. I think it was some way of protectin’ me. Every couple of weeks the man in the lavender jumpsuit would sit down and just chat with me. I told him about the latest video games, and about Jane Austen, and I talked with him ‘bout Lovecraft, even though I didn’t understand most of it. “That racist son-of-a-bitch knew true terror.” He cackled. 

I stopped askin’ questions about his life after a while, it made him sad. I thought maybe the love of his life died or something and he was a mad scientist trying to bring her back from the dead. That would have been pretty neat. 

At least, I knew he was alone. He had that feelin’ about him. Like he had given up waiting and was just floatin’ along. Even as a kid I could feel it in the air around him. Like a one-man funeral. 

One day when I was in high school I asked him when he was born. I wanted to know if he was alive during any of the interesting wars we had been learning about in history. He looked young, but by this time I knew that he was older than he looked. If I didn’t know him I’d’ve thought he was maybe in his mid-20s, but I was also a teen at the time so he could’ve looked anywhere from 20-40. Maybe 50 with good skin, lord knows he don’t go outside. 

He thought real hard for a moment, an’ I could tell he was proper concentrated on the question cause his eyes screwed up like when he was tryin’ to help me with differentiation in math. It took so long I was sure he must’ve plain forgotten, when he said “1580s-ish. Don’t remember the exact date.” 

“No shit!” I said, mouth agape. He had to be pullin’ my leg. No way was he that old. Even if he went to prison when he was eighteen, my da had been working there for about twenty odd years, puttin’ this guy at 38, minimum. “You’d be over four hundred years old!” I said. 

He wasn’t smilin’ exactly, but his eyes were twinkling like that old poem about Father Nick. “C’mon kid,” He said, “You know I bleed purple, you think four hundred years means anything?”

I sputtered, honestly I’d forgotten about the lavender blood thing, I’d learned ‘bout it too young, never gave it real thought. While I was struggling to form words, he simply sighed and held up one arm, then he took his other hand and dragged his nails down it. 

I guess they don’t give the guys nail files or clippers or shit, ‘cause his nails were long and sharp, and looked more like claws or talons than anythin’ else. An’ I guess they were sharp as claws too ‘cause they drew blood. 

I sucked in a breath, his blood was straight lavender. The same damn shade as his jumpsuit. It didn’t smell like lavender though, it just smelled like plain ol’ blood. 

“What the fuck are you doin’ here man!” Was the first thing I said, “You could be out there helping cure old age! Dementia or some shit!”

He gave me that same smile again, and the funeral feeling sent a chill straight down to my toes. “I can’t,” He said, “I’m sure your old man told you, I’m here until the world ends.” 

“But why?!” I protested, “Surely if it’s been long enough you could be let out on parole or som’ing!” 

“You don’t get it,” he said, that sad smile never slipping. “I *can’t* leave. My very life is tied here, got moved over from Europe in the 30’s by some idiot who didn’t understand what he was doing. I couldn’t leave if I wanted to.” 

“So what?!” I said, “The government jus’ built a prison around you?” 

“Kind of,” He replied, “It was a lab at first, the prison came later. Every week or so they run some tests on me, measuring all that complicated shit like metabolism and respiration. They’ve tried to kill me a couple dozen times by now, nothing works.”

This shook me up more than the age thing. “What, so they do like, shady government tests on ya?”

The man hummed in response. We sat in silence for a bit, me absorbin’ everythin’ and him just kinda sitting there. Then my dad came back from whatever locker room he keeps his outside stuff in and we had to go. 

Fuck, it’s so weird how vividly I remember this all. I guess I spent most of my childhood in that chair, but I can still picture the guys face clear as day. 

We didn’t talk ‘bout his being in some fucked up government test center for a bit. ‘Couple weeks later though, I asked him how come his jumpsuit was the same colour as ‘is blood. I figured it was a weird thing for the prison to care about, they could’ve spotted him out from the other inmates regardless. ‘Cept he said the colour was his blood. 

“It’s cheaper for the scientists to bleach my cloths every couple of months than waste money buying new orange jumpsuits for me.”

What the fuck. 

Anyways all this ‘s mostly context, ‘cause here’s the reason I’m posting: He’s gone. 

Not dead, not vanished, but I was visiting my da recently and the guy wasn’t there no more. I waited a few extra days just to be certain, but he never showed up. I asked ‘round too, and all the people working with - though that may have been code for ‘on’ - ‘im were gone too. Meanin’ they finally figured out how to move him. 

And I guess, I figured, ya’ll have these fucked up experiences, maybe one’f you’ll encounter him. He ain’t mean, nor cruel. He’s nice and patient. He loves red vines and says we never got the hang of beer. His favorite animal’s an octopus, an’ his favorite author’s Shakespeare. He hates pears. 

Please, I just wanna know he’s okay.
