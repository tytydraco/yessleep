“I saw one of them again last night.”

One week away from land on a small cargo ship and Adam’s stories didn’t age any better in saltwater. 

“Seven, maybe eight feet tall. Standing on the waves. Watching us. Watching the boat.”

The dude was a virus that nobody on deck wanted to catch. He was a deckhand by trade but the Captain banished him to cleanup duty. His fellow crew cracked jokes at his expense. Nobody wanted to work with him. Nobody wanted to talk to him. Ultimately his station fell so low that he ended up in the mess hall, with me, the cook. Funny how shit rolls even on a ship.

“People think I’m crazy,” he continued that morning with a wistful eye out the window. “You can say it. Jack already did. He’s off his meds. He’s detoxing. It’s whatever. Fuck it. Doesn’t matter. I’ve heard it all before - from you guys, from my parents, name it. We’ll find out soon enough.”

The sureness in his voice baited me to ask a little further. 

“Alright,” I offered. “What do you think you saw?”

He took to the question like a life raft. I think he was glad somebody would just listen. 

“I don’t even know what to call it,” he answered carefully. “A jumper, maybe, hydro-jumper or something.”

“A waterwalker,” I suggested. “I heard some of the guys joking…”

“The cameras can’t capture enough light out there,” he whined. “The radar fucks up. Only thing that works is binoculars… and even that only lasts for a second. Too many jumps”

I went to get us some coffee from the counter.
 
“I finally got one good look last night,” he called after me. “Out there on the waves. Just looming there like a fuckin’ titan. Humanoid but not human. Long arms, long legs, maybe a tail or something at the back to keep balance. Big, like I said, bigger than you or me. And I don’t know how fast.”

The pot beeped.

“I tried to track one of them with radar. I wanted something visual to show everyone, you know, hard data instead of me just talking shit. But it didn’t *like* that.”

I snorted.

“What didn’t it like?”

He stared back at me. He waited for me to fidget awkwardly with the coffee. Then he answered.

“The radar. IT didn’t like radar. The scanner jumped up and down, you know, back and forth, back and forth. I would catch this thing in one spot - only to have it pop up a mile west a second later. Then it would hop back again. I’ve never seen anything like it. I don’t know if the track worked and something scrambled or if IT is just… *fast*. You know? Really fucking fast.”

I shrugged.

“What’s that quote?” he wondered aloud. “‘If you stare long enough into the void, it stares back at you’?”

 He shuddered and snatched the hot cup of coffee from my hand. 

“I think we’re getting a little dramatic, here…” I started. “You said...”

He grabbed me.

“No. You don’t fucking get it. Nobody gets it. Last night, on deck, I could feel the void, Matt. I could feel it looking right into my chest cavity and wrapping around all the muscles and blood vessels in there. I could feel this *cold*… freezing cold you know… and all I can remember thinking is that I didn’t want to ever be cold like that again. Have you ever felt that way? An impenetrable cold? I can feel it right now. It’s sixty fuckin’ degrees in here.”

He cradled the cup.

“So what happened?” I asked. “Did you track it?”

“No. I tried. I couldn’t track it. It wouldn’t let me. Then it started to move closer….” he looked at the floor. “It *looked* at me… it *saw* me…. With bright green eyes. Like a lizard, you know, right through the scope.”

He gulped.

“I went inside and locked the door. Haven’t seen anything since.”

I let him sip for a few seconds before piecing together my reply carefully. I wanted to let him down easy. Nobody on board seemed to have the conscience necessary to do it.

“This is going to sound really arrogant,” I sighed. “But I have been out on the water for a long time. You’re not the first guy to say he’s seen something. You won’t be the last. It’s dark at night. Darker than anything you have ever experienced before. That darkness has a way of pulling people in and there isn’t a spec of land in any direction. So no. I don’t think you’re crazy. People see things.”

Adam nodded violently. He felt vindicated. That made the next part much harder.

“But you gotta understand how this stuff makes people uncomfortable. When you talk about it all the time… when you insist on the truth in it…  we live in a day and age where society has figured out all of the mysteries. There's nothing left out there to discover. There’s no monsters or voids. That shit is all pieced together in your brain to deal with the harsh reality of the unknown.”

The wind picked up.

“There’s nothing out there but sea and fish,” I finished. “Maybe some rocks. A shit ton of garbage. But that’s it. Mostly just sea and fish.”

The radio cackled with orders to do something for someone. I felt relieved of the conversation and disappeared into a corner to occupy myself with breakfast. Adam let me go without another word.

The rest of the day moved like any other. Lunch came and went with dinner not long after it. The “normal” folks on deck had five modes - work, eat, sleep, drink, or fish. The second kept me busy and the last kept us all fed. Everybody contributed. Everyone except Adam. Hence the hatred from everyone else on board.

That night, on Captain’s orders, I circled the ship to find my disheveled buddy on a chair on deck under the stars. He had a pair of binoculars at the ready and the same outfit he wore all day. I wondered when he last showered.

“You know they got Anna up in the tower tonight,” I offered loudly to announce my presence. “Are you backing her up?”

Adam answered without looking away.

“She misses shit.”

I laughed.

“And you don’t?”

He considered that. 

“Backup,” he answered. “Like you said.”

I nodded and pulled up a second chair behind him. 

“Buddy, it’s past midnight.”

“Shut the fuck up a second.”

“Excuse me?”

He grabbed my arm. 

“I’m sorry, just, look.”

He handed me the lenses and pointed to a speck of the horizon. I zoomed in and did my best to pinpoint the spot. But the only thing that stood out to me were waves. Countless waves and a blanket of black behind it.

“I don’t see anything.”

He snatched the binoculars back out of my hand. 

“It was right there.”

I sighed.

“Man…”

Adam stood and pointed a finger aggressively, as if he hoped to poke the damn thing in the night, then he shouted - 

“RIGHT THERE.”

To the point that his voice carried and the observation deck threw up a light. I grabbed him around the shoulders and led him back down to the bunks. He fought me for a little bit. Then sheer exhaustion took hold. 

Inside, I shucked off his shoes like a drunk in college. I tossed him into bed. I found his bed sheets, neatly kept and folded, beside a small stash of books and maps organized by size. I turned off the light on my way out the door, and just before the frame clicked, a voice whispered - 

“Wait.”

I did.

“Lock it for me,” Adam muttered. “Will you?”

The Captain and mates had keys. I thought about saying as much. But I supposed he wasn’t worried much about them as much as whatever he thought might be coming. I nodded in the dark and clicked the cheap Kwikset. Just before I left, he called out again. 

“Lock yours too.”

My room was right next door. But something about the glow of moonlight through the windows in the hallway drew me back up top. I sat on deck a while, in Adam’s chair, and investigated the shapes on the horizon just as he did. I kept expecting to see something. Maybe a boat or a whale that would explain away his worries. Maybe something would jump out at me. But ‘it’ never did, so I just sat there a bit. The waves looked peaceful when they crashed up against the ship. 

One turned into two AM. Sleep finally started to seem more likely. I slipped back downstairs to bed and passed Adam’s cabin on the way. I listened carefully to the reassuring sound of him sleeping off the paranoia. Then I found my own room and dimmed the lights.

Two turned into three AM. I read on my phone. I tried to sleep but the silence of the ship made me uncomfortable. I took off my clothes and decided on a late shower. Halfway in between finding a towel and a razor blade, my eyes fell on the lock. I hesitated for a second. I thought about it. Then I clicked it forward.

The hot water of the shower washed away Adam and all of his problems. My mind switched to the following day and its many different headaches. I wrestled in between breakfast quesadillas and body wash when suddenly, oddly, I heard something. 

I still can’t quite identify the noise that first caught my attention. The whistling of the shower obscured most sounds. But that crash or bang got me out from under the water in a hurry. I wrapped a towel around my waist and whisper-walked my way around the corner. 

The door handle caught my attention.

The lock jiggled in a pattern. Two to the left. Two to the right. I stood still as a ghost in a white towel, scared of breathing for fear of alerting whatever might be on the other side. Two to the left, two to the right. Over and over again for about a minute.

Heavy footsteps retreated from the doorway. I felt safe enough to whisper-walk towards my golf clubs. The footsteps stopped again. A faint jiggle of a lock echoed in the hall. I listened and cursed my breath for being so goddamn loud.

Two the left, two the right. Stop. Two to the left, two the right. Stop. Again for a minute. The heavy footsteps moved on and a high-pitched ringing followed behind. I gathered what remained of my courage and gently unclicked the lock.

A door opened. I opened mine. 

I peeked outside just in time to see a shadow enter a room down the hall. 

The door closed. I closed mine. 

I hopped over - feet still dripping - to the closest wall. Adam’s bunk was in between us and the third room and he was no longer snoring. I wondered if he was listening too. There was a loud THUD. Then a shuffle of feet. More ringing. A door opened soon after and I rushed to slip open mine. 

I only saw a silhouette. A shape that disappeared in seconds. It was huge. About eight feet tall. Long legs. Long arms. No tail. It dragged someone behind him, a crew member we later learned to be Jack, then turned a corner and went up the stairs to the deck. 

I didn’t follow. 

The slow and heavy footsteps turned into a gallop against the floorboards. A couple other guys reported hearing a high-pitched shriek. The running ended in a splash. And then it was silent.

‘

The man overboard alarm sounded a full five minutes after we roused the ship.

The Coast Guard launched a broad search that scanned the surrounding ocean for a full week. Nobody found Jack. Rescue services theorized he was suicidal. The Captain insisted he fell. The crew heard something… but most people couldn’t agree as to what.

I thought about telling our story. I assumed Adam would do the dirty work. But when I caught him in the mess that morning, he just smiled at me, fresh as a bird, and poured a fresh pot of coffee.

“Did you hear who it took?”

I nodded carefully.

“Who’s fucking crazy now?”
