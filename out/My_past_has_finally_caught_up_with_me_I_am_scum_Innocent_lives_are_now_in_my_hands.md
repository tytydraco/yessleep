Just to clarify. I am scum. This account is a plea for help and for me to begin repenting from my previous crimes. Crimes, I'm still too much of a cunt to fully confess. Everything you read is true. I am still faced with the closing dilemma that whichever avenue I choose will spell the end of my life on this planet. The events of Friday, the 8th of December 2023, have caused this. I deserve to face my demons, let them claim me and heed the warning to those who are easily turned to believe in themselves more. Evil will try to break you. Only you can repel all that is iniquitous in this world. 

On the face of things, I'm somewhat of an average 34-year-old white British male. 

Well, maybe not so average... My former peers are currently nestled safely in healthy, long-term relationships. Some with kids, a company car, even a yappy dog to keep them occupied. They're battling the mundane stresses of their mid-30s, a receding hairline, the increased cost of living, and the perils of having loved ones who rely on them. For me? I'm detached from that life.  

I've been single all my adult life and have little in the way of a social circle. In my defence, I probably exaggerated my pitiful existence just a little bit. I'm well-liked and always polite and attentive to those who know me. I'll always be up for a pint at the end of the working day if a colleague asks (I work in sales for a well-known telecommunications company). I pay exorbitant rent on a 2-up, 2-down terraced house in a northern city, and my parents love me dearly; they still call me each week to see how I'm getting on, asking if I've met a girl and congratulating me on any recent successes. The unspoken issue is. I consciously live far away from them, yet that doesn't detract from their unwavering, consistent support; they miss me, but I seldom visit. I've been known to work over the festive period to avoid them, to remain secluded. This quiet and solitary exterior is, unfortunately, the result of a regrettable flirtation in my teenage years.

You see. To put it bluntly, I was groomed by a neo-nazi terrorist organisation as a naive and bitter 19-year-old student. I left that life 13 years ago, cutting off all contact. I destroyed all trace of any association with the twisted evil I called my family, a family whom I would've taken a bullet blindly for. Until this week, I have had no contact with any of them. You see, now I'm in a dilemma. It appears only I can stop innocent people from being hurt. Only I hold the key, but I'm fearful of facing a life where the remaining guilt ruminates continuously in my mind. Some atrocities are being committed. How do I know? I'll try to fill in the blanks.

As I type, sweat is starting to build. I know a salty monsoon will shortly flood my face. The lingering product in my hair from yesterday will bind and deservedly sting my eyes once the sweat slowly seeps down from my forehead. I'm physically shaking. My heart pumps faster. The more I pour my heart out, the more sweat will flow from my brow. Please don't sympathise with me. These physical manifestations are only the effects of sheer cowardice. Unlocking my past is indistinguishable from facing one's greatest fear. My brain is my enemy. Reminiscing only allows for a bombardment of home truths that continuously divert my attention:

"You weren't groomed! How dare you suggest it, you fucking loved it", 

"You're an adult at 19, your autonomy drove you to that life, your hate clouded your judgement, and you're only suppressing the inevitable". 

Sorry. I'm stalling. My gutlessness will spare you the gruesome acts I once gleefully revelled in. In truth, my gutlessness is what probably stopped me from becoming too engulfed. At that time, I still skillfully marshalled two separate lives; despite my passion and devotion to the cause, I was still discomfited in divulging my extracurricular activities to those close to me. In a stroke of luck, my cowardice made my quick escape seamless. That can't be said for others. I was the spineless anomaly, the weak link of an army of brave, unwavering soldiers. 

I was recruited at a similar time to someone who was more headstrong and more easily led. We came from different backgrounds; our social classes would've seldom mixed in any other scenarios. Even our statures contrasted. While I was of average height and scrawny, his stature was large and dominant, with a height of approximately 6 foot 4. My babyfaced complexion and thick hair differed from his hardened skin tone and deliberately bald scalp. 

The bitterness we shared was manifested from experiences, whilst mine weren't inherited, more acquired. This person's prejudices and anger were shaped from an early age. His primary socialisation meant that this organisation would always be his destiny. Whilst we became firm friends immediately, my eventual disassociation was born from an ever-brewing disgust; his hatred was only heightened by the atrocities we were exposed to. Like me, he has dissociated from the brotherhood, the family, the morals and norms we swore to adhere to. However, for him, the chilli just wasn't hot enough. He hated the beauracracy, the over-promised, under-delivered actions that were in hindsight apparent cowardice. He wanted more; he desperately wanted to change the world and bring all-out war to our perceived enemies.

I knew about his dissociation long ago; it briefly touched the middle pages of some of Britain's "left-wing" news outlets. But this figure of hate, my old friend, had vanished for years. I scoured forums about a year ago, and his whereabouts were speculated to be in Eastern Europe. Still, in all honesty, nobody had a fucking clue. I hoped, like me, he'd left it all behind and started afresh. No. I was misguided in my thoughts. 

Two nights ago, I felt a presence. It was dark and lonely. The window was wide open. From the safety of my unmade bed, I stared wide-eyed at the musty-smelling pile of clothes perched against the damp corner wall of my upstairs bedroom. They'd been there for a week now, and I was beating myself up again for being too much of a shitbag to do anything about them. The Sominex I'd bought earlier in the evening, which I'd taken double the allowed dose, had yet to kick in. I could hear the cool breeze and the distant sound of a car revving about half a mile away. It was just me in the darkness, my covers wrapped around me. I closed my eyes, breathed in and held my breath for 3 seconds before slowly exhaling; I repeated this meditation bullshit 7 or 8 times to no use. I muttered to myself, realising the rumination of my past life that no SSRI could block out was gathering momentum again. 

A couple of minutes passed. My eyes were still closed; it was now complete silence. I felt it as I was about to roll over and try again to get comfy. A presence. I stayed still. Determined not to open my eyes. A somewhat seductive sensation touched my lips. The smell and taste of leather. A finger was pressed against them. I tensed, my eyes still closed, but my heart pounding. "Shhh". For those who have been unfortunate to experience sleep paralysis, this is the only description I can give to the sharp, tingling feeling and fear that overwhelmed me. A prominent figure, the figure I described earlier through my intentional rambling (stalling tactics), was looming over me. Dressed head to toe in camouflage, wearing leather gloves. He smelled of burnt fires and the damp musk that's usually attributed to the results of heavy rainfall. When our eyes met, a wirey, sadistic smile curled up on his face. "Found you", he whispered menacingly. He looked older, more. Sinister. He quickly pulled me upright and chuckled. He began whispering in a threatening manner.

"You weren't hard to find, you know. Pretty fucking easy. I thought you'd live under that thatched roof with your dear parents? Look at you in this squalor. I heard you'd moved on; I thought you'd be living the fucking high life."

I couldn't speak; I was gasping for air. What the fuck is happening? I thought. His voice became eviler and eviler, his whispering becoming calmer, calculated, wicked. 

"Read about that poor family in Birmingham? 2 dirty Muslims, 5 dirty kids, the poor innocent fire that claimed their lives last month? What was it? The takeaway beneath them was that they took liberties with their equipment. Soon, they'll tell the truth. We're going to war, and I need someone as dedicated as me to help round up troops".

Before I could get a word in edgewise, he continued, his fucked up smile as wide as ever. 

"I know you were never fucking into it; you got mugged by a bunch of pa**s and wanted revenge. Took me a while to fucking notice. You were a pathetic coward, like them, but I know when you were at your angriest, you did things; I'm sure your parents would love to know."

I replied in shock; I asked him what the fuck he was doing; I didn't care how he found me; I wanted to know what the cunt had planned; he'd just admitted to scorching an innocent family. 

He somewhat ignored me. Instead, he carries on explaining his sick plan. 

"This is just the beginning. Soon, there'll be race wars, mass deportations, and more murders, which means more resentment and eventually less scum walking these streets". 

For another 5 minutes, he carried on telling me about schools, families, mosques, and all future targets that will stir up hate in communities. Why was he telling me this, you may ask? 

He was that fucked up; he needed to vent his fucked up exercise to someone he knew he could control. Someone like me, a coward who he believes is powerless to prevent these atrocities. Before he slunk off into the night, he promised he would return, but in the meantime, I'd "hear about him through his actions in the coming weeks". His final message was even more chilling. He complimented my retired father's choice of car. Then he proceeded to reveal a screwed-up photo of me and my parents when I was roughly 14. I knew exactly where the photo belonged in their house. My heart sank. "Just to show you how close I got to them without them ever noticing", he chuckled. I never mentioned my family when we were associated; how did he find out? I threw up all over myself, my hair drenched in sweat, rocking back and forth. 

As soon as he left, I called my startled mother. They were fine! I made excuses for calling and put it down to a bad dream. We talked briefly about Christmas before apologising again for waking them and hung up. 

I haven't slept since. This week will be life-changing. I will update you when I know what the fuck it is I need to do. 

I am scum. I'm so sorry to those close to me, especially my parents
