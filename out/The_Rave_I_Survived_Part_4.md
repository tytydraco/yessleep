Outside the chilled dance room, murmuring quiet returned. The rooms off to either side were now easily noticed. While most of the indication had been removed, it was still easy to tell the rooms were only overflow space for bathrooms. A good place to check if the makeup was indeed waterproof. One room was empty save a few random chairs and upturned tables. The bathroom entrance, however, looked barred up and reinforced with a pile of rubble. The other room had cracked mirrors stacked against broken mirrors so dense a path barely one person wide remained. The bathroom on the other side of the mirror gauntlet appeared open and accessible.

Through the mirrors, I began. The initial intent was to ignore the crumbling edifices and anything they showed. That proved an unrealistic expectation. At first, it was just a quick glance to notice that the reflection of my shoes was leaking and tracking a tar-like substance. In the plated surface of a mirror that had more in common with a spiderweb, my hand was coated in black goo. My leg, my body, the ends of my hair, a corner of my face, all captured in fractured pieces, replaced me with Reflection.
The dirty, unkempt bathroom featured toilets that were knocked off their bases. A lone sink appeared to be functional, with a faucet dripping brown water. As I approached the mirror, Reflection approached it from the other side. "You're looking better," I said in a voice braver than I felt.

"You're not," Reflection said.

"Rude."

"Obvious." Reflection leaned against the mirrored sink, and I leaned against the normal sink.

"I would like to see my face."

"You're looking at it."

"You're not me."

"I was you, and I will be you."

"True or not, you're not me right now." I glanced away from Reflection's muddied scowl. The faucet handle took some convincing to move; rust scrapings fell from where it sat on the body. The initial stream was a series of sputters, but over time, the water flowed with consistency. My nose scrunched up at the brown water coming out.

"Looks safe, give it a try," Reflection antagonized.

"Turn on your sink," I huffed. Reflection stuck out their tongue (I think.) They nonetheless manipulated the faucet; they were me, after all. On both sides of the mirror, the water started to run clear, at least as clear as could be expected.

A deep breath helped brace for the cold water splashed across my face and neck. A look in the mirror showed that some of the oily substance had washed off. The makeup was still in place.

Another splash. Reflections face became clearer, and my makeup remained as clear as it had when fresh. It was a careful process where I patted my face dry and gathered water in cupped hands. Reflection at no point seemed pleased, but it wasn't their opinion that mattered. At one point, the mirror slipped out of view, and when I looked up, the only thing left in the portal was me. Well, not entirely true. The locker room I was standing in was also in the mirror, but the only person there was me. It took some effort, but I appreciated my face. The makeup helped.
The faucet was easier to shut off than it had been to open. Stepping away, some droplets still rolling down my jaw and neck. The locker room was compact, with benches below stacks of lockers, each barely big enough to hold a pair of shoes. All but one of the personal vaults was left open. A graffiti gold crown marked the sealed locker.
From outside the room came sounds of splashing, music on tin-y speakers, and a laughing crowd. The smell of salt and chlorine were easily recognized.

The room I stepped into was bathed in shimmering blue and purple lights. Most of the space was occupied by a pool, where people in full attire danced in the shallow end while others dove in and out of the deep end. The DJ was at a simple table set up near the intended pool entry. They had home-quality speakers mounted high, trying to belt a swaying track out at a volume that was probably not recommended by the manufacturer. Snare was replaced with samples of a steel pan drum, adding to the overall impression of sunsets and beaches the music called to. Against the ceiling, the pool cast thin, rolling white lines.

My steps developed a bounce that accentuated the shakers that moved around the kick. I found an unassuming spot near the deep where I could sit. Shoes were removed, and feet were placed in the water (with a bloody sock, used-up bandaging, and all). Bobbing shoulders and scuffling hips continued to match the push and pull of the track. It almost seemed like the world moved only as fast as the ripples lazily rolling across the pool's surface.

Something at the bottom of the pool sparkled. My attention was grabbed. Water has a way of reflecting light that can often be deceptive. Yet, as I stared on, the twinkle remained. Something shiny sat unattended at the bottom of the pool.

I took a deep breath. I shut my eyes. I then pushed myself off the edge. The water pulled me in with a coy chill. Eyes open, it didn't take long to adapt to the wavering world. The deep end proved surprisingly challenging to reach. Stroke after stroke had me descending deeper. Light was struggling to keep pace, my surroundings becoming darker. A carefully measured exhale was needed before continuing. Above me, the sounds of splashing turned into the deep thuds of an experimental beat. The dancers above melded into a single porous and undulating shape.
My lungs started to ache, dull and tense. Breathing needed to wait. Another careful exhale. I thought maybe that'd reduce buoyancy and make it easier to get to the bottom. I'm pretty sure I was just lying to myself.

The bottom of the pool was turning black, any detail of the water's confines lost in the shadow. Illumination was becoming a feint memory that swirled above me.

My lungs began to protest, stabbing at my chest and kicking at my sore ribs. I was close; they would have to wait for fresh air. They had held breath longer than this; at least, that's what I thought at the time. I hadn't tracked how long I had been under.

The attention-demanding glint was fading as I drew close, turning into a simple silver coin. Bubbles escaped my mouth and nose as I allowed myself another partial exhale. Clumsy fingers scraped at the bottom of the pool to gain ownership of the silver coin. It was about the size of my palm. The crown on one side had been scratched out, and an owl was emblazoned on the other. Victorious, I pulled my feet close and spread my arms out to find equilibrium. When I stopped moving, what little of my weight that wasn't held by the water rested on the dark floor.

Far away, the distant world was a blur of streaks of white, blue, purple, and dull-hued blobs. I had seen this before. My lungs had restored to screaming in tones of scalding stabs. I could ignore them a bit longer; their base function an easily ignored survival instinct. Here, even my mind was calm and comfortable. I could stay here, just sit embraced by the water. Why shouldn't I?

Shielded from the noise of the world was the closest I had ever felt to belonging. Yet, the noise also called to me. It bid me to make a place where none existed. There might never be a spot where I fit, but there was a romance to a crowd that didn't know I existed but also revolved around me.

No, I wouldn't stay today. Rabbit still needed to be found. Pushing off the bottom of the pool, I began to ascend back to the lights and sound.Â 
My gasp for air drew a few surprised looks but granted me no lasting attention. Thinking about climbing up the edge of the pool brought nothing but stinging pain from head to toe. So, I paddled to the shallow end to stand in the crowd. I swayed through the dancers, hips and chest conducted by the cycles of melody. At the ramp, soaked through, I left the pool. The DJ gave me a nod as I passed, and I returned the gesture.
I tracked puddles of water across the floor as I returned to the locker room. Back in the mirror, I observed the makeup was unmoved, and my hair didn't look anywhere as bad as I had expected. Locks were a little flat and limp but mostly in place. My outfit was doing me no favors. Smudged, stained, drenched, and in a few unexpected places, close to ripping.

Encroaching on the edge of the mirror was the marked locker. The crown spray painted on it matched that of the crown carved on the coin in my hand. A faint link was all that was needed to justify investigation.
The lock keeping the door shut was bulky. Where one would expect the tumbler plug for a key to be was only a simple slot. The coin fit it but required a bit of effort to push in. Once inserted, the coin produced a loud click, and the shackle snapped open. The lock was carefully put on the bench. When the door swung open, the doors above and below it, which had been ajar, swung open too, revealing a single tall storage space. An outfit somewhere between a formal outfit and a ballet leotard hung in the expanded locker. The shoulders and waist were accentuated with feathering. Each piece of fabric, possibly real feathers, was narrow, long, structured but soft, and hued somewhere between dark gray and black. As I pulled the outfit out, the fluttering feathers made not a sound. It had no tags, but looking at it, something in my brain said it was my size.

The thought proved accurate as I exchanged my basically ruined clothes for the outfit. At the bottom of the locker, I found my sneakers, complete with orange-brown stains and streaks of tar. They didn't quite fit the outfit, but they would still do. Then I noticed that the locker didn't have a back, wall replaced with an open yellow glow. Squeezing through the locker ignited new crushing aches in my chest.

--------------

Moving through the locker to the room on the other side felt like waking up from one dream into another. The cream-colored walls, the patterned linoleum floor, the off-white, powder-coated ceiling tiles, and the annoying humming fluorescent tube bulbs all gave me a deep-seated disorientation. The unmanned doorways led to rooms that appeared to be complete replicas.Â 

Speakers wedged into the corners played a bit-reduced tune. Drums created a subtle, steady, and relaxed pattern. A variety of instruments was represented by an array of tones and slight variations in beeps. The bass was clearer than I would have expected out of the overall lo-fi-styled music.

The next room proved to be exactly the same, along with the one after that and the one that came after. Room after room was just a cloned iteration of that first room. The only thing that changed was the location and number of doorways.

If the song had changed, I couldnât tell; one verse blended into the next with only the occasional bar that demanded actual attention. It, along with the murmur of the fluorescent lights, started to give me a headache.
For a moment, I gave up. I sat down. I first tried to cross my legs under me, but a cutting heat reminded me that was a bad idea. Leaning back on my hands took enough pressure off my chest, and I could almost breathe freely. Despite how comfortable I got and how calm the area was, I was starting to panic. My thoughts were loud and fast. My heart was beating with an intensity that was trying to break through my chest or leap from my throat. I was losing time. Outside, the festivities were carrying toward an inevitable conclusion without me.

âIs this going to take long?â A harsh feminine voice said, jarring me out of my thoughts. The speaker was a tall woman in matte black tech wear accentuated with straps, pouches, and buckles. The soles of her combat boots glowed. Her hands were clasped behind her head, the gold wristband she wore the only other color in her outfit. She strode in from one of the doorways I hadnât gone through yet.

âYou know what you signed up for,â some older man entering behind her answered. He was shorter than the woman, but like her, he was in a custom set of tech wear with a gold wristband. Cans of spray paint hung from his belt.

âHow are you already jaded?â a woman with a deeper voice asked as she trailed in. Her voice was muffled through what I could only describe as a thin motorcycle helmet. A fourth person leaned on the speaking woman. The two walking together shared their style with the other two, gold wristbands included.

âShe just wants to get back to licking Monarchâs chair,â the fourth added. As he spoke, the thin mask covering the lower half of his face illuminated with an audio visualizer that painted the sound of his voice. The four masked people who followed the group seemed smaller in comparison. They looked much more alike to each other, their clothes of a lower caliber than those of the initial four as if they were just cheap imitations.

âLetâs see here,â the first woman said. She crouched down in front of me. She sat on her heels, supporting her elbows on her knees. I could now see that on her clothes, blocky white text across a few straps and on the corner of pockets read âTROUBLE.â

âForgive her; sheâs a bit new,â the older man said, standing nearby, making pointed eye contact. The text scattered across his clothes was âGUIDE.â

âThey donât need to know that,â Trouble remarked, briefly glowering over her shoulder.

âWonât do them any good,â the helmeted woman said. She was labeled âHOLYâ along with what I guessed to be kanji as part of the text.

âStill, not necessary information,â the last said as he took his weight off of Holy. The only text on his attire was a single line, âBX-05S,â on the collar of his coat. Trouble pinched the bridge of her nose.

âIâm just going to start over,â Trouble mumbled.

âYour show,â Fives said, mask flashing with each syllable. Troubleâs hand dropped back down, and she forced a warm and subtle smile.

âWelcome,â Trouble began. âSorry weâre late, but weâre ready to start your trial now. Thanks so much for stopping by.â Trouble stood up. Before I could fully register the statement, the four assistants were pulling me to my feet. Trouble stepped back to stand among her cohorts. Silken bands tied my ankles and wrists together.

âWhat are the charges?â I finally protested.

âItâs your job to convince us there are none,â Fives said.

âIâve done nothing wrong,â I insisted. The four judges held their thumbs up for a second.

âLetâs start with something simple,â Trouble said. âWhy are you here?â

âI was invited.â

âEveryoneâs invited,â said Holy. All four held their thumbs up for another second.

âWhy did you follow the invite?â Guide asked.

âCause I like to dance and enjoy a lot of electronic music.â A silence followed my answer, filled only with lo-fi and noisy lights. Trouble, Fives, and Holy held their thumbs up. Guide held up a thumbs-down. Immediately, my body responded to a sudden, intense stimulus. Everything tensed, no matter how much it hurt. Electricity lashed at the small of my back and spread out to every nerve. One of the assistants had jabbed a taser against me. When it was removed, I tried to fall to my knees, but the four assistants kept me standing. Trouble looked at Guide, who only nodded.

âPlenty of places can satiate those desires. So why here?â Trouble crossed her arms.

âI wanted to spend time with Rabbit.â At this, the judges discussed through looks. Lo-fi beats counted down to the moment the judges held up their thumbs.

âWhy Rabbit?â Holy asked.

âCause they seemed nice, and theyâre cute.â Two, three, four. A whole bar of simple meter of music passed. Trouble and Guide voted no, Fives and 

Holy voted yes.

I thought I was ready. Pain and I were not strangers, especially tonight. Experience had been graciously provided by Guideâs first ânoâ vote. It would still hurt, but like sitting through a tattoo, knowing and mentally preparing would help, right?

I was wrong.

My head jerked to the side and stayed there, even as it felt like the vertebrae in my neck were about to shatter. I thought part of my spine had managed to break when one of the teeth in the back of my jaw chipped loudly, the sound echoing in my skull. I couldnât process the all-encompassing assault. My brain was trying to turn off, but my panic kept it awake. I truly feared what verdict the tribunal might make if I passed out. So, between brief plunges into numb darkness, I was hit with fresh waves of electrically induced suffering. When it ended, I hung there between the grips of the masked attendants, none of my posture under my own power.

The convened waited for me to regain myself, though Troubleâs fidgeting made it clear taking too long was not in my interest. I spat the displaced chunk of my tooth onto the floor, where it landed with a wad of pink blood-infused spit.

âDo you need the question repeated?â Fivesâs mask gave shape to his question.

âNo.â I stared forward without giving any of the four judging me particular focus. âI wanted to spend time with Rabbit because I like the way interesting people who find me interesting makes me feel.â The room soaked up the words. All four approved of that response.

âYou go out often?â Guide asked.

âYes.â My answer got approval, though Guide and Holy hesitated.

âHow often do you go out?â Trouble asked.

âThree or four times a week, as often as I can manage when thereâll be a large enough crowd,â I didnât want to risk being perceived as withholding information. The effort was rewarded with another unanimous thumbs up.

âWhy do you go out so often?â

âItâs a chance to meet people.â I had provided my canned response without consideration. I was so used to answering the question my tongue and lips moved automatically before my slowed rationality could stop them. Trouble laughed as she led the four in a unilateral ânoâ vote.

I do not have the language sufficient to describe that answerâs punishment. I was enclosed in a vice. I felt like a giant bruise, every inch of me a raw, exposed nerve touched to a needle. My vision cracked and twisted like a screen in a blender. I couldnât remember anything outside the pain. The pain was all I had ever known and all I would ever know. My subconscious offered the easy out: just let go of consciousness and cut to black. I didnât. I donât quite remember what thread I clung to in order to stay aware, but I do recall at least appreciating that of my flirtations with death; at least this time, I liked how I looked.

âHuh, looks like they will get another chance,â Trouble commented as she nudged my own foot with hers before stepping away again. I grimaced but didnât actually feel anything.

âTake your time,â Guide said, voice raised for me. Despite the assurance, I didnât feel time was mine to take.

âI go out because the glamor of it all is the only thing that gets close to the crippling intensity of reality. Reality is far too mundane for how loud my feelings are.â I couldnât look up from my feet. A shallow pool of blood had formed under my terribly battered shoes.

âHow did you get that outfit?â Trouble asked.

âI earned it.â A stutter of my weight had the tranquil crimson on the floor shiver and quake. I waited, familiar pains returning as my body acclimated. My extremities were fading into the buzzing pinpoints of numbness. Moving my head felt like rotating a mechanism that was off its track. The judges had huddled together. They appeared to be talking, taking turns gesticulating. Their voices were hidden by the lazy, faux-relaxing tones still creaking through the corner-mounted speakers.

âWell,â Trouble announced as the four separated. Her expression was disappointed. âWe have determined that while you shouldnât be here, weâre not sure where you should be.â

âWhat does that mean?â

âMeans you pass by default,â Guide said.

âCongrats, I guess,â Holy commented. Trouble was still moping. Their assistants were starting to undo my soft bonds. My will was the only thing keeping me standing now.

âCome on,â Fives said, hooking his arm through Troubleâs. âKill the Feed should be playing soon.â Trouble began to grin again as she let Fives lead her from the room, the other two following shortly after. A door shut behind them. The attendants left through the archway behind me, leaving a door that had not been there before ajar.

Across the room was a red door with a golden nob. The frame was so black that it appeared to not exist, like some error in reality. One bloody footprint after the other was tracked toward the red door. I took as deep a breath as my stinging chest allowed and pushed through to the next room.

--------------

I was met by a symphony of eyes. While I'm not sure why, anytime I think of that room, I think 'reverse theater.' There were two raised parts; a narrow walkway around the door and a congregating area on the other side of the room. Steps on either side and in the center of the raised floors led to a recessed floor. I was isolated, standing in front of the door, and apparently demanded the attention of the crowd gathered on the far side of the room. Chandeliers made this the best-lit room I had seen all evening.

I didn't notice the room at first, though. The first thing I noticed was Rabbit. They were standing by a chair placed at the very center of the platform, in front of the middle set of stairs. Their eyes widened when they saw me.

In the pit stage, a couple performed on a padded table. They panted and moaned through the exaggerated motions of copulation. The two appeared amid the most immaculate euphoria, with the man hunched over his partner, grabbing at her hip and at the table by her head. In turn, the woman's arms swayed and stretched; she pulled at her hair and grabbed at her partner's shoulder.

I could tell it was all a lie. From behind, I could see the man's limp penis hanging useless between their bodies. They were doing their best to conceal it. They were soaked in sweat that occasionally dropped onto the table and floor.

Besides the two performers, there was one other person who did not immediately look at me. A woman with long black hair that was far too neat and smooth to not require hours of attention a day. Her makeup was sharp and shockingly beautiful on her already naturally attractive features. Her eyeshadow matched the bright red tint of her dress. Over the dress, she wore what I would have guessed was a vintage commander's cavalier jacket complete with epaulets and golden ropes that looped under one arm, except it was far too vibrant to be entirely vintage. She sported no wristband. She was slouched over in a beat-up, high-backed leather chair. On the fading crimson leather, a golden grown had been painted on the back; it currently hovered well above the woman's shoulder. This had to be Monarch. Her green eyes remained on the performers even as she commented.

"Tourists aren't supposed to be here," Monarch said. The male performer grabbed the woman by the hip and yanked her closer, her back squelching over the padding.

"I was invited," I declared. The woman grabbed at the man's thighs, and I could see her nails dig into the straining muscle.

"By who?" Accusing green eyes finally turned to me. The man grabbed both the woman's wrists and held them above her head.

"Them." I pointed at Rabbit. The woman wrapped her legs around the man's waist, restricting his feigned thrusting. Monarch only briefly glanced at Rabbit.

"You still don't belong here," Monarch accused. The man rocked his body back and forth with such force the woman was pushed and pulled against the table, her hair growing wild.

"Who ever truly belongs?" I asked as a means to dismiss. The female performer pulled her partner down by her and, with a twist of her waist, put herself on top.

"Here?" Monarch straightened in their seat, the painted crown hovering just over their head now. "Those I say belong, belong." The man grabbed his partner's hips and forced her to roll the pelvis faster and faster; I could see his meek phallus bouncing between exposed pussy and the table.

"That's a bit one-sided," I said, a statement punctuated with a creased brow. The woman pushed down on her partner's chest, each twist of her waist pushing him back down into the failing cushioning.

"If it is?" Monarch crossed her legs. The male performer reached up and pressed his palm against the woman's neck. A red wristband hugged tight around the flexing forearm.

"It's a bit of a personal feeling to belong, isn't it?" I questioned of Monarch's question. From the table came an obviously inflated moan, the woman pushing her sternum up against the man's hand.

"Irrelevant and impractical." Monarch's beautiful features were becoming frighteningly fierce. The smack of skin echoed from the man's hand, re-finding purchase against the woman's neck - fingers constricting.

"Impractical?" My head tilted to the side. The woman tried to moan but coughed. Her nails dug into the man's wrist.

"Those not wanted don't belong," Monarch's lips began to twist into a smirk. Heavy breaths arose from the performers, no pattern among the gasps that refused to match the groans of the frame they fucked on.

"So I can't belong here?" The skin around the straining hand began to darken. The woman leaned down closer to the man.

"Why would you?" Monarch looked on the verge of laughing. Hips bucked wildly, shaking the performers and their crude stage.

"I always manage to find a place," I shrugged. It was more or less accurate. The woman's breath was coming slow and croaking. Her hands clumsily slid around the man's face.

"So you belong nowhere?" Monarch was smiling wide. Sitting straight with her head inclined back, the crown fit her maniacal presence. The man added another hand to the woman's neck.

"I belong anywhere." Consciously, I stood straight and held Monarch's gaze. My lips retracted into a thin line. A sour note echoed from the table as the man screamed along with the squish of his eyes; the woman's thumbs had pushed firmly into the orbital cavity. He released her neck so she rolled off the table onto the floor. The woman's gasps of fresh air came with earned freedom.

Monarch clapped, and small doors on either side of the recessed pit opened. From the doors came people in red suits with metal masks that looked like anguished faces. The suited stagehands gathered up the performers and their table and then forced them out through the pit doors.

"Yet you've come here," Monarch remarked once the stage was clear except for a few splatters of blood. "Step forward," she said, gesturing for me to approach. While I initially hesitated, I eventually complied and took the steps into the pit, careful not to overly agitate my injured foot. Monarch leered down her nose at me. "Now, Interloper, who of us gets to decide you belong?" Only with the luxury of hindsight, I get to say that suited figures emerged back onto the stage.

"Neither of us," I began. Monarch snapped her fingers, and gloved hands seized me by the elbow and wrist on either side and with no resistance, they put me onto my knees.

"I can be forgiving," Monarch cooed as she leaned forward in her seat, crown constantly aligned with her head. "Would you like to try again?"

"Belonging must be built-"

Monarch rolled her eyes. "Stubborn," she stated, gesturing at the stagehand on my right. They forced my arm to where I could just see my hand, but clearly, it was brought forward more for the crowd's benefit. I glanced over at Rabbit, the only person looking away. Then, pressure. Something squeezed at the base of my pinky finger. I spun my head to watch the stagehand pull a red zip tie tight around the vulnerable digit. "Again?" Monarch offered.

"You can't alone dictate fellowship."

"Interloper, you think belonging is about fellowship?" Monarch actually laughed, a cold, hollow sound. She gestured at the stagehand, who pulled the zip tie tighter. The plastic pushed in on my skin, and I could feel my heartbeat in my palm, trying but failing to move blood through the finger that was quickly growing numb. "Everyone here belongs to me," Monarch spread her arms to indicate the crowd around her. "Toys do not need to fit together," A wave to some unseen maestro brought in the sliding harmony of strings. From where the music came, I still can't say. The occasional stutter during the prelude, with the insertion of mechanical clicks and a kick drum, indicated that the piece had been remixed and more was to come. I recognized the piece but couldn't name it; it was one of those old Russian composers whose names I could never remember.

"So I don't belong 'cause I'm not your plaything?" I asked. The pressure in my throat made it hard to swallow.

"Not my plaything yet." Vibrant fingernails traced through the air in time with the drifting melody that was losing sharpness to give space for a swirling bass sound. The zip tie was pulled tighter. My spine quivered as the skin around the base of my pinky began to tear, blood starting to pool around fresh lesions. Pain was digging into my hand from every angle, body urging reactions I couldn't muster.

"And what if I was?"

"Was what?" Monarch acted perfectly ignorant. Another tick tighter. Over frantic notes, a kick drum began to bore through the mix, a suite of synths rising to meet the strings. Blood was starting to trickle down my hand and trickle to the floor. My pinky was turning blue, or maybe black; it was hard to be sure in the frenzy of that stagnant panic.

"What if I belonged?" I asked, unsure what I was actually getting at anymore. Monarch laughed. Tick. My temples felt like a vice was clasping around my head as my labored breathing began to feel insufficient.

"Even if I had the words, they'd be insufficient for you, I suspect. How do you describe a cage to a bird? Even one that gives them safety and food?" My scream drowned out the zip tie pulling tighter. I was certain the plastic was starting to rip at muscle, though none of it could be seen under the ichor that seeped from the wound. My entire hand was growing numb except for the bolts of pain that buzzed on my nerves, jumping from spot to spot.

"You clip the wings till it understands," I muttered on a failing exhale.

"What was that?" Monarch asked, leaning forward in their seat. I looked up to meet their malicious and hungry gaze.

"You clip the wings," I stated, knowing full well nothing good hinged on my answer. Monarch scoffed, and a definite crunch resounded from my hand. I don't know if it was audible in the room or just through my body. My pinky tilted at an irregular angle, but somehow, it was still attached. The music transitioned into a soft bridge, a muted drum roll complementing the chopped-up composition.

"And what if the bird complains?"

"I don't know," I admitted.

"I have the authority of experience." Monarch leaned back in their seat, one leg crossed over the other.Â 

"I know enough," each syllable was punctuated with a gasp for air.

"You? You know what?" A single violin held a shaky, tenuous note. I took a deep breath to rush through the statement before the nerve left me.

"People are not birds." Monarch did not appreciate my criticism. The music dropped into a rapid movement, jumping to a minor version of the original key.

Crack.Â 

Crack.Â 

Pop.

Splosh.

My pinky finger fell to the floor, and blood poured down after it. Somewhere in the pile of crimson-purple viscera was a zip tie that sometimes the blood settled enough to leave a part of it peeking through.Â 

I felt unsteady, even held firmly there on the ground. The room was spinning, and I wanted out, but consciousness already threatened to leave me as waves of fiery pain burned through my hand and up to my shoulder, eating at muscle and bone.Â 

"I need a drink," Monarch announced.

The anguish-masked stagehands were joined by those wearing weeping masks. They lowered me from the resolute grips that allowed the anguished to leave the stage. The weeping assisted me in sitting; I wasn't sure if I was on the ground or in a chair. The music that soaked the room shifted to a polyphonic mode as strings and synths chased a light melody accompanied by a firm throbbing bass. My world felt worn through, like the knees on a pair of jeans about to rip open. The weeping were tending to my hand with medical supplies pulled out of metal boxes. Through the muttering of those gathered around Monarch, I saw Rabbit, who stood with shoulders hunched by the throne. In their hands was a glass of orangish, not-quite-amber liquid that they stared at and spun slowly between fingers. My jostling arm drew my attention; the weeping were trying to scrub up some of the dried and caked blood that had dripped down to my elbow. The weeping all had a red wristband on both wrists, and seeing them next to my soaked one, it struck me how the spattered and soaked accessory was now more red than black. Among Monarch's crowd, stagehands with masks of joyous expressions carried trays of drinks or mirrors of powder.

The stagehands then brought me to my feet and tried to turn me toward one of the stage exits. I didn't have the physical strength to resist but resist I had to. "Hey," I yelled loud enough that even the music resorted to whispering.

"Still here?" Monarch asked, head canting to the side so it looked like the crown was sliding off her head.

"I belong," I stated, pulling my arm away from one of the anguished and holding up my blood-soaked wristband.
