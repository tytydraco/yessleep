I never ended up calling Alina.

I just sat in that diner, wrapped in fluorescent buzz and cheap linoleum, watching my coffee go cold.

Outside, the night pressed against the windows like it was waiting for me to blink first.

I hadn’t moved in hours. Hadn’t slept.

Then my phone buzzed against the table.

The notification blinked on-screen—sharp, simple, and wrong.

**Return route complete.**

The words glow against the screen, stark and impersonal.

"Return route."

My breath sticks.

I drove here. Didn’t I?

I open the app. A pale blue path is traced across the map. From this diner... all the way home. Footsteps logged. Distance counted. Every step accounted for.

Eight-point-three miles.

My stomach tightens into a knot.

Hands trembling, I press **Call**.

Alina’s name lights up the screen.

She answers on the second ring.

“Hello?”

Relief floods my chest. Her voice is warm, familiar. Solid.

“It’s me,” I whisper.

There’s a pause. A silence that stretches, just long enough to hurt.

“I think you have the wrong number,” she says.

The floor beneath me drops.

“What?”

“I don’t know you,” she snaps—brisk, irritated. Like I’ve interrupted her day.

A noise rattles faintly through the speaker. A dull thump, like something shifting in the background. Then—silence.

The call ends.

I stare at the phone in my hand, my own reflection warped in the black glass.

I call again.

Voicemail.

I leave too much money on the table, hands clumsy, and shove out of the booth on legs that don’t feel like mine. The cold outside punches the breath out of me. I drive with white-knuckled fists clenched around the wheel, the world passing in a blur of night.

The apartment door creaks open under my hand.

Alina is in the kitchen. She stands with her back half-turned, cradling a mug, steam curling toward the ceiling. Her posture stiffens when she sees me.

“Where have you been?” she asks. Her voice is taut—tired, but edged with something softer. Concern.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I manage. “Went for a walk. Sorry.”

She watches me carefully, lips pressed thin. Then she exhales, and the tension leaks out of her shoulders.

“You should’ve told me.”

It’s almost a scolding. Almost.

I open my mouth, hesitate, then push the words out anyway.

“Did you call me? Around three this morning?”

Her brow furrows. “What? No. Why would I?”

I hold out my phone. My thumb hovers over the log.

“There was a call. Blocked number. Around 3:12 a.m.”

She leans closer.

And freezes.

“What is it?” I ask.

Her face has gone pale.

I follow her gaze.

The number isn’t blocked anymore.

It’s mine.

The call came from my own number.

I can’t breathe.

“You said I left my phone here,” I whisper. My voice sounds far away, like I’m underwater. “This morning. You said... you found it here.”

She nods slowly.

We turn, together.

There it is. Sitting neatly on the nightstand.

My phone.

Exactly where I left it.

But I’m already holding mine.

A silence crashes down, thick and suffocating.

I move first. Fingers numb, I reach for the one on the stand. It’s warm. Real. Too real.

I lift the phone in my hand. Press redial on the incoming call.

The line rings.

Only one phone vibrates.

The one on the nightstand.

The one in my hand stays cold. Still.

Alina backs away, her breath coming shallow.

Then—she grabs her own phone and dials my number.

We both watch.

Only one rings.

The one on the stand.

The other... doesn’t even blink.

My heart is a hammer in my chest.

I take the fake—*my* fake—and without thinking, march to the window. I hurl it into the dark.

A sickening crack splits the silence.

Then—my phone vibrates.

**New update.**

I don’t want to look.

But I do.

**Mileage confirmed.**  
**Trip logged.**

The app shows a path from the diner. Straight here. As if I’d just arrived.

But I was here.

Wasn’t I?

I never went anywhere. I never—

I stagger back as the weight of it presses down on me. My brain scrambles for footing.

And then Alina’s phone buzzes in her hand.

She stiffens. Her eyes meet mine.

A call. Blocked number.

She hesitates, then answers.

“Hello?”

The voice on the other end is wrong. It’s not even a voice—just a low, garbled murmur. A static-laced hum of something that wants to be speech. Like a person drowning mid-sentence. Like a language breaking apart in real time.

I see the color drain from her face.

And then—

She speaks.

“I think you have the wrong number.”

The words hit me like a bullet.

The same ones. Word for word. Her voice matching the recording in my head.

Her eyes widen, horror blooming behind them.

She hears it too. Realizes it too.

That she said those exact words to me.

But she didn’t remember.

Until now.

Her phone slips from her hands. It hits the floor and shatters.

The call ends.

Silence.

Then—my sleep app refreshes.

**Mileage confirmed.**  
**Trip logged.**

The line moves. From the diner.

To here.

As if I’d just arrived.

Again.

I bolt for the door.

My car is gone.

I open the GPS app.

It’s still at the diner.

Still parked in the same space I left it in.

Only—I’m here.

And suddenly I know.

**I never left.**

I was never supposed to.

But I’m standing in my apartment. Aren’t I?

I turn.

Alina is gone.

The kitchen is empty. The mug is gone. The room feels wrong—*tilted.* Off.

I step toward the balcony door. Crack it open.

Cold wind slaps my face.

And that’s when I smell it.

Damp. Mildewed. Like rotting drywall. Like water damage in an abandoned crawlspace.

And then I see it.

The view outside.

It isn’t my street.

It isn’t our building.

I’m looking out over Ridgeview.

The ruined complex. Boarded windows. Collapsed balconies.

Long-abandoned.

Cursed.

My breath catches in my throat.

I’m not home.

I never came [home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l70ag5/my_sleep_app_says_i_walk_miles_every_night_but_i/)
