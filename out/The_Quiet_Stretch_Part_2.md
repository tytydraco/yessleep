Upon entering the empty highway, I immediately applied the brakes. I didn’t want to head any further. I wanted to turn around. I looked into the rear-view mirror, and it showed a hitchhiker, donning a hoodie and standing near the road, gesturing. I immediately stepped down from the truck and looked around, once, twice, thrice, but there was no one. The toll plaza was no longer behind me. There was only an endless highway, dimly lit by an unseen light source, stretching forward without variation.

I had no option left but to travel ahead and find an exit, any exit. I climbed back into the truck and started driving again. Fear accompanied me, and it wore the shape of the hitchhiker. He was still present in the rear-view mirror, motionless, as if the mirror were a camera displaying a live feed. Throughout the drive, I wasn’t just scared. I was confused, sweating profusely. The truck produced no sound, as if it were an electric vehicle, only quieter. I realized then that the silence wasn’t accidental. It felt selective, as though certain things were being taken away deliberately.

Meanwhile, my habit took over. I tried honking in the same pattern as before. It was a reflex rather than a decision. The horn didn’t make a sound. That was when I understood that it wasn’t just the truck that had gone quiet. Sound itself was no longer behaving the way it should.

After what might have been several miles, I saw someone standing right beside the road, gesturing in the same way as the hitchhiker in the mirror. I had no choice but to approach. He was wearing a hoodie, looking in the opposite direction. I slowed the truck and reached the spot, and what sent chills through me wasn’t the hitchhiker ahead of me, it was the fact that the rear-view mirror now showed nothing, just the empty highway behind me.

I couldn’t fathom the behavior of the road or my surroundings. The hitchhiker remained still, unmoving. I didn’t know whether I should step down or not, and something within me resisted the idea entirely as my heart raced. After a brief, frantic conversation with myself, I decided to leave him where he was and not disturb him.

I pressed the accelerator and tried to move past him. Nothing happened. I tried again, still nothing. Even after the tenth attempt, the truck refused to move. I had no option left but to step out. The road hummed unusually beneath my feet, vibrating with a low, unnatural intensity. It wasn’t loud, but it was persistent, as though it had replaced the sounds that should have been there.

I slowly stepped towards the hitchhiker, who remained frozen and completely unmoving. I walked past him, and then he moved. He avoided eye contact and said nothing at all. He simply began walking towards the truck, climbed in, and sat beside the driver’s seat. As he did, I noticed his chest rise slightly, as if to breathe, and then stop halfway, frozen in a failed attempt at something human.

Right after he sat down, a new image appeared in the rear-view mirror. It looked like a gas station, very dimly lit, with a truck parked beside it. That probably meant my next destination was a gas station. Meanwhile, the hitchhiker released a faint humming noise, as if he were mimicking the road, the highway itself.

His throat produced an inhuman vibration, and I could feel it beneath my seat, through the very frame of the truck. I dared not ask anything. My heart was already in my mouth, and I didn’t want to collapse right there by doing something stupid. I didn’t want to attract his attention. But something within me was still curious, desperate to know if he was human, if he could respond to a question.

After half an hour of complete silence, I dared to break it. “Hello,” I said. “Sir?” He didn’t respond. He continued humming, frozen, his gaze locked onto the rear-view mirror. Moments later, it wasn’t his silence that unsettled me most, it was the fact that I didn’t hear my own voice when I spoke.

Even my own voice wasn’t audible to me. I wondered if the transition from the normal highway to this one had deafened me. The thought deeply unsettled me. It no longer felt like coincidence. First the horn, then my voice. Whatever this place was, it seemed to strip sound away in layers, leaving only what it wanted to keep.

Something within me was quite certain now that asking again wouldn’t be a good idea. It didn’t matter anymore. I couldn’t hear myself, and the silence felt profoundly wrong. His humming was the only sound tearing through the quiet. The truck, which normally vibrated because of the engine, now vibrated because of him. That hum convinced me he was less than human. A normal person would need to pause to breathe. He didn’t. He wasn’t breathing at all.

It was taking me more than courage to live through all that. I was constantly cursing my decision of having become a truck driver. It felt like I was lured into that job by the universe itself, as though this road had been waiting for someone like me to notice it.

Just how a normal trucker would, I looked to my right. What happened next made me keep my head straight ahead for the rest of the route.

Looking to my right, I could see a road being built in real time. It stretched far beyond what my eyes could follow. A truck, moving with the speed of a jet, came hurling towards me. Terror seized me, and I immediately looked ahead again, accelerating fully. To my surprise, my head movement caused the approaching truck to disappear, along with the road itself.

I tried looking again for a fraction of a second. The highway rebuilt itself in unison with my vision. I immediately looked straight ahead. That was enough. I understood then that this place responded not to movement, but to attention.

That meant I mustn’t look to my right or left. Although I had no courage left to test the left side, only a fool wouldn’t understand that it had to work both ways.

Meanwhile, the hitchhiker hummed constantly, adding to the unease relentlessly. My heart hummed in unison, not with rhythm, but with fear. The gas station was still visible in the mirror, and so was the truck parked beside it. This time, its brake lights were on.

After another hour of driving, an hour that felt like an eternity, I could finally see the gas station ahead. It appeared faint in the distance, surrounded by fog. If it weren’t for the red lights of the truck standing near it, I might not have noticed it at all.

Right upon touching the gas station’s boundary, there was no need for me to stop the truck. It stopped on its own. The gas station’s image vanished from the rear-view mirror, confirming that the mirror didn’t show what was behind me, it showed what was waiting.

I looked at the hitchhiker. He was still staring ahead, as if waiting for me to move first. I took out a cigarette, not out of craving, but because I needed something familiar, something ordinary, to anchor myself to reality.

I lit it. The smoke didn’t drift. It remained static, suspended in place. Then the hitchhiker moved. His body resisted itself, as though something unseen dictated how far and how fast he was allowed to go.

He snatched the cigarette from my hand. The gesture stirred something in me, an echo of familiarity I couldn’t place. I knew I had seen that movement before, but the memory refused to surface, leaving behind only unease.

He stepped out and began running towards the truck parked at the other end of the gas station, the cigarette still in his hand.

Immediately, another truck came hurling out of the darkness. The hitchhiker tried to make way, but at an impossible speed, the truck struck him. He was thrown upwards, still rotating slowly in the air, suspended rather than falling. A powerful hum followed, one that lingered far longer than it should have, vibrating through my bones.

The truck vanished into the darkness as abruptly as it had appeared. The body did not fall. It remained floating, rotating gently, as if held there by the same force that governed the road.

I walked towards the parked truck. The moment I climbed inside, I didn’t need to see anything else. The scent told me everything. It was Martin’s truck. My legs weakened before the thought fully formed. Only then did the realization hit me, the hitchhiker had been Martin all along. Tears rolled down my face as his body still hovered above, unreachable.

I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t understand why Martin hadn’t spoken, or why he never looked at me. I didn’t understand the hum, or whether it had been him, or the road, or both.

The next moment, I looked into the rear-view mirror of Martin’s truck. It showed a truck speeding towards me. And I understood, with a certainty that made my chest tighten, that the road was not finished with me yet.
