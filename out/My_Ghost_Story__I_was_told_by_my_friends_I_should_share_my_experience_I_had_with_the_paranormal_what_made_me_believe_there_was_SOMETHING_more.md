So when I was 19 I was a hardcore militaristic atheist, I grew up in a very Christian family and youth years were hard. I laughed at anyone and everyone that was spiritual and believed in anything beyond the sciences. I was on my second year of a probationary term and very depressed and cynical in life obviously.  
I was just nonchalantly reading up on topics about wiccan rituals, pagan witches, etc. just out of boredom and curiosity after watching a Sean Bean movie about the black plague. I didn't have anything in life to really lose so I humored myself and did some research and found translated ritual scripts from the grimoire "The Lesser Key of Solomon". I used reddit and whatever else resources / urban sites to learn about ritual circles and the best time to perform them. I just wanted life to be better.  
So I saw that I was not far off from a night with a blood moon in 2014, I bought the things I needed and just waited because if I wanted to even believe in this a CRUMB I wasn't going to fuck anything up. Every part of the method had to be precise for me.  
I ended up setting up in my sisters' room at like 6pm because she had a large floor space and the room I was staying in was just bed and desk space, not even close to what I needed. She was still out or gone for the day so I had plenty of time.  
The ritual had me set up a circle with the white candles, pretty standard, and write down my ambitions or wishes on a piece of paper marked in blood. So I just did a thumb print onto a drop on it because it seemed reasonable I guess. I didn't have just any blood to use of course and I didn't think anything of it, so I just used my own blood. (biggest mistake I believe)  
I did the ritual as described. I thought I did everything right, I don't know if I did or didn't, maybe I didn't close the circle or say goodbye correctly. I didn't know anything about the practices. Afterwards I felt nothing and I just assumed that it was bunk, I was upset but not surprised and cleaned up the mess and went about my evening before sleeping.  
For at LEAST 6 days after this I had the same exact recurring dream turned nightmare.  
  
It was a first person perspective dream, just like I was in this place. It was this old European style village, the year could have been somewhere between 1700 and late 1800's. It was foggy, abandoned. I would walk past barricaded village homes and abandoned shops. In the dream I would always pass this white oak tree with a circle of stones around it. I passed this shed that had a barricaded door and one of the only things I had seen with an open window, but broken glass. Finally going to turn a corner I spotted someone else, and I was shocked and in a bit of awe. It was a feminine figure, as I looked more I saw that she was standing towards an old shop window. I could not see her face through the long black hair but her white gown was tattered at the bottom like she had walked miles in it. As I stared I don't know how much time had passed, especially in a dream state, but in a quick moment she turned her head towards me fast and it seemed so menacing, then came towards me. I ran and backtracked all I could in fear through the foggy village and I finally found that shed I had seen earlier, I jump through the window every time and bar the wooden window shut that it has. As I'm in the almost pitch black shed I start to hear a ringing in my ears, I assumed that I must have cut myself somewhere from the window glass. I look for a lantern, matches, or torch, anything so that I can see in here and assess my body. I manage to feel around and get a lantern on. I don't hear the ringing anymore and I don't seem to have any cuts on my arms or stomach which is surprising to me, so I don't think much more of it, maybe it was just fear.  
I'm looking around this shed and it's exactly what you'd expect to be in a shed, old rusty tools, farming equipment, some old hammers and rusty nails in opened boxes. As I'm looking around my oil lantern starts to die. The ringing comes back and I'm feeling/searching for more oil and trying to get the lantern back on fast. The ringing becomes DEAFENING and when I finally get the light back on there this feminine figure from earlier is. The ringing is coming from her agape mouth in my face, at least 3 times wider than should be humanly possible. I wake up in a cold sweat at least the first few times.  
After having this nightmare 6 to 8 times, on the last night I have it & everything is exactly the same, except when I'm looking for light in the dream I can't find it, and the ringing is so loud I decide to wake myself up out of fear. And she's there above my face in bed. It sounds INSANE yeah but this was when I was 19 and sober on probation. I get up as FAST as I can and I'm tripping and fall towards the light and I turn it on with my heart beating a million miles a minute and nothing is there. And I grab my phone fast and leave the room to go downstairs, I turn all of the lights on in the living room and look at the time, it's past 2am, probably like 2:40am. I figure it must have just been another nightmare or sleep paralysis but it seemed so real I don't go back to sleep or my room. I just watch my phone and TV until daylight in the safety of the living room light.  
  
The day passes fine and I'm basically over it and everything is cool, but after dinner my mom mentions that when my sisters were sleeping in her room they both swear they saw a figure that looked womanly standing in the corner of the room and my heart drops to the bottom of my chest. I don't bring anything up for a long while and keep it to myself. But when I would sleep in my room I never felt like I was alone anymore, and it sounds silly but for weeks I would plead and apologize quietly out loud for disturbing whatever I did, because I constantly felt uneasy. When I did bring it up to my sisters at least a week in they said that it seemed nice, like benevolent or at least neutral to them because I assume now they didn't do anything to it/her.  
But after awhile into those weeks of the pleading turned into soft talking out loud I feel like I was forgiven at some point, maybe months after. Sometimes even years after this I would close my eyes and still see her silhouette in the long center of my eyelids.
