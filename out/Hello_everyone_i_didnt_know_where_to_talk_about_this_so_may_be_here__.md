A few days ago, I took a walk in a place that had become a ruin.

The wooden floor, emitting the smell of mold, is not unpleasant to me. It's just that the atmosphere of a house that has lived is still there. That's how it begins.

I find a spiral staircase, illuminated by a flashlight, the only source of light that night. I climb to the only floor of this dwelling.

What a pleasure to be alone in this isolated cave. Despite the austerity of the place, I feel light.

A "modern" wooden door in design stands at the top of the stairs. The lower hinges are destroyed, and it stands only by a miracle.

I gently caress the door with my left hand, leaving deep marks in the wood, as if cut with a machete. These scars do not stop my curiosity.

My lamp is no longer needed. A wide beam of light filtered by dust comes through the door.

Does someone live isolated here?

I push the door with my finger, afraid of destroying it permanently after the assaults of the past. It is tired, this guardian; it deserves tenderness.

It opens; no creaking. The top hinge holds up. How many more passages will it survive?

It gives way to a kind of plastic floor. The original color must have been a sort of pink ceramic, now yellowed by time and probably tobacco, whose scent is still present.

Boxes litter the floor; some are affixed to the wall along the shabby corridor before me. When suddenly, one of the boxes is pulled to the right. It slides with a hiss and disappears from my field of vision.

My heart accelerates. I am not alone; I know it; I see it.

A shadow, huddled, slightly protrudes from where the box had disappeared.

A breath escapes my knotted throat. The shadow heard it. It rises instantly to reach two meters. The mass of shadow has been disturbed. "Damn."

After a few seconds of a silence that evidently tried to tear my aorta, my consistency evaporated. A hello or a good evening could untie the situation, who knows?

He rushes to the left of the room; impossible to distinguish anything other than a black mass. The clatter of steel, a braking train would seem inaudible now. What is he doing? Putting away pots with boxing gloves? What's happening?

My curiosity, as much pricked by curiosity as my nostrils by the sticky air, directs me towards the lair, finally more amused than worried. This excess of amusement would be paid for.

So here is my host, the face barely visible, hidden behind the loophole that was his long dirty bathrobe.

Finally, I see his face. A man, he has no age. He doesn't need it, like his teeth, which have also been missing for a long time. I know because he wears a smile. He invites me to sit on a heap. A heap of what, I wonder? Impossible to know. And then, it is not polite to criticize people's interiors when invited!

On the fire, an old pot boils. Are there seaweeds? It looks like it, anyway.

It looks a bit like his face too, between pockmarked and wrinkled but with more color. He, he doesn't have it anymore.

He grabs a handful of seaweed, puts it on a diaphanous paper, delicately rolls it. Is he rolling a cigarette with seaweed tobacco? Then he stuffs it into his gullet. "Oh well, he won't light that." Then he takes it out between his two fingers. "Oh well, it's going to be even harder to light it there," he hands me his "cigarette." The paper holds up well, but seaweed and saliva get along wonderfully and apparently try to escape from the packaging.

I politely place it on my knees, thanking him. I don't want to offend him, let alone upset him. He miraculously lights his own, and I feel good. The cigarette gently falls apart on my knees; he knows it, and he doesn't mind.

The alarm clock rings; the sun has been up for a while. It's already warm.






 I've been having strange dreams lately, this is one of them ,
Have a nice day everyone, take care :)
