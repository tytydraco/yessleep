Last month, my little brother was hit and killed by a drunk driver while walking home from a friends house at night.

After about a half an hour of waiting for him to get home so we could all eat dinner together, my mother went from angry, to concerned and went out to look for him. She found him crumpled in the street, his legs twisted to an impossible angle.

The driver was found a few blocks away, he had hit a tree and totaled his car. He died on impact, robbing us of any closure we may have had.

My brother was only 10, and my only sibling. Our father had walked out on us before  my brother was even born, leaving me at the ripe age of 7 as “man of the house”.

For the first week or so, my mother wouldn’t say a word, she would pass by me in the hallways like a ghost. The only indication I had that she was still alive, was the ever growing pile of empty vodka bottles I found in the trash, and her banshee like wailing she tried to muffle with a pillow late into the night.

It was hard to see her like this, she was all I had left for a family and I wasn’t about to let her drown herself in liquor like the man that killed my brother.

I came up with a plan to hopefully start the healing for her. I went to the store and bought a pack of balloons, dark blue, my brother’s favorite color, and I went home to begin writing letters to him.

I managed to catch my mother in between one of her many trips to the kitchen to freshen up a drink, and told her my plan- to tie letters to balloons and send them up to heaven where her son would get them.

She faltered for a second, then immediately picked up a pen and began writing a message in cursive, and left a lipstick kiss at the bottom like she would on all of his birthday cards. When she was done, I folded our letters in half to tuck them into an envelope, and tied it to the balloon freshly filled with helium to send up to the clouds.

This went on for a few days, until one of the balloons came back.

I had just headed out the door for school and found myself face to face with a blue balloon. At first, I thought it was a hell of a coincidence that it managed to float its way right back down to our house, until I checked letter and saw it was addressed to me and my mother.

I quickly grabbed the balloon by the string and ran inside to show my mother who was still asleep in bed. After shaking her away and showing her the envelope, her jaw dropped and with trembling hands, she opened the letter.

We read, and re-read it probably a dozen times until my mothers tears began to blot the paper. It was undoubtedly my brother’s handwriting we were looking at on the page, even some words were misspelled the exact same way he would. After the initial shock and tears began to die down, me and my mother went back to the kitchen table to begin writing another letter to send.

That night I couldn’t sleep, I tossed and turned for hours thinking about what my lil bro might write back about. What was heaven like? Are angels real? I had so many questions I crammed into the last letter that I desperately needed answered.

It was probably about 3am when I made the decision to just go outside and wait on the porch for the balloon to gently float down and greet me. I was lost in my thoughts, heavily day dreaming for awhile when I was abruptly snapped out of it by what felt like an earthquake.

I grabbed onto the porch railing for support when I noticed a hole beginning to open up in front of me on the grass, and something floated out of it. Suddenly, the shaking stopped, and the hole closed up almost as fast as it had appeared. I walked over to whatever came out of the earth and my heart sank.

It was a blue balloon with another letter attached.

I bit down on the inside of my mouth to try and keep from crying as I read the simple two word message on the letter.

“Ha ha.”

I haven’t told my mother about this yet, but I don’t know if I can keep it a secret for long either. If any of you have ever experienced something like this or have any idea what to make of it, please let me know.
