I was house/pet-sitting for my next-door neighbor/friend, Angel, while she was in Hawaii. She’s a widow, and I was just taking care of her two cats and elderly Yorkie. All I had to do was feed them, play with them, clean the litter box, etc.. Pretty simple.

Then, while she was still gone, her dog passed away. I called her, did what needed to be done, and put him in the freezer like she asked. That night, after everything settled, I went out to the back patio for a smoke. Around midnight, I started packing up my stuff, turning out the lights, and getting ready to head home.

And then I heard it.

A bark. But not from a dog. A man’s voice.. like someone was imitating a dog.

I stopped, turned around, and looked. My house is to the left of Angel’s, there’s a vacant house to the right, and behind her place is another house with motion-sensor lights. No one was there. Then I heard it again.

Once. Then twice.

It sounded like someone was standing just on the other side of the fence, messing with me. The barking got louder, more frequent, like whoever was doing it was having way too much fun scaring me. And the weirdest part? It didn’t feel like a person. I don’t know how to explain it, but something about it was just wrong.

That was all I needed to nope the hell out of there so I ran. The barking got louder as I booked it, but the second I reached the front yard…silence. I didn’t stop until I was inside my house. My husband calmed me down, listened to the whole thing, and said it was probably just some idiot playing a prank. I wanted to believe him, but I was still freaked out.

Fast forward a few days, I was outside smoking with my mother-in-law, and I randomly brought it up. Told her the whole story. She barely reacted, just nodded and said, “Oh, that’s Rex.”

I was like, “I’m sorry, what?”

She explained that Angel’s late husband, Rex, used to bark at her from over the fence as a joke. The next day, I told Angel, and she confirmed—yep, that was definitely something Rex used to do.

I still won’t go back there alone at night. 

I still catch myself thinking about that night, replaying the sounds in my head and wondering if it really was Rex. It’s one thing to hear a strange noise, but it’s another to learn that the exact thing you heard was something a deceased person used to do.
I haven’t had another experience like it, but every time I’m outside alone at night, I can’t help but listen..half-expecting to hear that bark again but hoping I don’t. 

00000/10 would not recommend hearing a ghost bark at you in the middle of the night.

Has anyone else ever experienced something auditory like this? Heard something that shouldn’t be there? If so, I’d love to hear your experience.
