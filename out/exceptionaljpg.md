Everybody seems to have one of those stories. The ones that seem implausible, and yet due to the conviction in their faces and tremble in their voices while telling it… you have no other option but to believe them. My whole family had a few of these. My dad would always tell about a time when he was six… his family vacationed at a beach house and he had a disturbing nightmare about the woman from the living room painting murdering him. But after he woke up, he went to the dining room only to hear his older sister recount having the exact same dream… exact and detailed down to every single event in the nightmare. My mom would always mention my grandmother’s house being haunted, and would tell of the time she woke in the guest room and saw the shadow of a woman making her way to the connected bathroom. However, one story completely intrigued me. I must’ve been around seven when this happened… sometime in late 2009. My older brother had been using his computer well after his curfew when he had gotten a strange email. 


My brother said that the email, while being in English, didn’t really make much sense. He described it as if it was written by someone who knew English but not how to structure a sentence. His recollection wasn’t perfect, but he stated that the email went something like this.

And attached to the message was a picture titled “exceptional.jpg”. My brother didn’t go too into detail about the contents of the picture aside from a short “it was kinda creepy”. But the reason it always interested me was because shortly after having opened the message and picture, my brother had sent it to one of his friends. My brother had said this friend stopped showing up to school. Not long after, the message made its rounds throughout his school… some kids stopped showing up, and the school had a perfectly timed assembly about online safety.


For a few years, this was all I was able to go on regarding the story… but something about it kept poking at the back of my mind. It felt like an old CreepyPasta made up on 4Chan, something about it felt so familiar… but every attempt to search for “exceptional.jpg” led me nowhere. These minor searches were infuriating, as the way my brother told the story felt like major chunks of it were missing. I just needed to know the origins and validity of this story, I needed the holes in the story to be filled. My brother had always told me to never search for it, but I needed answers.


Recently, the story had been eating at the back of my mind again after having been back at my mother’s house for her birthday. Me and my brother had gotten to talking about scary events again… and exceptional.jpg had gotten brought up again. But like always, the way it was told felt like he had been intentionally keeping details from me. The vagueness he described the picture with kept eating away at me… “yeah, it’s kinda creepy / it’s hard to remember details, I remember it being dark / it was a long time ago, it was just creepy from what I remember”. And yet his face was holding back abject horror whenever exceptional.jpg was brought up. But I should’ve taken the vagueness as a hint, a red flag… there’s a reason my brother left out details, there’s a reason it doesn’t show up on Google, there’s a reason you don’t look for exceptional.jpg.


Two weeks ago, I was still searching for mentions of it. Google searches didn’t provide anything, scouring Reddit didn’t do much either. I was about to totally give up on my pathetic search for a potentially fake story my brother made up to scare me… until I registered what I was seeing. A notification… an email.

Attached was a file titled “exceptional.jpg”. I almost didn’t know what to do. This thing that I’ve been searching for for years had finally fallen directly into my lap… but a nagging feeling came with it. “Don’t open that file” I kept thinking to myself. Every fiber of my soul all of a sudden started screaming at me like a primal response to something being wrong. And you’d think that millions of years of evolution to warn you about danger would help you to make the right decision… but on occasion, curiosity kills the cat. Clicking on that file made my hair stand up on end like a cat arching its back. But I was almost disappointed in what I witnessed, I had built the picture up in my mind to be a lot worse than it was. That wasn’t to say it was all sunshine and rainbows though, there was still an air about the picture that’s nearly indescribable… it felt otherworldly, it felt… wrong.


In a weird way, I felt validated in receiving the email… finally knowing it wasn’t entirely made up as a sibling prank. But still, I couldn’t get it out of my head, why couldn’t I find anything about this picture and email online? Why does it seem to just… not exist? Even seeing my brother’s old yearbooks just increased my curiosity… in the jump from Freshman to Sophomore year, a solid ⅓ of the kids were no longer in the yearbook. Even though I received exceptional.jpg, I still wasn’t satisfied… I still didn’t really believe it was anything but a CreepyPasta in all honesty… a rather obscure but local one. But it’s true nature would be made clear to me not long after receiving it. That night, I had gone to bed earlier than usual. It didn’t usually take me long to sleep, so I was passed out within a matter of minutes. It must’ve only been a few hours when I was awoken by something. I couldn’t quite tell what did it at first… until I realized that my walls were reflecting bright lights… so I had turned around in my bed to face my desk. That’s when I realized that my computer had turned on and the light from my monitor had woken me. But it wasn’t until I sat up in bed that I realized what my monitor was displaying… exceptional.jpg.


I turned my computer off and had gotten back into bed… only to be thrust awake to the same situation not even thirty minutes later. Computer sounding like it’s about to take off like a plane, bright monitor lights, and the looming presence of exceptional.jpg plastered over my monitor screen. I had turned my computer off and gone back to bed again, thankfully this time without being disturbed in my sleep again. The next morning was pretty awful, as I was tired to hell and back. I came to the conclusion that opening the file had given my computer a virus, so I started to run some anti-malware program in hopes that that would get rid of whatever I infected my pc with. I scrolled through my phone as I waited for the program to do its thing, and that’s when I noticed it… a voicemail. It didn’t look like I had received any calls overnight, leaving my stomach with a strange feeling. I opened the voicemail only to be greeted by two seconds of what sounded like faint rustling… almost like somebody accidentally recorded a video with their phone in their pocket. I found it weird, but that strange feeling in my stomach didn’t go away when I looked at my computer screen… “No malware detected.”


I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very off that whole day. Paranoia grabbed ahold of me, I approached every corner of my house as if someone was waiting for me on the other side. I ran into rooms and shut the doors as fast as possible as if someone was coming at me from the darkness of the hallways. It all had to do with that picture, the more I thought about it… the more the details didn’t sit right with me. I wanna refrain from acknowledging the picture’s contents but I feel like I have to give at least some description. The picture simply contained a hooded, faceless figure in front of an enveloping black background. But it was something about the over exposure, something about the emptiness… just something about that picture kept popping up in my subconscious. 


I somehow managed to sleep that night despite the onset of paranoia. But that wouldn’t last as not even an hour after falling asleep, the sound of my computer and light from my monitor jolted me awake. It taunted me, plastered across my monitor as I apprehensively turned my computer off. But as soon as I got back in bed, the bright lights lit up the room again. When I got out of bed to turn the computer off, that’s when I noticed it. I had been sent another email.

I didn’t have much time to comprehend what I was reading before my mother started calling me. It was 2:26 in the morning. I apprehensively answered the call… but I was met with roughly ten seconds of silence. That was until I heard what faintly sounded like my mother… but she was repeating my name over and over again. After asking her if everything was fine, she stopped calling my name. “Just do it, your brother did it too.”


I was completely confused by what she meant. But at the same time, it didn’t really sound like her… it sounded like somebody doing an almost pitch perfect impression but just missing something… emotion? A soul? Purpose behind the words? Something was missing. I hung up, and turned my computer off, but I couldn’t get those words out of my head as I tried to sleep. I had awoken the next morning to find my computer and phone flooded with hundreds of the same exact messages…. “It’s not patient! It is exceptional! It is not patient! Spread the message:(“. All of these messages were followed with increasingly distorted and altered versions of the original picture… but one caused that primal panic… the hooded figure was no longer present. In the back of my mind, everything started to connect and the things I didn’t want to believe kept coming to the forefront of my mind.


I messaged my brother and asked him about the kids who stopped showing up to school. He asked me “Why did you go looking for it, I told you not to.” I understood then. I didn’t want to, but that thing made its presence known, filling up every corner of my mind… threatening me… demanding to spread its message… I couldn’t take it. It’s been a week… I’m assuming my brother didn’t spread the message… no one knows where he is.


Do not go looking for exceptional.jpg. There’s a reason you won’t find it mentioned anywhere but here.
