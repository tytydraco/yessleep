The remote and long-abandoned mining town of Bodie, California was once a booming hub of activity during the gold rush days of the late 1800s. Located in a remote valley east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Bodie sprang up seemingly overnight after the discovery of gold in 1859. Thousands flocked to the town seeking riches and opportunities. Saloons, shops, homes and mines popped up rapidly as Bodie's population swelled to over 10,000 residents in just a few short years.  
  
However, by the early 1900s, the gold had dried up and the town was in decline. The mines closed, businesses shuttered and residents moved on to other towns with more promising prospects. Bodie was eventually completely abandoned by the 1940s, with buildings and belongings left exactly as they were. The town was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and left in a state of "arrested decay" as a preserved ghost town.  
  
And it seems some of Bodie's former residents never left the town, even after death. The spirits of deceased miners are said to still roam the chilly streets and abandoned buildings to this day. Visitors have reported seeing the apparitions of shadowy figures wandering the roads late at night, peering into broken windows or slowly making their way towards the old mineshafts. Some believe they are the ghosts of miners who perished in accidents still trying to find their fortune. Others say they are merely the residual hauntings of spirits continuing the daily routines they followed while alive.  
  
Eerie sounds have also been reported coming from the grim Bodie cemetery on the outskirts of town. Creaking noises emerge from the rickety funeral wagons dotting the graveyard. Howls and cries seem to float on the wind. Gravestones shake and move on their own, as if restless spirits are trapped beneath. And in the middle of the night, phantom lights flicker and glow between the worn wooden crosses marking forgotten graves.  
  
Those who wander the streets of Bodie typically do so during daylight hours only. Locals strongly advise against exploring Bodie at night when the phantom miners are said to come out and claim the town for themselves once again. Spirits lurk in every shadowy nook and cranny, guarding the place they once called home in life. Attempts to stay overnight often result in terrifying poltergeist activity and violent threats from the ghostly inhabitants who do not take kindly to visitors overstaying their welcome after dark.  
  
Jake Scofield was one such visitor who chose to ignore the warnings. He was a blogger who investigated supposed haunted sites all across the country. Jake figured spending the night recording Bodie's ghostly phenomenon would make for a great Halloween video on his website.  
  
Arriving on a late October afternoon, Jake strolled through the town snapping photos while sunlight still bathed the crumbling buildings. He made sure to capture shots of the abandoned homes, general store, saloon, and mine entrances gaping darkly against the mountainside. As the sun sank lower in the sky, Jake hurried to set up static night vision cameras around what he already determined would be prime ghost hunting spots after scouting the area earlier.  
  
By 9 pm, Jake was ready. He parked himself in the middle of the dusty road running through town. Turning on an EMF meter to measure electromagnetic energy, Jake called out loudly, "Hello, my name is Jake! I come in peace to this place. I'm here to gather evidence of your existence! Please show yourselves to me tonight!"  
  
Only the slight rustling of leaves answered his call. Jake knew ghosts tended to take their time making an appearance, if they appeared at all. He had several hours before sunrise to document any paranormal findings. Settling on an overturned crate, Jake took out his digital audio recorder and began asking questions aloud that any spirits nearby could respond to.  
  
"What is your name?" Pause. "How did you die?" Pause. "Are you trapped here?" Jake went on like this for nearly two hours. But besides the occasional flickering needle on the EMF meter, there seemed to be little ghostly activity stirring.  
  
Around midnight, Jake's drooping eyes snapped back open when a sudden loud BANG made him jump. It sounded like a rock hitting one of the buildings down the street. Jake leapt up, peering into the darkness, but saw nothing.  
  
"Hello?" he called tentatively. "Did you make that noise? Please do it again if you want to communicate with me."  
  
Silence. Jake was just beginning to think it was only the natural settling of the old wooden structures when a screeching GROAN filled the air. Jake's skin prickled with goosebumps as the unearthly cry died off.  
  
"Thank you!" Jake said excitedly. "Can you make another-"  
  
CRASH! The deafening sound of shattering glass came from the second floor of the saloon down the road. Adrenaline pumping, Jake began jogging towards the building. But he only made it a few feet when the front doors of the saloon suddenly slammed shut with a resounding BANG. Jake stopped short. Cold dread trickled down his spine. The air around him felt charged, pressing down with unspoken warning. This didnâ€™t seem like the usual harmless ghosts looking to communicate.  
  
Jake slowly began backing away down the street. "O-okay, I don't want to intrude here. Thank you for showing yourself, I'll just be leaving now until daylight when I can finish my-"  
  
An explosive SMASH right behind Jake made him whip around with a choked cry. One of his static cameras now lay in pieces on the ground at his feet. Before Jake could react, the EMF meter was torn violently from his shaking hand, sailing through the air to smash into the side of a building.  
  
Jake turned and ran.  
  
The chilling sound of disembodied laughter seemed to echo all around him. More glass shattered, buildings creaked, heavy footsteps pounded. Jake sprinted out of the town and didn't stop until he reached the safety of his car parked half a mile down the road. Only once the doors were locked did Jake finally let out the breath he'd been holding in sheer terror.  
  
As dawn broke, Jake drove to nearby Carson City and booked a flight home, having captured no ghostly evidence but vowing to never again stay overnight in the haunted town ruled by its phantom miners after dark.
