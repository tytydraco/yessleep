**Origin Agency:** ███████ Anomaly Eradication and Containment Facility (AECF)  
**Document Status:** UNREDACTED COPY — SOURCE UNKNOWN

# SUBJECT DESIGNATION

**Anomalous Entity 111 (AECF-111)**  
**Threat Classification:** OMEGA–PERSISTENT  
**Containment Status:** FAILED (See Incident Logs)

# OVERVIEW

AECF-111 is a humanoid entity exhibiting continuous emission of unknown radiation without observable biological degradation. The subject does not register symptoms consistent with radiation poisoning and appears physiologically stable despite output levels exceeding lethal thresholds.

Initial encounters suggest AECF-111 is **not the source** of the radiation, but rather a **conduit**.

# PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

* Height: Approx. 211 cm
* Build: Human male, average physique
* Skin: Pale, discoloured; phosphorescent glow observed in low-light conditions.
* Hair: No hair
* Eyes: Emit faint white luminescence during elevated radiation output
* Clothing: Civilian attire fused to epidermis (material unidentifiable)
* No visible protective gear, implants, or augmentation detected.

ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES

Emits sustained gamma and beta radiation at fluctuating levels

Radiation intensity increases during emotional distress

No detectable radiation decay over time

Proximity causes:

Cellular degradation

Neurological damage

Spontaneous equipment failure

AECF-111's Oral cavity is capable of anomalous expansion, with the maximum recorded horizontal extension measuring between 33 and 36 cms during radiation spikes. No corresponding skeletal deformation is observed during this process.

When normal, AECF-111 possesses a humanoid facial structure fixed in an abnormally widened expression resembling a human smile. The corners of the mouth extend unnaturally toward the auricular region, giving the appearance of a permanent grin. Facial musculature appears rigid, and the expression does not change in response to external stimuli.

Notably, radiation dispersal does **not** follow inverse-square laws. Intensity remains consistent regardless of distance until a sudden drop-off occurs at unknown thresholds.

Direct physical contact with AECF-111 results in immediate and catastrophic multisystem trauma. Initial exposure induces acute neurological disruption, including severe cortical hyperexitation, loss of motor coordination, and rapid onset of nociceptive overload. Subjects remain fully conscious during the early and intermediate stages of exposure.

Within minutes, AECF-111 initiates localised biological consumption beginning in the abdominal region. Imaging and post-incident analysis indicate that the entity preferentially targets gastrointestinal tissues, mechanically degrading intestinal matter while simultaneously increasing localised unknown radiation output. This radiation accelerates cellular breakdown, causing rapid necrosis and liquefaction of surrounding soft tissues.

As the process continues, internal organs undergo progressive dissolution, transforming into a semi-liquid, necrotic substance of unknown biochemical composition. Despite extensive tissue failure, cardiovascular and neural activity persist far beyond survivable thresholds, suggesting that AECF-111 inhibits systemic shutdown mechanisms.

Subjects report extreme, sustained pain responses until higher neural function collapses. Death typically occurs only after near-total internal liquefaction, at which point the remaining biological matter is rendered nonviable.

# DISCOVERY LOG

AECF-111 was first identified following a mass-casualty incident near **███████ Nuclear Research Facility**, ██/██/20██.

Responding teams reported:

* Melting of vehicle shielding
* Geiger counters maxing out within seconds
* A single individual walking away from ground zero

All personnel within a 300-meter radius expired within 72 hours.  
AECF-111 remained unaffected.

# CONTAINMENT ATTEMPTS

Multiple containment strategies were deployed, including:

* Lead-lined isolation chambers
* Remote drone surveillance
* Subterranean confinement

All attempts failed.

During Containment Attempt ██-C, AECF-111 reportedly spoke an unknown language.

>

Containment site was abandoned after spontaneous radiation surge rendered the area permanently uninhabitable.

# BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS

AECF-111 demonstrates:

* Signs of guilt
* Avoidance of populated areas
* Attempts to isolate itself

When approached, the entity consistently warns responders to retreat.

No hostile intent observed.

# INCIDENT 111-DELTA

On ██/██/20██, AECF-111 disappeared from satellite tracking.

Last transmission captured from an unmanned drone shows the entity standing at the edge of ███████ Desert, radiation levels peaking briefly before dropping to zero.

No radiation signature has been detected since.

# CURRENT STATUS

AECF-111’s location is **UNKNOWN**.

Several global radiation anomalies recorded in the past six months match AECF-111’s signature.

Correlation under investigation.

# CLOSING NOTE

You were not meant to find this.

If AECF-111 is still active, containment is no longer the objective. ERADICATION is.
