I had fallen asleep while sunbathing on the beach.
Who hasn't had that happen to them at some point?
Such a common occurrence shouldn't be of any importance, right?

As soon as I regained consciousness and still with my eyes closed, I heard the waves crashing hard against the rocks to my left. In the distance I could hear children shouting and laughing on the shore while their parents advised them not to go too far away.

I felt the scorching sun on my skin, completely soaked in sweat, and the unpleasant touch of the sand packed between my toes.
At that moment I felt the urgent need to get up and take a dip to cool off. But something strange happened then.

As much as I tried and as incredible as it seemed, I was unable to open my eyes. My eyelids now felt extremely heavy and unable to open simply at my will.

With my heart racing, I sat up to try to force them open by applying pressure on them with my fingers, but it was no use.
I screamed. I did it over and over again with all my strength hoping that someone would come to my aid. But when my voice broke as I screamed for the umpteenth time without anyone answering my call for help, I knew that all my efforts were in vain.

I cried for a few minutes, unable to shed a single tear.

Faced with this strange situation in which I found myself, I understood that the most sensible thing to do was to calm down and pay attention to my other senses. Maybe that way I would be able to understand what was happening to me.

My agitated breathing returned to its normal rhythm and I sharpened my hearing to try to hear what was happening around me.

I must admit that the overwhelming silence that now enveloped me made me shudder like nothing had ever done before.  The sound of the sea and the murmur of the people around me a moment ago seemed to have been locked away in a soundproof chamber.
I then realized that the stifling summer heat had also disappeared. A sudden chill shook my back as I felt the icy air now digging its sharp fangs into my skin.

My trembling hands tried to grab onto the sand where they had previously rested, but it had also evaporated, leaving a void around me.
Unable to bear it any longer, my mind escaped for a moment from this nightmare to maintain sanity and took refuge on that idyllic beach.

Without any effort, I could see myself sitting there looking at the horizon while the sea breeze caressed my face and swayed my hair.

I heard the people around me talking about trivial things again. I listened to a boy telling his friend how his team had won the game last night by a landslide.  Also, two teenage girls were talking about how handsome the lifeguard looked.

I felt the sun warming my cheeks again and the smell of salt perfuming the air.

It was really comforting to remember that wonderful day at the beach before the roar of the machines that keep me alive shattered it once again.

Forcing me to relive the terrible car accident I suffered that same day after falling asleep at the wheel on the way home.
