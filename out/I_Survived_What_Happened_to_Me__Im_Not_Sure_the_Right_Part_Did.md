I’m writing this because people don’t ask me *how* I’m doing anymore.

They ask if I’m still conscious.

Not directly. They circle it. Doctors check my pupils too long. My sister says my name like she’s testing whether I’ll respond. Friends pause after I speak, watching my face, waiting for something behind it to catch up.

I answer everything correctly.  
My name. The date. Where I am.  
I laugh when it makes sense. I apologize when I’m supposed to.

No one looks relieved.

The police were the first to say it out loud. A wellness check, they called it — which is what you do when someone else thinks you shouldn’t be trusted alone with your own mind. They stood in my doorway and asked if I remembered what happened.

I said yes.

That was a lie. I just didn’t know it yet.

One of them asked, “Are you thinking about hurting yourself?”

I said no.

Another lie. A better one, apparently, because he nodded like I’d passed.

When they left, I locked the door and realized my hands were shaking so badly I couldn’t feel the key.

My phone was full of messages from people I hadn’t talked to in years.

*You’re alive.*  
*Thank God.*  
*Please don’t ever do that again.*

I scrolled until my chest went tight, until I found the message from my sister sent three days earlier.

**"They pulled you out of the water."**

I stared at it until the words stopped meaning anything.

I don’t remember water.  
I don’t remember panic.  
I don’t remember wanting to die.

What I remember is waking up yesterday morning, brushing my teeth, and thinking — very clearly — that something important had been deleted.

Not forgotten.  
Not repressed.

Removed.

Like a tumor you don’t feel until you notice the scar.

I went to the river to prove everyone wrong.

It smelled like metal and rot. The current moved faster than it looked, violent and impatient. I leaned over the railing and waited for fear, memory, anything.

Nothing came.

Instead, my phone buzzed.

A text from an unknown number.

**"You weren’t supposed to come back yet."**

I dropped the phone into the water and watched it disappear without feeling a thing.

That’s when I understood this wasn’t about memory loss.

This was about *replacement*.

At home, I found the folder on my computer. I know it had always been there. I also know I had never seen it before.

**"READ THIS BEFORE YOU PRETEND YOU’RE FINE"**

Inside was a video.

The person on the screen was me — but his eyes looked used. Like he’d seen something and it hadn’t blinked first.

“If you’re watching this,” he said, “it means I couldn’t do it.”

He laughed softly. It didn’t sound human.

“I don’t mean dying. I mean *living after*. You need to understand that.”

He leaned closer to the camera.

“There’s a point where the mind refuses to continue. Not shuts down — *steps aside*. I found a way to let it.”

My throat hurt. I realized I hadn’t swallowed in a long time.

“I didn’t want to forget,” he said. “I wanted to stop being the one who remembered.”

The video cut off like he’d been interrupted.

After that, the messages changed.

“You don’t flinch anymore.”  
“You used to hate the sound of running water.”  
“You don’t say her name like you mean it.”

I started checking myself in mirrors, looking for glitches. I still cried sometimes. I still laughed. I still felt hunger, pain, warmth.

I was human.  
I was conscious.

But everything hurt in the wrong places.

My sister finally said what no one else would.

“You came back,” she whispered across my kitchen table. “But you didn’t come back *alone* last time.”

She slid her phone toward me.

A recording. My voice, shaking.

*If this works, don’t tell him why I did it. He won’t survive knowing.*

That’s when the memories started leaking.

Not the event. Never the event.

Just the weight of it.

Just the certainty that whatever I saw made staying alive feel impossible, and forgetting feel like the only malfunction left.

I wasn’t created by accident.

I was installed.

A continuation without the infection. A version that could wake up, pay bills, answer questions, and keep the body moving forward.

The system didn’t fail.

It worked perfectly.

I am not broken.

I am the part of me that stepped forward when the rest begged to be erased.

So yes — I’m still conscious.

I’m still human.

I just exist so the part of me that drowned doesn’t have to remember why he let go.

*And every night, when I dream of the river, I wake up knowing I’m only alive because I let the part of me that mattered stay underwater.*
