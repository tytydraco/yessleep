[\[Part 33\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1j80v9l/the_call_of_the_breach_part_33/)

We skidded over the long grass, the thick tires of our ASV gouging at the mushy soil. The radio headset blasted with multiple fervent calls shouting over one another as our vehicles did their best to swerve out of the path of the oncoming Wyverns. Gunners began to fire into the sky with their various weaponry, but the beasts had taken us by surprise and closed the distance in seconds.

Razor sharp talons slashed at the earth where our armored car had been not moments before, and the Osage Wyvern soared right over our heads, letting out another titanic roar that reverberated in my chest.

Chris’s face had turned pale, his knuckles sheet-white from how they gripped the steering wheel, and Peter swore loudly from the back seat. Jamie worked to crank her gun turret around, firing with the coaxial machine gun, but couldn’t rotate it fast enough to keep up with the flying menace. These Wyverns were bigger than the ones I’d seen in the wild outside of the Breach, and as they arched away to circle for another pass, I glimpsed the vague outline of humanoid figures astride their bark-scale necks.

*Bwwwooonnnggg.*

Trees crunched, snapped, and toppled as bright white lights flooded the plain from either side, enormous angular shapes skittering out of the forest. They closed in as the Osage Wyverns readied for another pass, and my throat tightened in primal fear. I knew these creatures, knew them all too well, and few other things in this bizarre new world frightened me half as much as an Echo Spider.

*“We’ve got more skinnies pushing in from the north!”* One of the mercenaries called over the radio, and I could just make out the newest wave of Puppets charging out of the tree line, rank upon rank of grey-skinned fiends with their crude weapons held high.

White eyes fixed on us without the slightest hint of uncertainty in them, they screamed in delight as the Puppets advanced with their characteristic wide grins. Soon we would be completely surrounded, and I no longer felt safe within the armored hull of our ASV. Vecitorak had been preparing for this, seemed to be one step ahead of us in everything, and there was still at least a hundred yards between our vehicle and the concrete tower. My plan had begun to deteriorate before my very eyes, and a sick dread churned in my guts as I clung to the steel support of my seat while the ASV careened further into the morass.

*There’s too many of them, we’ll never make it out. How can there be so many? What if there isn’t an end, what if the Breach just keeps making more until we run out of ammo, and then . . .*

I looked out my viewing port in time to see jaws and talons swoop toward me, and the blood turned to ice in my veins. “On our right, on our—”

*Wham.*

Like we’d been struck by a gigantic sledgehammer, the ASV was thrown off its wheels to roll over and over in the marshy grassland. The seatbelt dug into my lap and shoulder with strained tightness, my helmet bounced hard off the bulletproof window to send stars before my eyes, and the front shroud of my Type 9 floated up to smack me in the lip with the sight hood so that I tasted blood. I heard Chris shout above the clanking of metal, Jamie’s voice crackled through my headset, and then our vehicle slammed down on its back in a soft patch of muck.

The force ripped the helmet off my head, snapping its leather chinstrap so the Cold War surplus bit of steel dropped away to the ceiling that was now a floor. My submachine gun swung from its sling a few inches from my face, and I blinked against the dizzying sensation of blood rushing to my head. I could taste it between my teeth as well, a split in my lower lip weeping trickles of coppery red fluid that oozed across my mouth to drip onto the ceiling below me. Shudders ran through the hull of the overturned vehicle, familiar jerky steps that coincided with the screech-thuds that echoed outside. Gunfire continued unabated as our forces drove in a wide circle to press the enemy back, engines roaring past us in a big loop as the fight wore on. Swinging a few feet below my head so that it brushed the ASV’s ceiling, my headset dangled from its connection cord on my radio, and the faint cries of our species at war crackled through the speakers in between a growing cascade of static. It seemed the Breach was making short work of our comms, and soon we would be utterly devoid of radios altogether.

*We have to get out of here.*

Wriggling in my seatbelt, I craned my head to look for my friends in the dim interior, the pulse in my temple growing in pressure from my inverted position. “Guys? You there? Is everyone okay?”

A figure crawled to me out of the shadows, an eerie sight in that they would have been on the ceiling had I been right-side-up.

“Watch your head.” Jamie grunted, and her knife gleamed in the dark as she slashed my seatbelt strap.

I managed to catch myself in the fall, sparing my head and neck from what would have been a nasty bump. Instead, I landed on my hands, arms, and then face, my legs collapsing behind me in an ungraceful heap. My submachine gun clattered down beside me, the stock hitting my right elbow just right to make the entire arm tingle. Another set of hands kept me from smashing my kneecaps off the radio mount, and the familiar strength of two muscles arms pulled me upright.

“You’re bleeding.” Chris probed at my lower lip in the murky shadows with his thumb.

“I’m fine.” I looked where I knew his eyes were in the darkness and remembered the first time we’d had such a conversation. “After all, it’s not my first crash.”

“We’ve got company inbound.” From behind the seats, Peter’s voice growled low as he crept for the armored door. “Gunports are blocked by the mud, so we’ll have to make a run for it. Someone help me open this.”

Jamie crawled to one of the few windows not pressed into the soft terrain and bent low to squint out at the battle raging all around us. “Riken’s circling the trucks in the middle of the field. Most aren’t far off, maybe a hundred yards or so. If we stay low, maybe we can get to them.”

Chris and I wriggled into the main compartment to join them, and began to gather supplies from the jumbled interior, mainly ammunition and the few additional weapons our vehicle had been loaded with. Just beyond the steel armor of the ASV, I could make out the shrieks of mutants running by, the *thunk-thunk* of bullets ricochetting off our downed vehicles, and the incessant pounding of the cold rain. Engines roared by as a few of our convoy who hadn’t made it to the protective ring of vehicles floored their accelerators in a bid to reach safety, and I groped in the ebony blackness for my radio headset.

My heart sank as I slid the speakers over my ears and caught nothing but the harsh grating of static.

*We lost signal that fast? I charged it before I left. The battery should have lasted twice this long . . . the Breach’s energy must be off the charts to flatline them so quickly.*

Another terrible realization flitted through my mind as my fingers brushed the protective headband that rested atop my ears. These too relied on electrical power, and even if shielded by the talented engineers of ELSAR, they couldn’t stand up to the Breach’s radiation for long. Once they failed, the minds of my friends would be open to Vecitorak’s power, and our army would be as good as dead.

*Creak.*

The door handle gave way at last, Chris and Peter shoving it open with all their strength, enough that Jamie and I could slither under the gap on our bellies.

For the first time, I felt the rain on my skin, the mud under my hands and knees, the wet grass brushing my face, all for real. No longer did I see it through another’s eyes or memories; now it was my experience, a visceral jolt of fear and macabre wonder as I emerged from the wrecked armored car into the gloom. No light pollution dotted the horizon from any distant cities, and I imagined there weren’t any in this desolate place, at least not ones inhabited by normal humans. There were no stars to be seen, no moon between the dense curtain of black clouds that seethed and boiled in the sky overhead like a witch’s brew, shattered only by the long bolts of eerily colored lightning. Huge trees made up the forest that ringed the enormous clearing, towering pines, crooked maples, and knotted oaks. The air smelled of rainwater, the stagnation of a swamp, and mold. Old leaves blew in the howling wind, the tall grass swayed around us like arcane worshipers in some ritual dance, all centered around the overgrown coal tower. A rush of emotion flooded my brain for just a moment, as if the very atmosphere had feelings of its own, a multitude of human sensation gathered over decades from countless victims. Rage, confusion, pain, loneliness, fear . . . it all languished in the dripping forests of this cursed place, waited for something, some looming fate that rested beyond my sight on fate’s horizon.

“Contact!” Jamie raised her AK and spun around to send a burst into the night.

Drawn by our movements in the rainy abyss, a cluster of three Puppets charged our way, their primitive weapons at the ready. Even in the shadows, I could make out the bloody strands of human scalps tied to their spears, axes, and clubs, one of them wearing a severed human jawbone on its hide belt. Their white eyes glowed with malice, and their wide cheshire grins showed the brown peg-shaped teeth in their wooden mouths, bits of rot and viscera stuck between them.

On reflex, I brought my Type 9 up to hip level and squeezed the trigger in concert with Jamie.

*Brat-tat-tat-tat.*

Two of the Puppets fell in twisted screams of animalistic rage and pain, one from Jaime’s rifle bullets, the other from my 9mm rounds. The third mutant closed the gap on us in seconds, his spear poised to lance Jamie’s throat.

*Bam.*

The Puppet’s head jerked to one side, black sap spattering from the ragged hole as he collapsed, and Chris emerged from the armored car with his Mauser pistol drawn.

Holding the hefty slab of metal up so Peter could crawl after him, Chris leveled the barrel of his handgun in another direction, eyes wild. “More on the right!”

Fast as I could, I swung the muzzle of my submachine gun around and emptied the rest of the magazine into the oncoming flood of shapes.

One of them leapt into the air, flinching as my rounds cut into its gray skin, and the Puppet tumbled to lay mere feet from me in the muddy grass. More sprinted forward, an endless wave of shrieking nightmares, and despite the four of us firing back with all we had, the wave grew closer, the noose tighter as more mutants realized we were exposed.

“Time to move!” Chris bellowed over the roar of our weapons, and waved at Jame and I. “You two go, head for the trucks. We’ll cover you in bounds.”

As terrified as I was, my heart ramming itself into my rib beneath the borrowed steel cuirass, my adrenaline surging at all time highs, I didn’t want to be first. The thought of running *away* from where Chris was in this hell, leaving him behind in the dark, made me want to vomit all over my boots. The mutants were everywhere, surrounding us by the second, and all it would take to lose him would be one wrong step on either his part, or mine. As Chris’s wife, I had vowed to stay by his side until death, but as one of his officers, and Head Ranger to his fighting men, I’d sworn to follow his orders to that very same death. My feelings were irrelevant. Only the mission mattered.

*If you’re not behind me when we get there, I swear to God, Chris Dekker, I will go right back out to find you.*

“Jamie, ready?” I slapped another magazine into my Type 9 and racked the charging handle.

“Let’s go!” She called back, and we lunged into the marsh, running side-by-side towards the distant circle of armored vehicles.

Nothing in all my nightmares could have prepared me for this moment. I ran with all my strength, heart threatening to crash through my chest like a wrecking ball and fired in every direction. Freaks came in at us with a vengeance, the swarm growing in size the closer we got to the truck barricade, and several got far too close for comfort. Teeth and eyes glowed in the flashes of gunfire, the only thing about them we could see before they were almost on top of us, and the shadows were filled with the shrieks of the mutant horde. Only a stream of rounds from behind us kept them at bay, and ever time one of the Puppets fell, it told me Chris was still alive. Terror mixed with a desperation that I thought might kill me even if the monsters around us didn’t, until halfway to the barricade I spotted a rusted hulk of what had once been an old tractor-trailer.

“There!” I waved Jamie to follow me and lurched to the right, shooting another two Puppets as our change of direction threw our pursuers off for a second.

Slipping and sliding over the wet grass, I reached the trailer first and grabbed onto a cluster of thick vines that had grown up the side. My fingers screamed with the exertion, but I hauled myself upward, Jamie on my left doing the same, until we reached the grimy roof. Snarling Puppets crashed into the trailer below with mindless fury, teeth clacking inches from our bootheels, and I had to duck several thrown spears, axes, and a few arrows.

*Bang, bang, bang, bang.*

Jamie fanned the trigger of her rifle to mow them down like corn stalks, and I took the momentary respite to wave with both arms in the direction of our downed ASV. “We’re set! Come on, move up! Move up!”

Two figures darted out from their positions by the truck, and I squinted down the sights of my Type 9 as they did, summoning *the focus* with slow, deliberate breaths.

My eyesight sharpened, the blurs cleared up, and from the darkness I saw the battlefield in all its sordid glory. There were thousands of them, emerging from all over, the Puppets giving their all to bring us down. Their corpses were already stacked three deep within yards of the truck ring, and still they pressed forward, pushing their beasts and fellow infantry to the absolute limit. None showed anything like fear or hesitation; they almost seemed joyful to give their moldy lives, smiling like children on Christmas morning. This was their world, and we were the aliens unaccustomed to the terrain, out of place without the warmth of our sun to light the way.

One of the Puppets lunged toward Chris, and I rested the irons of my weapon over its bare torso.

*Not today, freak.*

*Brat-tat-tat.*

The rounds caught the mutant in the shoulder, and sent the fiend reeling backwards, which brought a thin smile to my grimy face. One after the other, I repeated this sequence to keep the mutants away from my husband and Peter, only breaking my vision from them to spray bullets into any Puppet that had gotten close to our trailer. At last, the boys reached our position, and Jamie knelt to extend them a hand as they crawled over the edge of the trailer roof.

As his exhausted face came up over the edge, Chris looked up at me, and his eyes widened in terror. “Hannah, no!”

My skin prickled, an alarm went up in my heightened brain, and I glimpsed a looming shadow out of the corner of my eye.

Black talons flashed in the sky, leathery wings swooped in a massive gush of wind, and the rusted surface of the trailer roof was ripped from under my feet. The air left my lung as an iron grip crush me under it, and I couldn’t even scream as the world blurred.

Into the sky I was lifted and barely caught sight of my friends growing smaller below me, firing up with their rifles in a vain attempt to bring down my attacker. I could see Chris run for the edge of the truck as if he would throw himself after me, only to be held back by Jamie and Peter as the Puppet ranks closed in on them. My Type 9 lay jammed against my ribs, both arms pinned, and I fought just to suck down the smallest breath. Panic swirled in my brain, the lack of oxygen causing blackness to nibble at the corner of my vision, and dizziness took over as I soared upside down through the stormy sky.

Dark branches rushed up at me, and the four-foot-long black claws grasped around my torso released their grip.

I fell down onto the vines, most of which gave with a somewhat spongy disposition, and rolled to a stop on a familiar round, flat surface.

*No.*

Sick with dread, I clawed at the interwoven vines under my fingers, the platform itself moving as if sentient. My lungs hurt, the dizziness had yet to subside, but even with my disoriented state, I recognized where I was.

*Oh God, please, no.*

Lifting my eyes, I watched in horror as another bolt of lightning illuminated the space around me in brutal detail.

Seven figures hung from wrappings of gray vines, their skin torn, black roots fanned out just under the surface of the flesh. Slate-gray vines pulsated as they fed unknown slush into the victim’s heads, their mouths hanging open to reveal more growth sprouting between their teeth, under their swollen black tongues, and out their throats. White eyes stared outward in frozen terror and pain, three boys and four girls of varying ages, all trapped in a perpetual nightmare. One of the girls was especially small, and her innocent face pockmarked with oily roots that bored through her cheek made my heart twinge in grief.

*Tarren . . . what have they done to you?*

Above the seven, another figure hung suspended by the growth, and I recognized the broken body of Madison from my dreams. Her mouth barely moved in a slight, pleading mumble, as if repeating the same thing over and over, though I couldn’t make out any sound coming from her gray lips. Both white eyes stared down at me, as if in pity, and a dozen shrill voices shrieked in my head from a jumble of confused, terrified memory. and the Osage Wyvern that had snatched me perched on the edge of the growth nearby to let loose a hunger reptilian chitter. Dozens upon dozens of Puppet warriors crowded in, ignoring the deadly combat their fellows waged against our forces not a hundred yards distant, their crude weapons poised to stop me from running away. Cold rain drenched me to the bone, though it wasn’t enough to wash the oily black substance from between the roots of the platform.

“I told you.” From the shadows, a tall figure strode forth, his hooded face regarding me with cold satisfaction, the wooden dagger gripped on one half-rotted hand. In the other, he grasped the book made from his own decaying skin. “You belong to the Master. Embrace the call, and I will take away your pain.”

Something slimy wiggled under my palm, and I jerked it back in a reflexive gasp of disgust.

As if on command, the thick tendrils of the platform surged upward to wrap around my ankles, my wrists and even into my hair.

I thrashed, tried to reach for my knife, but the vines engulfed me in seconds, the organic tide slowly inching for my face. Tears rose in my eyes, abyssal fear in my veins that made me want to cry for my mother as the filthy sprouts probed their way toward my ears, eyes, and mouth. I remembered the pain of my stab wound, remembered the agony of the surgery to remove it all, but something told me this fate would be far worse than all of that. I would be consumed, rotted inside and out, until there was nothing left of my body but mold.

*Shout, fight, do something, you can’t just die like this.*

However, no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t muster anything, not my sonic scream, not *the focus*, not even a stout whimper. The vines squeezed the air from my lungs, forced me to my knees before the macabre altar of human bodies, and sapped any hope I had left of escape. Even in the chilly air, the stench of decay was stifling, and the greasy residue of the vines on the back of my neck made my skin crawl. Disgust and horror mixed into a panicked state of total revulsion, but I remained powerless to do anything about it.

Thunder rumbled overhead, and as he advanced, Vecitorak’s gravelly voice slithered to me across the icy wind. “Our time has come. Welcome to the Sacred Grove, Hannah. Welcome home.”
