It’s 1:43 a.m. right now. I’m sitting at the desk across from the bed, typing this with all the lights on. I don’t know what to do.

I know how this is going to sound. But I need to write this down before I convince myself it didn’t happen. Before I brush it off again. Before I call it a dream.

So.

I’m staying in this hotel for a work trip. It's nothing fancy. Just a normal inn kinda, not too cheap though. My room's on the fourth floor. There’s a big window facing some other building, and in between there's just... nothing. Trees. A wire fence.

Last night it was raining.
I couldn't sleep. I don’t know why. I had a long day. Dealing with annoying foreign officials. Skipped lunch too. I was fking tired, but my body just wouldn’t give in. So I put on a movie on my laptop and got under the blanket, trying to wait it out.
The window was opposite my bed. I wasn’t really looking at it, my screen had most of my attention, but I could still hear the rain.
And then, somewhere halfway through the movie, the power went out.

I looked up. Instinct, I guess.
And I don’t know how to explain it, but, I felt like something was watching me.
Like someone was out there. Still. Staring in.
I sat up slowly. Told myself it was nothing. Just nerves. Just the dark outside messing with me.

Still, I couldn’t stop looking at that window.
At first, I couldn’t see anything. Just black. Rain. 
But then my eyes started to adjust.
There was something there.
A shape. Sort of bushy. Right at the top part of the window. Moving just slightly. Like it was swaying with the breeze.
I blinked. Focused.
It looked like-

Hair.
Long. Wet. Hanging down. From the top of the window.
Like someone was on the window sun shade.
Hanging upside down.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just kept staring, waiting for it to shift or vanish or do something that made sense.
But it did nothing. Didn’t move an inch.
I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t even look away. My entire body locked up. 
And then,
The lights came back on.
And just like that, the window was empty.
No hair. Nothing.
I sat there for a long time, still staring at it.
Eventually, I got up. Walked to the window. Pushed it open a bit. Looked around.

Nothing.

I told myself it was a dream. A half-sleep hallucination. My mind playing tricks on me. Right?

And I fell asleep eventually. I don’t even remember when.

But this morning…
Everything felt normal. I laughed at myself in the shower, thinking about last night. Rolled my eyes at the mirror. Went out for the day.
I almost forgot about it.

Until I came back this evening, and I tried to open the window again for some fresh air.

My fingers brushed against something.
Something soft. Cold. Almost silky.
I looked down.

And I swear to god,
It was a strand of hair.

Long. Black. Wet at the ends.

Not mine.

I have short blonde hair. Always had.

I dropped it instantly. Backed away. Slammed the window shut and locked it.

And now I’m here. Typing this.

I don’t know if I imagined it. I don’t know what I saw. But I’m leaving this hotel tomorrow.
I just need someone to tell me I’m not going crazy.

Please.
Help me.
