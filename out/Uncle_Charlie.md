Rolling over, I wrapped my arms around her, she lay still, sleeping. The room was silent, the gentle humming of the boiler downstairs was all to be heard. Usually she's awake before me, maybe she's coming down with the flu. I squeezed her, leaning my head into her luscious brown hair. I take a deep breath as her beautiful scent drifted up my nose enhancing my senses.  
  
My heart fluttered wildly, like the first time I met her, I remembered it like it was yesterday. Her deep brown eyes spotted me from Across the room. In an instant, I fell in love.  
  
My heart fluttered wildly, like the first time I met her, I remembered it like it was yesterday. Her deep brown eyes spotted me from Across the room. In an instant, I fell in love.  
  
She was married, she told me she was. But I knew one day, I'd end up with her. My pull to her was too strong, I could not live without her. I knew deep inside she couldn't live without me. I snapped myself back to reality, her smell getting stronger, the house still silent. It was eerie, really, how quiet the house was, even though she has two children and her husband living here.  
  
"Isabella, I'm going to check on the family, my love, then I will come sort you out," I whispered, stroking her hair.  
  
Her husband and I, we had a deal. He could live with us, he can pretend everything is OK to his children. On one condition, he cannot touch her, he cannot even look at her. I liked the children they called me Uncle Charlie. I hopped down the stairs, not able to contain my grin. What a perfect life I had. I had to hop, when the husband first found out what was going on, he hit my leg with a hammer, It was just a shattered kneecap, it would fix itself soon enough. But that was when our deal came along. I turned into the kitchen, ready to greet the family. "Good morning all." I would sing to them, as I sang every morning. I looked, the children sat nicely up the table, their food untouched. Little Lucy had dark brown hair and light blue eyes, but I couldn't see her eyes right now, she must be asleep too. Her older brother Kyle is a different story, he's lolling his head back, he's not in the right state of mind, see. His blue eyes looked milky. Maybe he needed to see his doctor, maybe he's refused to take his seizure medication. I'd get my doctor's kit later, maybe operate. Something needs to be done for this poor boy. The dad, he still had lively moments where he thrashes in his chair and cried, but most of the time he is silent, I had to tie him to the chair to keep him from running away, the perks of being a police officer. A good set of handcuffs and was trained to use a gun. I haven't needed to use my gun yet, the family has been quite welcoming. The dad, his name is Jeff, his eyes are wide, and his hands started to shake, I knew then a tantrum was going to erupt.  
  
"My children, they're rotting, in front of my eyes." He cried.  
  
He had been trying to tell me for two weeks that his children are dead, well he was just wrong, I could hear them. He'd have to go, he's scaring the kids, he'll worry his wife. And with a swift thrust of the kitchen knife, I punctured his throat, blood squirting freely from him as I pull the blade out with a twist, excitement pulsated through my body.  
  
You are finally free of the burden of your father, please call me daddy now," I whisper to the kids. My new kids.  
  
I cleared his body, cutting it up into small squares. Took me a few hours but by the end, I had enough to freeze for the next week, and enough to make a stew. I will slow cook it, make it tender for my poorly love. Isabella would enjoy a nice stew. I rushed upstairs, my arms ready to embrace my darling. I glanced into the bedroom and noticed she was still sleeping. Maybe a nice hand wash would do her good. I fill a bowl of soapy water and enter our room. The smell getting stronger, she definitely needs a wash. Lifting her shirt over her head I started massaging her body gently with a soapy sponge, she must have liked it, she flopped her head back in which I was sure was happiness. I scrubbed gently back and forward over her body. Then when I squeezed the soapy sponge into the water, I noticed a red hint.  
  
Blood.  
  
My heart raced, of course, my Isabella is bleeding. Her skin peeled off her beautiful body, enough now that there was no skin left to cover her right rib. Maybe I had gotten too excited and pressed too hard. I'll patch her up later, there's a possibility that she has just shed her skin, it is possible of course. I filled my bowl with stew, it taste tough, much like pork. I should have skinned him first.  
  
I took the children out that night and left them at the door of their grandma's. It'll be good for them. Little Lucy's body hung loosely in the car as if she was asleep. She's such a joker, Kyle was as stiff as a board though. That evening I got home, and ran straight upstairs to make love with my darling. That's when you knocked and handcuffed me for no real reason except for protecting my new family.  
  
Officer jones handcuffed me straight away, He knew there was something wrong. The smell startled his nose, causing his skin to crawl. I was shocked, he said I didn't understand what I had done. He received a call earlier, from an old woman. She screamed she did, her heart was shattered. She got a knock on the door at 6:17 pm that evening, she opened it to find her grandchildren. A 5-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy. Dead. When he arrived the first thing he noticed was the strong smell, then the decaying bodies of the little children who lay at his feet. He described it as skin fell off their cheeks, the fingers completely missing. The maggots which slid out from the ears of the little girl were a haunting picture. Still, he cannot get their glazed scared eyes out of his mind. Of course, straight away he went to the mother's home, and the grandma was happy to give him the address. He blue-lighted his way over here, to knock on the door of what seemed to be a happy family home.  
  
The man who answered the door was what shocked him the most me Charlie. He(jones) worked alongside me but I had called off sick about 3 weeks earlier. I am tall, 6'5 feet tall muscly physique blocked his entry. I greeted him like an old friend, knowing that as soon as I had his hand in mine the cuffs will go on. And so he did it, handcuffed and forced me to the floor I knew I could take him I got up and tried to take him down with my other hand which was very hard but I did it. As The smell of the house getting stronger, a mixture of rotting eggs, rotting cabbage, and human feces. Another police car pulled up, gripping hold of Jones and I thought was a gentle giant. I ran around the house, gun in hand that I took from Jones when I took him down before another car pulled up. Three more of them, I pointed my gun at them 'bad move' I know and before I could load the gun, one of them shot my thigh. I fell to the ground and Jones ran up me and punched my face and everything went dark...  
  
Jones told me later that the kitchen was a state, two chairs had urine and feces all over them, chains tied to the arms. Another chair lay on its back, bloodstained and broken. One followed a stronger more pungent smell up the stairs, looking for a survivor. On the bed, completely exposed lay a lady, her rib caged exposed, flesh hung from her stomach, her one breast completely deflated with blood leaking from its side. The bed was spoiled with red, brown, and yellow. Her long brown hair hung off her skull, exposing the bones. Her eyes closed as if sleeping. But the lips were open, infested with maggots. His heart skipped a beat, as well as dropped into his stomach as he held in the vomit. With shaky hands he turned to leave, his mind scarred with what was left.  
  
I wasn't charged with murder. Instead, I was sent to the loony bin, I won't get out anytime soon. What happened to me is a mystery to him, why did I snap? what made me kill? I knew him well, he was a good man or did I thought he was? I was always on my good behaviour, I mean I was pretty good looking and tall which made me easy to pick girls but was always nice to everyone. But when I am let out, his fear is I will attack again. I still believe the family is alive, I talk about them a lot. It's been 15 years now, but I'll tell you one thing, that smell has not left my mind. I loved it.  
  
That old women, my children's grandmother took them from me, called the police and I was sent to an loony bin? I gave her the children to take care of them rather she betrayed me? she is next I will go for her when I get out.  
  
Doctors here told me to write a diary as I was very angry even after 15 years. They tried everything they could over the years to fix me even put me into the locked unit for care. All items that could be used for self-harm or to harm others are removed from the possession of the patient and they are placed in a safe hospital wing that is also free from those types of items. Typically, a unit may have 10â€“15 other patients which will share the space. But then I figured I would just write on reddit rather than write a dairy.  
  
  
  
I might update if I ever get my hands on that grandmother, which will be very soon I believe.
