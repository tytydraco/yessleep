*I can’t die.*

*I can’t.*

My shoulder pulsed with pain. I continued running down the hall, towards the big, red EXIT sign. The hospital hadn’t released me. “Stop,” Luke begged, catching up with me. But I forced myself to run faster, despite the pain.

I wasn’t going to just sit in the hospital room and wait to die. Obviously, from what the doctor said, that’s what happened to the last one. I was going to get underground. Maybe I would have to stay there forever. Or until they found a way to kill these things.

I would not leave Grace without a mother.

I wanted more than anything to go to her. Hug her. Tell her I loved her. But maybe that thing could follow me, even into a basement. I didn’t think so, but I couldn’t risk it.

The best thing I could do was get underground.

Buy time.

Grace was as safe as she could be, with my mom, underground.

I ran towards the exit. The red sign glowed brightly in the darkness of the hallway. One of the lights flickered overhead. My bare feet slapped against the floor.

The floor felt sharp.

I kept running. But it didn’t seem like I was getting any closer to the exit sign.

*What the…*

I glanced back. Luke wasn’t following me anymore. Nor Richele or Jamie. The hallway extended behind me, stretching back into the darkness, infinitely.

I kept running—

The exit door was open now, still so far away. A stiff breeze blew in, ruffling through my hair. It smelled of pine and wood and decay.

*Keep running—*

The ground was so rough under my feet. The air was so cold. The lights above me flickered wildly. The door didn’t get any closer, no matter how fast I sprinted. A few leaves swirled by outside in the darkness.

*Keep running…*

The lights above me flickered out.

And then I wasn’t in the hospital anymore.

I was in the middle of the woods.

Pine trees stretched up into the darkness. The sand, littered with sharp sticks and rocks, bit into the bare soles of my feet. Silence rang in my ears, except for a light fluttering sound somewhere in the darkness.

*No.*

*No, no, no.*

*It tricked me.*

I wheeled around. I didn’t see any lights. Any break in the trees. *How deep in the barrens am I? How long have I been running?*

The darkness closed in. Suffocating me. I felt my pockets—no phone. *No way to call for help.* *No way to know where I am.*

I sucked in a breath, ready to scream into the darkness. But that would draw the stick men to me. Wouldn’t it? Or did it not matter—did they already know where I was?

I looked up at the stars. At the slices of sky poking through the pines. I tried to identify them—*is that Cassiopeia?—*but I didn’t know anything about how to tell directions from the stars. Besides, the pines blocked out most of the sky, anyway.

*No, wait. That’s not the way to do this.* I ran in here. My legs didn’t feel that sore. Even though it must’ve distorted time—I’d only felt like I was running for a minute—if I’d run ten miles into the barrens, I’d know.

I just needed to figure out what direction I’d come from.

I wheeled around, trying to look for footprints, flattened vegetation, any sign of where I’d come from. But it was pitch dark out, and I didn’t have any source of light. There was moonlight—enough to see so that I didn’t smack into a tree—but not enough to look for footprints in the sand.

I stared at the trees. But the branches were up too high, and too thin to support my weight. I couldn’t climb them to get a better vantage point.

I ransacked my pockets again. Nothing.

So I started off in a random direction.

Sticks stabbed at my feet. Pebbles rolled underneath my toes. I kept walking forward, trying to keep a straight line. *The Pine Barrens is a million acres*. But an acre wasn’t *that* many square miles—I remembered that from somewhere.  I tried to focus on doing the math—if I was in the center, and walked in a random direction, how long would it take me to get to the edge? Five hours? Ten?

More than that?

And of course I’d heard the stories. Even without the stick men, the Pine Barrens were deadly enough. Carnivorous plants, rattlesnakes, and a way of turning people around. It was easy to get lost in the infinite pines…

I thought of Grace. Luke telling her I was gone. Her crying, melting down. She needed me. Maybe years ago, at that low, low point in my life right after Grace was born, I wouldn’t have been quite so panicked at the thought of dying.

But I was panicking now.

I picked up the pace. Sticks stabbed at my feet harder. I tried to keep a straight line, but it was so hard in the dark. And for all I knew, I was just walking deeper and deeper into the barrens.

Then I saw it—

A clearing.

My heart soared. *That must be where I came from—*

It was one of the burned areas.

The fire had hollowed out a large clearing. It was lit in silver tones by the nearly-full moon, no longer obscured. Some pines still stood, completely bare of needles, skeletal and black. Ash blackened the pale sand beneath, the color of bone. A few pine saplings poked through the destruction, only inches tall.

It was deathly silent.

*I’m never going to get out of here.*

I looked up at the blackened pines, stretching up to the sky like fingers—

*Snap.*

I whirled around.

Someone was standing at the edge of the trees. Painted in all tones of gray from the moonlight, barely visible among the trees.

I took off into a run.

But in my panic, I tripped.

It felt like it was in slow motion. The sandy, ashy ground rose up to meet me. Pain shot up my arms—my shoulder screamed in pain. Sticks scraped my cheek.

*Snap, snap, snap.*

I scrambled up—to see *myself* standing there. Arms hanging limply at my sides. Hair grazing my shoulders.

“Let me go!” I screamed.

My voice echoed and died into the forest.

She stepped closer. I could hear, too, a wet smacking sound—there was another slimy, black appendage attached to her feet. Controlling her, like she was a puppet. She canted her head at me and her lips split into an unnatural grin.

I turned and tried to run again.

An intense wave of dizziness hit me. The ground tilted. Heaviness pressed down on my head. My stomach lurched and I was vomiting, stumbling, tripping in my own puddle of vomit.

*“Stop,”* I croaked.

I was lying on my back. Warm, wet vomit soaking through the back of my shirt. Twisted black appendages were filling up the corners of my vision. Melting in with the twisted black pines stretching up to the sky.

The stars above me looked like shooting stars, moving across the sky, with how dizzy I was.

The sky was replaced with my own face.

My—*her—*hair hung onto my face, sticking to the sweat and the vomit.

Her lips curled into a smile.

And then her mouth began to open. Wider, wider, wider. Rows of sharp teeth, like a lamprey’s, descending into the darkness of her throat.

I tried to push it off. But my hands met slime. I was pinned by the creature. One of the stick men.

It was only her disembodied head hovering over me.

Attached to a tangled black mess of creature.

*They eat brains,* Jamie’s voice echoed in my head, as the teeth loomed closer. So close, I couldn’t see any of the barrens anymore.

*Grace.*

*What’s she going to do without me?*

*She’ll never recover.*

*Her entire life will be ruined.*

*I can’t…*

*I’m so, so sorry…*

And then I realized.

The stick men were attracted to brain signals.

What if I’d done something I’d never done before?

What if I just… *stopped* thinking?

I closed my eyes.

Ignored the warm, rotting breath on my face. Ignored the slime seeping through my shirt.

Ignored thoughts of Grace.

I used every last bit of my willpower to *stop* thinking.

Nothing.

A void.

Nonexistence…

…

…

…

A clicking sound came from above me. The creature began to shift its weight. I continued thinking about nothing. Absolutely nothing.

…

…

…

The creature pulled itself off me.

When I opened an eye, it no longer wore my head. It was twisting and turning, making clicking sounds, lifting some of its appendages in the air…

As if confused.

As if it thought I’d escaped, and it was trying to sense me out again.

I lay there in the dark, burnt forest, thinking of nothing for seconds. Minutes. Hours. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. Pushing away thoughts of Grace, of my future, of hers. Pushing it all out and being…

Empty.

…

…

…

When the sun began to rise, I pulled myself up. The burnt forest was bathed in the pink hues of dawn. My skin was covered in vomit and black slime. My shoulder still throbbed with pain.

And there was no sign of the stick men.

\*\*\*

It took me another few hours, but in the daylight, I was able to find my way back. After walking around in circles for a while, I caught a glimpse of a road through the trees.

I’d apparently fled the hospital and run a half mile into the pine barrens across the street. Luke and hospital staff were looking for me all night.

I was reunited with Grace, and it was the happiest day of my life.

I think the stick man is still linked to me. We’ve been spending our nights in the basement, where we’ve been totally safe. Richele, Jamie, and I have been working together to figure out how to kill it for good. Some guy online, from the incident ten years ago, claims drowning them works.

But for now, I am content to be home, and be safe.

Even if it isn’t forever, and a million bad things are waiting to happen.
