I slowly and sluggishly approached my bed and flopped down onto it and I let out a sigh. I am exhausted after a long day at the factory. I haven't had a moment to rest or do nothing for a while. My palms are drenched with a cold sweat. My knees feel as if they are to cave in, every single bone just shattering into pieces. So did my arms, heavy, and still. My taste buds are gone, I could tell from my after work coffee, which I forgot in the car, I'm stupid.

I lounged lazily and searched for a nearby snack or anything, leftovers maybe, I wouldn't be able to taste it right now, but I crave something, anything actually. I felt almost desperate for something, then I saw it. My head twisted to the right and I saw it, a bag of potato chips. I clawed for it, my arm straining in pain before I was able to snatch the bag of potato chips, crumpling and cracks are audible heard as any normal bag would have these noises emit from it.

Firstly I just tried using my hands, yet the sweat just kept it slippery, and my arms flinch upon each attempt. Then, with all my possible strength left I just lifted the bag to my mouth and resorted to using my teeth. This was way easier for me, as it causes my arms less pain, besides from lifting it up to my face.

I reach into the bag and pull out the first chip. Each time I check there is a crunch.

Crunch
Crunch
Crunch
Crunch.

My arm remains in pain, I wish this wasn't the only thing in my room. As I reach back into the bag, I felt as if something else reached in from the bottom, my arm drags itself quickly and I grunt.

"What"
"What the fuck?"

There probably was some reasonable explanation for what happened. It was just another chip in the bag. Yes that's all, just a chip. My arm feeling less heavy I lift it with ease, slowly, to grab another chip. I lifted the chip back out and started chewing on it.

Crunch
Crunch
Crunch
Crunch.

I grab another chip.

Crunch
Crunch
Crunch
Crunch.

I grab another chip, this one struggled it seem, but I paid no attention.

Crunch
Crunch
Crunch
Crunch.

That chip was way harder to chew, but I keep on eating more and more.

Crunch

Crunch.

I reach in one more time, I move my hand across the bottom. Crumbs all over my chest, my face and finger a mess. I can't feel a chip, but I reach further into the bag. I stick my whole arm in and continue to search. As my arm reached the furthest that it could go, a hand grabbed me, I felt only 4 fingers, or maybe 3 fingers and a thumb. I'm panting heavily, and I'm terrified. No matter how hard I struggled and tugged and pulled. It wouldn't let go of me. Whatever was in there, it spoke to me.

"You took something from me."
"And now, I'll take it back, from you."

Crunch.
