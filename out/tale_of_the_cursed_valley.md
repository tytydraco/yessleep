It was a quiet town late at night. The streets were empty, the lamps buzzing faintly as moths battered their wings against the glass. Inside a small house at the edge of town, a man lay awake, sweating bullets beneath his blanket.

He sat up suddenly. He could have sworn he heard his mother calling his name. But that was impossible—she had died months ago. The sound came again, faint but clear, curling through the silence like a whisper carried by the wind.

Then came the knocking.

At first, it was soft, as though someone was politely rapping on the door. But with each passing second, the sound grew louder. Knock. Knock. Knock. Soon, it was pounding with such force that the windows rattled in their frames. He pressed his hands over his ears, but the sound only grew until, without warning, it stopped.

The silence was worse.

That’s when he heard them—footsteps outside, crunching slowly against the gravel driveway. Heavy, deliberate, unhurried. With each step, he felt a pressure build in his chest, an ancient, suffocating weight, as though the very air was bending around some unseen force.

A sudden crash shattered the silence. The front door splintered open. The man froze. He was not alone.

Heart racing, he scrambled to his room, ducking beneath his bed. He knew it was pointless, but instinct told him to hide. His breath came shallow and fast, his sweat dripping onto the floor.

Then *it* entered.

The creature was impossibly tall, hunched so its spine curved in jagged angles. Its gray, ash-like skin clung to bones that jutted through like shattered glass. Its arms hung too long, knuckles nearly scraping the floor, claws curved like rusted hooks.

Where eyes should have been were hollow sockets that dripped a tar-like sludge. Its jaw swung loosely, unhinged, and when it breathed, the sound was like graves opening. Rows of broken teeth gleamed in its grin, blackened with rot.

But what everyone remembers—what the stories always mention—was the sack.

It dragged behind the creature, massive and tattered, bulging with something that shifted and writhed inside. The stench of spoiled meat rolled from it in waves. Sometimes, if you listen closely, you can hear muffled voices from inside. Screams. Pleas. The scratching of fingernails against the fabric, trying desperately to claw their way out.

Locals call it **the Sackman**. Some say he was once a butcher who fed on human flesh and was cursed for his crimes, doomed to wander forever with his harvest. Others whisper that he is not of this world at all—that he collects souls for something darker, stuffing them into his bag until the weight drags him back below.

Every town nearby has stories. People missing in the night. Doors broken in with no sign of forced entry. And always, always, the smell of rot left behind.

They say if you hear knocking that grows louder and louder, don’t open your door. If you hear footsteps that stop outside your window, don’t look. And if you smell spoiled meat in the dead of night…

…it means the Sackman has come, and he won’t leave until he’s fed.
