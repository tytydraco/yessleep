For most of my adolescence, and all of my adulthood, I’ve lived with the guilt that I was a murderer. Nothing can assuage it. Not while I know I’ll never be caught. The murder weapon wasn’t buried so deep, but authorities won’t unearth it. As for the victim, he had barely any documentation of his existence. No birth certificate, student ID, nor driver’s license. The files of a counselor somewhere, if not ravaged by mildew, then covered in dust. 

I read it’s pretty common for kids of a certain age to have an imaginary friend. A healthy enough stage of development, in no way indicative of future instability. Kids pretend to be cops, robbers, superheroes, even housewives. From there, it’s not much of stretch that a kid might concoct an entirely make-believe playmate. Especially if they’re particularly sheltered or isolated. But what kind of child makes up an imaginary *enemy?*

Like any honest adult, I’ll admit to having a terrible time during childhood. Whether at home or school, things were rough. But at least I had Gal. When I first met him, I can’t specify. He was already present in my oldest memories. But hazy. As if, besides his voice—coming in loud and clear—he was intangible. A spirit.

I was five when I realized my parents couldn’t see my best friend. Gallowgrin wasn’t bothered by this. “That you notice me means you’re special, Aaron. Let’s play a game called ‘Keep a secret from your parents.’ It’s so much fun, you’ll love it!”

He watched over me. My personal guardian angel. Attending all the usual childhood milestones. Every birthday, Christmas morning, whenever I lost a tooth, the first day of any school year. With time, Gallowgrin became more solid. I could hold and pet him. He slept in my bed, near the foot.

If I was hurt or sad, he’d purr and curl across my shoulders. His soft, warm fur a reassuring presence on the nape of my neck. At first, his weight was light. No problem to carry. The idea that he might someday crush me never popped into my head.

I wouldn’t know what other kids’ imaginary friends look like. They’d be as invisible to me as to anyone else. But Gallowgrin appeared as a small purple lemur. His tufted ears always pointed in askew directions. His round eyes were so wide he always looked surprised. And his brown tail had the consistency of rope.

Therapists have asked how I came up with that name “Gallowgrin.” A pretty rude question. It would be like asking how I came up with my parent’s names. Sure, in fifth grade I had braces. But I had known Gallowgrin years before then. No point psychoanalyzing that detail.

It was an accurate name, anyhow. His wide mouth was packed with metal teeth, each shaped like a guillotine blade. That probably should have terrified the young me, but I was used to that smile. Gallowgrin always smiled. Those teeth proved no more frightening than a nutcracker’s. Actually, at the time I probably would have found the nutcracker more disturbing.

Gallowgrin’s personality, more than appearance, endeared him to me. He never had a cruel thing to say about anyone. He was my favorite playmate, whom I’d choose over a human companion any day.  

Up to pre-K age, Gallowgrin’s only interest seemed to be in having fun. Once I got to kindergarten, we were forced to spend time apart. He didn’t attend classes. I guess he thought school was really boring. Which I couldn’t fault him for. 

In the evening, when we finally got time to play, he snubbed me. He started leaving every evening, only returning at breakfast time. Never admitting what he got up to at night. Out of the blue, he’d want my total attention. If I wanted to play, I’d have to skip my homework. So, I fell behind in class when I used to get gold stars.

“I’m bored,” Gallowgrin would say before proposing new games. Different games than we’d played before. He dared me to perform pranks. Initially, they weren’t so bad. Splash in a puddle and tramp mud into the house just as my mother finished mopping. Nothing that could be categorized as criminal.

By second grade, he spurred me on to petty theft. We’d be in a grocery store and he’d say, “Swipe that candy bar real quick!”

“Why not just ask mom to buy it?” I asked.

“Where’s the sport in that? C’mon, the clerk won’t notice.”

Whenever I hesitated, Gallowgrin vowed to abandon me if I didn’t follow his requests. He claimed he could find a more agreeable child any time he wanted. “Face it, Aaron. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have a single friend in the world. You need me more than I need you. I hang around here as a favor, but every day, you disregard my feelings!”

I believed him. Back then, I didn’t know any better. It was extortion. His words hurt, and I broke under his cajoling. Hating myself the whole time. And weirdly hating myself most when I got away with the crimes.

The times I wasn’t so lucky, my parents duly punished me. “*Good*,” I’d think, “*this is exactly what I deserve*.”

Gallowgrin didn’t just tempt me in the daytime. He whispered awful things in my ears as I tried to fall asleep. There were bags under my eyes. I slacked off with doing chores at home. I couldn’t concentrate on school assignments. Most of the time, I lacked an appetite.

Every day, Gallowgrin had some new rotten request of me. Only after I’d done something wrong would his personality revert to the original him. He’d hug me. Curl up in my lap. Wiggle his nose against mine. The times he got on my shoulder, he was noticeably heavier. But I was growing, too. I could handle it.

Gallowgrin’s moods quickly soured. It took worse and worse acts to earn his continued loyalty. By third grade, we’d graduated from larceny to vandalism. I was ordered to stomp the flower beds of our neighbor, Mrs. Dirigible. And I tore them up, just like I stole the candy. I threw a baseball through my teacher’s window, running before she opened her front door.

“Enough is enough” wasn’t something Gallowgrin understood. He asked for me to act out in plain view of witnesses, including cops. I chickened out. He tore off in a rage.

I was left thinking “*Why has my friend changed so much?”* What had I done wrong? He didn’t even seem like the same person. But Gallowgrin wasn’t really a person. He was something else.

As he got meaner, Gallowgrin’s hair fell out in patches. Underneath were scales. His big wide eyes shrunk to narrow slits. The tip of his ropey tail twisted into a knot that couldn’t be untangled.

Walking outside, we’d find a bug crawling on the ground. “Squish it,” Gallowgrin would say, over and over until I caved. Green blood stained the bottoms of my shoes. To some, an insect’s life might not seem like much. Most bugs are considered creepy-looking pests.

But think of the Monarch butterfly I chased after for Gallowgrin’s amusement. I caught it between my oversized hands. In a second, I could have easily let it go. Instead, the beautiful thing was crushed flat between my palms. In my whole life up till then, I’d never felt more ashamed of myself.

Gallowgrin tired of killing bugs. It was bad enough when he asked me to throw rocks at our neighbor’s cat, Freya. Now, he ordered me to steal a knife from the kitchen cabinet and stab her.

I finally stood up to him. It was years in coming. “I don’t want to do mean things anymore. They’re not fun.”

“But this *is* fun, Aaron. For me. The most fun is when you’re caught. Not all friendships are equal. I feel like I contribute more. You don’t realize just how much of my time gets wasted listening to your immature whining. Kill the cat, then bury it in Mrs. Dirigible’s flowerbeds for her to find! I’ll be your pal for another week.”

“You’re a bad friend!” I shouted.

“Tsk-tsk. I think you’re the one who’s a bad friend. Such a naughty child. You’re in too deep now. Just a juvenile delinquent, with a pre-reserved seat in a concrete cell.”

“You made me do those awful things!”

“Did I? I think you’re misremembering. Did I really *make* you do anything? You chose to be a bad kid. I only put the suggestions into your head a little early, before you would have thought of them all on your own. Because you’re rotten. You have a dark heart.”

“I wouldn’t have…”

Gallowgrin laughed. “Maybe I’m bad, Aaron, but I’m the only friend who will put up with you. That I can guarantee. No one else could even pretend to like you! I hear the other kids talking behind your back.”

It wasn’t just my home life he wrecked. When I wanted him gone, I couldn’t get rid of Gallowgrin. He followed me to school now. Trailing a few feet behind, floating in the air like a ghost. But when he wanted, he could be solid enough to touch objects, and move them slightly.

I tried my best to ignore him, and regained my appetite. At lunch one day, I had the fork to my mouth when Gallowgrin flicked the mashed potato off its end. Arcing across the cafeteria, it landed on the shirt of Tyler. The worst bully at our school.

Gallowgrin vanished when Tyler rushed me. He thought I had messed up his shirt on purpose. And, like all bullies, he couldn’t be convinced otherwise once his lizard brain decided on something. At recess, he caught up to me with his two buddies, Hunter and Andy. His friends held my arms while Tyler punched me in the stomach. I fell into the mud. The three kicked me in my chest, my legs, and face.

I wasn’t an athlete like Tyler, but I was big for my age. You know that era where girls were taller than the boys? Well, no girls were ever taller than me. So because of my size, if someone picked a fight with me, it was invariably assumed I’d been the aggressor.

Tyler told the principal I had started everything, managing to squeeze out a few crocodile tears over his “Ruined shirt.”

“Boys will be boys,” the principal shrugged.

Tyler and his friends were let off. I got suspended the rest of the week “For causing a disruption to the other students’ learning.”

My mom grounded me. When he got home from the bar, my dad gave me a belting. Not because I’d started a fight, but because I hadn’t won.

That night, as I cried, Gallowgrin tried to console me. “I didn’t know that would happen with Tyler, honest. I was just trying to have a little fun.”

That week of suspension, covered in bruises, I swore I’d had enough of Gallowgrin. But I quickly reneged, my head hanging in shame. For all his manipulations, he was right about being all I had. I hoped, even prayed, he would snap out of this darkness and be who I needed him to be without asking anything terrible in return.

Lucky for once, I found a legal way to pacify him. In my early memories, Gallowgrin didn’t seem to eat. Maybe I’d pour him some imaginary tea or vodka during playtime, but that was it. The sudden heaviness on my shoulders correlated with him discovering his appetite.

He claimed stolen candy tasted better. Instead, I offered him any stray scraps from our kitchen. Then I started giving him half of my meals.

“I’m still starving, Aaron!” Gallowgrin whined.[ ]()He’d chew on objects in the house. The ends of tables, corners of books, my parent’s shoes, and electrical cords. More than nutrition, he wanted things to use his guillotines on.

Our dog got blamed for most of the messes. Gallowgrin laughed. He always hated the animal, though she never bothered him. Whatever the dog didn’t take heat for, my parents accused me. And, well…let’s just say my dad wore his belt around his hand more than his waist at home.

I endured. Keeping Gallowgrin sated proved hard work, but it kept the house intact. He practically inhaled the roadkill I picked up in my *Radio Flyer*. For weeks that satisfied him, and we stayed friends. Or, at least, not enemies. Then, he decided he’d rather have fresh meat.

Freya from next door went missing. Poor Mrs. Dirigible put up signs on every lamppost in the neighborhood. She eventually found her pet. But not in her flowerbeds, like Gallowgrin originally planned. The dead cat lay half-buried beneath a bush in our front yard. Partially eaten.

First, Dirigible blamed our dog. But we only let her out of the house for walks, for which she was always leashed. My father determined the precise marks on the cat’s bones could have only come from a blade. The culprit was human, and I was suspect number one!

But with zero proof or a confession, the adults wouldn’t punish me. But from then on, Mrs. Dirigible kept a close—and evil—eye on me. I spotted her peeking over our shared fence.

Had Gallowgrin been around, I would have screamed at him. But he disappeared for weeks. I did better at school. I still wasn’t popular, but I kept my head down and steered clear of bullies. I didn’t have my old friend, but I had a decently stocked library. During any free moments, I read.

I was putting on my pajamas one night when I heard a familiar purring behind me. The sound used to comfort me. But the hair on my scalp stood on end.

“I’ve given it some thought, Aaron,” Gallowgrin said from my open window. “I’ve decided you’re right. I could be a better friend. So, this Monday at school, I’m going to kill Tyler for you!”

“Don’t!” I yelled, prompting my father to bang on the paper-thin walls, telling me to shut up.

“Okay, the Monday after next, then!” In an instant, Gallowgrin was gone.

I shoved my window down, twisting the lock.

Monday morning, he was waiting for me in the classroom. Gallowgrin didn’t carry out his promise. Not right away. Instead, he whispered. Threats against the other students and my teacher, which grew more specific and graphic as the week progressed. All the things he’d do to the girls*.*

They may have treated me like dirt, but I still didn’t want what happened to Freya to happen to them. My grades slipped yet again. A parent-teacher conference was called. Only my mother attended.

Gallowgrin was, for lack of a better word, becoming more “real.” Signs were subtle, but other people detected his presence. My mother found strands of purple hair shed on the carpet. She didn’t think much of where they came from. Just vacuumed up the mess.

Each time he made his presence known, Gallowgrin pushed boundaries just a bit further. He’d moved on from chewing things to leaving claw marks on the floor, on doors, on walls, and on me. My mother thought I’d been injuring myself on purpose. Rather than saying anything, she took the razors from the bathroom and hid them.

I swear, when I brought that gun, it wasn’t for Tyler, my teacher, or any of my schoolmates. The police and judges got it all wrong. I only wanted to protect people, not hurt them!

I meant to scare Gallowgrin away. If he tried following through with his threats, his blade teeth or hangman’s tail wouldn’t touch anyone at school. He’d see through a water pistol or a light-up sci fi gun immediately. It had to be the real thing.

 I won’t deny the facts. I *had* hidden a weapon in the bottom of my backpack and carried it into school. I wasn’t stupid…well, I guess even the smartest kids still have their unwise moments. It was certainly reckless. I knew that going in. But the handgun wasn’t loaded. When grabbing it out of my dad’s shoebox in the back of his closet, I carefully removed each bullet.

 I know I did! It shouldn’t have gone off in my locker. But it did, seemingly on its own. Everyone heard. Even the janitor mowing the soccer field. The shittiest show-and-tell in school history.

In a day, I’d proven every authority figure’s suspicions, based on my appearance, correct. I really was some worthless thug. While the fat rent-a-cops dragged me into the principal’s office, Gallowgrin sat in the corner of the room, cackling madly. *This was what he wanted*.

 Looking back, what makes the most sense to me is that Gallowgrin must have snuck back into my dad’s closet and taken the bullets. When the pack was out of my sight, he reloaded them. The demon had known my intentions from the beginning.

Of course my actions merited punishment. Somehow, I scraped past a sentence to juvie. I did a lot of thinking the weeks after my expulsion. A lot of “What ifs?” came to me. What if Gallowgrin started appearing to other people? What if he could have done so this entire time? “*No*,” I thought. “*If that was possible, he would have already*.” Something was boxing in his evil. Limiting his ability to hurt other people. *Me.*

Ironically, this was when my father finally let up on me. Maybe it was because it was his gun that had gone off, which he hadn’t locked up safely. It could have been fear. Mostly, I think it was because he’d realized I’d already suffered enough. What more could a grounding or a switch do?

 I planned out my birthday, which other kids’ parents forbid them from attending. Given the circumstances, I can’t fault them. The children really were in danger. Just not from me. I had an unusual request for my parents on where I wanted our small party hosted: at a circus. Not the tortured animal kind. One of those weird experimental French things.

Ultimately, I wanted to find a mime. Not for the usual invisible rope or box tricks. When I caught up with a performer taking a break, I specified the object they needed to shape in their white gloved hands. They were in no position to say “No.”

For a palm’s width of Sacagawea dollars and a *Chuck E. Cheese* token, I received the very thing needed to end Gallowgrin’s reign of terror.

The devil hadn’t stalked me to the circus. We were spending increasing time apart. So when Gallowgrin did pop up, he’d scare me all the more. I’d stopped bringing him roadkill room service. What sustained him now was the fear he clawed out of me. By this point, he was a hairless monstrosity. Reptilian hide covered in scabs and blisters. Like a fungus, tumors sprouting from his back. The nails on his hands and feet had grown into claws.

Still, paranoia told me his eyes were always on me. If he could be invisible for everyone else, why couldn’t he also be invisible to me?

Once the mime had done their work, I hid the tool in my coat pocket. At home, I wrapped it in a cloth, hiding it in a corner of my bottom dresser. Hoping Gallowgrin wouldn’t go messing around with my clothes. I needed him ignorant of what I had, until the trap was ready. I had ample free time to plan it.

For miles in each direction, I gathered every piece of roadkill my wagon could fit. In our backyard, behind a shed, I formed the rotten matter into a mound. An offering too large for Gallowgrin to ignore.

I bided my time. Waiting for a day both my parents were out of the house. Always keeping vigil on the carrion pile.

Gallowgrin finally took the bait. Though I wanted this, had planned it out so carefully, knots still twisted in my stomach. I owned one striped shirt in my wardrobe. Before going outside, I slipped it on. Trying to look the part of a mime as much as possible without access to white greasepaint or a beret.

By the logic of childhood, it made sense that to kill an imaginary being you needed an imaginary weapon. And who better to imagine a weapon than a professional? I could see the mime knife in my hand. A short dagger, but with a sharp blade. Light glinted off its edge.

I had tested it. Stones, bricks, pieces of plywood. The thing wouldn’t cut anything of the physical world. I really had no reason to think it could injure Gallowgrin. Only faith. If that wasn’t enough, he’d retaliate. But I had no doubt that he planned to kill me someday, regardless. *This had to work*.

Gallowgrin had his back turned. His unhinged jaws drooled over the aged, sunbaked meat. I didn’t make a single wrong move. Never stepped on a crunching leaf. Even so, he detected my approach immediately.

“Don’t you dare point that weapon at me!” Gallowgrin wiped gristle off his mouth. “Remember, I’m the only friend you have, Aaron! The only friend you’ll *ever* have in your miserable life. No one else understands what a wretched, awful, pathetic baby you are, and accepts you for that.”

I wanted to yell back, but stopped myself. To talk, to respond in any audible way, would take away the magic. Actions would speak well enough. His taunts had the opposite intended effect. They didn’t break my will, but strengthened it.

Without the element of surprise, I charged. He leapt at my chest, clawing my throat and chest. I cut him across his belly. Instinctively, he retreated.

Despite being something *other*, his blood was just as red as a human’s. It came out as a thin trickle. A few drops only. But I’d proven that my weapon worked! For the first time, something had hurt him.

The realization set Gallowgrin berserk. He sprung on the small of my back. A spot I couldn’t easily reach. His crawly flesh touching mine felt awful enough before his rope tail wrapped around my throat. I choked quietly.

I was going to suffocate to death, and he would find some other child to torture and corrupt. He’d gotten heavier, true—but so had I. Being large for my age finally paid off. I let myself fall on my back. Gallowgrin slammed into the ground first. The tail’s grasp slackened. My ear barely managed to avoid being snipped off by guillotines.

I got back on my feet before Gallowgrin. Knife tip leading, I rushed forward.

But the demon was fast, and clever. He bounded away. With his tail acting as a fifth arm, he easily climbed to the top of the shed. To cut him, I’d have to throw my knife. But there’s a million ways that could go wrong, first one being that I was a terrible shot.

Spreading his arms wide, Gallowgrin swelled in size, till he was taller than me, and not slowing. Again, he jumped to my back.

I crashed to my knees. I heard my vertebrae *pop*. The imaginary blade dropped from my sweaty hand, far out of reach.

But Gallowgrin had actually made himself too heavy. When my face hit the dirt, he catapulted forward, knocking into a fence. Planks were dislodged, the post behind it splintered.

From her yard, Mrs. Dirigible screamed.  

Gallowgrin shrunk. We were the same height now.

Resisting the urge to massage my blue throat, I dived for my weapon. Gallowgrin saw the shining tip pointed at him. A point sharper than any literal blade could possess.

“You kill me, you’ll be alone for the rest of your life!”

*“So be it*,” I thought, wishing he understood. I stabbed through where a heart should be. What came out was like the hard pit of a fruit, so dark it didn’t seem to reflect light. Without the organ, Gallowgrin shrank to his original size. His feet and tail went slack. Talons raked weakly toward me. I disarmed him—literally. Both hands.

 My knife cut across his mandible, splitting his head into top and bottom halves. His tongue and lower teeth stayed attached to his neck. With no intelligence, the tongue loudly flapped.

The top of his skull hit the ground. Metal teeth ripped loose from his gums. The ears twitched, still pointing in different directions. Gallowgrin’s eyes stared up at me, glaring with hate. My thumbs gouged them out.

I became an animal, hacking up my torturer of so many years into chunks. Not neat squares. Rough, ragged members. I dragged out intestines and guts. Shattered every bone till marrow leaked out. I pulled his tail until the rope was just strings.

Once my fury wore off, I felt sick. Disgusted with myself. So much red on the lawn. Gallowgrin wanted me to be a killer. He got his wish.

During my days away in special ed, I’d tell any therapist that asked about my old pal Gal. With nothing left to lose, I held nothing back. Telling the rogue’s gallery of in-over-their-heads counselors anything they wished to hear about my imaginary enemy. The best they could do was prescribe heavy antipsychotics.

When asked why I brought a gun to school, I said it was to ward off a monster no one else could see. It went over as well as you’d think. The fucked-up headcase version of “The dog ate my homework.”

One shrink’s pet theory was I had been suffering from what’s currently known as dissociative identity disorder, but at the time was called a split personality. If so, I told her, it was just me now. The alter had left the meatsuit. I was well and truly alone.
