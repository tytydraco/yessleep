Man, what a weird night. I go with my girlfriend to get a Christmas present for her little sister and suddenly we’re all forced to leave the store because some guy I just met went into what I guess they’re gonna call some kind of coma. That’s what I had to be, right? Greg had just passed out of fucking nowhere and his eyes were as black as the sky. Usually I’m all for that kind of stuff but not like this, especially not when it leaves my girlfriend disappointed. She was really looking forward to getting something from that store and now she wouldn’t be able to. She had wanted to get a present for her sister Halle as soon as possible and told me that I could go ahead home. She kissed me on the cheek before we went our separate ways.

I would’ve said I was fine going to another store with her  but I really needed to get the weirdness of what had happened out of my mind. I decided I was gonna sleep it off and headed home. 

I did exactly what I planned to do. Once I got inside I headed straight for my bed and went to sleep. It had to be about 20 minutes later that I woke up to a loud hanging on my door.

I sat up, pretty pissed off about the knocking. “Who the hell could that be?

Getting out of my bed, I headed to the front door and opened it. I was face to face with Ron, the soldier from down the street.

“What is it, Ron?” I asked him. “I had a weird night and am trying to get some-“

Before I finished, I found myself pinned to the ground.

“Ron, what the hell, man?!”

That’s when I noticed it. Ron’s eyes were black. The same way Greg’s were. I had been too annoyed to notice when I opened the door. Ron didn’t say anything, instead just keeping the hold in and leaning his head down at me. I headbutted him and forced him to let go. I was going to punch him in the face when I found myself tackled to the ground by two of his army buddies. Their eyes were the same.

I yelled, “What the fuck is going on here?!”

“Good question my friend.”

That voice. I knew that voice. 

Tommy walked into my view, holding the doll that he had from earlier. He had a satisfied smile on his face.

“You!” I gave him a glare. “What the hell are doing?!”

“I’m doing what I’ve always wanted to do,” Tommy told me. “Give my toys a new leash on life.”

I heard Greg’s voice called out to me. Confused, my eyes wandered around. As I did, I began to hear more voices. Ron and his army buddies were also calling out to me.

My eyes went to the sword of the doll. Everytime I heard Greg’s voice, I saw it glowing.

I had no idea what the hell was happening. Tommy smirked down at me and held up three toy soldiers and that’s when I could hear Ron and the other guys clearer. That’s when I knew.

They’re souls were trapped in the toys somewhere.

“Aren’t toys just amazing?” Tommy asked. “They bring joy, fun, adventure and more. I gotta ask you something.”

He turned away from me, putting the toy soldiers back.

“How does one grow out of towns?” He asked. “How is one simply expecting to forget about them when they’re older and lock them away somewhere like they were nothing?”

“Just part of growing up I guess,” I replied. “Look, if you want to play with toys, that’s all well and good, but don’t go taking people’s souls.”

“Oh but I have too,” Tommy said. “You see, these four are all guilty of leaving  their toys behind. Anyone who does that doesn’t have a soul to begin with, so I didn’t take anything from them. I only gave the toys their cut of life after they have provided so much joy all over the world. And I’m going to keep doing that.” He turned his head back around to look at me. “And I want you to help me.”

I looked at him  like he was nuts. “What?”

Tommy bent down and looked at me. “I know your secret. I know what you are.”

My eyes widened before they narrowed at him.

“You’re a demon,” Tommy said. “I sensed you at the store. That’s why I came up to you and Greg. I had found someone who could help me with my endeavor. As for Greg well…”

He looked at the doll again. “Once his sword was in the sword, I had what I needed. Any other toy this doll touched would now be able to take the same of a human with just one touch.”

“Then you must know that I could do this,” I told him. That’s when I began to transform. My skin turning gray, my eyes red, my wings coming out of my back. I was able to take army guys off me.

Tommy backed up a bit but didn’t look scared. In fact, he was smirking. Almost like this was exactly what he wanted.

“Yes! Show me your true form. I remember fighting demons just like you with my action heroes when I was a kid. This is a dream come true for me.”

“A dream that’s going to become nightmare,” I growled at him.

He looked at me as if I disappointed him. “But don’t you see?” He titled his head and smirked again. “That’s the beauty of toys. With them it can be both.”
