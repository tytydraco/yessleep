The last thought that passed through Charles Clements mind, before choking to death on his own testicles that is, was an agony hazed combination of *“I don’t deserve this”* and *“so that’s what my balls taste like”*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The morning started as would any normal day for Charles. A quiet breakfast of scrambled eggs, coffee, and a cigarette. *“I’ll quit smoking next month”* was what he often said as he pulled a cig out of his pack of Marlboro Reds, usually uttered with a bit of chuckle and wink at no one in particular. He finished his eggs, and moved to his chair on the porch to sip his coffee and enjoy his smoke as he watched the neighborhood wake up around him. He waved to Mrs. Johnston across the street, out watering her lawn every morning like clockwork. Sasha was next door packing up his truck for the day. The Petersen kids across from him were pulling out their bikes to head off to school.

The sun crested the hills off to his east and brought a ray of warmth to the porch. As a soft breeze blew leaves across the yard, Charles couldn’t help but smile as he said quietly *“today is going to be a good day”*.

He sat and considered the day before him. Perhaps a trip to the grocery store or some other mundane errand. He had no job to speak of, nor did he necessarily need one. The home his mother left him when she died was paid off. The balance of the inheritance provided for his basic needs.

So Charles focused most of his time on his own personal pursuits. He loved his volunteer work. Mondays he worked afternoons at the soup kitchen on Maple. Thursdays were set aside for cleaning up trash along the river walk. Saturday was at the hospice facility. But Tuesdays were his favorite. Tuesdays he volunteered at the animal shelter. There was just something about tending to the needs of the animals that brought him joy. No matter the mood he was in, the kittens always made him smile.

His neighbors all loved him. He was the neighbor who would bring in your trash cans if you forgot, brought you cookies every Christmas, and always pet sat for anyone who needed it.

The hours that weren’t spent volunteering were used for his hobbies. Of those he had many. He was a collector of sorts, and he prized the many artifacts he had acquired over the years. Some hobbies he shared, others he only enjoyed alone. As he thought of the latter, his hand absentmindedly wandered up to his neck. There his fingers found one of his most prized possessions, a delicate gold ring worn on a chain. He would turn it over in his fingers and it would remind him of the beautiful soul who had once worn it. The ring always made him happy. He would picture her face in his mind. The smell of her hair. The feel of her skin underneath his fingers. Then she was gone, with the ring all he had to remember her.

A normal person would feel sadness at that loss. But Charles was not a normal person. He saw death as a part of life. The endless cycle of beginning and ending. He had seen so many lives end throughout his life, but he always saw it as a natural process. He viewed it as a necessary transition. Something to be embraced and even fostered.

Charles snapped out of his wistful reverie and decided it was time to get on with his day.

Later that morning, as he walked to his car to head out, he stopped briefly as an overwhelming feeling of unease filled his stomach. It was just a momentary pause, but he could have sworn he was being watched. As he sat down in the driver’s seat, the feeling returned. This time brought on by the faint smell of whiskey that seemed to hang in the air. Charles never drank whiskey. In fact, he never drank anything. He always wanted his senses sharp and to be in control of how he felt. He debated heading back inside and putting off his trip to the store, but then reconsidered, chalking the feelings up to his overactive imagination.

An hour or so later, as Charles climbed his front steps with an arm full of groceries, he noticed the mat on his front door was slightly askew. A normal person would not have noticed something so small being off. But Charles was not a normal person. Life had taught him to observe everything around him and that mild paranoia can save your life. He cautiously reached out for his front door, and to his relief, found it locked. He unlocked it and slowly walked into his house.

As he entered the foyer, the skin on the back of his neck began to heat up and he knew in his gut that something was off. He set the groceries down quietly in the middle of the floor and crept up the stairs to check his study. The exterior padlock that held the door fast was still in place, and Charles breathed a sigh of relief. Some of the most valuable items in his various collections were in that room, and it often served as his hobby room. So long as that room was safe, anything else could be replaced.

He wandered both floors of the house starting at the top, quietly taking a mental inventory in each room. He was looking for something, anything, that was gone or out of place. But he found nothing until he reached the kitchen. There, sitting on his dining room table was a pair of pink baby shoes. As soon as he saw them, Charles froze. His initial shock and panic subsided relatively quickly as he was certain that no one was still in his home.

Walking up to the table, he reached out and picked them up. They were old and dirty and smelled of musty earth. Charles sat at the table and simply stared at them for a very long time. He tapped into his near perfect memory and tried desperately to figure out the significance of these shoes. But he came up completely blank. He couldn’t think of a single reason these would mean something to him or anyone else… and that made him more nervous than anything. He bagged up the shoes and took them upstairs to his study, carefully placing them in one of the drawers he reserved for items he planned on giving attention to when he had more time.

A normal person would have called the police to report the break in. But Charles was not a normal person. As much respect as he had for law enforcement, Charles didn’t like people in his home. For now, he resolved to stick close for a few days just to make sure this violation of his space and privacy didn’t repeat itself. Days went by and Charles resumed his normal routine. Soon, he had forgotten about the shoes.

The following Saturday, Charles returned home from a long shift at the hospice facility. A older gentleman he had spent some time with over the last few weeks had passed, and of course Charles was with him at the end. He smiled as he remembered it. He was always happy when he was able to ease someone into the next life. As soon as he hit the first step of his porch, the same burning feeling hit him on the back of his neck. That’s when he saw them. Muddy footprints leading up the steps and disappearing behind his front door. The feet were small, a woman most likely. The unease he felt when he found the baby shoes returned in force.

As he unlocked the door and slowly walked inside, his nose was met with the same musty earth smell he had gotten from the baby shoes. The footprints continued through the hardwood floor of his foyer and through the living room to the back door. Charles once again ran upstairs to double check the lock on his study, and once again, his panic subsided somewhat as he saw it still shut tight. Coming back downstairs, he followed the prints to the back door and out into the small fenced in back yard.

There, in the center of his neatly manicured grass, was a rectangular patch of freshly turned earth. At the head of the of the rectangle was exactly what one would expect. A small marble headstone. On the headstone, in large block letters, was:

***CHARLES CRAIG CLEMENTS***

***1964 – 2021***

An acidic burning filled his stomach and Charles thought he might pass out for a moment. He quickly recovered his senses and followed the small muddy footprints over to the grave. The headstone was professionally made and no doubt cost a pretty penny. Just for his own sanity, Charles immediately went to his garage and found a shovel. As he suspected, the grave was empty… for now.

A normal person would have contacted the police to report this threatening type of vandalism. But Charles was not a normal person. He spent the next two hours meticulously cleaning the footprints off his floor and tidying up his back yard. He left the headstone where it was, uncertain what to do with it.

Later that night, he sat in his study looking over some of the more valuable items in his collection, as that usually calmed him when he was restless. But instead of calm, his mind raced. His attention kept turning to the headstone in the backyard, which he could clearly see from his study window. He had no enemies that he knew of. No one that would go to such lengths to unnerve and intimidate him. As the ensuing days passed, the feeling of unease never truly went away. He tried to just go about his normal daily life, but he was always on edge. He wasn’t sleeping well and he continually had the feeling that he was being watched.

Tuesday morning rolled around, and Charles woke up just as exhausted as he had the previous few days. But knowing it was Tuesday lifted his spirits a bit. Tuesdays was the animal shelter, and he really needed the kittens to improve his mood.

That afternoon, as he arrived at the animal shelter for his volunteer shift, the feeling of unease returned. He felt eyes on him as he parked his car and walked in the front door. Even the friendly greeting from the fresh-faced receptionist didn’t assuage it. He went to the staff locker room, changed into his coveralls, and got to work. After cleaning out the dog pens, he spent time with a litter of stray kittens, tending to their needs, holding them each in turn. There was something about feeling that small fast heartbeat against his palms that soothed his soul. Before he knew it, his shift was over and it was time to head home.

As he went back to the staff lockers to change, he could have sworn he got a whiff of the same smell. As he opened his locker to put away his overalls, there, sitting on the shelf, was a picture of… ***her***. He stopped breathing as soon as he saw it, cautiously taking the old picture in his hands. He had no surviving photos of her. He had hundreds of photos of her before, but after she died he had purged all of them. He had gotten rid of everything except for the ring – which he was now instinctively rubbing between his fingers.

She was younger in the photo than the last time he saw her. It was obviously some sort of family event. She was sitting, smiling at the camera, looking beautiful in her youthful exuberance. As happy as he felt seeing her face again, he was instantly filled with panic.

It had been more than ten years since she died. No one knew about them. ***No one***. Yet here she was, in his locker.

Charles put the picture in his pocket, closed the door to his locker, and walked out of the shelter. His panic was rapidly rising. This combined with all the other things that had been happening lately gave him an overwhelming feeling of dread. As he walked to his car, his mind ran through all of the scenarios that could have brought that picture to him… and none of them ended well.

When Charles arrived at his house, he knew something was wrong. The front window drapes were closed and he distinctly remembered opening them to let the morning light in. He knew someone had been there, again. Charles was no longer scared. Now, he was angry.

He rushed from the car to the front door and threw the door open. As soon as he walked into the foyer he froze. They were everywhere. Plastered to the walls, on the floor, stuck to the furniture. There must have been thousands of them.

They were flyers for a missing person. There, under the large block letters of “Have You Seen Me?” was the picture that he now carried in his pocket. His mind was taken back more than a decade. These had been on every telephone pole and in every shop window in the days following her disappearance. But why here? Now? Charles was afraid, and he prided himself on never being afraid. He needed to disappear for a while and figure out what the hell was happening.

He didn’t even pack a bag. Just turned on his heels and rushed out the door to this car. As he was walking, Charles was aware of someone behind him. That moment of recognition was brief, however. The next second brought the searing white pain of a blow to the back of his head… followed only by darkness.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When Charles awoke, he was instantly aware of the fact that he could not see anything or move his body. As the cobwebs cleared from his trauma addled brain, he could feel the restraints against his skin and what he could only assume was duct tape against his eyes. He was naked and laying spread eagle on a cold surface. His head throbbed and his tongue tasted the irony copper of his own blood.

As his senses returned, he smelled it again. That faint odor of whiskey. He slowly tried working his hands against the restraints, trying to be as quiet and inconspicuous as possible. His eyes were still covered, and he didn’t know who or what was watching him. But his stealth was in vain.

*“Awake already, are we?”* spoke a deep disembodied male voice.

Charles could feel the malevolence in the voice as it washed over him. He lay still, hoping that his calm would pay off.

*“Come on now. We both know full well you are awake.”* the voice said, somehow managing to mix both humor and hatred in his tone.

*“Who are you? Why am I here? What do you* ***want***\*?!” Charles asked quietly. His veneer of calm cracked a bit with the last question.

A gruff laugh came from the unseen captor, but it lacked any kind of genuine amusement. *“I wonder Charles… how many people have asked you the same question over the years? Under different circumstances, I would find the irony funny.”*

Charles could hear the voice coming closer as it spoke. A moment later a hand reached down and ripped the duct tape from his face. It took a decent portion of Charles eyelashes, eyebrows, and no small amount of skin. After a brief whelp, Charles was able to finally open his eyes. A few blinks later, he was able to look over and see his captor. He was sitting on a barstool just a few feet away, his back leaning against what looked to be a workbench of some sort. He appeared to be in his forties with salt and pepper hair, an unshaven face, and a look that was part exhaustion part sadness.

*“Who are you?!”* Charles squeaked.

He gave a half smile before standing up. *“Names aren’t really necessary are they Charles. You didn’t know most of their names did you? But since you and I will be spending some time together, you can call me… Rog”* he said before turning his back to Charles and rummaging through what lay on the workbench.

*“I don’t know you! Why am I here?”* Charles croaked.

Rog whirled around as if the statement had insulted him. *“Don’t know me?! Oh, my dear Charles, you and I have been linked for over a decade. No one, and I mean NO ONE, has had as big of an impact on my life as you have.”* He then turned his back to Charles and once again began fiddling with something on the workbench. Charles began to panic as he wracked his brain trying to find any hint of the name, face… anything. But he found nothing. He did not know this man.

When Rog turned around, he held something in his hand. It was the chain and small gold ring Charles wore around his neck.

***“THAT. IS. MINE!!!”*** Charles exploded with a barely contained fury. *“That is special to me! Put it down right now or so help me I will…”*

*“Or what?”* Rog interrupted as he rushed over to be almost nose to nose with Charles. *“What are you going to do?!* ***YOU GOING TO TORTURE AND KILL ME?”***

The last statement was screamed at a volume that made Charles wince a bit. That smell was there too. Whiskey. Not on his breath, but on his sweat. Like it was seeping out of his pores. Rog quickly caught himself and stood erect, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. He walked slowly back to his stool and sat down before continuing. He held that delicate little piece of jewelry in his fingers, looking at it with eyes blurred by tears.

*“This is special to me too”* he said quietly.

A sudden realization hit Charles, and with it, a sickening knot in the pit of his stomach.

*“I gave this to her when we were first dating…”* Rog said as he strained to keep his voice even. *“After we were married and she had a real ring, she still never took this one off.”*

*“Do you know how long it took me to find you?”* he asked mostly rhetorically. *“It has been nearly ten years. I’ve hunted and searched and spent every cent I had to figure out who took her. I knew…* ***I KNEW…*** *with enough time and resources I could solve it. You covered your tracks well; I will give you that. But I was able to do what the police could never do. It’s amazing what healthy doses of hatred and self-loathing can get you to accomplish”.*

Rog took a deep breath as he held the small trinket in his hand.

*“Most nights, I pass out cuddling a whiskey bottle, thinking of the last time I saw her. She smiled that beautiful smile of hers as she walked out the door. I remember telling her to be careful… When I sleep, my nightmares are always the same. They force me to relive that moment over and over. To see her walking out to go shopping and me knowing that she won’t be back. Knowing what’s going to happen to her, but unable to stop her…”* he trailed off.

The sickening knot in Charles stomach began to spread as he slowly started to realize how well and truly fucked he was.

***“She was beautiful! Perfect!”*** Charles screeched out as his mask of calm finally crumbled. ***“I helped her! Because of me she will be that way forever!”***

Rog roared as he launched himself off the chair. He grabbed the side of the table holding the bound man and with the twist of a knob he was able to pull the table upright. Now, face to face, Rog screamed ***“HELPED HER?!”***. Charles could see the rage burning in the other man's eyes.

He then took a step back, closed his eyes, and visibly took a deep breath. *“Can’t go losing my temper and ending the fun early can I now. Worked way too long for this to have it spoiled.”*

*“You murdered her you sick fuck”* he continued. *“You took your fucking time doing it too. The police told me she was probably alive for three days after you kidnapped her."*

Rog took a deep breath and smiled in a way that made Charles shiver. "*I wonder… do you think we can last that long?”*

Charles began to sob.

*“Do you know what she was on her way home from when you took her?”* Rog asked with a genuine earnest. All Charles could do was stare blankly as his body shook with stifled cries.

*“Shopping for baby clothes”* Rog said softly.

A normal person would have felt pity for the naked and shivering Charles Clements. But Rog was not a normal person. That normal person had died a decade ago when he lost everything that he loved in life. The shadow of a person he was now felt nothing but hatred as he turned around and went back to the workbench. In his now upright position, Charles could now see the bench clearly. It held an assortment of tools akin to what you would see in a horror movie version of a 19th century surgical theater. He started to hyperventilate at the sight.

*“You know what today is Charles?”* he asked as he turned around with a particularly menacing set of clamps and a large scalpel.

*“Today would have been my daughter's 10th birthday."* He slowly walked over until he was again face to face with Charles. *"Let’s wish her a happy birthday shall we?”.*
