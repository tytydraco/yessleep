I work salvage in Arizona, out in Mogollon Rim country. I wouldn’t blame you if you hadn’t heard of it. From above it looks like a dense forest, but on the ground, it’s high desert hiding under scraggly Ponderosa pines. Dry dirt, sharp rocks, prickly cacti, and more than a few abandoned properties. One of them—a busted old dairy farm—fell into my lap when the county hired us to clear it out.

In my line of work, I’ve seen my fair share of strange shit—creepy photos in attics, old letters tucked behind walls, the occasional dead animal. But on this job…I came across something else. Something dangerous. Something that didn’t belong.

It started like any other project: hauling scrap and wood by the truckload from a sprawl of barns and sheds. Blisters, rusted nails, the usual. About a week in, as we were wrapping up, I spotted a shed I hadn’t touched, way out by the treeline.

The roof sagged and the door hung half off. Inside, weeds poked through the floorboards. Nothing special—except for a single corrugated metal panel on the back wall that didn’t match the rest. Looked like it’d been slapped on later.

I pried it loose, and behind it was another room. Musty, dark, and untouched for God knows how long. A worktable sat in the corner, draped in a dusty tarp. I pulled it off.

There it was.

A machine. About the size of a portable generator. Thick iron, rust flaking off, like it’d been waiting a long time. A wide mouth lined with interlocking teeth. Grinning like a busted shredder, only smaller. Built for something…personal. No cord, no fuel tank, just a single toggle switch.

I couldn’t place it. Parts looked familiar, but the whole? Wrong. There were two holes and a faded outline of a nameplate on the front—someone had pried it off long ago. The more I stared, the less it made sense. Still, my gut told me it mattered.

The switch didn’t do shit. The whole thing was smooth like a stone worn down by water, except for a thin slot on one side. Couldn’t tell if it was an input or an output. Then my eye snagged on a tiny rivet, a hinge nearly invisible under the rust. My heart jumped.

I pried it open. Two things fell out: a yellowed scrap of paper…and a bone. The paper was frayed, ready to crumble. I flipped it over. Written there, jagged and desperate, were the words:

**GRIND TO FEED. LISTEN TO LEARN.**

Instructions. Or a warning. I should’ve walked away; instead, I took it home.

That night, I looked it over again. Picked up the bone. Too big for a bird, and it wasn’t from a deer. A nasty thought crossed my mind. I held it up to my index finger. Same size.

Grind to feed.

I dropped it into the machine’s mouth. Click. A single amber light pulsed. No power source, no fuel, yet somehow…it was awake.

I threw the switch. The machine groaned and rattled, its teeth grinding the bone to dust in no time. Heat and the smell of burning oil filled the trailer. Then, silence. Except for a low purr deep inside. A blast of hot air shot from the side slot, and I yanked my hand back.

Out popped a rectangle, cream-colored and about the size of a business card. Warm to the touch, thin and brittle, with jagged edges. Burned into it like a cattle brand were the words:

**FORTUNE AWAITS BENEATH THE WHEEL OF RED.**

All that buildup, just for a fortune from some ancient piece of carnival junk. I tossed the card in the trash and forgot about it.

Until the next day.

I met Rook at La Casita de la Montaña. Told him I’d buy him lunch to celebrate finishing the job. He didn’t ask about the machine, so I kept my mouth shut. Felt dumb getting so excited over it, all for nothing.

After we ate, I was heading back to my truck when I saw it. An old silver Toyota with a splash of red paint across the front tire. My brain snapped straight to the fortune card: the wheel of red.

Stupid. I knew it. But I waltzed across the parking lot anyway. Crouched down, saw nothing at first—just asphalt. Then, white, peeking out from underneath. An envelope.

My pulse shot up. I snatched it, tucked it under my arm, and bolted to the truck, waiting until I was inside the cab to open it.

It was full of cash—a thick stack of fifties and hundreds. Two grand, easy. My brain nearly shorted out. That damn machine was right.

I know how this sounds, but I couldn’t stop myself. I got greedy. Went shopping with that cash, picking up new work boots and a sturdy chore coat. On the way home, I grabbed a bucket of fried chicken. Part dinner, part experiment.

I ate as much as I could stomach, saving the rest for the machine. Bones are bones, right?

Same as before, it whirred to life, gnawed through the leftovers, and spat out a card. Only this time, it wasn’t so crisp. It was ragged, moth-eaten, and almost see-through.

**ONLY A HUMAN TRIBUTE SHALL OPEN THE PATH.**

So much for easy.

I mulled it over, and the next morning I paid a visit to my old friend Mary, the local taxidermist. Back when I first started in salvage, she and her husband used to toss me odd hauling jobs. Helped keep me afloat. 

I asked if she ever came upon any bones in her line of work. Of course she did. Then I asked about human ones. She gave me a look, but said her husband found a femur hunting in the Sitgreaves. Maybe Apache.

She brought it out like it was nothing, said they weren’t doing anything with it. I tried to pay her, but she waved me off. I took that bone knowing full well what I was about to do wasn’t right. There were laws for this kinda thing, whole systems meant to handle it properly. This wasn’t just a bone—it was something sacred. And yet, I couldn’t stop thinking about the next card it might spit out.

Back at the trailer park, I ran into my neighbor Wade loading furniture into the back of his truck. Late on rent, he said—the property manager was giving him the boot. Swore he’d had the money, about two grand in an envelope, but he lost it on the way to pay him.

The goddamn envelope. Shit.

I felt awful. No way in hell was I telling him, though. I offered a few hundred to help him cover part of it. He said I had the Lord in me, said it was mighty kind, but he’d manage.

Back inside, I had second thoughts. What if the machine wasn’t just handing me luck? What if it was a trade—one thing for another? I went back and forth, but after all the trouble to get that femur, I figured I might as well see it through.

The machine didn’t hesitate. Even though the femur was bigger than the first bones, it gobbled it up no problem. And then came the card:

**A FLAME EXTINGUISHED BURNS ANEW.**

Had no idea what the hell it meant, but I decided to wait and see.

Not a few hours later, my phone buzzed. It was my ex, Marlie, inviting me to a kickback at the place of an old high school friend, Luke.

I headed over and found his little cabin on the edge of town, weeds eating the yard like I remembered it. String lights in the windows tried for cozy but landed somewhere closer to sad. Ten years on, and it was still the same crew of burnouts hanging around.

Marlie and I caught up over a couple of beers. She talked about her gardening job and how she was pretty much done with her boyfriend, Rhett. I told her about salvage work and how I’d come into some money. I left around one, figuring I’d see her again soon.

But I wouldn’t. The next morning, my phone blew up with texts from her best friend Sierra. Marlie was in the hospital. After I’d left, Rhett had shown up, drunk and mean. Broken ribs, a concussion, and a busted lip. That’s when I started wondering if the bad outweighed the good with this thing.

That same morning, Rook and I were at a job site—trash haul. Boring work. I was still down about what’d happened to Marlie, thinking I should visit her at the hospital. But Rook wouldn’t shut up about my new clothes, and I let it slip about the machine. Big mistake. That was all the invitation he needed, unleashing a million questions, starting with when and how he could use it.

I explained the problem with the fuel. Human bones ain’t exactly lying around, and I wasn’t about to become a murderer just for another crack at a fortune. But Rook, lazy as he was, could always dream up a master plan when it suited him. That night, he said we’d go to the local cemetery. Dig somebody up.

So he dragged me there in his beat-up old sedan in the dead of night. I ain’t proud, but if it counts for anything, I was more accessory than mastermind. Nervous as hell about getting caught, I made sure to pick a grave that was old and beaten down, with no decorations. Somebody no one would miss.

Digging in caliche is brutal work. Still, we got the bones, and reburied what was left of the poor bastard.

By the time we got back to the trailer, Rook was raring to go. His fortune read:

**RICHES SHALL COME BY THE HANDFUL.**

Might’ve done less damage handing him a loaded gun than that card. That night changed everything…and after it, I never saw him again.

What happened next, I only pieced together from friends and a few frantic texts from Rook himself. The night after his fortune, at his weekly poker game, he won big. Too big. Things went south when someone accused him of cheating. Words were exchanged, then fists. He knocked someone out cold, but the guy must’ve hit his head wrong on the fall, because he never got back up. With his rap sheet, Rook figured running was easier than facing the music, and he bolted.

That was the last straw. I was done with that stupid machine. Shoved it into the back of my closet and wrapped it in a blanket, thinking that was the end of it.

A few nights later, I woke up to that awful burnt-oil stink and a bright orange light seeping through the closet slats. The machine was rumbling low and steady. No clue how the hell it turned itself on.

I slid out of bed and opened the closet. The blanket was lit up like a lantern, then it dimmed and went quiet again with one last sizzle, almost like it hissed at me. I peeked underneath and found a new card, still warm:

**THE BARGAIN IS BINDING.**

I hadn’t made a damn bargain. At least, I didn’t think I had. But it didn’t seem to care what I thought.

Weeks went by. I kept it locked away, hoping ignoring it would work. Then, one evening after a job, I came home to my front door wide open. The closet was empty. No blanket, no scorch marks, no sign it’d ever existed at all.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t glad to be rid of it. But unleashing that thing on the world made me sick with guilt.

I drove past the old dairy farm, thinking about stopping in to see what was left in that shack. An explanation. Anything. But the county folks had already come through and leveled it all. Guy at the gas station said they’re gonna build a strip mall there. Maybe a new dollar store.

Soon enough, the town started whispering, as small towns do. People disappearing. Fires that made no sense. Accidents too strange to be natural. And Rook—people would spot him skulking around town, only for him to vanish before the cops could catch him.

Did he take it? Offer it more bones? How far would he go to keep it satisfied?

I don’t know. But every time I close my eyes, I feel it. Watching. And sometimes I swear I hear a faint whirring in the back of my mind, like it’s reminding me of the bargain I never asked to make. I ain’t much for religion anymore, but believe me, I pray harder than ever that I never see it again.
