As your reading this I’m in grave danger please find help! I am typing this on phone I just found. It all started with An innocent party.


It was my fifteenth birthday. I was so exited for it! It would be so fun! Or so I thought… I woke up so energized for the day! Todays my birthday after all. 


I woke up went to the kitchen where my mom told me “ good morning! Happy birthday sweetheart! “ I just replied “ morning! “ I was so exited I thought it would be the best day ever. But it was only the beginning.


We decided to have my party at dark. I invited all my friends over for a sleepover. As it soon went to noon I started getting everything prepared. My mom unfortunately couldn’t stay she had a business trip to attend to. So before she left she told me “ be safe you don’t know what can happen here. And my present will be in the kitchen cabinet love you! “ 


If you didn’t know there was a lot of mysterious murders happening around here. But I’ll be safe I thought to myself. My friends said they’ll come over at eight so I had some time alone to myself.


But I got a little hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack. I could have sworn I saw someone in the window. He had a pale face black hair might have been dark brown but I couldn’t tell. I blamed it on my over active imagination. But I was paranoid of course.

It soon turned to eight and my friends texted me saying there on there way. Everything was set up but I started wondering if who I saw was really just my imagination… 


As I heard loud knocking I thought it was weird my friends only texted me a few minutes ago. I was about to go open it. When I heard a ping a text message from them. They say they’ll be there in five minutes. 


I got so scared I jumped. But as I was thinking if I should call the police. I calmed down of course someone’s knocking. My mom orders a lot of packages and it could be a nearby neighbor. Soon the knocking stopped I calmed down. A few minutes after that happened. My friends texted me that they are here. 


I got up and with a smile on my face opened the door there they where! My best friend Emma said “ happy birthday I’m so happy for you “ and my other friend rose said “ did you hear of the murders… “ in a mysterious voice. I shook my head yes. She told me “ I heard that he goes out for Girls like you… “ I got nervous but then she laughed which calmed me down and said “ I’m just kidding he won’t go after us! “ i was relieved 


We had fun as it started to turn dark. I decided I wanted to take a break outside. 


Then I heard Noises in the bushes. Then footsteps coming towards me. I didn’t see anyone thought.

So I ran inside and locked the door. My friends asked if I was ok which I replied “ of course I am “ I tried to be calm while saying that but they could tell I wasn’t. Emma told me “ it’s ok you can tell us anything “ I smiled and told her “ I just thought I heard footsteps coming towards me “ they all agreed I was probably over reacting. 

It soon became ten so I decided to open my presents. I opened them but remembered about my moms gift. So I just said to my friends “ I’ll be right back I’ll get my moms gift stay here! “ I was walking happily towards the kitchen. 


I went there and took a sigh of relief when I saw nobody was there. I started thinking maybe I did just have a hallucination. I got my gift and as I was closing the cabinet. I heard pounding on the window. I tried to run but I couldn’t I couldn’t do anything just scream. My whole body just stood there as the pounds became louder and louder. 


My friends ran then it just stopped I started screaming “ I WANNA LEAVE PLEASE “ my friends became a bit more concerned and scared. But Rose just said “ there’s a lot of crazy people here it’ll probably be fine.. “ 


My friend Lucy tried calming me down. We wanted to leave but we couldn’t get hold of anyone and it’s a lot more dangerous in the street. Especially for girls like us! 


I opened my moms gift to try to help but I still couldn’t calm down. We got a lot more cautious after that. But soon we decided to go to bed. It was ten thirty so kinda late. took me a while but I was able to fall asleep at twelve forty five. 


I soon woke up to hear pounding on the door. It was 3:55 My friends heard it too. I went to call the police but our phones where dead. And the electricity had gone out a few Hours ago. We could try to sneak out from the window. But it’s too risky we could fall and most windows are in the front off the house where the murderer was. So he would catch us.

The pounding became Louder and louder. Then he got inside the house as I saw him I got more fearful then ever before. I thought I killed my dad years ago..
