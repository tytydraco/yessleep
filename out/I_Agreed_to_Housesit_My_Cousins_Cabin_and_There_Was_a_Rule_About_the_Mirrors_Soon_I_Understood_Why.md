I’ve known my cousin Mara my entire life. She invited me to housesit at her cabin for a weekend. I thought it would be a weekend of fishing and board games and late night movies. I arrived on a Friday afternoon and the place felt quiet and cozy at first.

The cabin sat beside a still lake. Tall pines crowded its sides and they swayed in a slow rhythm in the wind. The air smelled of cedar and damp earth. The floorboards creaked underfoot as I stepped inside. Mara greeted me at the door. She looked tired. Her smile was quick and nervous.

“Thanks for coming,” she said. Her voice was low. She dropped her bag on the floor. She held the door open. “Just one thing. There’s a weird rule here.”

I pulled off my shoes. I shrugged. “Okay. What is it?”

“No mirrors in your room after midnight. Cover them or face the wall. No questions.” She sounded firm.

I laughed. “Got it. No mirrors.”

Her eyes followed me into the cabin. She nodded and closed the door behind me. I heard the bolt slide home.

Inside, the place felt normal. The living room had a stone fireplace and a long couch. On the walls there were paintings of the lake and the woods. A kitchen sat at one end of the room. A little hallway led to two bedrooms. My room was the one at the far end. A large mirror leaned against the wall. I could see my own nervous face in it.

That night we made pasta. We drank a cheap white wine. We talked about school and old family trips. When the clock ticked ten Mara yawned and stood up.

“I’m going to bed,” she said. Her voice was small.

“Hold up,” I said. “Show me the mirror.”

She followed me down the hallway. We stood by the tall glass. I pulled a blanket off the bed and tossed it over the mirror. It fell in a soft heap on the floor. I stepped back.

“Good?” she asked.

“Perfect,” I said. I threw the blanket aside.

She walked back into her room and closed the door. I heard her lock it. Then I heard her say good night.

I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling. The only sound was the wind through the trees and an old moth fluttering by the window. I felt calm and sleepy. I closed my eyes.

I woke up at around midnight. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. My body felt frozen. Something tapped on the wall behind me. Soft. Slow. Steady. Tap. Tap. Tap.

I shot upright. My eyes darted to the corner. The blanket lay in a crumpled pile. The mirror stood bare and shining in the dim moonlight. The tapping came again. It was coming from the glass itself. The blanket rustled. It slipped down the frame as if pushed by a faint wind.

My breath caught. I forced my legs over the side of the bed. My feet touched the cold wood floor. I took a step toward the mirror. My eyes fixed on the blank surface. My reflection stared back. Then another shape emerged behind me. A shadow so close it almost pressed against the glass.

I spun around. The room was empty. My heart hammered. I backed toward the door. A voice drifted down the hall.

“Isn’t anyone home?”

It sounded like Mara. Friendly. Light. But it was twisted. Warped. As if heard through a submarine hull.

I stumbled into the hallway. The door to her room was closed and locked. I pounded on it.

“Mara! Let me in!”

No answer. Only silence. I froze. My skin felt tight. My eyes darted back to my room. The door swung on its hinges. The moonlight spilled across the floor.

I turned and ran for the front door. I yanked it open. The porch was empty. The air was still. The pines stood silent. No shadow. No figure.

I slammed the door shut and locked it. My breath came in short gasps. I sank to the floor. I leaned my head against the door. I stared at the lock. My legs shook.

A sudden thought came to me. The mirrors. The rule. I cursed myself. Why did I ignore the warning? Why did I move the blanket?

I stood up. My mind snapped to action. I grabbed my phone. I flipped on the flashlight. I made my way to the bedroom. Each step felt like walking on thin ice.

I pushed the door open. The mirror waited. The glass was cracked. A spiderweb of lines spread across its surface. My breath froze. The moonlight revealed a dark shape behind the cracks. It moved. In a shiver of shadows the shape pressed its face against the glass. Its eyes were wide dark holes. It smiled. A smile that sliced the mirror in two.

I screamed. The thing inside the mirror leaned closer. Its fingers trailed along the back of the glass. It left wet streaks of something dark. It tapped again. Tap. Tap. Tap. Closer. Harder.

I stumbled back. My heart pounded. I slammed the door behind me. I locked it.

I heard footsteps in the hallway. Heavy slow steps. They approached my door. I pressed my back against it. My hands shook. My breath was ragged.

The steps stopped. A soft voice came through the wood.

“Open up. I brought you juice.”

The voice was mine. My own mother’s voice. Gentle like I remembered when I was small. It called me home. My chest twisted. I felt a wave of longing. I wanted to open the door. To step out. To go back to my childhood. I wanted that more than anything.

I caught myself. I shook my head. No. I was not going to fall for it. I clutched the flashlight. I braced my feet.

“The juice is warm,” it whispered. “You must be hungry.”

I answered. My voice was a dry croak. “No thanks.”

The figure sighed. A long sad breath. I heard its nails scrape the wood. Tap. Tap. Tap.

I counted in my mind. One two three. Then I lunged for the door. I threw myself against the frame and slammed my shoulder into it. The wood groaned. The voice shrieked. A terrible sound that twisted metal.

I rattled the bolt free. The door swung open and I tumbled into the hallway. I landed on my knees. The hallway was empty. Glow of the flashlight carved a path ahead. I crawled to the living room. Floorboards creaked under me.

The living room felt empty. The windows dark. I saw the two small mirrors over the fireplace. They were cracked. Shattered glass glinted on the floor. The mirror in the guest room was gone. Only splinters remained.

I heard a muffled cry from the kitchen. I ran. I found Mara hunched by the sink. Her hands were pressed to her cheeks. Her eyes were red.

“I messed up,” she said. Her words tumbled out. “I thought I could fix it. But it’s too strong now.”

I pressed the back of my hand to my mouth. I swallowed down a fresh wave of fear.

She pointed to the window. “Look.”

Outside the kitchen window the moonlight showed a tall thing under the birch tree. It crouched low. It had no face. Just a dark mass. It rose. Its limbs unfolded in sharp angles. Its head was a broken mirror that dripped black fluid. It wore a smile of fractured glass.

My breath stopped. My legs felt like jelly.

Mara grabbed my arm. “Run.”

We bolted through the back door into the woods. Cold wind bit our faces. The thing pursued. I heard its feet crash through the underbrush. I heard its tortured scream.

We did not stop until the cabin was a bright dot behind the trees. We collapsed in a mossy clearing. Mara sobbed. I panted.

At dawn we crept back. The cabin doors hung open. Inside every mirror lay in broken shards. No trace of the thing. Only its echo. A soft whisper in the empty rooms.

Mara dropped to her knees. She gathered pieces of glass. She pressed them to her chest. Her tears fell on the floor. She looked at me. Her eyes were hollow.

“We broke its prison,” she whispered. “We made it whole again.”

I helped her gather the last shards. Each piece cut at my palm. The pain was sharp. It felt real.

We stepped outside. The air was cool. The sun rose over the lake. Its pale light touched the water. The cabin stood silent. A place of broken promises.

Mara and I walked away without looking back. We left the shards scattered on the floor. We left the mirrors to the dark thing that now roamed free. We left the cabin to whatever it became.

I have not heard from Mara since. I keep waiting for a message. A call. Anything.

I try to tell myself it was a one time thing. That the wraith will never find me.

But late at night I catch my reflection in a shop window. I see my face. My hollow eyes. And I hear a soft tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

I cover the glass with my hand. I close my eyes. I walk on. I pray it does not remember me.
