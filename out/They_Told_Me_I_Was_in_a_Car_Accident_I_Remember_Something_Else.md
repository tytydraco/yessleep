**I was attending an art show when I saw it, the latest work by an avant-garde sculptor. “It's a series. He calls them *idols*,” a friend explained. Seeing its revolting, tumorlike essence, I was sent spiraling silently into my own repressed past...**

I felt a sting—

When I turned to look, a woman wearing a calf's head was removing a needle from my arm.

My body went numb.

I was lifted, carried to one of a dozen slabs radiating out from a central stone altar, and set down.

Looking up, I saw: the stars in the night sky, obscured by dark, slowly swaying branches, and masked animal faces gazing at me. Someone held an axe, and while others held me down—left arm fully extended—the axeman brought the blade down, cleaving me at the shoulder.

*A sharp pain.*

***The world suddenly white, a ringing in my ears,*** before nighttime returned, and chants and drumming replaced the ringing.

*A physical sensation of body-lack.*

I was forced up—seated.

***The stench of burning flesh:*** my own, as a torch was held to my stub, salve applied, and I was wrapped in bandages.

Meanwhile, my severed arm had been brought to the altar and heaped upon a hill of other limbs and flesh.

Insects buzzed.

Moths chased the very flames that killed them.

The chanting stopped.

From within the surrounding forests—black as distilled nothing—a figure emerged. Larger than human, it was cloaked in robes whose purple shined in the flickering torchlight. It shambled toward the altar, stopped ***and screeched.***

At that: *the cries of children*, as three had been released, being driven forward by whips.

I tried—*tried to scream*—but I was still too numbed, and the only sound I managed was a weak and pitiful braying.

The children stopped at the foot of the hill of limbs, forced to their knees.

*Shaking.*

—of their hearts and bodies, and of the world, and all of us in it. The drumming was relentless. The chanting, now resumed, inhuman. Several masked men approached the figure at the altar, and pulled away its robes, revealing a naked creature with the body of a disfigured, corpulent human and the oversized head of an owl.

It began to feast.

On the limbs and flesh before it, and on the kneeling children, stabbing and cracking with its beak, pulling them apart—***eating them alive…***

When it had finished, and the altar was clean save for the stains of blood, the creature stood, and bellowed, and from its bowels were heard the subterranean screams of its victims. Then it gagged and slumped forward, and unto the altar regurgitated a single mass of blackness, bones and hair.

This, three masked men took.

*And the creature…*

**I awoke in the hospital, missing my left arm. I was informed I'd been in a car accident, and my arm had been amputated after getting crushed by the vehicle. The driver had died, as had everyone in the other vehicle involved: a single mother and her [three children.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)**
