I stared at the photo for a long time. Long enough for my tea to go cold, untouched beside me.

Grace, cross-legged on the bed. Same pyjamas she wore the night before she died—blue and white stripes, fraying at the wrists. Her face was soft, neutral, like she’d just said something under her breath and was waiting for me to laugh.

She shouldn’t have been there.

Not in that room. Not in that photograph. Not now.

••

The camera had been a charity shop find. Grace used to brag about it. 

*“Thirty-five quid and some stranger’s holiday photos still inside.”*

She’d spent weeks learning how to load it, develop her own film in the uni darkroom. Said digital was too clean, too sharp. 

*“Real things have grain.”*

It had been sitting on her desk when I went to clear out the room. Heavy in the hand. The film still loaded.

On a whim, I took one photo of the empty space. Just the room, like a memorial. A kind of goodbye.

But when I picked up the prints from the lab in town, she was in it.

No double exposure. No mistake.

Just Grace.

••

I kept it hidden in my drawer for two days.

I’d check it sometimes at night, when I couldn’t sleep. Just to make sure she was still there. That I hadn’t dreamed it. But each time it was the same—her, sitting quietly, looking at me.

It didn’t feel like a ghost photo.

It felt like a portrait.

••

Three nights later, I heard the door to her room creak open.

I was still awake. Doom Scrolling. Trying to exhaust myself into sleep. I froze.

It was a slow sound. Drawn out like someone didn’t want to wake me.

Mum hadn’t stirred. Her room’s just across from mine. The creaking stopped, but I lay there listening for something else. A breath. A footstep. Anything.

Nothing came.

In the morning, the door to Grace’s room was ajar.
The light was on.

••

It still smelled like her.

Lavender fabric spray. The faded scent of body lotion in the sheets. The air inside felt warmer than the rest of the house.

Something was different, though. The room had been vacuumed. I remembered the little bits of fluff on the carpet from last time. They were gone.

And the covers were pulled back.

Folded down neatly.

I hadn’t done that.

••

Mum asked me if I’d gone in there again.

I said no.

She didn’t press. Just looked at me with the same hollow expression she’s worn since the funeral.

Later, while she was loading the washing machine, I heard her say—barely audible—

*“I thought I heard her again. Just for a second.”*

I didn’t ask what she meant.

••

The envelope came two days later.

No stamp. No return address. Just my name, written in a shaky, oversaturated ink, like the pen had been pressed down too hard. It hadn’t come with the post. It had been slid under the front door, pushed just inside the mat.

Inside was a single photograph.

Another one of Grace’s room. Same angle. Same dull afternoon light. But she was standing now.

In the corner of the room. Half-turned toward the window. Her face caught mid-blur, like she’d moved between the shutter click. Her expression had changed. 

Not smiling. Not angry. Just… blank. As if she was waiting for something.

And her eyes weren’t looking at the camera anymore.

They were angled past it.

*Over my shoulder.*

••

I went to the attic to check the camera. Still wrapped in the towel, still in the box, untouched since I hid it.

But underneath it—

Three more developed photos.

None of which I had taken.

They were darker. Grainier. The room had changed. The wallpaper was starting to peel at the corners. A mirror on the wall was cracked. Grace was gone from the frame.

But in the last photo, scrawled in something thick and black across the bedroom wall, someone had written a single word, just out of frame:

***“More.”***
