Let me get this straight from the start: no, I do not believe that my family's house was haunted back then. However, one thing is for sure, no matter what the reason was, something sinister had targeted me during the summer of 2006.

It all began during one of those nights, when my nine-year-old self preferred playing with a game handheld with low volume instead of sleeping. At some point around two in the morning, my ordeal started out of the blue. I heard the door slowly open and quickly hid the console under my pillow, which literally muted the device as I faked being asleep. With care, I then opened one eye just enough, expecting to see my mother, the single parent of the house, checking on me to ensure I was asleep but instead, the door just remained partially open. I waited for at least four minutes which felt like forever, thinking she already saw what she needed to while my eyes were closed, and hoping to see her close the door. When I was fed up with waiting, I decided to get out of bed and close the door silently. However, the moment I approached, the door was violently slammed shut.

Later in the morning, by mere fear of snitching on myself, I avoided mentioning any of it to my mother, expecting she would then assume that I was awake the whole time. I went about my day, doing what kids do and during the night, I was back to business with the game handheld. Once again, around two in the morning, the door slowly opened. 'Well Josh, you know the routine!' I thought, confident and executing the usual choreography to deceive my mother. Once again, I opened one eye and the door was partially open with no other particular activity. Annoyed, because I did not want to walk to the door like the night before, I called:

"Mommy?" Faking a sleepy and tired voice to the best of my ability but got no response the first time. "Mom?" I insisted more convincingly after a few seconds. The non-verbal response I obtained, covered me with shivers.

Four fingers, white like snow, appeared as an unknown hand gripped the top of the door, the way a person would do to hold it open. They were almost glowing in the dark, almost fluorescent. Was it a glove? No, because I could glimpse the dark color of the nails contrasting with the fingers. They remained there, no movement, nobody taking a look or fully coming in the room.

"Mom is thatâ€”you?" I asked, hesitantly. How could it be her? I knew for a fact that my mom had a personal reason for never painting her nails, so they were never that dark. I called again, worried at this point, and in response, a second set of four similar fingers appeared at the very bottom of the door, as the intruder unnaturally gripped the door with his other hand, I assumed. I began hyperventilating, mustering the strength to scream for my mother at this point, but when I tried, only a whimper came out of my mouth instead. In response, a third set of four similar fingers appeared in the middle of the door near the handle,

"Mommy?" I heard multiple people say at the same time, at least, this is how I can describe what I heard. It was as if they miserably tried to imitate me, frightening me instead.

I just screamed.

The three hands quickly retreated behind the door which was then violently slammed shut by the intruders. A few seconds later, my mother stormed inside the room. She just reassured me that it was nothing and opted for me to sleep besides her in the main bedroom. Nothing else happened that night, and having my mother with me meant no more furtive nocturnal gaming but at least, 100% safety. How wrong I was.

About two days later, I was peacefully sleeping one night, with my back glued to my mother's chest and belly, when I was suddenly awakened by a strange noise. I opened my eyes and immediately looked at the door from where I was, without moving an inch, and witnessed a vision of horror. The fingers were there, the hands were back, but that time, there were around ten hands, and thus countless fingers tapping on the door with the tips of their nails, the way some people casually do on a table when they wait for something.

"Mooom." I whispered, trying to notify her without alerting the intruders. "Mooooom wake up." I insisted, discreetly tapping her thigh with my hand.

Her response froze my whole being:

"Ssssh! Just ignore it Josh, sleep." She said, before placing her arm over my body to reassure me.

Instead, what I saw mortified me to the point that I could no longer make any sound:

The arm that covered me was as white as snow, with dark nails at the end of each of its fingers.

Paralyzed with terror, I remained still, trembling to the core and letting tears of fear just streaming from my eyes. I remained there, the whole night, and to this day, I do not know how I fell asleep, but I did. The next morning, I woke up to my mom getting ready for work as if nothing strange happened.

Was it really my mom? Was my own mother part of the intruders? I guess we will never know. We did not talk about it at the time and never did since. I requested to go back to my room the same day and opted for barricading my door every night. To this day, I still do so, no matter what building or room I spend the night into, and nobody understands why. I know that I have to. Why? Because every night, I can still hear the faint tapping of multiple fingers on the door. Sometimes, they even knock, but never say anything other than that distorted 'mommy' for whatever reason. I just know that I should never come face to face with the sinister people behind the door.
