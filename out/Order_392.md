I never saw the guy who dropped off the laptop, but then again I don’t usually interact with customers. I don’t really have the personality or the patience to deal with them. I work better as the little gremlin in the back, tinkering with the electronics. I’m happy that way.

&#x200B;

My name’s Morty, and I work in computer repair. My brother, Dave and I run a little repair shop downtown and we do alright for ourselves. We get a steady stream of business. Most of it is from repairs, but we also sell equipment and refurbished laptops as well. It keeps us fed, and I can mostly set my own hours. On the nights where I can’t sleep, I’ll hunker down in the back of the shop, put on a podcast and work. 

&#x200B;

It was on one of those nights where I started on Order 392.

&#x200B;

Dave had left me a note that the client had complained about the laptop crashing when certain programs were opened, namely Blender, a 3D animation program. He’d included the password for the laptop in his note, so I put on a podcast to listen to in the background and set to work diagnosing the problem.

&#x200B;

I won’t go into all the technical ins and outs of what I did. They’re really not important or interesting. The long and short of it is that he had some corrupted files that Blender was trying to access and *those* were causing the crash. Uninstalling and re-installing Blender ended up being the best way to fix it, so I did that and decided to move his files back after.

&#x200B;

After I finished the re-install, I booted up Blender to make sure the laptop didn’t crash. It didn’t.

&#x200B;

I closed it. Booted it up again. Still good. But just to be sure, I decided I’d open up one of his recent files just to make sure everything was still running smoothly.

&#x200B;

Now, just to be clear, I wasn’t looking to snoop. I *know* people have secrets on their computers, and I’m not all that interested in seeing it. I’ve already seen enough interesting shit in my time. Weird porn, creepy fanfiction, embarrassing personal videos. I don’t judge. So long as it’s not illegal, I’m content to leave well enough alone. 

&#x200B;

And what this client had on their laptop wasn’t all that weird by itself. The file that I opened up in Blender was an animation depicting a very realistic model of a ranch style house. I didn’t modify the animation. Lord knows, I know very little about how to use Blender and even if I did, I wouldn’t want to screw with the clients work. While I didn’t really understand what the purpose of the house animation was, my gut told me that it was probably a construction thing. Maybe this was a house they were building somewhere, or something?

&#x200B;

It was a little odd to see that there was already someone living in the house… but considering how little I knew about whatever the hell was going on, I kinda figured it was probably all just par for the course. 

&#x200B;

In the animation, an unmoving figure of a woman drifted through the house, moving to fixed points in some crude imitation of a nightly routine. She was only barely animated, floating from one point to the next. Her limbs didn’t move. Her eyes didn’t blink. She was just completely still. She went to the kitchen, then to the living room, then to the bathroom, then into the bedroom. In the corner of the screen, a small clock indicated what time it was.

&#x200B;

7.

&#x200B;

8.

&#x200B;

9.

&#x200B;

10.

&#x200B;

By 10, the woman was in bed. (Or, clipping through the bed, I guess)... and I was about to shut the animation off when I noticed something.

&#x200B;

Three new figures had appeared in the animated house.

&#x200B;

They approached from the back, going into the houses backyard before entering the house through a window. I saw them remove the screen from outside of that window, then slide it open and enter, one by one. The three figures then moved through the house, entering the woman's bedroom. They surrounded her bed and then…

&#x200B;

The animation ended, freezing on that unsettling tableau. My eyes narrowed. 

&#x200B;

This was probably nothing. Rough animation for some kind of film project, maybe? But… well…

&#x200B;

Staring at the three animated men who’d come in through the window, I couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable. Their models were blank. No defining features, unlike the woman who’d at least had a little bit of effort put into her model. These three figures were just… gray shapes resembling men. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t usually like to snoop… but something about this animation made me feel like I had to… just to reassure myself that everything was fine. I clicked into his documents folder and was greeted with an army of subfolders, each one with a different name.

&#x200B;

***Vanessa.***

***Claire.***

***Amy.***

***Megan.***

***Sandy.***

***Patricia.***

***Jamie.***

***Penelope.***

***Regan.***

***Cara.***

&#x200B;

Just a bunch of women's names… 

&#x200B;

I clicked into the most recently updated folder, ***Cara,*** and felt my heart sink as I immediately recognized a photograph of a house that was in there.

&#x200B;

It was the same house I’d seen in the animation, only this was an *actual photo*. This didn’t look like it’d been taken off of Google either. This looked like it had been taken in person. Most of them were clearly shot during the day, but judging by the fact that there was no car out front, I had a feeling they were taken when nobody was home. 

&#x200B;

They weren’t the only pictures there either.

&#x200B;

There were *lots* more, most of them pictures of a woman. She was petite and a little chubby with short brown hair and glasses.  She appeared to be the owner of the house. Some of the photos showed her leaving the house, or going back in. Others showed her inside the house, having clearly been shot through the windows. I could see her cooking, watching TV, doing yoga… 

&#x200B;

Someone had been watching this woman.

&#x200B;

I felt uneasy, looking through the collection of little invasions into this stranger's personal life. In some photos, I saw her cooking in her kitchen. She always seemed to open the window when she was cooking… 

&#x200B;

I remembered the animation I’d found. 

&#x200B;

The kitchen window, that had been how they’d planned on getting inside. Cutting open her screen and opening the window from the other side. If she opened it often, odds are she’d leave it unlocked and getting in would be easy. 

&#x200B;

The truth of that animation gnawed at the back of my mind. I didn’t want to accept it… but it couldn’t be denied.

&#x200B;

It was a home invasion plan.

&#x200B;

Among the last of the files I found in Cara’s folder was a PDF. I wasn’t sure I was ready to see what was inside, but I still clicked into it and opened it up. I was greeted with a two page report that made the pit in my stomach sink even deeper.

&#x200B;

This report had everything.

&#x200B;

Her name, her address, her date of birth, past addresses, place of employment… everything that someone would need to track her down. 

&#x200B;

I felt sick.

&#x200B;

The name of the company that had provided the report was in the top right hand corner of the PDF.   
***Horizon AI Solutions.***

&#x200B;

I looked up the company name.

&#x200B;

*Horizon AI Solutions* was a subsidiary of DuCharme Horizons, some fancy company that did robotics and AI programming. It seemed like the kind of company that liked to tout its innovations without ever actually doing anything useful… although I guess Horizon was their way of changing that.

&#x200B;

Their website touted how they were one of the most advanced facial recognition AI’s out there… able to help law enforcement identify anyone based on just a photograph. The implications were a little disturbing, to say the least…

&#x200B;

I closed out of the PDF, and reluctantly clicked out of Cara’s folder as well.

&#x200B;

There were still so many other folders on that computer… other folders that I didn’t want to look at… but I couldn’t stop myself. I clicked into a folder named *Vanessa.*

&#x200B;

It was mostly the same as Cara’s folder had been, with photos of a house and photos of a woman, a tall, blonde girl with a busty physique. There was a PDF from Horizon as well… just like Cara’s file, it shared everything that one could possibly need to know about Vanessa.

&#x200B;

The only thing different about Vanessa's file was the other pictures it included.

&#x200B;

And those pictures were what made me finally call the police.

&#x200B;

I don’t think I need to tell you what those pictures contained… and truthfully, I didn’t take a good hard look at them after the first few. Once I saw the blood… I couldn’t look anymore.

&#x200B;

The sheer brutality of what they did…

&#x200B;

Just imagining it makes me sick.

&#x200B;

I’d rather not know the ugly details.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An officer came by that morning to take my statement pick up the laptop. I explained to him everything I’d seen on the hard drive. The animation, the pictures, the reports…

&#x200B;

He nodded, took down notes and then bagged the laptop as evidence.

  “We’ll be in touch,” He promised me before leaving.

&#x200B;

I’d flopped down in my chair as soon as he left, rubbing my temples and still feeling sick… but at least I knew I’d done the right thing. The police could probably track the laptop back to whoever had owned it, and that sick son of a bitch would hopefully be going away for the rest of their life!

&#x200B;

Hopefully…

&#x200B;

It wasn’t more than five minutes later that Dave came into the shop. He hummed to himself as he set up, and looked over at me, sitting uneasily in the back.

  “Long night?” He asked, playfully.

  “You’ve got no idea,” I replied.

  “Yeah, I’ll bet. Guess you got 392 done?”

&#x200B;

I grimaced.

  “Did you see the cop outside?”

  “Sure did. Didn’t think he’d be back so early to pick it up, but hey, long as it was done!”

&#x200B;

Back?

&#x200B;

My blood turned to ice in my veins as the pit in my stomach swallowed me whole.
