Something's going on with my husband and I need help!

My husband’s family has always been weird, but I never really went out of my way to pay any attention to it. When we turned 16 my now husband, Gabriel, proposed. I was extremely hesitant, I mean what 16-year-old is actually ready to get married? I wanted to argue, but both our pushed for me to agree.  I knew deep down it was wrong but I figured my parent knew what was best so I trusted them blindly. However, I see now that my parents only wanted the extreme wealth that came with our marriage. A month after our marriage his family shipped us off to his dad's old cabin in the mountains. Though I personally think it's too big to be considered a cabin. I didn't want to move here, we’re almost an hour away from civilization in any direction, but again his family insisted on it. 

They claimed this house was more important than any family heirloom. Though I think it was just because it was so far from anyone I couldn’t go anywhere when my husband lost his temper. I am now 19 and have grown to love this house, Gabe on the other hand, hates it. At first, he was excited to live here, but after his family came over earlier this year, he’d just wanted to leave, but never actually did. When they came over, his parents and sister said something that made him uneasy. I left to get some more food from the kitchen when I saw they were saying something to him, they all seemed to be excited but it seemed to shake him deeply, he seemed scared, or on edge. I asked him what was wrong, but he just lashed out at me. Since then his behavior had been getting increasingly more, violent, but the last week has been the weirdest. 

I woke up to cold air blowing on my face. I opened my eyes to see the windows were open, I sat up confused when I noticed Gabe wasn’t in bed. I threw the blankets off of me and closed the windows before walking down the stairs. Each step seemed to get colder and colder. I held my arms close together, it was dark, but I could still see a little from the moonlight. The doors were wide open, and I could see someone was standing outside, looking away from me, entranced by whatever was deeper through the tree line. I timidly walked out to the porch where I could clearly see it was Gabe. I rushed out into the snow, the icy ground stung my feet the deeper I got into the woods. When I reached him I called his name gently and placed a hand on his shoulder, he turned his head to me slowly, and looked me in the eyes. He looked as if he didn’t even know me. He looked around and saw the house behind him. He looked at it for a while, his eyes squinted. I asked him what was wrong but all he said was “Sorry.” before walking back inside. 

I tried to get him to communicate further but to no avail. When we made it inside I noticed he wasn’t wearing any shoes or even socks. He must’ve been freezing, but he seemed unbothered, still I urged him to take a warm bath. I watched as he walked upstairs before I started preparing him some soup. I stirred mindlessly wondering if he had been sleepwalking. He’d never sleepwalked, he’d never even sleep-talked, why would he be doing it now? I reached for the bowl next to me and poured some soup. I turned around to see him sitting at the island. Startled, I dropped the soup all over me and the floor, I cowered on the floor, expecting him to scold me, but he didn’t. I looked up to see him wiping the soup off the floor quietly. When he noticed I was looking at him he smiled and helped me up. 

He felt my hands shaking and asked me why, but not in his usual taunting tone, he meant it. My brows furrowed in confusion. Why was he acting like this? Did he have a concussion? I was so lost. I took my hand away slowly and said I was just worried he’d be upset. He looked at me perplexed. I didn’t know what to say, I just got up and poured him another bowl. He finished cleaning the floor before even thinking about touching the bowl. As he ate I told him I would be going to bed. I rushingly changed and plopped myself onto the bed before drifting off to sleep.

I woke up early in the morning to see Gabe standing over me. I sat up quickly, he smiled shyly and said he wanted to thank me for last night. I asked what he meant by that, but he just smiled wider and led me downstairs and that’s when I saw he had prepared breakfast for both of us. I looked at him baffled. I asked him why he would make us breakfast. He simply shrugged, repeated that he wanted to thank me, and ushered me to eat. We ate at the table in silence, I glanced over at him occasionally, but he didn’t seem to notice, he was too busy eating, he must’ve been hungry because he had almost three different stacks of pancakes. After I took our plates he walked up behind me and asked if I liked the food I smiled sheepishly and said that I did.

He nodded with satisfaction and walked upstairs to the shower. It’s been like this for almost a week now. He hasn't lost his temper once, he’s been talking with me instead of locking himself away, helping me with meals, laughing, smiling, and he’s been so soft with me. I just don’t understand this sudden change. I tried to do some research to see if he had a concussion, but It just doesn’t seem right. I don’t know why he left the house, why he was standing out there in barely any clothes, or what the hell he was looking at, but after his family came over to talk last night, it just brought me more questions. When his family arrived, you might've thought it was a damn holiday with the number of people, over 25 family members chatting in my living room.

I rushed upstairs and told Gabe his family was here. He looked at me confused a small smirk creeping on his face as if I was lying, I reminded him, that we had planned this for a while. He nodded and we walked down to the dining room and hugged his mother tight, he’d never done that, he usually just sits right down and waited for them to speak first. I could see the look of surprise on everyone's faces. After everyone was done getting their fair share of my husband's love, we all sat down and ate dinner. His father, cousins, and sister were talking nonstop until his mother spoke up randomly.

“Gabe is something the matter.”

Gabe was just staring out the window, he obviously hadn’t noticed his mother was talking to him until I lightly tapped his hand and glanced over to his mother. He shook his head and smiled up at everyone, before looking down at his food and taking a bite of his mashed potatoes. His parents looked at each other before his sister leaned forward.

“Do you remember when you turned 15 and we all went on that skiing trip?”

Gabe looked at her blankly for a second. “Uh…Yeah, I do.” He said smiling.

His sister laughed in relief and practically jumped up in her seat. Everyone did the same, except for his niece who sat in silence playing with her food. Everyone else was so joyful, that his Uncle and Father ran out to grab some drinks from the car. I looked over at Gabriel, who was being aggressively hugged by his mother and other relatives. Dinner was awkward after that, his entire family seemed so giddy, but I felt I was the only one left out. After cleaning the table with his nephew, I noticed Gabe and his father talking outside. I looked at them closer, they looked like they were arguing. Gabe looked more sad than upset while his father was practically fuming with anger. I looked back at his nephew who simply pretended not to notice. After Gabe and his father walked inside Gabe just walked to the kitchen in silence.

I was about to walk after him when his mother approached me and for the first time, asked if everyone stay the night. I agreed and went to set up the guest rooms. I was wiping down the side tables when Gabe walked in. He was quiet but I could feel his eyes watching me. I sat up and tuned to him. He simply walked next to me and took the cloth from my hand before wiping down the table himself. His eyes looked sad and on the verge of tears.

This was not my husband.

Well it was, it had to be unless my husband has a doppelganger who’s identical to him down to his broken nose, it had to be him, but why was he acting so different? I took his arm and pulled him to look at me. His green eyes looked at me with such softness I hadn't seen for years. It was so strange, to see these eyes I’ve seen for so long look completely different. He asked me what I wanted to say but nothing came to mind. Later that night I passed the room his parents were sleeping in when I heard them talking. His mother said something about never telling me because I would never be able to understand, and how Gabe knew it was for the best. His niece seemed angry, saying that everyone knew Gabe didn’t want to do it…Do what? I pressed my ear to the door. His dad spoke up saying.

“We just want what's best for Micheal, everyone agreed he had more potential than anyone else.”

Who the fuck is Micheal? I knocked on the door, and his father opened it smiling.

“What’s going on?” I asked concerned.

His mother glanced at her husband before speaking up. “Nothing dear, just head to bed.”

I raised an eyebrow. His mother looked increasingly stressed before Gabe walked up behind me. He asked what was wrong and she just smiled at him. 

“Nothing, we’re just talking…Gabe” His father said a look of frustration washing over his face.

I turned to Gabe who was just looking at his father with disdain.

He looked at his parents and then at me. “Let’s just go back to the room.” He took my hand and pulled me back to our bed. I quickly stood back up and put my hands up frustrated.

“Gabe, why have you been so different, did something happen that no one’s telling me about?”

He looked away before climbing into bed.

“Don’t ignore me, I can’t pretend like you and your family haven't been acting weird, I can’t keep looking the other way!”

He just laid there, not saying a thing. Eventually, I gave up and walked to the bathroom. I put my hair up and got into the shower. Eventually, I heard the door open and close.  I waited for him to say something but he didn’t. I pulled the curtain aside and popped my head out. He was just staring at the mirror, it was foggy so he wiped a circle to see himself. He smiled, then frowned, then went blank, then smiled again. I got freaked out and pulled my head back. I looked at the blue tiles infront of me focusing on any sign of movement, I got impatient and turned the shower off. I reached for my towel wrapping it around me before I opened the curtain to see him still looking into the mirror, He turned to see me before turning around again his eyes wide. I wasn’t even naked. I scoffed a little and stepped out infront of him.

“Look at me.” I said flatly.

He turned to me slowly. He looked like he’d never seen a woman before.

“What is wrong with you?” I asked concerned

He looked at me then at the floor. “I’m sorry.” He said sheepishly.

I looked at him surprised, I didn't even know what to say. 

“I don’t want an apology I want an explanation,” I said softly

He looked me in the eyes, avoiding anything else. “I just…don’t feel like myself.”

He smiled at me weakly. I squinted my eyes a little, I was left unsure by his words. I looked past him and grabbed my toothbrush and he awkwardly grabbed his as well and we stood in silence with nothing but the sounds of our toothbrush filling our ears. Afterward, I walked past him changed, and went right to bed, though I couldn’t really fall asleep, Gabe was up for a while just sitting up in bed in the fetal position. I flipped over in bed looking up at him. I told him to go to bed, he looked down at me and I could see streaks of tears shining in the moonlight. I sat up and tried my best to comfort him, but he wouldn’t talk to me, eventually, he just apologized and laid down. I didn’t want to push him further so I wished him a good night and went to bed as well.

With all this, I haven’t even gotten into the most damning thing, which is what happened this morning. Everyone was sitting in the living room talking, pretending as if everything was normal. Gabe got up to get a drink of water when his sister called out to him a few times and as usual he didn’t turn around, she waved her hand in defeat and turned back around to her family and continued to talk. In their fits of laughter, suddenly I got an idea and stood up and said. “Micheal.” in a low talking tone. He instantly turned around. Everyone went dead silent. He looked me in the eyes. I looked around me and everyone looked like they had just witnessed a murder. His mother stood up and looked at me, Gabriel, and her husband in desperation before she laughed nervously. 

I looked back at Gabriel who was stunned, I couldn’t tell if his eyes reflected fear, relief, or both. His family didn’t talk much after and soon left. I sat in the living room and looked out to the endless forest in front of me. I turned to Gabriel who was making coffee in the kitchen. He walked over to me and passed me a mug We sat in silence for a while. I looked up at him.

“Who’s Micheal?” I asked softly.

He was quiet for a minute before responding quietly. “My twin brother.”

I raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t know you had one.”

“Yeah.” He said stirring his coffee.

I brushed a hand through his hair, which he pulled back a little. I sat down next to him looking out to the snow falling slowly. We didn’t talk about it much after, we put on a movie and spent the rest of the day on the couch. I’m writing this out in my office right now. I don’t know what to think, I’m not much of a supernatural believer, so I don't have much knowledge about it, but this is freaking me the fuck out.
