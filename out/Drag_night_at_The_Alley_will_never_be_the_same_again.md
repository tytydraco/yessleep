I really wasn’t in the mood to go out, having just been dumped by my long-term boyfriend. But my bestie Miles turned up at my apartment with a bottle of Grey Goose, despite me wallowing in self-pity and insisting on being alone.

“Rule number one after getting dumped,” said Miles as we drank vodka-cranberry. “Don’t hide away, babe. It’s drag night at The Alley. We’re going!”

We refer to it as ‘The Alley’, but it’s actually an unnamed back alley club in Seattle. The kind of place that doesn’t have Yelp reviews.

“What if I end up publicly ugly-crying?” I asked. "The humiliation."

“Dean, come on. It wouldn’t be as humiliating as the great table topple of 2018, would it?”

That got a chuckle and a cringe out of me. It was a hideously drunken night that resulted in the damage of a table, my left ankle, and my ego. It almost got me banned from The Alley.

“I can always rely on you to put things in perspective, Miles.”

I opted for a green checkered shirt and black jeans, finished with white sneakers.

“Straight man realness,” said Miles, visually my opposite with lashes for days and a tank top so loose his nipple piercings were on display.

We arrived at The Alley around 11pm. Miles grabbed a table while I went to the bar. It’s a relatively small venue. There are around 10 tables, a dance floor and a stage. The decor is speakeasy opulence with a touch of dive bar sleaze.

As I joined Miles at the table, a drag queen with a voluptuous figure was performing a lip sync to *Some Velvet Morning*. She had a 60’s aesthetic; white kneehigh boots, a bright floral dress with flared sleeves, and beehive raven hair with a white headband. She finished the lip sync to applause from the intimate crowd.

“Thank you, my babies,” she said into a microphone. “I see we’ve got some late arrivals.”

Miles grinned and raised his hand in admittance as I covered my eyes, wanting the floor to swallow me.

“It’s sweet you’re bringing your straight friend to drag night,” she said, turning to me. “Spoiler alert; I have a penis.”

“He’s not straight!” said Miles, finding it hilarious.

“Really?” she asked. “I mean, you clearly came out of the womb with jazz hands. But him?” She looked at me. “Wait… What are you drinking, honey?”

“Strawberry daiquiri?” I said with an inflection that sounded more like a question.

“I stand corrected,” she said to laughter. I felt my face heat up as I grinned awkwardly. “Is it just cocktails on the menu tonight or are you looking for cock and tail too?”

She made the classic *ba-dum-tis* drum sound as the crowd laughed.

“I’m single again so you never know,” I said.

“He just got dumped,” said Miles.

"What’s your name, hun?” she asked.

“Dean.”

“It’s his loss, Dean,” she said. “You’re a handsome fella. Dogshit personality but an absolute vision in plaid.”

The small crowd laughed and I couldn’t help but join them as I shook my head.

“Welcome, boys. My name is Mama Crass, and this is my show!”

We all cheered as the music played and Mama began a lip sync to *Dream A Little Dream Of Me*.

“Thank you for bringing me out,” I said to Miles, who kissed me on the cheek.

As the song was coming to an end a middle aged man walked towards the stage and paused on the dance floor. He was dressed all in black, from fedora to pointed shoes. He stood to my right, and I could see something dangling from his left hand. He stared at Mama, who just stared right back.

“Are you lost, sir?” she asked. “Do you need me to call someone?”

“Leander of the Cane coven,” bellowed the man, making me flinch. I turned to Miles who looked as shocked as me.

“Sir, this is a Wendy’s,” said Mama, which got a laugh from the audience. At that point it felt like it could still be part of the show.

“Leander Cane!” the man yelled again, holding up his left hand. As the light hit I could see a metallic crucifix. They were rosary beads. A few tables started to clear out, this clearly not being their brand of entertainment. I wanted to leave myself, the change in tone was jarring.

Mama stood defiant on stage. “I am Mama Crass from The House of Babylon. Now take a seat or take a hike, because this is *my* motherfucking show!”

A couple of people clapped and whistled as I looked around for security. The man took a few steps towards the stage, holding out the rosaries.

“You will pay for your blasphemy and desecration, along with your vile brothers and sisters. You are an abomination to all that is holy and pure. Your fate awaits in the fiery depths.”

“Honey, this is drag night,” yelled Mama Crass. “Drag me to hell night was last week.”

More tables began to empty as I tapped Miles to leave. “This doesn’t feel right. Let’s get out of here.”

As we stood up the man pulled out a gun and pointed it at the stage. “May you burn for eternity, Leander Cane.”

Before I could stop him Miles was running to intervene, cut short by the man’s elbow as it flew back.

“Miles!” I screamed as he went down. I ran to his side. He was out cold.

“No!” yelled Mama, both of her arms outstretched as if attempting to summon something. But then my ears were ringing as a gunshot sounded out, and a bullet hit her forehead. She stood for a few seconds before her body hit the stage.

The man turned the gun and started firing it into the club as the few remaining audience members screamed and ran for cover. He turned it on me and I froze for a moment before scurrying towards the exit, hearing bullets hit nearby. My heart was racing as I fell through the door, and a burning pain shot through my upper right arm. I landed on my ass in the dingy alley, clutching my arm as warm blood seeped through my fingers.

The door opened and the man walked out. I pushed myself back against the wall, trembling as he lifted the gun and pressed the barrel against my head.

“Please, sir,” I stuttered.

His expression was vacant as he spoke. “I’m sorry, my child.”

There was an explosion of blue light from nearby which distracted us both. It looked like some kind of contained storm, and a figure could be made out within it. As it cleared, Mama stood in the alley, bullet wound and all. My jaw dropped.

“That was cunty,” she said, putting a hand to her forehead. There was a blue glow, and when she removed her hand the wound was gone. She held the bullet between her fingertips.

"Demon spawn!" the man grunted as he spun the gun around, but with a flick of her wrist she threw the bullet. It hit the man directly between the eyes as if fired from a gun itself.

“Nobody gives head-shot like Mama Crass," she said, blowing her smoking fingers as his body hit the ground.

She crouched down and held her hand over my bullet wound, that blue glow appearing again. I groaned as I could feel the bullet being pulled through my arm, but within seconds the pain had completely gone. The wound was healed, I was just left with the bloody and tattered shreds of my shirt. I looked at her in disbelief as she tossed the bullet aside and smiled.

"I’m good, but I’m not *that* good. It’s a bad shirt, hun. It belongs in the trash.”

She stood up and turned to go back inside the club.

“Wait!” I yelled, getting to my feet with the support of a nearby dumpster. I wanted to thank her, but my stupid brain had other ideas. “What the fuck are you?”

She cackled into the night sky, her hands on her padded hips as it echoed within the alley.

“Oh, honey. I’m a motherfucking drag queen!”
