Every night when I try to sleep, the stairs begin to creak. A screech that whispers worryingly through the air. Such a slight, simple sound, yet it invokes such a feeling of eeriness. Our minds seemingly search for reasons to be afraid, to be scared.

The creaking starts slow, and distant. A faint few footsteps, climbing the bottom steps quietly. It then quickens on the quest to scare me, as the pace picks up, and the creaks grow louder. It ends with a thundering thwack on the final top step. This pattern perpetually continues, all night, every night.

Yet when I rise in my robes, into the hallway, all confused, the sounds suddenly stop. They wait warily for my exit so that they may continue. When my body hits the bed, there again, outside the door, the creaks continue evermore.

My son left this world weeks ago. The sounds began thereafter. Perhaps, I thought, he wants me to hear him again. Perhaps, I thought, he wants to communicate with me. This brought me comfort and subsided my fears for a few days.

For just that short while, the creaks, they made me smile. My happiness was not long-lived as the haunting only got worse. This was not my child, not my family, I've been visited by a curse. Lights would flicker or turn off in every room I entered. Knives would fly from their drawers, towards my body they ventured.

My son died with no wounds or fractures found, his death was merely a mystery. He just dropped dead one day, presumed to be a medical issue. My son had nothing of the sorts yet the doctors told me I must be mistaken. They assured me it was likely to be an unknown, unseen illness. I told them it was unbelievable.

My world whirled and spun that day. It was as if someone hit the pause button on life, with him being taken so suddenly, without explanation, causing so much devastation. I could not sleep that night in bed, with so many thoughts in my head. That was the moment in which the creaks started, the very same day that my son had parted.

No, this creaking, it is not my son sending signs. This is a demon sending sinister signals. Mocking me, and tormenting too. This demon took my child away, and stays around as a clue. I don't know if it wants me next, and if it does I don't know what to do.

The creaks, my god the creaks, they won't end. I sit here every night and listen, longing for my son. I'm being driven mad by these sinister sounds that seemingly scream all around.

Every step I take is cautious, for danger seems to follow. Being in my own house makes me nauseous, as my life feels empty and hollow.

Nobody believes me or listens to my claims. They call me crazy.

I live now in a fear so deep, wanting only to shout and shriek. Every night when I try to sleep, the stairs continue to creak.
