I lived in an apartment in New York, which goes all the way up to the 40th floor. The window showing off the city was in my living room, while a very small window was at my bedside. So I suppose you’d be afraid if you saw it too. 

‘It started when I got home from work as per usual, but I had a horrible feeling in my gut. The night was extremely quiet with barely any traffic, which if you live in New York, you’d know that it’s extremely rare. I got off at around 6PM and headed for a bite to eat, however as I got closer to my apartment, I started feeling more and more nauseous. I thought that it was due to the food I ate, and I kept it in until I got inside; but when I did, that feeling was gone. 

All that was left was me and this empty space. I often contemplated if this room was always so big. The couches and the rugs, the kitchen and the seats all felt so unfamiliar. Almost as if I’ve stepped in another ones home.

I cautiously took off my coat, and made my way to the bedroom, before washing up and heading to bed. 

I shouldn’t have. 

I awoke at around four in the morning. The room was usually pitch black. Except, this time wasn’t. A small circular light was on my bed from an unknown source. My phone was on my nightstand, so it couldn’t have been that, nor could it have been some other piece of technology, as they were all stored away in my office. It had a faint yellow tint, and the more I stared, the more I realized that it was coming from outside. 

My heart began to race as I felt the cold sweat begin to form on my back. What could it be? I lived on the 30th floor. 

There’s no way it could have been human. 

That realization hit me like a truck. Maybe this was all a bad dream? Maybe it would all be over soon? I shut my eyes and tried pretending like I was asleep. If I do, it’ll get bored right? 

I stayed awake the rest of the night. The yellow light remained where it was, still and unmoving, before it dipped at around 6AM. Even though I felt much safer, that feeling of doom and dread remained with me for the rest of the day. What could it have been? 

This happened for the next few months. 

I could feel my body deteriorating. I could no longer eat, no longer sleep, and due to this, no longer able to preform simple tasks. I got fired, and my life fell into a pit of despair. This however, also enlightened some form of rage within me. I was angry at this creature for destroying me. For watching me. Why me? 

So that night, I was prepared. I stayed up, as per usual, and the yellow light showed up once again. Now my curtains were usually closed, but they fail to cover up my entire window, so there’s always a little crack in the corner. I slowly snuck up from my bed, dodging the light, hoping that it didn’t notice my movements. 

I stood, and picked up a knife from my bedside drawer and swung open my curtains. 

My blood ran cold. One large eyeball was staring back at me. It was glowing yellow, with slime oozing from its sides. I stood there, unable to move as it continued to stare. Slowly, I dipped my head down to look at the floors below, and as lord would have it, its body was just as long. An angler fish. It almost resembled an angler fish. Its body was mutilated, almost like an eel, as it swayed with the wind. 

I fell to the ground in a daze as its yellow eyes seemed to draw closer. That same overwhelming doom over took my senses, while I saw ecstasy in its eyes. 

No, *no*. Not like this. 

The knife. The knife!

My hands scrambled to grab it, and with all the strength left in my body, I plunged it in. 

Bullseye.  

It let out an ear deafening scream, as It retreated into the darkness. The yellow eye was the last to disappear. I still remember my hands shaking as I brought them in to my chest, the knife clattering onto the floor. 

That was the last time I saw it. 

My life is going as per usual now, with nothing out of the ordinary. Even so, my mind circles back to that encounter on a regular basis. What did it want? What could I give? What did it see in me? 

If you ever encounter it, I wish you luck.’

Shaking, I close the letter left by the previous tenant and take a peek at my window. I moved in this apartment recently after I noticed it was selling for an extremely low price. I look down, a small circular light was reflecting off my bed sheets. 

“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
