The hospital air conditioning was a relentless, low hum, a sound I’d come to associate with pure, unadulterated exhaustion. It was 2:31 a.m., the dead of my 24-hour shift at St. Anthony’s Children's Hospital. As a third-year med student, I was on overnight to help the resident with any new admits that would come in. Tonight was a night like any other filled with tasteless coffee and the dull glow of my computer screen as I typed the latest note and reviewed some lab results. I stared at my fingers as I typed away. The edges of each finger were worn from my nervous chewing and scanned over the small reddish, star shaped birthmark between my thumb and forefinger as I picked up my coffee for the next sip to get me through the night. 

So far my rotation has been a mundane, if demanding, blur of rounding, note writing, and the constant dread of presenting patients to my attending . The children's hospital had a specific kind of quiet at this hour—not a peaceful quiet, but the heavy, tense silence of a building holding its breath. The only interruptions were the soft beeping of monitors and the occasional, unsettling rustle from a sleeping child’s bed.

A piercing, three-tone chime echoed through the hospital's PA system, followed by a voice, flat and unhurried. “Attention all staff. Code Pink, third floor, room 323. Repeat, Code Pink, third floor, room 323.”

In the hospital, we have drills for every possible emergency: Code Blue (when a patient becomes unresponsive, their heart stops beating, or they start having serious breathing problems i.e. an emergency response to a life-threatening emergency), Code Grey ( when a family member or patient becomes aggressive and needs security intervention), and the one that always raised the hair on my arms, Code Pink, when an infant is abducted. 

Unfortunately, in the hospital I’ve heard Code Pink over the intercom dozens of times, usually when a family member would step outside of the room with a patient and the nurses couldn’t find them. Everytime we’d go through the same grim dance of locking down doors and searching every square foot only to find that the patient was in the bathroom or just getting a snack at the vending machines.
My heart hammered against my ribs. I froze, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. My supervising resident, Dr. Chen, seemed unbothered. “That’s the fifth one this week”, she exclaimed with a sigh. “I really wish the nurses would just keep an eye on their patients and stop interrupting everyone's work”, she said calmly. Room 323 was one our admitted patients signed out to our team earlier in the night. I did not know much about this particular patient besides that they were here for a respiratory problem and needed a few days in the hospital. “Sol, can you please go chat with the team and figure out if you need me”, she declared before going back to putting in orders on her computer. 


Security alarms blared as magnetic locks slammed into place on every door, sealing the unit. A Code Pink meant a full lockdown. A group of nurses and two security guards were all huddled around the front desk. The charge nurse robotically called out the description of the patient, “18 month old male named Tommy, here for RSV bronchiectasis who was planned to go home tomorrow. Last seen in his room at 1:35 AM when nurse Jackie was doing a vitals check. The patient’s mom was in the room asleep and awoke at 2:30 but they were gone.” She gave everyone as much detail as she could and the search was on. “I think this might be real, so please be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary. No one gets in, and no one gets out until we find him.”
The usual playful drawings on the walls seemed to sneer in the flickering red light. The hall felt unnaturally long, the silence between our hurried footsteps oppressive. My mind, usually a fortress of medical knowledge, was a panicked, useless jumble. 

We searched room by room, checking beneath every blanket, inside every closet. The patient’s mom, already on edge, was being quietly comforted by nurses, their terrified eyes darting around as if a boogeyman were about to leap from the shadows. The patient had been in his room, just down the hall from where the alarm rang. The mom had dozed off for a few minutes and when the nurse came for her check the child was gone. I stepped into the room and immediately noticed a small, hand-knitted blanket, folded neatly on his empty bed, one that didn't belong to the hospital. The magnetic pull of the blanket drew me in closer and closer until I was inspecting every aspect of the cloth half expecting a small child to fall out of it. I held the blanket to my nose and recognized a scent of rose and perfume. “Is this blanket yours?” I asked the mom. “No, we were given it by a nurse when we first came to the room”, she replied. My heart sank deep into the pit of my stomach. Did someone use this blanket to mark the patient? And if so, why did they leave it behind? 

Nothing. The other groups’ searches were yielding the same. A cold dread began to settle over me. It felt like a ghost hunt. The security cameras had shown nothing. The child was simply gone. Vanished into thin air. 
Desperate, I remembered an old, unused storage closet at the end of the hall, rumored to have been sealed off years ago. It was a long shot, but I felt a strange draw toward it. I told Dr. Chen I would check it out, and she waved me on, her face drawn.

I found the door at the end of the corridor, partially obscured by a crash cart and some other equipment. The air around it felt heavy, colder than the rest of the hall. The door itself was locked with a rusted deadbolt, but a piece of the frame was splintered, a sign of recent, forced entry. I pushed on it, and it groaned open, revealing a small, dark closet filled with dusty relics from a different era of medicine: old charts, archaic monitors, and a lone, rusted filing cabinet pushed into a corner.

A cold wind seemed to sigh past my ear as I stepped inside. My flashlight beam cut through the darkness, illuminating a pile of old files. My eyes were drawn to one drawer on the filing cabinet, partially ajar, with a tab sticking out. 
My blood ran cold. I pulled it open, the screech of metal echoing in the space. Inside was a single manila folder. My hands shook as I pulled it out. I opened it and shined my phone’s flashlight on the contents. On it, in faded black marker, was a single, chilling phrase: "CODE PINK - SOLOMON THOMAS - 1989.” 

I froze, dropping the file on the floor. For what felt like an eternity, I was paralyzed. My ears filled with blood drowning out any thought. Slowly I picked up the file and read the first page report.  The date was exactly 25 years ago, to the day. The location: St. Anthony’s Children's Hospital, pediatric wing. The subject: a male infant, abducted from his room overnight while the mother slept. The abductor, according to the notes, had never been identified and the child was never found.
My breath shortened. My eyes dropped to the second page. It was a polaroid photo of a child hand in hand with a young mother. My heart leaped into my throat. The baby in the photo had a small, reddish-brown birthmark shaped like a star. It was the same birthmark I had. 
I flipped to the last page. It was a small piece of paper, folded and taped to the file. It was a note. The handwriting was neat, almost elegant. My eyes devoured the words:

He's coming home.

A wave of nausea and dread hit me. I looked up, and the flashlight beam wavered in my trembling hand. The air in the space grew colder. A new smell filled my nostrils, not the sterile hospital aroma, but a sickly sweet scent, like old roses and cheap perfume. The door to the closet groaned shut behind me, the deadbolt clicking back into place.

A soft hum echoed from the darkness behind me, a sound like a sweet lullaby. “My sweet boy,” a whisper, so close I could feel the cold breath on the back of my neck. “It’s time to come home.”
