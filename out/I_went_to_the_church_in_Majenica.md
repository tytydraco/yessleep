The town of Majenica has around 80 permanent residents. It is little more than 24 houses. It has no post office or general store. There is a gas station, but it closed back in 08. The town is the halfway point between the interstate and an actually notable town. The only real draw to Majenica was the fact that it had the church. If you lived in the area you have undoubtedly heard of the church. Saint John’s - Bastion of Faith. It was much larger of a church than a town like Majenica warranted. I’m not entirely sure how the town afforded the building. It was a big beautiful building with well designed limestone and brick. The windows were massive, beautiful portraits made of stained glass. I had never gone there myself, but most people in neighboring towns attended the Sunday services. 

I stopped being involved with church after my father died. I fell out of the routine. Too many people told me it was “god's plan”. What a load of horse shit. Their insistence upon the matter only made me more upset. That was a few years ago however. It’s been long enough now that I'm ready to try it again. I’ve been talking to my family friends and they asked me to join them this next sunday. Everyone who goes talks about the church fanatically. I figured that I might as well try. 

I woke up that Sunday at 10 am. I was still tired from the night before. I didn't get much sleep. I was still dreading the idea of a pastor rambling on about his warped interpretation of the Bible and how my life is in peril. I pulled myself out of my bed regardless. I put on my Sunday best, which happened to be a polo shirt I got from a thrift store and some black slacks from the same thrift store. I looked presentable. I decided to skip breakfast as that would take too long. I wanted to get there early. If I was lucky I'd be able to find the people I knew and I'd sit with them. I walked past my kitchen, grabbed my keys, and walked out my front door. 

The morning greeted me with a gray misty rain. It was rather brisk out, but it was honestly quite pleasant. I decided to open my door and grab my sweater. I tossed it over my polo shirt in order to keep some warmth. I walked through the rain to my car. My key fob was always finicky. This meant that I had to press the unlock multiple times before the headlights of my car blinked signifying that the doors were indeed unlocked. I hopped into my car, slightly wetter than I would've liked. I plugged my phone into the cassette tape/aux cord. It was something I picked up from the hardware store here in town. I put on some music before starting my drive to church.

Once arriving I find it very hard to find a spot to park. I was about a half hour early, but the parking lot was full. Every spot has been taken. Some of the patrons took to parking on the grass. I was hopeful that my car wouldn't get stuck in the mud. I decided to go for it. I walked through the grass into the parking lot. The parking lot was quite large. Unfortunately for me, I had a small walk ahead of me. I should have brought my umbrella. “It’s too late to go back now though.” I thought to myself. 

Approaching the big wooden doors of the church, I was a little intimidated. I looked up at the massive windows collecting rain. I turned to look back at the parking lot and thought about leaving. I was psyching myself out for no reason. I was not going to leave now. I pushed open the solid oak doors. The inside of the church was just as breathtaking as the outside. The roof was ornate and wooden. The stage was marvelous. The air inside was warm like a blanket from the dryer. There were people everywhere. I began to feel out of place. I looked around for people to talk to or something to do. That's when I noticed the little coffee bar that they had inside the church. It was embedded in the wall and the room could really only fit 3 people. It looked cozy though. I walked up and asked for a cup. I had skipped breakfast and groggy, I could use the pick me up.

The cute girl behind the counter asked if I was new. It must've been obvious. I was looking around in amazement and wasn't talking to anyone. I admitted that I was a newcomer and I was a little nervous. She giggled at that. Usually that would have embarrassed me, but her voice was so soothing that it eased my concerns. She pointed to a spot in the middle of the room on the left side of the pews and recommended that I sit there.

“It's cozy over there. It's out of the way, but you get a good view.” 

I thanked her for the advice and tried to pay for my drink. She smiled and told me that the drink was free since I was new.

I walked to the area she pointed out for me and took a seat in the far end of the pew. I continued to look for my friends, but they were lost in the sea of unfamiliar faces. It was hopeless. I sank into my seat and drank my delicious coffee. Despite my friends being elsewhere, I was actually quite content and cozy. I was excited to see if this sermon was really going to be life changing. 

I waited about 12 minutes before the lights dimmed. I had chatted up some elderly folks in the meantime. They looked like the kind of old person that had very little time left. Purple skin around their arms indicated that they bruised easily. I felt bad for them, but they seemed as cheerful as ever. The lights became very atmospheric. They illuminated just enough to keep the room visible. It was like going to the movie theater when they play the trailers. The crowd went quiet. Everyone was waiting for the pastor. I was intrigued. I could feel the anticipation of everyone around me.

I heard a man's voice projecting from the speakers on stage. He had a golden tone to his voice. He walked on stage and I was confused. He wasn't exactly what I imagined in my head. He was no older than 50. He looked to be wearing a twill suit, the kind with the large checkers on it. He was quite handsome. The spotlight shined down upon him as he introduced himself to the crowd. 

“Hello people. I am pastor Zacharious. Today is a special day. We are going to be performing miracles”

With that the entire room erupted in cheers. 

“What the hell? Miracles, really? Maybe this was more of a cult than a church.”

I was uneasy, but I decided to stay. I was probably just over reacting. He went on.

“I see a few new faces in here today, let's not scare them off, okay? If you see someone new, make them feel welcomed and introduce yourself. It makes me happy to see our union grow so much over the last several years. Today the Lord will thank us for all our hard work. We have been planning this holy day for a few weeks now. Now it is finally time to produce the miracles I promised you.”

Again applause.

“Before all of that we must praise our Lord in song”

I thought to myself.
“Oh shit, fuck me. I didn't really want to sing hymns today.”

I had completely forgotten that this was a part of church. I scrambled to find a hymn book as everyone had already stood up and opened the pages. Kindly, a stranger handed me their book and pointed to the area we would be singing from. I was very appreciative of that. 

It was some generic song about how Jesus is Lord and how we aren't grateful enough for his salvation. Call me cynical, but they all sound the same. After singing, I thought we'd be sitting back down. Instead, the pastor beckoned the crowd to the stage. Everyone flocked the stage in a frenzy. I was startled. There was shoving and screaming. It was anything but dignified. I backed out of my pew and clung to the wall, watching in utter confusion. The people washed up to the stage like a roaring wave. The pastor reached down to a few of their heads and grazed them with his hand. Every person he touched seemed to faint out of pure excitement. I was creeped out. Right as I turned to leave, the cute barista was beside me. She scares the shit out of me even more than I already was.

She hurriedly responded trying to calm me down.
“Oh my goodness I'm so sorry, are you alright”

I told her I was fine and that I was just disturbed by the events going on. I told her that I was probably going to leave.

She sounded like a disappointed mother.
“Leave? But you haven't even witnessed the miracles.”

“What? What're yo-”
I turned around to see each crowd member grazed by the pastor's cold hands suspended in air. They emanated a holy glow. The light emanating from them was warm and bright. It lit up the room. I stopped mid sentence and every other thought in my head ceased to exist. 

I said in utter bewilderment 
“Oh my god.”

She said innocently.
“I know, isn't he amazing?”

I whipped my head between the girl and the act of God that was currently happening at the foot of the stage. 

I thought to myself.
“Is she really acting as if this was completely normal? Is this completely normal? How often does he do this? What happens next?”

 I needed to know more.

I sat back in my pew and clapped. I didn't know what else to do. The glowing ones slowly descended. People cheered again. The pastor said that was all he could do for this week. He took a knee as if it had drained him. 

When the pastor was done handing out miracles everyone returned to their seats. I noticed that the elderly couple who had conversated with me before the sermon were heading back towards their seats too. They seemed different. Their skin was no longer bruised or thin. They looked younger? A lot younger, by about 10 years.

“What the fuck” 
I thought.

The sermon continued like a normal church for a while longer. After the sermon ended. The pastor said as charismaticly as a politician.

“Will those new to our union join me in the front. I'd love for the chance to meet you all.”

The rest of the congregation fled to their respective lives. Me thought? I was going to meet this pastor. I walked to the front. I was both excited and nervous. On my stroll to the stage, I noticed that I was the only newcomer. I looked around looking for the other “new faces” the pastor talked about. 

He chuckled when he saw my confusion.
“Oh boy don't worry, it's just you. I just didn't want to make you feel too targeted. I said “new faces” to put you at ease.”

I thought to myself.
“He noticed me out of the 200 or so people in the church?”

We talked for a bit. He said that it was great to have more members in the church and he told me about his time teaching God's word. I listened in pure fascination. He was an even better story teller than I had previously conceived.

He ended the conversation with a request.
“Well I have to attend other business” he then pointed at his stomach signifying he was going to go get lunch. “But I wanted to personally request that you do come again next week.”


I said as cautiously and politely as possible.
“thank you sir, it was great to meet you”

I instinctively stuck my hand out to shake his, but he recoiled as if my hand was a venomous snake.

“Oh sonny, you don't want to do that. My hands are capable of a great number of things.”

Instead he gave a gentleman's bow. 
With that he walked away
