It was the crashing sound of thunder that woke me up from an already disturbed sleep. The thunder was followed by a flash of some of the most intense rainfall I can remember ever having experienced. The whole event lasted ten minutes, from then on the rain began to slow down.

Now wide awake at the unfortunate hour of midnight, I decided that I'd just cut my losses and get up. I had an exam which I needed to study for anyway. I had the unfortunate problem of needing to write an algorithm to count the islands within a two dimensional array; this would be a bit challenging so I decided that I needed food, and caffeine first.

Home is a strange thing, at once it is a place of comfort, yet with only subtle changes it can become so unfamiliar. My Mom was on a business trip, one which would last a week. In the meantime I was largely stuck at home, a place which with her absence, felt uncomfortably empty. I live in a comparatively rural area, the nearest major city being an hour's bike ride away. I walked into the living room, which also housed the kitchen and cracked some eggs into the frying pan, while they fried I cleaned out the dregs from the cafetiere and filled it with fresh coffee ground. I was lost in the routine, so my surroundings were largely out of mind. When both the coffee and the eggs were ready I moved towards the couch to enjoy my early breakfast.

I was interrupted by the sight of a familiar figure standing just on the border of the light's reach. It was the familiar figure of my Mother. She was standing uncomfortably straight, tense. I called out and asked whether she was back from her trip early. I received back as a reply a stilted and strained "yes". In a jerky, but fast motion the figure turned to face me. Her face was pulled into a taut smile. She was soaked; as if she had been standing outside during that entire rain storm.

Have you ever heard of the idea that the uncanny valley exists because we once feared something that disguised itself as human? I'm a believer in that theory now. Those eyes, I became filled with a deep, intense, dread. Every hair on my neck was instantly electrified. Some instinct, burned deep into my amygdala was telling me to run.

Despite the intense dread, I stood my ground. The rationalisations flooded in from the parts of my brain more suited to abstract thought. I was tired, I didn't expect her to be home, I was just scared by the storm. Rational reasons for not being afraid flooded through my mind. I nervously said something about changing out of those soaked clothes. Three seconds of silence followed, and then in the same unnerving tone, I heard "yes".

A sudden flash of thunder illuminated the figure, it was then that I noticed that the proportions of what I had thought was my Mother were deeply off. Arms stretched out far too long; legs bent unnaturally as if containing an alien bone structure. The neck was grotesque, it seemed bent in multiple places. I slowly took a step back. Like a knife through the silence I heard in that same stilted jarring tone: "Come here". That thing, standing in my living room kept repeating itself, each time slightly louder: "Come here", "Come here", "Come here!".

I walked slowly backwards first into the hallway and then into my room. I shut the door, but not a moment later, I heard a knock. How fast could that thing move? Three more knocks rang out in succession, each louder than the one before. There were a few seconds of silence before the knocking began again, it grew and grew in intensity until it resembled pounding more than anything. I did the only thing that seemed sensible in my state of rising panic. I hid in the closet. The pounding continued, getting louder and louder until finally one loud crash rang out as the door presumably gave in. From the closet I could only see a fraction of the room; but it was enough to notice something that made my gut churn. My cat, Frederika was on the bed. In plain sight. She was such a sweet and gentle cat, and had been my constant companion for nearly three years; I would do anything to protect her.

When Frederika saw that uncanny figure move into the room, she practically doubled in size. She began to screech and hiss with an intensity I had never seen before. The creature, undeterred began to move forwards towards Frederika, slowly being backed into a corner, Frederika chose flight and lept at the creature. The creature staggered back seeming somewhat shocked at the ferocity of the cat which had transformed itself into a furious ball of gnashing claws and teeth. I took this opportunity to leap out of the closet. I picked it up with a speed enhanced by the adrenaline pumping through my veins, and smashed it directly onto the creatures neck. Momentarily stunned, I then took the opportunity to scoop up my terrified cat and run for the front door. My cat gave me a number of deep scratches, but I held onto her nonetheless.

When we got outside, the field outside my home was illuminated by a flash of thunder. What I saw threw me into an even greater panic. Just standing there in the rain soaked field were at least eight figures with similar unnatural proportions. I ran over to my bicycle and hopped on, still holding a very pissed off cat in one arm. I maneuvered the bike onto the street, not without great effort and began to cycle one handed through the rain. I decided that I'd head for the nearest city with a police station. As I continued to cycle, I saw things that I don't think I'll ever get out of my head. One of those things was swallowing the limp body of man, just like one of those massive snakes you see in nature documentaries. The thing's neck was so horribly stretched; thick veins easily visible through the stretched semi-translucent skin. Its dead eyes watched me as I cycled past, but thankfully, it was already occupied.

As I neared the bridge which separated my village from open farmland, I heard screeches behind me. Three of the things were running on all fours, gaining on me as I continued to cycle. They were incredibly fast. I cycled faster, faster than I believed I could. The bridge grew closer and so too did the howls and screeches. Just as I crossed over the bridge I hit a rock at a bad angle. I was sent flying. I landed just clear of the bridge on my side. Frederika landed on her feat, and without hesitating turned to face the incoming creatures. I wanted to cry; this would be the end, with that unnatural speed they would be on me in an instant. I would never see my real Mom again, never feel the touch of the summer sun on my skin, this was it. My life would end here, and I would be swallowed whole. I didn't want to be awake for that. I prayed that they would at least grant me the mercy of killing me beforehand. I braced, waiting for the end... But it never came. When I got the courage to open my eyes I saw those creatures standing straight upright on the other side of the bridge. I saw clearly now that the thing in the shape of my Mother was among them; and from her mouth escaped two words... "Come here"

Never taking my eyes off of them, I scooped up my cat, not without some protest and got back on my bike.

It has been a week since then. I was one of two survivors of that night. The authorities have no explanation. Almost 700 people, an entire village, missing. Traces of blood, signs of fighting, but not a single body. There was no trace of the creatures. It seems like they just disappeared back into whatever hell they came from.

My Mom heard the news and came back early. Confronting death gave me a greater appreciation for the people I care about. I cherish every day we still have together.

The other survivor was an old stubborn man called Jan. I came to understand that he had lived in that village his entire life. From what I heard he didn't speak much, didn't talk to the news, and seemed to only want his peace and quiet. From what I've heard he already moved back into his old farmhouse. I only spoke to him once, he was leaving the police station after an interview with the investigators on the case. I chose my question carefully, and asked whether he knew anything about those things. He sighed, and in a stern tone replied. "Regenlopers".

In English, this translates to 'Those who run through rain'.
