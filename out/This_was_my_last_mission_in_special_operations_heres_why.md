“I need you to start at the beginning Marcus.” The way he spoke shook me to my core. Everything about him, from his slick-pressed gray suit, to his black top fedora. I could tell he had no background in Special Operations. I could also tell he was somebody you didn’t want to upset, so I did as I was told. 

The mission towered before us like a shadow in the night, a recon of what we believed to be a terrorist organization's base nestled deep within the dense woods of the Appalachian Mountains. We were briefed thoroughly, equipped meticulously, and trained extensively. But as we approached the seemingly abandoned compound, an unsettling feeling lingered in the air, like a premonition of impending doom. I led the reconnaissance unit, my voice steady as I issued orders over the radio.

"Stay sharp, everyone. Eyes peeled for any signs of activity. We don't know what we're walking into."

The crackling of radio static filled the tense silence as my team spread out, cautiously advancing through the overgrown foliage surrounding the perimeter. Private Ryan Hayes, the youngest member of the team, kept glancing nervously at the dense forest that seemed to swallow the feeble light of the moon.

"Sir, I've got movement to the east," Corporal Lisa Alvarez reported, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Possible hostile activity." I nodded grimly.

"Stay hidden and observe. We need to gather as much intel as we can before making any moves."

As the minutes stretched into hours, the tension mounted with each passing second. The forest seemed to be holding its breath, as if anticipating the inevitable. Then, a sudden noise shattered the stillness, a low twig snap that sent Ryan into a cold sweat..

"Did anyone else hear that?" Private Hayes asked, his voice trembling.

"Negative," I replied, my grip tightening on my rifle.

"Stay focused, people. We're not alone out here."

I paused briefly whilst recounting the stark beginning to mission BlackHawk but it was enough to get the man's attention. The look he gave me alone struck fear in my soul.

"Continue,"

he said in a deep, raspy voice. I remember the still taste of the damp air. It reminded me of the calm before a storm. Then it happened. Gunfire echoed through the night as unseen assailants ambushed us from all sides. We were prepared for this and shot each body down one by one until only lifeless bodies on the ground remained. Amidst the chaos, Private Hayes found himself separated from the group, his heart pounding in his chest as he darted into the darkness of the appalachians.

"Sir, I'm being chased by 3-4 hooded attackers! Requesting immediate backup!" Hayes shouted into his radio, his voice laced with panic.

"We're on our way, Hayes. Hold tight," I responded, my voice strained with urgency.

As gunfire ceased, I noticed Hayes’ labored breathing through the radio, his next words caught us off guard as he spoke,

“I’m navigating through a maze of dilapidated buildings now, I’ve seemed to have lost them”, a sense of foreboding washed over us.

“The air is growing thick, and there’s a stench unlike anything I’ve ever smelt. I see strange symbols covering the walls. Captain.. I’m.. scared.” Hayes said, his quivering voice barely audible over the crackling of the radio. 

As we continued to follow Haye’s tracker we had also started to catch a slight scent of the decaying smell he had caught earlier but this was to be expected I thought. A few minutes later and nothing from Haye’s we had decided to enter the maze of collapsed and crumbling buildings. A flare burned dimly near a building so we decided to leave the other 2 men to stay watch outside whilst we went inside.

“Take a look at this” I said pointing to the runic symbols that covered every surface. We surveyed the area with caution, only for the 2 others with I and Lisa to start arguing.

“Those are more magic the gathering lookin symbols” Apollo said.

“No it definitely belongs to dungeons and dragons” Nexus argued.

At this point I was just wanting to go back home but we had a job to do and by the time I looked back after my train of far away thoughts I found them wrestling each other to the ground over what the runes had looked to come from.

“Would you two fuckwits get off each other and shut up, we have to find Haye’s and finish the mission” I half yelled to not give our position away but enough for them to hear clearly.

"Who are you talking to?" Lisa asked. "The two idiots attracting unwanted attention." I snapped

"Marcus, they're out front.. where you wanted them." Lisa responded.

My blood ran cold as it suddenly came back to me. I ordered Nexus and Apollo to stand watch outside the building complex while we went in to look for Hayes. The radio suddenly crackled to life.

“I found a back entrance to a building since it’s starting to rain hard out where I am, I can barely hear you over the static” Haye’s voice chirped through our radios.

"Permission to enter, sir?" Hayes asked, his voice trembling.

"Granted. Enter cautiously and keep your eyes peeled.. This is now a retrieval and extraction." I replied, my voice a lifeline in the darkness.

“I’m walking up to the building's back entrance now and I see.. I see something, wait, that looks like hooded figures up ahea-” His voice cut out mid sentence as he presumably entered the building.

“Shit shit shit” I said aloud and started jogging in the direction of the back entrance, hoping to get to a possibly hurt Haye along with Lisa following my pursuit.

"Stay calm, Ryan. We're coming for you," I replied, my voice strained with determination.

As our reconnaissance team Delta rapidly approached the flared back exit, we noticed a slight electricity in the air as our hairs stood on end. When we first stepped foot into the building’s back entrance it was almost as if we had been put straight into a humid freezer, the kind you’d find at my Uncle Mickey's house and boy it was freezing. The second thing we noticed was Hayes’ rifle. Empty. This made no sense as we had heard zero gunfire moments before. Me and Lisa were confused but we had to move on and make the extraction successful.

“Apollo, Nexus, report in.” I said over the radio, got nothing but crackling silence in return.

“Shit.” I muttered,

“Signal must be too weak.”

Me and Lisa traversed the building's interior. Our steel toe boots hitting the wet floor. There was a tension in the air, and I knew why. Lisa doubted my ability to lead us. I swear I caught her eying me a few times. As we continued our imperial march down the hallway we had encountered the dog tag of our boy Haye’s, not a good sign at all.

”Haye’s come in, are you injured?”, nothing except total static but a slight slur came out of the radio like someone trying to speak for the first time.

“Haye’s, Nexus, Apollo, is that you. Come in”.

To our horror the room we ended walking into whilst distracted by the radio was well, there’s no good way to put this.. It was filled with bones of all sizes, some ranged from carrot sized while some were the size of an oversized frying pan.

“Holy shit…” Lisa muttered under her breath.

“This wasn’t on any of the intel we had.”

She was right. Nothing could have prepared us for this. The radio crackled to life.

“Turn around.”

We immediately swing around towards the door and I’m not sure how nor do I really care but there was Apollo. I looked at Lisa and she shot me a look of approval. She saw him too. “I told you to stay outside!” I said.

“I’m sorry, our position was compromised and we had to get the hell out of there.” he explained.

"And where is your great dungeon master buddy Nexus?” I asked with a touch of annoyance and concern.

“I don’t know, we ran in two different directions.” he said.

“They could’ve got to him for all we know.”

That’s when I noticed it. It was slight and any average person would’ve missed it. His eyes. I was shining my flashlight straight at his face, yet I saw no reflection in his eyes. At first I chalked it up to delusion but the more I examined his physical appearance the more irregularities I saw. His hair was a slightly darker shade of gray, His skin was paler than usual. He even seemed taller at one point. The teeth when he showed a grateful grin looked irregularly sharp, almost dagger-like. It appeared that Lisa didn’t see what I did because she gave him a firm handshake and they started to set off to find Haye’s along with Nexus. He also had a tinge of blood smeared on the toe of his steel toed boot. As they left the room, I trailed behind, making sure to keep an eye on Apollo.

“Hellooo” a familiar voice said on the radio.

Ryan sounded.. Off. I didn’t know how to describe it. He prolonged every word he said as if he was unsure that was the word he wanted to use.

“Ryan, is that you?” I asked.

“Yess,” he responded.

“Tell us where you are. We need land-markers.”

“Goo past…” he said.

“Can you repeat that?” I asked, Silence.

As if he were choosing his next words very carefully.

“Ryan, we need you to be more specific on your coordinates” I ordered in a stern monotone voice.

When he didn’t respond I ordered Lisa and Apollo to follow me deeper into the building we had entered into. I was trying to rationalize it by telling myself Haye’s was probably slurring his speech due to the fact it was super cold and he could have hypothermia I thought to myself.

“Is it just me or is it getting colder the further we go into this crumbling wreckage of a building?” Lisa murmured to nobody in particular.

“May I take a minute to collect myself?”

I said to the old agents that were collecting my memories like bees on a flower. They nodded and I took a sip of a water glass that sat on the metal table in the room we lingered in. After half a minute I continued my account. So, we rounded a corner and we saw a figure just standing there in the dark hallway. It nerved the shit out of me since it stood like a statue and as quiet as an asylum chamber. By the looks of it the figure had a uniform the same as the ones we were wearing which made it seem odd.

“Hey, is that you Haye’s?” I called out toward the unmoving figure.

It didn’t respond nor move an inch to the sound of my command. Just as a precaution I ordered the others to check their ammunition and point it forward just in case it got messy. And just then I noticed, Apollo didn’t have his rifle which greatly confused me.

“Apollo, where is your rifle?” I ordered in an angered tone.

“I lost it in the scramble me and Nexus had earlier when the terrorist ambushed us whilst waiting outside as you ordered us to.” He replied looking pale as he probably recounted it in his head.

I gave him an angered stare but shot my gaze back at the still unmoving figure. I held my hand up to tell Lisa and Apollo to stay back as I slowly closed the distance between me and it. As I came within a few feet of it I poked the figure in the back with the tip of my rifle. It promptly fell over with a deafening dull thud.

“Holy fucking jesus on a skateboard” I half yelled when I realized it was Nexus’s uniform with his dog tag around the mannequins neck.

 It was a god damn mannequin which scared the shit out of me and the others. How in the hell did his uniform and all get around a mannequin that just so happened to perfectly fit his clothes. This shit show was already making no sense but now I felt like this was a low budget nightmare.

“They must have gotten him and done this as a sick joke to toy with us.” Apollo said in a shaky voice.

“We don’t know that but it is indeed a grim possibility. But we must remain on point and hope for the best, even though this job is never always a happy ending” I told them with sadness in my tone.

It was a while and in that time I thought Lisa was giving me multiple side glances which really set the idea in my head that she might try something with opposing my authority of the mission at hand. We were checking and sweeping every room we came across only to find nothing but dust and static on the radio until we either heard a response on the radio or came across our other lost teammates. About 12 rooms down the hallway we found a door slightly ajar which we found all the other shut tight. I halted the unit and made a hand signal to proceed with guns drawn into the room.

“Three, Two, One” I counted quietly.

When I hit zero we entered the room with a slight pace in our stealthy entrance into the room. To this very day I wish we had left that room alone but we had a job to do. What we found was Nexus, well, what remained of what you could barely call a human.

The mangled remains of Nexus lay sprawled amidst the surrounding ruble, an art piece of carnage. His form resembled a pulpy chaos, with flesh torn into ribbons and organs strewn about as though crafted by a butcher catering exclusively to Bundy and Dahmer themselves.

Limbs were twisted at unnatural angles, bones protruding through torn skin like jagged spears. Chunks of flesh had been ripped away, leaving gaping wounds that ooze crimson blood onto the ruined floor. His face, contorted in betrayal, was barely recognizable beneath the mass of ripped tendons and muscle.

Eyes stared lifelessly, wide with terror, while lips peeled back in a silent scream, revealing broken teeth protruding from the back of his throat and neck as well as partially and having his own tongue bitten off, hanging out of his mouth like a dog with its head out a car window. A rusty piece of rebar was protruding through the back of his head and out of where his left eye should have been in a bloody fashion.

It was a scene of unimaginable horror, a testament to the merciless brutality of whoever had done this upon Lieutenant Gabriel Nexus. And as we stood amidst the carnage, the realization dawned upon us that in the darkness of the crumbling labyrinth, something merciless lurked, its bloodlust insatiable and its thirst for harm unquenchable.

“Well, whoever did this should have left us some flowers too because this is a very fucked up art piece it made out of him.” I remarked with a frigid chill running through my veins.

 I was promptly punched in the arm by Lisa for making that remark and as soon as Apollo came through the door the after us to where we stood he froze like a statue and doubled over a few feet away from us from the fucked sight of Nexus.

“We need to get the fuck out of here” I thought aloud.

Apollo and I shared the same unspoken thought, a lingering question that danced on the edge of our minds until Lisa voiced it aloud, cutting through the tense air,

"Do we radio home base and request the dreadnoughts?"

"Even if we do, which we should, I doubt they'll send them. It's not disastrous enough for them to intervene. Plus, those guys are just muscle, they'll shred everything they see," I replied, my confidence tinged with uncertainty.

"It's worth a shot. And if they refuse, we can always bail in the armored truck we arrived in," Apollo suggested.

"We'll be toast if we bail, whether or not the base agrees," I countered, my voice edged with a sneer.

I thought over our options, and it became clear there were no good choices. Stay and risk further danger, or call for extraction and face potential consequences. Calling in the dreadnoughts wasn't viable either, as they were essentially a last resort.

"Unit Delta to base, do you copy?" I asked sternly into the radio receiver.

"Base to Delta, copy. What's the situation?" The man on the other end asked with curiosity and professionalism.

"Delta Unit to base, we've got one KIA, another MIA. Multiple hostiles surrounding the compound. Requesting immediate backup!" I conveyed, a hint of panic evident.

When the base hadn't responded right away, worry gnawed at my mind. Had we lost connection?

"Base to Delta Unit, backup denied due to current situation. Be advised, we are detecting multiple signatures around the area you are located in" He told me with confidence and a touch of empathy.

"Delta Unit to base, roger that. We'll be on site until the threat is neutralized," I confirmed before signing off.

With no backup en-route, we were left to fend for ourselves. As I straightened my back, I saw Hayes limping toward us, his condition shockingly worse than imagined. His skin drooped in some areas and stretched thin in others, a grim sight that made my skin crawl.

"H-Haye's, is that you? Where have you been?" I asked, a mix of relief and anger in my voice.

Hayes barely acknowledged my presence, his demeanor unsettling. But before I could dwell on it, I spotted a few flashlights in the distance coming from a group of 3 people patrolling the area it seemed. I’ll grill his brains out when we get back to base after we finished the mission I thought to myself. 

I was about to brief the team on our next move when I realized Hayes was missing again. Alarm bells rang in my mind. Hadn't I just seen him moments ago?

"Did anyone notice Hayes is missing again?" I asked, a chill creeping up my spine.

"Yeah, he said something about scouting a vantage point down the hall," Apollo replied, his tone nonchalant.

"Check on him, make sure he's okay," I ordered, my unease growing.

"That directive will haunt me forever, Agent... Wait, you never disclosed your first name," I said, addressing the agent from the FBI, ATF, or whatever damn organization he represented.

"I suspect you're delaying what you must disclose, eager to return to your solitary abode and share this tale with your online acquaintances. But should you do so, I'll have no choice but to imprison you for violating the NDA I'll provide once this story concludes. So, refrain from inquiries and proceed," the seasoned individual growled, their voice resonating with the weight of years and authority, leaving me shaken to my core.

“Apologies,” I murmured.

So, when Apollo had ventured off to check up on Haye’s I had noticed a few figures tentatively crouching alongside the building just a floor below us. Those terrorist fucks were going to try and get the jump on our unit if we stepped a foot outside of this building we were located in. 

“Hey guys, I have spotted 4 armed figures crouched on the east wall just a floor down from the window I am closest to.” I spoke firmly into the radio.

Before I could lose myself in the recedes of my mind I witnessed Apollo barrel through the open doorway and nearly crash through a closed wooden door before he could stop himself. He looked white as a ghost and out of breath like he just ran a full marathon. "

Hey, watch where you're going Apollo” Barked Lisa as she had a near miss with Apollo colliding with her head on.

“C-C-Captain, I f-found Haye’s..” He shakely said in a tone that was barely audible.

“Okay, is he alright?” I questioned.

“H-He’s.. His b-body is gone.”

“What are you talking about Apollo, is he alright and still there?” I demanded with unease.

“His body is g-gone, only h-his skin is l-left..” Apollo said whilst his knees were buckling and shaking under his weight.

I hadn’t realized it at the time, it took me a few seconds to process what he said until it just clicked. When I figured out what he meant I bolted towards the hallway to find the room where Haye’s went to find a good vantage point. When I finally found the room I gagged as the sight was horrific.

 Before us lay Private Hayes, or rather, what remained of him, a ghastly shedded skin draped over the cold earth. His skin, once a canvas of life, now hung in tattered shreds, a macabre tapestry stretched over a devoid room. With only his skin remaining, the flesh was only shedding strips like shedded snakeskin. 

Beneath the shredded remnants of his flesh, there was nothing but emptiness, a void where muscle and sinew once pulsed with vitality, now emptied by, well. Nothing. Blood, thick and viscous, seeped from the shredded remains, mingling with the badly scented room in a sickening display. His face, a face of surprise and pain, bore the brunt of the humanities fury. Eyes, wide with horror, stared sightlessly into the abyss, their once vibrant hue now dulled by the chill embrace of death. Lips, torn and mangled, were frozen in a silent frown, a testament to the unspeakable damage he had endured. But amidst the desolation, one thing was clear Private Hayes was beyond salvation. In this forsaken place, the darkness held sway, and the horrors of man that lurked within were beyond the normal man’s eye.

Apollo appeared behind me suddenly with a surprisingly calm expression. What I hadn’t noticed before was that the hunting knife situated in his waistband was missing when I saw it a few minutes ago..

“Apollo, where is your knife?” I asked with concern.

“Oh, I had probably lost it from the ambush we had earlier.” He said in a nervous tone.

“You better be right about that, don’t lose weapons the terrorists can use against you again, yes?” I barked.

At this point Lisa tried to look through the doorway but we had subdued her efforts and forced her away from the room, for her sake. We need to radio in base and leave with or without their permission I thought to myself. I don’t care if I get my head put onto a stake in my boss's office. At that point I entered the room and noticed tossed furniture and blood stains leading towards a closed closet door.

“Apollo, watch my back, I’m going to check out the closed door.” I told him with conviction.

As I crept closer towards the door the smell I caught earlier got stronger, it was heavy with copper and a slight hint of decay. I stood before the door and in one swift motion I swung open the creaky old battered door and with deep sorrow in my soul I unfortunately found the insides and bones of the insides of Haye’s slouched in the dark abyss that the closet held in a tight grasp. The detail that turned my blood from ice to boiling hot rage was a knife protruding from Ryan’s sternum, a knife with Apollo’s bloodied initials on the handle of the blade..

Next thing I knew my temper exploded like Krakatoa erupting after thousands of years, a rage that I thought to be impossible to fully radiate from a human.

“APOLLO, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH." I screamed at him not caring if the bogeys outside could hear or not.

Before he could rifle his gun at me I pulled my service pistol from its holster and fired a shot that ripped through Apollo’s shoulder like a frenzied rocket. He managed to pull a shot off at me too but the bullet only grazed my thigh. His agonizing yells and moans of pain echoed throughout the building with Lisa bursting into the room where I shot him and where the remains of Haye’s skin and innards were strewn about. 

“Marcus, put your gun down. Why the fuck did you shoot Apollo?” She demanded from me.

“Do you not see the remains of Haye’s behind me? When I checked on the body I found a knife with Apollo’s initials on it protruding from Haye’s sternum.” I sternly said with my teeth clenched.

I sincerely thought I was losing my mind but that thought was pushed aside when Lisa confirmed what I saw only a few moments ago. She looked down at the now profusely bleeding Apollo and gave him a look I could only describe as pure hate and disgust, so before I could tell her to handcuff him and not cause any more damage to him she grabbed her handgun and shot him square in the temple.

“Jesus fucking christ Alvarez, why did you do that? We could have taken him in and put him in prison for life or even the death sentence!” I yelled at her for the unprofessional actions taken to get rid of Apollo.

“Let’s just get the fuck out of here, I just need to radio base on what our next move is.” I thought aloud

.“Unit Delta to Base, come in” I spoke into the radio.

“-Static-”

Shit, I guess the concrete building is blocking the radio signals so we have to leave on our own accord then. I peeked outside the window the crimson walls had to offer and had not seen any hostile enemies around or approaching our current location, perhaps they left the compound in fear of more officers being called down to take the rest of them out for a date with the reaper.

“Let's just get out of here and back to base, I just can’t stand seeing any more death tonight.” Lisa told me with desperation in her eyes. I had the same idea but refused to say it until she did that for me.

We trudged down the stairs and peeked out the front entrance to find the corpses of the terrorists we had shot down from their high horse just a few short hours ago. We proceeded with rifles drawn along with a swiftness that was questionable considering that stealth was a good sized priority when traversing the labyrinth of crumbling cobblestone buildings. When we were about 100 yards away from the armored truck Lisa had tripped on a root that stuck out of the ground which made her stumble and fall in an awkward angle so that she sharply hit her head on one of the many rocks the size of yoga balls that littered the area.

“Shit, Lisa are you alright?”

I said in a consoling tone. She wouldn’t respond as I assumed she was either unconscious or dead from her untimely fall. So ultimately I had to carry her a hundred or so yards and into the truck. When I put her in the back and I hopped into the driver's seat I noticed the keys were still in the ignition, my dumbass had left them there so I am lucky nobody decided to steal our only escape. I turned the ignition and the vehicle rumbled with steady intensity, ready to take us far far away.

“So that’s my adult only fairy tale you wanted out of me, agent.” I spoke to him in an overall tired tone.

"And how is Lisa holding up sir?"

“She is braindead since the blow to her head gave her major brain damage so she will never remember this mission and will need to live in an assisted living home until she ends up dead.” The agent said like it was the most normal goddamn thing he’s ever said.

In the end the agent made me sign an NDA which he promised my sorry ass earlier and sent me on my way. So, that’s my story and I’ll put my bets that the agent will be super fucking pissed when he figures out that I recorded our entire conversation on this old 90s recorder I have used for your interested mind.

I’ll leave you with some advice, humanity will always be the apex predator to what it can conjure up against you. At least you can hide under the covers from the monster under your bed, but when you are faced with someone with true horrific intent all you can do is watch the fight unfold.
