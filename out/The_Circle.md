There is nothing for which I more fiercely yearn than the eternal embrace of death. There is not a soul more intimate with its cold touch than myself, it is a curse I am forever forced to wield. I am the inevitable fate of us all, the shepherd from this realm. I am the blood soaked hand, the final caress. I am death itself.

What a blessing it would be to know not of pity. I am not a heartless man, if it is man that I am? There is an unwavering empathy felt for all, as all I have ever loved has fallen before me. I have tried to put an end to it, to take my own life, yet I persist on. I fear that even when the fabric that ties all that is finally tears, it will be only I and the void which remain.

It wasn’t always this way. I was born a gift from god as we all are. I was raised in love, I learned to love. With the season of manhood came more than physical change.The start was gradual, and only with the simplest of souls. Our houseplants would wither and die one after another, the still bodies of insects littered my bedroom floor each morning. Then our cat took ill. An overnight stay at the vet seemed to fully revive him, yet he was gone the next day, curled at the foot of my bed.

It was the loss of my mother which finally broke me. Such conflict there was in my hesitation to visit her in her dying days. How does one accept the reality of becoming the angel of death? The signs can only be ignored for so long. The day I watched her heart cease to beat was the day I knew it to be true. 

This force grows stronger with each passing moment. Birds fall from the sky as I walk, the tallest of trees wilt at my touch. When there was no other option I found the desert and I walked to its deepest and most desolate center. It is there that I sit. It is here I will remain until the final knee bends.

There is a circle that as formed around me. I am its center and the force from which it grows. Living vegetation has rapidly dissapeared from my line of sight. There is not a single creature on this earth that could reach me now, the circle has grown too large. There is no time within these borders. Eternity envelops from its center and swallows all that it touches. It is here that no wind blows, it is here that no rain falls. It is inevitable that this circle will know no bounds…

I thirst yet I do not drink. I hunger yet I do not eat. Still I grow stronger. The sun has blistered and burnt my skin beyond recognition. I feel the pain of it all, but I cannot succumb.

 I commune with the creator now. The one who has made all that has been and all that still is. I am his antithesis. I am the destroyer. It is my destiny to undue all that has been. It is my burden to weep in its ashes forevermore.
