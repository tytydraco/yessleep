some horrible thing's have been going on in our neighborhood. About a month ago, children have been disappearing right out of their homes. The police havent been divulging any information on the situation, whenever pressed on the issue, they would respond that the matter was under investigation and they had the situation well in hand. I knew that response was P.R. bullshit. What they really meant was: we have no clue what's going on, who's behind it or how we can stop it. 

 Thing's where quiet for a few day's before more children started disappearing. Before you knew it, every corner,light post and anywhere you could put a missing person poster was full of them. Thing's got so bad, families where driving out of town in droves. I would've followed suit and taken my daughter far away until the situation was handled or whoever was kidnapping these kids got shot by an angry parent, unfortunately I didn't count with the financial means to go anywhere for any extended amount of time. Yesterday our neighbors from a few houses down woke the entire street up with blood curdling screams. It had happened to them too. 

Their young boy had been taken in the dead of the night,no forced entry,no alarms were set off, it was as if the kid was never even in his room to begin with. This seriously worried everybody that was left in our small-town community. Whenever you hear bad thing's going on in this world you feel a certain disconnect as you may think: this will never happen to me or mine. It's an entirely different thing when those bad thing's happen in your backyard and you being the next victim is an entirely real possibility. My next door neighbor,David, was a family man as well, he had every intention of protecting his children and had approached me earlier today to ask for help doing this. 

He wanted me and my daughter to sleep in their house while he and I pulled security to make sure there would be no way anyone would even have a chance to get in and kidnap his two young boy's. It was a strength in number's situation and I was desperate to protect my own daughter so I accepted his proposal. When we got to his house we had noticed that all the window's had been boarded shut, leaving only the front door as possible entrance to the house. Once night rolled around david tuck his kids in their beds and closed the door with lock and key. He walked out with a baby monitor in hand, another one had been left inside the boy's room.

 "If anything goes on in there,we'll know". He said confidently. David had offered my daughter to sleep with his boy's in their room but she had declined, she's always been very attached to me and honestly, having her sleep next to me during this whole ordeal would help both of us feel better. David handed me a double barrel shotgun and gave me a crash course on how to use it. For the next few hour's it was quiet as a graveyard in that house. David was fixed on the baby monitor waiting to hear any signs of a break in. My daughter had fallen asleep on the couch and I was trying to get some sleep.

David and I were taking turns at security, one kept a lookout for about 2 hours and the other would sleep. Around 2 in the morning David woke me up and handed me the baby monitor, it only took about a minute for him to pass out on the couch. Almost an hour in to my shift it happened. First the baby monitor started giving some static feedback that made me think the thing was breaking on me. Then there was an ever so slightly creaking sound coming from the upstairs bedroom, like someone was shifting his weight to quietly move around. 

I doubt I would've heard anything if we weren't directly below the kids bedroom. The baby monitor was picking up something. It was faint and barely audible through the static but I thought I was making out distorted voices,too many to just be David's 2 boy's. They were crying, some screaming. "David, the boy's!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. As if he was only faking being asleep, David jumped out of the couch with his shotgun in hand and raced upstairs, I followed shortly behind. 

When we got to the bedroom door we could hear muffled screaming coming from inside the room. "They couldn't have broken in", I thought. The windows from the room were boarded up from the inside and we were on the second floor of the house. David frantically tried to make his key go in the door lock,finally deciding on kicking the door open. What we saw next would haunt us for the rest of our days. 

There was this grotesque figure in the middle of the room,right in between the boy's beds. It had the familiar shape of a man,but it was twisted,malformed and horrific. It was impossible yet it was standing right in front of us. There was a particular bulge right around where the thing's belly should be, it appeared bloated and then the realization kicked in. It had swallowed one of David's boy's. 

When we broke in to the room it was in the process of swallowing the other boy, it had it's elongated boney fingers around the child's waist as it had already shoved half of his body down his gullet. We could still hear him screaming. It took an eternity for any of us to digest what was going on, much less do anything about it. David was the first to fire at the creature, it moved out of the way with shocking speed and agility, moving across the floor on all fours, it crawled underneath one of the boy's bed and there it disappeared. We were speechless. 

As soon as shock left my body, I raced downstairs and held my daughter in my arms,she was still there, she was still alive. In the morning the police arrived at David's house and  corroborated his story. The officer's didn't seem too shocked by the honestly batshit crazy story a nervous wreck David told them. Something told me the police were more aware of this thing than they were letting on but judging from what I witnessed last night, what could they do about it? I decided to move in with my parents a few states over, there's no way I was going to stay another night in this God forsaken neighborhood. 

Hopefully I can get my daughter far away from the creatures feeding grounds and we can go back to a version of normal life. But if this thing has its sights set on my little girl, I'm afraid there won't be anything I can do to stop it.
