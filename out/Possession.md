This is a true story so I had to change the names of everyone.

This didn’t happen to me. It happened to my mom and the man she was with at the time, Tom. I only know about it because of her and because she wrote down notes while it was happening. I also saw some of the craziness and the way he was acting. 

It began in May of 2014, on Mother’s Day.

Tom was out and about one day, probably at the bank or something when he walked into a jewelry store he had never been to before. He said it was an impulse. He felt drawn to the store for some reason. 

The workers greeted him one after another, but he waved them off. Finally he pointed to a woman behind the counter and said, “Her. I want her to help me.”

Her name was Karen.

She walked over to help him and didn’t act like it was strange that he asked for her specifically. She also didn’t think it was strange that he randomly asked and guessed right that she was Native American. 

That day he bought a bracelet for his daughter, Sarah, and a turquoise necklace for my mom, Linda. Karen told him turquoise was for protection.

Later, when he tried to pick up another turquoise necklace of my mom’s, he dropped it immediately. He said it burned his hand.

He went back to the store often. My mom was with him for some of those visits. One day, she saw him take Karen’s hand across the counter. He broke down crying and said he didn’t know why, only that he felt so much sorrow. Karen began to cry too. They held hands, both of them crying in the middle of the store. My mom stood there like, what is going on?

Another time, Tom said he needed to bring Karen a turkey feather. He didn’t know why. He just said he had to. He even went right to a specific store that he’s never seen or heard of before to purchase it. She wasn’t there that day, so he left it in an envelope with her name on it.

One day my mom was sitting across from him at a diner and when she looked at him and saw another man’s face over his. She said it looked like a ghostly overlay.

“I see another face over yours,” she told him. Like she was definitely scared at this point. 

Tom brushed it off and kept eating like he knew it was there or something. 

A few days later, my mom ran into Karen outside the store. They were talking casually when Karen said, “Did I ever tell you about my son? His name was Jason. He died in a motorcycle crash.” Then she showed Linda a photo of him.

It was the exact face she had seen over Tom’s.

After that, things started to get even more crazy.

Tom’s personality shifted. He became overly touchy with people. He started talking constantly, almost manic. He couldn’t sleep. He ordered food but wouldn’t eat it. He became inappropriate and sometimes angry and aggressive. Everyone noticed he wasn’t himself.

My mom wrote it all down thankfully because she knew weird stuff was happening. The first note says:
“First meeting with Karen. Immediate, uncanny ‘spiritual’ connection.”

The later entries say:
“Personality changeover. Overly touchy. 
Aggressive.”
“Constant conversation. No sleep. No appetite. Ordering food but not eating it.”

One night my mom tried praying the Our Father when he was getting overly aggressive towards her. Tom screamed at her to stop.

Another night, she read from the Bible. He flipped out, yelling at her to put it away.

She wrote about that too:
“Bible incident. Night of aggression.”

This went on for months.

It did end eventually.

One night my mom kept reading the Bible near him while he was asleep, and when he woke up he said he felt like a weight had lifted off him.

That morning, a rash appeared on his left leg. Red, swollen bumps, almost like hives on steroids. By the next day it was gone.

Then it moved to his right leg. Same thing. It lasted a day, disappeared, then showed up on his right arm. The next day it was gone, and then it appeared on his left arm.

After that, it spread across his torso.

And then it was gone.

Just like that, it was over.
