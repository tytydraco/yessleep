  

The violent red light presses against my eyelids as I’m dragged in the day like a screaming stillbirth. I look around the quad and hitch my backpack up higher and stride across campus towards the library. I still needed to study for Professor Derleth’s final and the statue had kept me up into the wee hours of the morning. I hustled forward with my head down and thought about the light, the pain and the Maiden. 

I opened the door to the library as it exhaled a breath of stale lepidopteran kisses into my face, and I smiled at the memories of tomorrow night. I went in and sat down at my usual spot, dragging out several books and a bloody rosary. I opened up the first book and set to studying but before I could even properly get into it I feel twin pulses of yearning battering against the top of my head. I looked across the room to see a girl in a normal school uniform with straight black hair and wide pale eyes. She had eyes only for me and licked her luscious lips lustily. She coyly lowered her eyes and bit her lip as I turned away and turned my attention back to the book. 

*The Haminoptrin* *butterfly (Rhopalocera Weisz-Fraserin) is the only known insect to commit suicide. After fertilizing the eggs, the male eats the effluence of the female to spare the hatching brood as this is poisonous and would invariably be their first meal upon hatching if he did not consume it, dying in agony.*

The girl was in front of me, her small gentle hand pushing the book down while the other grasped the shirt at her collar in a twisting grip. She stood over me, a smoldering gaze burning into my jaded heart, and her teeth biting deep into her lower lip. She continued pulling her collar open and began to unbutton the first button as she leaned down over me.

Her voice roiled in my ear as though it was a squirming maggot seeking to devour my diseased and infected brain. “Here,” she breathed, “and now.” She flicked electric kisses down my neck and jolted me as her perfect white teeth pierced my jugular and a flood of crimson swept through the library.

*The female leaves and never returns to care for the abandoned children and many of them are destroyed by the evil predators. But one survives and eats and eats until it is full…*

She threw her head back and laughed as she touched the arm of the man sitting next to her. Tall and dark, he was a study in contradictions to her petite porcelain physique. She gazed into his ears and the blood boiled up into my eyes as the rage at her betrayal boiled inside me. I shook my head and chalked it up to another wicked jezebel that the Maiden had warned me against. 

*of hate, dreams, and laughter. Then he spun himself up in the empty skin of his fallen brethren and slept…*

I knew I had to pass this exam, but her laughter grated on me as she writhed atop the stupid jock.

*the sleep of the justified. He emerges changed through the Maiden and is now a true butterfly coming through into what was always his.*

Slamming the book shut I smiled. I had finally learned my lesson. I left the bag and the books there. I had no need for them. I followed them out of the library and watched them walk slowly across campus. I kept my head down watching from under my eyelids and saw them keep a safe distance between them **LEAVE ROOM FOR THE HOLY GHOST!** as though she hadn’t been thrashing like the whore of Brooklyn just moments before. He turned off before she did and didn’t even give her the respect of a proper goodbye despite her fervent gyrations. I chose the clear winner knowing the Maiden would lead me back to her when it was time.

The dusk loomed as I followed him to a dorm room and then inside. He turned to me and said, “Man, you have been acting really weird lately.” I struck him in the forehead with the onyx gloriousness of the Maiden and she bathed in vermillion fervor. Screaming, I brought her down again and again on the face of this pestilent purloiner of pilfered passions. I felt someone behind me, and she whispered a warning as they stood dumbfounded in the doorway.

Yes, our journey wasn’t complete. I turned to the young man in the door and smiled with my blood splattered smile. “It’s ok. She was so very thirsty. A thirsty thirsty gurl,” I chuckled. She flew across the room and pierced his eye as I closed the gap and dragged him in the dorm room. 

*The new male knows better than to mate as females are death.*

Gripping the Maiden tightly I cross the manicured lawn towards my destiny as the sirens grow louder. Oh yes, she will finally be all mine.
