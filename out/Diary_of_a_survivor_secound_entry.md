Day Two  
The first thing I wanted to do when I woke up in the morning was to gather information about my situation. You know, it's not normal to see literal monsters in the city, unless you count addicts as monsters. So, I took two guns from my friend's collection along with the respective magazines. In my friend's garage, there was the BMW he used to drive when he was still here. I thought he wouldn't be angry if I took the car; after all, his car is full of gasoline, so I wouldn't have to worry about fuel. His keys were right by the garage door.  
  
I decided I would go outside to gather more information. For example, why there aren't any humans around and what those creatures are. I opened the garage door, got into the car, and started it. I drove the car to the nearest village to look for human remains. I thought it couldn't be that there wasn't even a trace of humans. If those monsters attacked them, there should be blood, but there was nothing.  
  
As I drove through the village, I saw some monsters. Only now did I realize that there are different types of monsters. I could differentiate five types:  
  
The small but extremely fast monsters that could easily run 45 miles per hour. I wouldn't be able to outrun them, but if I were to encounter one alone, I could probably defeat it with my strength. They look like little gremlins, but they have a more... meaty appearance. They have mouths with long teeth.  
  
The insect-like creatures would be a nightmare for people with Apiphobia. They resemble bugs or centipedes, but I think they can't fly due to their size. I'd rather not encounter them upfront because I've heard that the exoskeleton of bugs is very tough. Who knows, maybe they could survive a bullet.  
  
The mammal-like monsters are mostly four-legged and can be described as giant creatures with a small head and long, stretchy necks. I should be cautious about how fast they can stretch their necks. Nevertheless, I did manage to kill one of those, so I know for a fact that they are killable.  
  
The slimes. I know it sounds hilarious, but I'm afraid of those creatures. They don't seem to have any organs or visible weak points. They can move incredibly fast and can reshape their forms in any way. In the village, I witnessed a Type 3 monster attacking one of the slimes, and the slime dissolved its head instantly with its body.  
  
The most terrifying type, however, I only discovered while I was driving out of the village. To understand it, I will write down the story of what happened on that occasion. After looting the Walmart for food and water, I intended to drive back to my hideout. On the way, I saw something unbelievable â€” a man. I thought I had found another person, so I stopped my car and approached him, calling out to him. He came closer, so I thought he understood me. However, as he came close enough, his entire face split in a horrifying fashion, revealing a mouth full of teeth. I didn't hesitate to pull out my weapon and shoot the creature. I'll be honest, I think I might have wet myself a little, but that was my first encounter with a "human" type.  
  
I got back into my car and drove to my hideout. Now, I'm writing down the information in this book I found in the drawer of my bedroom. I've also documented what happened yesterday. I've truly lost hope of finding another human again. Who knows, maybe... but only maybe, I'm really the last man on Earth.
