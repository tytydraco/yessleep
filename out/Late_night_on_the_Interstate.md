The night I'm about to recount left me grappling with more questions than answers. This past summer, I decided to embark on a rather audacious goal: biking across the entire expanse of the United States. While summer proved an arduous season for such an endeavor, its constraints aligned with my schedule, rendering it an opportunity I couldn't resist.

The journey yielded a trove of stories, each more astonishing than the last. From hair-raising dog chases that seemed to stretch on forever, to the unnerving encounters with locals who gave "hospitality" a different twist, and the heart-stopping near misses with cars that were apparently in a race against time, every anecdote etched a unique mark on this adventure. Yet, anyone considering a cross-country odyssey like mine must reckon with the inherent risks. It's a test of resilience where every mile is a gamble.

Unfortunately, my grand expedition was curtailed due to health setbacks. Nevertheless, the experiences I gathered remain as a treasure trove of stories I'll be recounting for years to come. Among these tales, one incident from just three weeks ago stands out as a testament to the unpredictable nature of life on the road.

Ordinarily, I'd go to great lengths to avoid major interstates. These highways tend to be a melting pot of chaos and unpredictability. But fate had different plans for me, and I found myself navigating the asphalt veins of Interstate 90. I'd rather not disclose the exact location – let's just say it was somewhere between the vibrant aura of Rapid City and the urban embrace of Sioux Falls.

My health had taken a hit, but the determination to press on prevailed. I was in the business of making up for lost time, even if it meant dabbling in a domain I'd usually steer clear of. The irony was palpable when I encountered a roadblock on the very interstate I had reluctantly chosen. It brought back memories of similar signs on a past road trip to the Grand Canyon – flashing lights instructing travelers to divert. But this time, the situation was much more puzzling.

While the roads in my hometown are devoid of such intricacies, here I was, standing before the highway equivalent of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" story. My curiosity piqued, and curiosity has a funny way of obscuring better judgment. So, ignoring caution, I maneuvered past the roadblock, brimming with the confidence that I'd outsmarted whatever inconvenience lay ahead.

What transpired next remains etched in my mind as a scene from a thriller movie. As I pedaled on, I was met with an eeriness that defied my expectations. About a quarter-mile from the interstate, nestled within the moonlit canvas of a field, were three enigmatic figures. Were they helicopters, drones, or figments of my imagination playing tricks on me? Their form was veiled, devoid of any discernible lights, a mystery shrouded by the moon's cautious embrace.

A sense of prudence kicked in, and I promptly abandoned my bike. Nestling beside the highway divider, hidden in plain sight, I watched and waited. Who were these nocturnal visitors? Were they friend or foe? Military or civilian? The answers, it seemed, lay suspended in that peculiar nocturnal dance.

As I sit here reflecting, the enigma of that night continues to haunt my thoughts. Some mysteries remain unsolved, left to simmer in the realms of the unknown. They become stories that are as much a part of the journey as the destination itself. And so, I find myself compelled to embrace the questions, to marvel at the uncertainties, and to share the experience with those who, like me, understand that sometimes, it's the unanswered queries that truly define an adventure.
