Dear Reddit, 
I hate to retell this experience I had as a child please be patient as I’m still trying to cope with my experiences and everything that’s happened to me in the year 1990. 

Far up North in the wilderness in a small cottage with my grandma and brother Jack. There in the Summer time, I remember me and my brother would play at the nearest hillside east of the house close to the brush near our house surrounded by towering trees that seemed to whisper secrets with every rustle of their leaves. Little did we know, those whispers would soon turn into screams.

The locals warned us about the Blind Man, a serial killer who supposedly roamed the valley, preying on unsuspecting victims under the cover of darkness. They spoke of his empty eyes, devoid of sight but filled with an insatiable hunger for blood.

At first, we brushed off their warnings as nothing more than local folklore, but as strange occurrences began to plague our days and nights, we couldn't ignore the feeling that something sinister lurked in the shadows.

It started with whispers echoing through the trees, faint at first but growing louder and more sinister with each passing day. My brother and I would wake in the dead of night to the sound of footsteps outside our window, only to find no one there when we dared to look.

Then came the nightmares - vivid, haunting visions of a figure cloaked in darkness, its eyes as black as the void, reaching out to drag us into the abyss. We'd wake in a cold sweat, our hearts pounding in our chests, unable to shake the feeling of dread that hung over us like a shroud.

But the worst was yet to come.

One fateful night, we heard the unmistakable sound of a struggle coming from the depths of the forest. Against our better judgment, we ventured out into the darkness, following the desperate cries for help that echoed through the trees.

What we found still haunts me to this day - a grisly scene bathed in moonlight, the lifeless bodies of the Blind Man's victims strewn across the forest floor like discarded dolls. And there, lurking in the shadows, was the Blind Man himself, his eyes fixed on us with an intensity that sent shivers down our spines.

We fled, running faster than we ever thought possible, the echoes of his laughter following us through the night. Somehow, we made it back to the safety of our cottage, but the terror of that encounter would stay with us long after we left the valley behind.

To this day, I can't shake the feeling that the Blind Man is still out there, waiting in the darkness, his empty eyes watching, waiting for his next victim.

So, to anyone who dares to venture into the valley of trees, beware the legend of the Blind Man. For in the darkness, where the whispers grow loud and the shadows come alive, there are horrors beyond imagining waiting to claim their prey.
