The late October air was crisp as I hiked the familiar trail along the Minnesota River, a stretch of wilderness south of the Twin Cities. The vibrant reds and golds of the changing leaves clashed with the deepening gray of the twilight sky. The sun, already dipping below the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows across the path. I pulled my sweatshirt tighter, the chill seeping into my bones despite the brisk pace I set. That's when I saw it. At first, I thought it was just a deer, standing at the edge of the woods. 

 But something was off. It was massive, easily twice the size of any deer I'd ever seen in these parts. Its silhouette was elongated, almost skeletal, and its posture was strangely upright, almost as if it were standing on two legs. Its head was held at an unnatural angle, the long neck almost serpentine. As it turned its head towards me, I saw its eyes – twin points of burning orange, glowing with an unnatural intensity. Then, with a speed that defied its size, it vanished into the dense undergrowth.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart pounding. I'd spent countless hours hiking these trails, and I'd never seen anything like it. Was it just a trick of the light? A case of mistaken identity? Or was it something… else? The image of those glowing eyes haunted me as I hurried back to my car, the fading light casting an eerie pall over the familiar landscape.

Back in my apartment, in one of the quiet suburbs south of the city, I tried to rationalize what I'd seen, but the image of those burning eyes kept flashing in my mind. Maybe it was just a large deer, its size exaggerated by the shadows and my own fear. But the feeling of unease lingered. I found myself checking the locks on my doors and windows repeatedly, a prickle of fear crawling up my spine.

The unsettling feeling intensified as the days grew shorter and the nights colder. During my walks along the river trails, I started noticing things I'd never paid attention to before – broken branches high in the trees, tracks too large to belong to any known animal, a strange, musky odor, like rotting meat mixed with something sweet and cloying, that clung to the air like a shroud. The dreams began – vivid nightmares of the deer, its form twisting and contorting in the shadows, growing larger, more monstrous, until it resembled something not quite animal, not quite human. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, convinced I wasn't alone in my apartment.

One evening, as I was walking back from the grocery store, the street lights flickered off, I saw it again. It was standing at the edge of the parking lot, partially obscured by the shadows, but its form was unmistakable. Tall and skeletal, with dark, matted fur and what looked like antlers protruding from its head. Its eyes, those burning orange eyes, were fixed on me, radiating a malevolence that chilled me to the bone. It stood perfectly still, like a statue carved from bone and shadow, its gaze unwavering. I froze, a wave of pure terror washing over me. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to run, to scream, but my legs felt like lead and my throat felt constricted. It stood there for what felt like an eternity, its gaze unwavering, before the lights turning on revealing an empty spot.

The fear became a constant companion. I started carrying a heavy walking stick on my hikes, a pathetic defense against whatever this creature was. I researched local wildlife, trying to find a rational explanation, but nothing fit. I even considered talking to someone about it, but the fear of being dismissed as crazy kept me silent. The isolation only fueled my paranoia.
Driven by a desperate need to protect myself, I went to a local gun shop and bought a used handgun. It was a small, something I could easily conceal. The cold steel of it felt heavy and reassuring in my trembling hand, a small comfort against the encroaching darkness.

Winter arrived, blanketing the landscape in snow. The cold seemed to amplify the dread, making the feeling of being watched even more intense. It grew bolder. I started seeing it closer to my apartment building, lurking in the shadows of the parking lot, its eyes glowing in the darkness. It was no longer just watching; it was hunting. The tapping started subtly, a light scratching sound I initially dismissed as branches against the window. But it grew more insistent, more deliberate.

One night, I woke to a tap... tap... tap on my bedroom window. My heart hammered against my ribs. I knew what it was. Slowly, I sat up, my hand trembling as I reached for the handgun on my nightstand. The tapping continued, a rhythmic pulse of dread. I crept towards the window, peering through the blinds. It stood there, its gaunt, skeletal form silhouetted against the snowy landscape. Its face, illuminated by the pale moonlight, was a mask of grotesque hunger, its long, sharp teeth bared in a silent snarl. Those eyes, burning orange embers, were fixed on me, radiating pure malevolence.

Terror seized me, a primal fear I'd never experienced before. My breath hitched in my throat. I raised the handgun, my hand shaking uncontrollably, and aimed at the creature outside the window. Tap... tap... tap... The tapping continued, each tap a hammer blow against my sanity. I squeezed the trigger. The gun roared, the recoil jarring my hand. I flinched, expecting to see  it fall, but when I looked back at the window, it was gone. Just an empty window, the snow falling silently outside.
Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a wave of confusion. Had I actually hit it? Or had it just vanished, as it always did? I lowered the gun, my hand still trembling, and turned away from the window.

Tap... tap... tap...

The tapping was behind me.
I whirled around, my heart leaping into my throat. It stood in the corner of my room, its back to the window. How…? It hadn't come through the window. It was inside with me. How? The question echoed in my mind, a chilling whisper. Its head slowly turned, those burning eyes locking onto mine. A low, guttural growl rumbled from its chest, a sound that seemed to vibrate the very foundations of the building. It was even more terrifying up close. I could see the details now – the matted fur, the long, sharp claws, the patches of bare, rotting flesh. The smell was overpowering – a mix of decay and something ancient, something utterly alien.
I raised the gun again, but it was a useless gesture. I knew, deep down, that no bullet could stop this creature. It was a manifestation of fear and darkness. It took a step towards me, and I knew… I knew this was the end. Its long, clawed hand reached out…

I fired again. And again. The gun recoiled in my hand, the sound deafening in the small apartment. It shrieked, a sound that tore through the night, a sound of pure, unearthly rage. It staggered back, its burning eyes wide with something that might have been surprise, or even… pain? It turned and lunged for the window, crashing through the glass and disappearing into the snowy night.

I collapsed to the floor, my breath ragged, my body trembling. I didn't know if I'd hurt it, or if I'd just startled it. But it was gone. For now.
I knew I couldn't stay there. It would be back. It was only a matter of time. I scrambled for my coat and keys, shoving them into my pockets along with anything else I could grab phone, wallet, a half-eaten granola bar and bolted out the door. I drove through the night, adrenaline coursing through my veins, my eyes constantly scanning the shadows.

I ended up in a cheap motel hundreds of miles away, but I knew it was only a temporary reprieve. It was out there, somewhere. I could feel its presence, a cold dread that clung to me like a shroud.

As I described my encounter in detail, the chilling progression from a fleeting glimpse to a terrifying confrontation. I recounted the creature's appearance, its glowing eyes, its unnatural strength, the way it seemed to invade my thoughts. I warned people to be careful, to stay out of the woods at night, to be aware of the signs.
Some people responded with skepticism, dismissing my story as a hallucination or a hoax. But others… others believed. They shared their own stories, their own encounters with the unexplained. They spoke of strange sightings in the woods, of eerie sounds in the night, of a growing sense of dread that filled the area.
I realized I wasn't alone. There were others who had seen it and whispers about the name.

The Windego.
