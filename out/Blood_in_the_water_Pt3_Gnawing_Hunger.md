Adam Parker had been the first to willingly enter the crimson pool, enticed by the potential regenerative effects. It shouldn't have surprised any of us that he would be the first to get back into the pool, despite our implementation of rules against the secondary swim.



It had been a month since the initial incursion into the water, and things had seemingly returned to normal - except, of course, the color of the gore-stained water. The once colorless, clear pool now rested in a clear ruby red state, the sand and silt having long since settled. The gates to the park remained closed to the outside world, not that it mattered. Tourists and Campers no longer cast shadows across the sealed entryway, now decorated with a barricade of pamphlets advising of the park's closure. We couldn't hide our new forms from the other members of the town for long, and we could scarcely hide the reason for very much longer.



Nurse Joy was the first we let through the gates, administering wellness checks to everyone who had gone into the water. Once she determined that there seemed to be no lingering side effects, she wanted to bathe in the youthful waters, too. Certainly, other members of the town would want to take advantage of the ichor's restorative properties. After Joy had finished her swim, we all gathered to make a comprehensive set of rules designed to ensure the safety of anyone entering the pool.



1. No one was allowed to swim alone; you must be observed by one of the changed members. The sole goal of the observer was to prevent the bather from exiting the waters.
2. Only people twenty-five years or older were permitted to bathe in the waters. Jasmine and Dave both failed to meet this requirement, but they had been lucky enough to undergo treatment before these rules had been developed.
3. No one swims a second time. The waters have an incredibly powerful effect the first time someone swims. It was too dangerous to risk a second swim without testing it first, and we had no way to safely or humanely test such a thing.



While the majority agreed on the final rule, there were a few outspoken voices in stark opposition to it. Michael and Adam both thought that there was more that the pool could do for us, and insisted we figure it out. The rest of us were grateful for the gifts we had already received and didn't think the risk was worth whatever minor boon we may gain from a second dive. During our deliberation on that last rule, the Sheriff slipped away from the table. Mistakenly, we assumed he was going to get a drink or maybe to use the head. That belief was shattered by Chris's panicked voice calling out about how he had just run past the window down the hill.



The impromptu meeting table became a frenzy of scrambling figures as we all tried to give chase after Adam. Had the Sheriff been his former older form, our new college age bodies would have had no trouble in catching up with him, but he had a similarly peak physique and a head start. We ran as hard as we could, trying to gain ground; some of the more daring members even mantling over tables and discarded camping gear. It was a fruitless endeavor. By the time we reached the lip of the beach, Adam had already leapt from the edge of the retaining wall, and our efforts had to be redirected into stopping Mike. I managed to catch him with a clothesline across the chest, which turned his forward momentum into a downward arc that left him breathless in the dirt.



"Damn it, Adam! We literally just made this a rule!" Joy shouted from the edge of the stairs, watching as he splashed happily in the water.



"Hard to make rules about something you don't know nothing about!" Adam had a shit eating grin on his face, clearly pleased that he had managed to pull one over on us and get his way. "Besides, I'm doing this of my own free will, so we ain't gotta worry about coming up with some humane way of testin it! I'm willing to sacrifice myself for this town, I been doing it for years as the Sheriff anyhow."



Bullshit. Being the Sheriff of our sleepy hollow was about as dangerous as being a kindergarten cop. Issuing an occasional slap on the wrist speeding ticket to the campers who drove through town a little too quickly was the most intense thing Sheriff Parker had done in years. This wasn't some heartfelt self-sacrifice in the name of helping the town; this was nothing more than self-serving greed.



And yet, I couldn't bring myself to be enraged with him over this. Truthfully, my anger was barely a smolder, and it wasn't due to being mad at him for acting recklessly; it was bred from jealousy. If there was something new to be gained from bathing in the waters, then I wanted it too. I was just too afraid to jump right in and join him, and I was too jealous to let anyone else either.



No one had a retort to the Sheriff's words. We were scared that this second trip into the waters would be the end of him, and while we didn't want him to die in the waters, we also didn't want him to suffer the same tragedy as Sandra if he left their grasp too early. Our only recourse was to sit back and wait, watching to see what fate would befall him now.



Mike relented his attempts to enter the water, pacified by the assurance that he could swim if nothing bad happened to Adam. We gathered chairs and benches so that we could sit and watch, an eerie feeling on the back of our necks that we were not alone in observing this spectacle. Shadows beneath the cypress, mangrove, and flatwood pine trees seemed to coalesce into a dark presence. Anything that may have been lurking in those void patches stayed just beyond the reach of sight, but its presence was palpable.



Time dragged slowly on for hours as Adam's skin shriveled and wrinkled a natural and normal amount. His playtime in the ichorous water yielded no new results; nothing happened. After four hours with no changes, Adam Parker relented in his quest and returned to the shore. We stood with baited breath, unsure if he would suffer any dire consequences from this betrayal of our rules. Buckets of water were gathered before he advanced up the stairs, in case we needed to buy time to get him back in the water, and then he left the pool.



Fright, revulsion, and despair pooled in my gut; all stemming from the very real possibility that I was going to watch another friend die before my eyes. Those emotions slowly dispersed, exorcised alongside the expiring seconds. One minute passed and then two; finally, my fears disappeared.



"You are such a fucking idiot, Adam." Jasmine stepped forward and slapped him on the arm, a relieved grin on her face. The two of them had been uncomfortably close since we all swam in the springs.



"Hey, respect yer elders, young-" He began to tease back, abruptly cut off by a shout from nearby.



"Yooooo!" Chris shouted, eloquently, pointing out a disturbance in the water.



Following the line drawn from his shoulder to his fingertip and then cast into the liquid, I could see massive wake-like ripples cascading across the otherwise glassy, placid water. It didn't take long to spot what was the cause of the disturbance, as it was swimming directly towards us.



The main body was the length of a school bus and half as wide; the beast's tail was just as long, slicing through the water to propel it forward. Just the top of its skull peaked up out of the water at first, the familiar third eye splitting open to gaze at us on the rock wall. Then, one by one by one, more eyes began to tear the scaly green flesh of its head asunder. It was hard to count just how many eyes there were now, but it was more than ten. The Alligator from the ichor pit had also sprouted two new pairs of powerful legs, and its maw had split further down its body - jagged teeth poking out of the Cheshire grin all the way back to its first set of shoulders. The many eyes, which glowed slightly, moved in erratic searching patterns before all settling upon us. It croaked and groaned, chuffing and chortling at us from its position in the water.



I cannot put words to why I understood the call from the malformed alligator, but I knew intrinsically that it wasn't being hostile towards us. It wasn't a warning to stay away; it was an invitation to go with it, deeper into the water. Its offer was left unanswered, and the Malligator shortly turned around and receded into the reeds.



"What the fuck was that?" Mike was the first to break the silence after the beast left, his voice carrying a tone of curiosity rather than fear. I silently wondered if he felt the same way I had.



"We all went for a swim, and none of us became anything like that." Joy chimed in, looking around to the group as though she was checking for extra eyes or a stray sprouting limb.



Everyone pushed up to the edge of the rock wall, trying to look into the thick reeds where the beast had returned. They wanted to see the creature again; they hungered to understand how it had become what it had. A hushed battery of voices clashed with one another as they excitedly chattered about what this could mean for the springs.



"I don't think that happened because it went for a swim..." I broke the murmuring chatter after a moment with my own hypothesis. They all paused and turned to face me, an anxious grimace on my face. "When I first went down there, it was at the bottom of the boil. I think it might've been eating the flesh around the wound."



Their stunned silence was more than enough of a suggestion as to what they were thinking; I had thought those same things after all. Is that really what had transfigured this creature? If so, would it do that to other things that ate from it? What would it do to us if we indulged in such a bounty?



The croaking of a nearby bullfrog was the only thing that broke our contemplative silence. It had actually become so quiet that when the amphibian groaned out the repetitive cry, we all jumped. Then we laughed, a slow, nervous chuckle, minds not really present in the silly moment but laughing as if to meet some expectation. That short burst of noise slowly faded away until we were held aloft by the uncomfortable silence once again.



"We outta try it..." Our gazes were drawn to the man who was speaking. It was, predictably, Adam Parker. The thought had undoubtedly crossed all of our minds, but it was brushed away as nothing more than an intrusive curiosity - at least, until the Sheriff spoke it into existence.



"Are you fucking crazy?" Chris cut in, abruptly pausing their burgeoning thoughts.



"Look what it's done for us already! Every single one of us is better cause we swam in the lake!" Adam was quick to counter, passion alight in his voice.



"Do you honestly think that Alligator was better? It's a monster." I stepped into the circle of conversation, voice wavering slightly. I couldn't push the ideas out of my head. I couldn't help but wonder if we would also suffer some great exchange by consuming the dead flesh.



"This pool is unlike anything humanity has ever seen! It's something wholly unique to this town. Think about the gift that we have been given, don't you want to explore it fully?" The statement was directed towards me and me alone. Adam knew that I was their best chance of recovering the meat from the bottom of the pit. His eyes begged for me to understand where he was coming from, and deep down, some part of me did."This could be humanity's chance for evolution."



"I dunno if this is a good idea..." Chris, Jasmine, Hector, and Cindy all looked at me as I spoke, eyes pleading for me to decline the request.



"We didn't know if swimming in the water was going to be a good idea, either," Adam added to my hesitance. We hadn't exactly done that on purpose, but I knew that argument wouldn't have changed their minds.



"I need to think on it." I offered nothing more than that, turning on my heels to head back up the hill alone. They murmured behind me, both parties hopeful in one way or the other. I would be the deciding factor. Not only would my vote break the tie, but I was the only one with the equipment and skill to harvest.



Sleep did not come easily to me that evening; I thrashed and turned about in bed again and again, unable to quiet the turmoil in my head. The idea was dangerous and felt downright stupid, but at the same time, I couldn't help but imagine what evolution would look like for us. Would we grow extra eyes? Another set of limbs? Would the capacity of our lungs deepen, or would our muscle fibers become more dense? Would eating an aquatic creature grant us adaptations to have mastery over the water?



I am under the water.



It was sudden, but there was no expected shock from the frigid temperature. I floated, weightless, above the Ichor Pit, looking off into the forest of reeds on the other side. Somewhere high above, moonlight skewered the clouds and pierced into the water, scattering the dull translucent light.



***Share***



A thought crossed into my mind, less of a word and more of a feeling or an idea. The echo was carried by the silent scream of a voice that was as thick as the mud. I spun around, looking everywhere, behind and below.



***Burden***



A morose weight struck my chest like a harpoon, and I felt myself dragged a few feet deeper into the liquid. The very weight of that concept was having a tangible effect on me.



***Gift***



As if carried by a torrent of bubbles, I was lifted back up towards the surface of the water. It wasn't enough for me to breach the water and catch a breath, but I didn't need to.



***Join us***



My eyes pulled down to the sanctum of reeds once more, meeting the soft, glowing array of eyes. They were incapable of showing emotion, and yet I still felt the sullen loneliness behind them.



Then I woke up in my own bed with a coughing sputter, puking up a liter of blood red pond water. I knew my answer. For better or worse, the presence in my dream was enough to sway me.



It was still pitch dark as I arrived on the beach, wrongfully assuming that I would be alone. Bodies lay in shallow gulches, dug out like soft cots for living corpses. Adam lay in the one closest to the steps, eyes wide open and staring out over the water. Behind him, in a tight circle around a smoldering campfire, Mike, Dave, and Joy lay fast asleep.



I felt the presence of the watcher from before, now completely concealed in the inky blackness of early morning. This was different than that of the malligator in my dream. This presence felt cold and sharp, and it bristled as I joined the bodies on the beach.



"I was hoping you'd come back." I hadn't noticed that Sheriff Parker was awake until he spoke, which startled me and almost caused me to stumble into one of the bed pits.



"So was I." It was a raw admittance of my true feelings regarding the pit and its contents, something I hadn't even acknowledged myself. I descended the stairs into the water, wearing a wetsuit, oxygen tank, and a bag of tools. Adam stood and followed me into the water. I didn't say anything else to him.



This time, there was no fear as I slipped my flippers and mask on. My last two swims into this water had been marked by the fear of the unknown, but now I welcomed the cool embrace. I didn't hesitate, dipping below the surface and darting towards the lip of the boil and the spoils it held within. From the corner of my gaze, I spotted the yellow glow of the eye cluster behind the reeds. They didn't look lonely anymore. They were reassuring.



Reaching the deepest part of the springs, I found the wound in far worse shape than it had been previously. Hardly any strands of wilted flesh remained, and the bone plate had nearly been completely chewed away. Looking inside the new crevice, I could see pallid gray spongy material, held in place by a net of necrotized veins. The gator must have feasted upon the anomaly when I left, eating whatever its snout could reach.



Doubt clouded my judgment as I drew out my tools. This was my last opportunity to change my mind. What would I tell the others on the beach? What reason could I give for changing my mind again? More importantly, would I ever be able to forgive myself for not going through with it? I cut the few remaining strands of flesh with my knife and stuffed them into a clear zip-lock bag. Then I tried to reach the tissue inside the bony cavity, but it was far out of my grasp.



The hole looked big enough for me to squeeze through, if only I didn't have my tank of oxygen. The clasps fell away easily enough, leaving the half-empty aluminum tank floating lazily above me, connected only by the single hose. Hopefully, I could squeeze into the skull without losing hold of the respirator between my teeth.



It was easy enough to shimmy my legs into the space, but I felt fragments of bone begin to slice into me as I tried to force my waist through. Slowly, I twisted side to side, trying to break into the space below unharmed. Wrong way, I jerked too hard to the left when I needed to inch, causing a long, thin fragment of bone to puncture my suit and me. Try as I might, I couldn't help but yelp in pain as my blood joined the ichor chorus.



The aluminum tank began to drift away from me, hose dangling down in a final offer of salvation. It was an offer I couldn't take. With gritted teeth, I shoved my body downwards into the crevice, knowing I only had limited time to collect the meat.



Being within the skull was a surreal experience. It was large enough for me to comfortably float without touching the bloody cave. In some spaces where the malligator had feasted, I could see stained bone making up a confined cell all around me. Yet I didn't feel trapped; I felt at peace, as though I was being swaddled in a mother's embrace. I belonged here.



My knife flashed through the beacon of my light, cutting into the dull walls of the flesh cavern. I wasn't precise. I didn't have time. Even if I wanted to carefully carve out individual nodes of brain matter and preserve this paradise, I needed to be efficient. I stabbed and ripped and stuffed meat into plastic bags until my lungs began to scream, inflamed.



Pulling myself back through the jagged maw of bone was much easier than trying to get in. Already slashed and bloody, I clawed my way out, not caring about any new scratches I was receiving. The edges of my vision began to darken and blur as my lungs desperately begged for air. I clenched the bags of flesh in my teeth and kicked away from the hole, rushing towards the surface. Hand over hand, I dragged myself up the rocks in a desperate race against time, my vision darkening with every foot I climbed.



By the time I could see the surface of the water, my vision had narrowed to a mere pinprick of light. My arms and legs felt leaden, and suddenly I wasn't sure that I could make it the last few feet.



Finally, miraculously, I breached, narrowly avoiding a watery grave. I drew in a breath of cold, sweet morning air, vision slowly returning to me. The next time I went down, I would need a hammer or some other tool to widen the hole. I was astonished at my own audacity, already planning a return visit to the pit to collect more of the meat.



Adam stood as a silent sentinel in the shallow water, watching me drag my gear and my bounty to the shore. The sun had yet to rise, and no one else on the shore had stirred, leaving me, the Sheriff, and the feeling in the woods, alone.



"Should we cook it?" I asked, pushing forward the two bags of waterlogged flesh.



"He didn't." Adam nodded at the water before beginning to sift through the stringy flesh strands. After a long, awkward moment of silent anticipation, he spoke again, "Did you want first bite? It's only right I ask, you did the work of digging it up an all."



I shook my head violently. Sure, my stance on eating the putrid corpse had changed drastically, but that did not mean I wanted to be the guinea pig. "Do you want to wake the others?"



Sheriff shook his head before sticking his fingers into the bag of skin strips, withdrawing a short slice. It was hard to watch as he brought the slimy thing up towards his mouth, but I couldn't look away. There was a moment of pause where I thought he wasn't going to do it, then he popped the entire flap into his mouth with a soft squelch.



The man before me grinned at the taste, and the very forest around us seemed to scream in dismay.
