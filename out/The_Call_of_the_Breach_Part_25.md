[\[Part 26\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1i75ds3/the_call_of_the_breach_part_26/)

*I stood once again in the rain, surrounded by chanting voices, the smell of blood in my nose. I didn’t want to open my eyes, for I knew what waited for me, could almost feel the roots and vines twisting into the flesh of my friends, and hear their pained groans.*

*Wake up, wake up, come on it’s just a dream, wake up . . .*

*A hand slid into mine, not cold and clammy, but warm.*

*“You have to look closer.”*

*My eyes opened to see once again Vecitorak with the knife, and the burst chest of the Oak Walker. Yet beside me stood the stranger holding a large umbrella the same golden color as his chemical suit, as calm as a spring morning. This time it seemed Vecitorak didn’t see him, and no overwhelming blast of light interrupted the scene. Somehow the stranger remained immune to this place, unmoved by the eternal storm as though it were nothing more than a dark closet or a shadow under the bed. Even the vines of the eldritch ramp to the Oak Walker’s torn chest cavity refused to shift under his boots as they did under mine, as though they feared him, and I found that though both comforting, and unnerving.*

*I shuffled closer as he held out the umbrella so I could take shelter under it, and as soon as I stepped under the yellow canopy my clothes became dry, my skin warm, and the wind ceased its clawing at my face. “I don’t see anything.”*

*“Only because your fear is trying to stop you.” The man shook his head with the same warm smile a father might give his daughter when trying to teach her how to ride a bicycle. “Darkness cannot create true light, only mimic it. What glows here that shouldn’t?”*

*Daring to raise my eyes back to the gruesome scene, my gaze locked on to the book in Vecitorak’s hand, the runes on its pages glowing red coals in a sea of off-brown parchment.*

*“Okay.” My brow knit with concentration, and I gripped his hand like a child at the supermarket who is afraid of getting lost. “So . . . what does that mean?”*

*The stranger granted me a nod of approval and swept his free arm at the shadowy world. “What binds must also free. He is bound to this place as much as his victims are. If you sever the chains binding one, you sever them all.”*

*Curiosity overtook my discomfort, and I stared hard at the book, hoping to decipher more answers. “Why does it bind him?”*

*His silver irises met mine, and the stranger made a grim frown at the fetid journal. “Everything left here is meant to be a sacrifice, a toll, a price to allow the living to cross back into the reality they came from. In some instances, however, it can also be used to gain power from the void. Whatever is used as payment must be irreplaceable in significance, and the greater the sacrifice, the higher the power granted to the one who gives it. Many of the lost who found their way into this place over time simply wished to escape, and so their gifts were small. Vecitorak wanted vengeance, power, the strength to mend what he’d lost; and for that he gave the most valuable thing he had . . . his soul.”*

*It struck me why the pages were so stiff, the leather so discolored, the stitching on it so warped, the ink so rusty in its hue. It had smelled when I’d kept the book in my tent, and until now, I hadn’t been able to place what the musty stench could be.*

*“His skin.” I clapped my free hand to my mouth in a horrified whisper, and my own flesh wriggled in revulsion. “I-It’s his skin. He did that to himself?”*

*“In exchange for the ability to channel the void’s power, yes.” The stranger sighed in melancholy disappointment as he watched Vecitorak. “Now he seeks to live forever through the resurrection of his Master. He is as bound to that fate as you are.”*

*I blinked up at him, flustered. “Me? Why me? I never asked for anything like that.”*

*“Destiny does not come only to those who seek it.” Giving my hand a tender squeeze, the stranger lead me away, down the ramp, through the crowd of Puppet worshipers, and back toward the long gravel road. “Sometimes it is given to those who need it most. Tell me, Hannah, do you know what equilibrium means?”*

*Grateful for the warm cover of his umbrella, I trudged along beside the stranger as we made our way through the marshy clearing. “That’s like neutrality, I think.”*

*“It’s much more than that.” He looked up at the storm clouds with an expression that almost bordered on whimsy, as if the stranger knew this place like the back of his calloused hand. “It means balance in all things, equal pull between forces, the universe set right. This place has put great evil into motion that must end in one form or another. If your world is to survive, chaos must be met with order and be brought to heel.”*

*Recognizing the words from Professor Carheim’s study, I side-stepped down the grassy embankment beside the roadway and breathed a small sigh of relief when my feet hit the gravel. “So, what am I supposed to do?”*

*“You are different.” We stopped in the middle of the lonely rain-soaked road, and the stranger turned to me. “You were chosen to restore the balance disrupted by the void. The question is, are you willing to make the sacrifice needed to do that?”*

*In the silvery luminescence of his eyes, I felt I could see the depths of all the stars, an ocean of infinite light that spoke of something deeper and older than anything I had ever known. Part of me still had so many questions, but another part wanted nothing more than to cling to his hand, stay by his side, and let this ethereal man lead me into shining places beyond my understanding. I didn’t even know his name, the black-stenciled 036 on his chemical suit all I knew to mark him by, and yet this stranger felt as familiar to me as Chris or Jamie did. While I’d been exposed to the false light of the Echo Spiders before, and the infectious whispers of Vecitorak’s poison, the stranger’s aura didn’t hold any malice, deception, or predation. I felt safe with him, safe in a way I hadn’t even felt in Chris’s arms, or in my own father’s, as though the storm itself couldn’t touch me while he was near.*

*Tearing my gaze away, I glanced down at my own hands and wondered what it would be like to carve the flesh from them while still alive. “I . . . I don’t know. I don’t even know what that means. Help me see.”*

*With a patient chuckle, the stranger pulled me close, his embrace somehow warm despite the yellow rubber of his chemical suit, and it brought tears to my eyes for how much I didn’t want it to end. “You will, filia mea.”*

A hand gripped my shoulder, and my eyes flew open.

Soft covers were pulled up around me, the cool surface of my pillow under the right side of my face, the shirt and shorts I wore clinging to me with the static of winter’s dry air. Our room was still dark save for the glow of a single lamp on Chris’s side of the bed, and lying on the nearby nightstand, the hands of my wristwatch showed it to be 1:28 in the morning.

Frowning at a sudden blast of cold air to my back, I rolled over to discover the sheets parted there, my fiancé no longer beside me. “Chris?”

“Get up, we’ve gotta move.” Already half-dressed, he sat in a nearby chair to lace up his boots with hurried jerks to strings, and I caught an echo of gunfire in the distance outside our window.

*Oh no.*

Rubbing my bleary eyes, I kicked aside the white cotton sheets and tried to clear my head. “What’s going on?”

Chris faced me, and I caught the nervous tension in his jawline, the worried bags under his blue eyes that struck anxiety into my heart. “There’s some kind of riot spreading across the northern district. Been getting reports in the past five minutes of people in the streets, looting, setting fires, even sabotaging power lines. We’ve got civilians coming in with all kinds of wounds, and there’s rumors of multiple active shooters near the residential sector. We have to get it under control before they burn down half the city.”

Stunned, I leapt out of bed to grope for my clothes and peeked through the curtains over our window.

Like lasers form a sci-fi movie, red and green tracers skipped across the nearby rooftops a few blocks away, and the skyline glowed with the orange flicker of burning buildings. Faint screams reached my ears, the enhanced eardrums picking up the *pop-pop* of handguns, and the brutal *bam-bam-bam* of rifles as more gunfire was exchanged somewhere up north.

*It can’t be ELSAR, they’re out of town. Why would the people riot? There’s more aid available to them now than ever before.*

“Have you checked on the Colonel and his men?” With no time to worry about privacy, I stripped to my underwear and yanked on a pair of trousers, feet pounding on the hallway outside our door as more people ran to mobilize.

Chris pulled his green uniform jacket on over his undershirt and fumbled with the buckle on his war belt. “They’re not involved. Every one of them was still in their barracks when it all popped off, and Riken swears he has no idea what’s going on. Can’t get through to the other commanders, the comms are jammed with all kinds of panic from the street patrols. People are losing their minds out there.”

Lacing up my boots, I grabbed my Type 9 and raced out the door with him, down the winding corridors of the university.

People ran helter-skelter, coalition members from all factions trying to find their officers so as to receive orders. Many flocked to us when they spotted Chris and I, all with wild-eyed confusion as they swamped the air with their questions.

“There’s crowds of civilians trying to get into the university, but I don’t know who they are; should we seal the gates?”

“We need to get runners to the hospital, I have patients bleeding out downstairs.”

“Patrol Five said there’s rocket fire in the north, did ELSAR break the truce?”

“I want all fighters to their stations!” Chris bellowed and waved the Rangers to me. “Any riflemen not on perimeter duty, fall in on Captain Brun in the parking lot! The rest of you, send word to the faction leaders to lock down their sectors.”

Picking out the officers and NCOs among the gaggle of faces that turned my way, I directed them to the stairs, still at a jog as we surged through the corridor. “Get everyone you can spare at the trucks! If you can’t find your unit, hop in with someone else. I want a headcount and equipment check asap!”

The university parking lot was a mess of trucks, both coalition-made and ELSAR captures, crews sprinting back and forth as they raced to get weapons mounted, ammunition loaded, and fuel squared away. At the gates, dozens of screaming civilians pounded on the fence that the Organs had erected to turn the college into a fortress, demanding our panicked entrance guards let them in. Some were bleeding, many held various kinds of improvised weaponry, and one woman attempted to pass her baby through the gate to one of our soldiers in a desperate attempt to get it to safety.

“This is madness.” I breathed, Chris by my side, the two of us frozen in sheer awe of the chaos around us.

“Where do you need us?” From the tangle of figures, Colonel Riken and eight of his aides strode forward, armed with gleaming M4’s and clad in the battle armor of their ELSAR brethren.

Chris let out a frustrated sigh and held up a hand to stop them. “No. No way. We’ve got enough confusion going on without ELSAR troops running around in the streets.”

Colonel Riken’s face darkened, and he folded his gloved hands over the buttstock of his carbine to take in the sight of our disorganized platoons. “My men are geared up and ready to go at their barracks. We have more training and experience with civil unrest than you do, and we have heavy armor. Turn us loose, Commander. Lives are at stake.”

*How can we be sure you won’t turn on us in the crossfire?*

I glanced at Chris, and he swept the chaotic parking lot with displeased eyes, no doubt unhappy at how few of the other platoons were ready. We hadn’t anticipated this, had never trained for such a scenario, as we hadn’t really expected to win Black Oak. Our efforts had been mostly focused on combat, not riot control, and any captured police equipment from the Organs was stilled locked in their arms room in the college. It would take far too long to issue it, and it was pointless to do so if we had little clue how to use the tools effectively. If we went into this riot now, the only thing we could do was shoot . . . and if Riken’s men got in the mix, it wouldn’t take much for someone to make a mistake and start the war all over again.

“You’ll go to your men and have them stand by.” Chris held the Colonel’s gaze, and his voice strained with barely concealed suspicion. “You *do not* engage without my authorization. If we need you, we’ll call you.”

At that Colonel Riken shook his head in frustration but walked toward their few trucks anyway. “Assumption gets people killed, Dekker.”

Chris bristled at the Colonel’s rebellious departure, but shrugged it off all the same, and turned back to me. “I’ll grab who I can and get a few ASV’s going. We’ll move together, that way we have strength in numbers. If we can break up the worst of the rioters, our street patrols can tame the rest.”

A line of armored pickup trucks rolled down the center of the parking lot to stop next to where we stood, and Sergeant McPhearson hopped out of the first truck’s driver-side door to salute. “We’re all up, Commander. Heard the shots and figured it was only a matter of time before we got called out. What are your orders?”

Chris returned his salute and flicked his blue eyes to me. “Guess that settles it. Your boys are going to be the tip of the spear. I know there aren’t a lot of you, but do you think they can handle it?”

*With men like mine, how can I lose?*

An odd combination of dread and excitement rippled through me at that, and I threw Charlie a slight nod of pride. “Of course, Commander. Fourth Platoon can handle anything. Just give the order.”

More of the vehicles began to line up, the officers doing their jobs as the soldiers flocked to the convoy, and Chris pulled on his steel helmet to head for the nearest ASV. “Alright then, mount up and wait for my signal.”

We clambered into the trucks, the gunners racking their mounted weapons to sure they’d loaded them correctly, and I clicked my radio mic. “All Sparrow One units, this is Sparrow One Actual. Our mission is to protect civilians within the northern district and suppress all forms of civil unrest. Be advised, Rhino One Actual is rolling with us, so let’s get this done right.”

Chris’s column of ASV’s rumbled past us, the guards at the gate shooed the townsfolk back at gunpoint, and we drove out into the fiery embers of the night.

As soon as we were clear of the civilians, Chris pushed his ASV’s to their limit, taking turns so sharp that I feared he would flip the heavy armored cars over. Desperate to keep up, our tires squealed on the uneven pavement, Charlie swerving to miss craters left by rockets, bombs, and artillery shells. The streets of Black Oak were mostly in ruins, and even though the civilian population worked hand-in-hand with our forces to clear the rubble, repaving everything would be a months-long task. Most streetlights were damaged or destroyed, the power grid spotty in large portions of the city, and it left everything coated in deep shadows. It felt like the beginning of some grotesque horror movie that Carla had always been fond of, where some disgusting chainsaw-wielding villain tortures his victims one by one until the main character is left all alone.

Closer to the northern district boundary, I spotted more people fleeing on foot down the roadway, frightened clusters of refugees with wide eyes, their clothing stained red from wounds they’d sustained. From the amount, I figured the housefires were getting worse, forcing people out of their homes in the middle of the night, and into the teeth of the riot itself. That could only mean more homeless we would have to find shelter for, more destitute mouths to feed, more sick and injured to fill our already overcrowded hospital. If the peace deal had given us a reprieve, this was a punch to the gut.

*Something’s not right. They’re coming from the collaborator district. Why would they rise up, only to gun down their own people?*

“We need to hurry.” I glanced at Charlie, who’s mouth was pursed in a confused frown, same as mine.

At last, we rounded a bend in the street, and our world lit up by with bright orange glow.

The northern district had been the home of those who helped ELSAR forces throughout its occupation of Barron County, and as such, it was the best maintained, the best policed, the best supplied, and had the nicest houses of the town. Our offensive to destroy the Organs had damaged some of it, but there were still places that had been relatively intact compared to the other neighborhoods that lay in total ruin. After our defeat of Crow’s troops, the northern section had complied with all our demands and hadn’t caused much in the way of trouble. In fact, they’d been relieved when the fighting stopped, and a few of the families even donated extra supplies they’d hoarded to help the poor from other districts, but the sight that greeted my eyes now cut me to the very soul.

Dozens of houses had been torched, their doors and windows roiling with greedy yellow flames, and pillars of oily black smoke belched into the sky. Multiple cars were on fire or turned over, their flames even hotter as the fuel caught, the air tinged with the thick stink of burning rubber from their melted tires. Smoldering cordons of garbage crisscrossed the roadways like flaming barricades, and various items were strewn across the green lawns from where they’d been dropped or thrown by looters. Windows had been smashed, gates trampled down, and several power line poles lay on the ground, sawed off at the stump. Worst yet, however was the stillness; and it didn’t take much looking to understand why.

They lay everywhere, bunched up in heaps, sprawled out on the road and sidewalks, curled up on the lawns, all motionless in the flickering light of the fires. Young and old, men and women, children and infants, they carpeted the shattered neighborhood in a silent mass of death, puddles of crimson blood surrounding the ones who died on pavement instead of the soft Appalachian bluegrass. Hundreds if not thousands of shiny little brass casings littered the streets, bullet holes in everything, as though the attackers hadn’t spared a single round in their rampage. Many of the bodies bore slashes, gouges, and stab wounds, indicating the attackers had used blades as well as guns, and a broken garden machete near one corpse proved that point. Some had been shot in the back while they ran, their blood sprayed across the concrete, while others had died on their knees alongside their family members. Husbands slumped over their wives and children, the piles of them machine-gunned where they sat, and still more had their heads caved in from the cruel blows of a sledgehammer. Close to a dozen bodies hung from one tree we drove past, stripped naked and mutilated, the majority of them young women. One picket fence bore a line of severed heads rammed into the top of its gate, and a woman’s body had been tossed over a park bench like a rag doll, while a little bundle wrapped in cloth sat discarded nearby, equally motionless.

My stomach churned, I fought to breathe and choked on my own horrified gasps.

*This isn’t real. It can’t be. How could anyone do this?*

“Captain . . .” Charlie muttered, his face drained of all color, and from how the rest of the convoy slowed, I figured the other crews were undergoing the same shock.

“Don’t.” I swallowed hard to keep from puking and shut my eyes.

His breathing sounded shuddery from where Charlie sat. “Captain, we have to stop, there might be some left alive . . .”

“Shut up.” I hissed between clenched teeth, and cringed at feeling the trucks slowly trundle over things in our path, soft bumps in the road that weren’t aberrations of the tar.

“Brun, for God’s sake there are women and children out there, we can’t just—”

“Drive on, sergeant!” My cool burst like a grenade, and I snapped at him, my body trembling with the urge to be sick. “Your orders are to stick with the Commander. There’s nothing we can do here.”

At those last words, my voice cracked with a half sob, and it took everything in my power to prevent myself from breaking down. Charlie didn’t retaliate, simply gripped his steering wheel until his knuckles turned white, and our convoy went on. In the armored compartment behind us, I caught the gagging sounds of crewmembers retching into empty green ammunition cans, muted curses rising as our vehicles ground bones and flesh under their knobbed tread.

More gunfire rattled somewhere up the street, and we picked up speed once we cleared the worst of the dead to turn onto a main thoroughfare.

My heart sank, and Charlie swore.

They moved like packs of coyotes from house to house, groups of five to seven men each, carrying guns, axes, shovels, crowbars, hammers, and torches. None wore a uniform, but they all had black armbands or sashes, and had their faces covered with masks, scarves, or bandanas. The attackers chased down fleeing civilians with ruthless savagery, beat them, shot them, or hacked at them with whatever crude weapons they had. No one was spared, and every blow was rendered with a visceral hate that had no equal. An old man was pushed to the ground, his head stomped to pieces by the heavy boots of the gunmen even while he begged for mercy. A young girl was torn from the arms of her parents and dragged off to a shadowy alleyway, tears streaming down her face as she kicked and screamed. Men were shot in front of their wives, women clubbed to death in front of their children, and I saw an infant thrown back and forth between a group of laughing men like a football.

In all my travels thus far, I had never seen such violence, and a boiling rage foamed within me, a blind anger that felt volcanic in its intensity.

*These scumbags better start running.*

*“All units on me!”* Chris’s barked orders came through the speakers with hate, and I saw his column of ASV’s charge into the morass, soldiers dismounting to charge forward with rifles blazing. *“Shoot anyone with a weapon. Kill them all.”*

Pulse pounding in my neck, I threw myself out of the confines of my truck cab and the other spare riflemen in my platoon followed suit. With the vehicles rolling forward to provide us with cover, their belt-fed weapons unleashing torrents of lead at the enemy, we advanced down the blood-soaked street. Even during the minor scuffles in Ark River over Jamie’s trial, things had never gotten this bad, and the wide-eyed terror of my platoon spoke volumes. However, it seemed everyone had arrived at the same conclusion as Chris had; this was no riot, it was a massacre. We weren’t here as police, we were here as soldiers, and if the psychopaths who had done this wanted violence, we would repay them in kind.

“Stay together.” I shouted to them from the front of our platoon, the Type 9 heavy in my hands. “Watch out for snipers. Do not stop for anyone; we can’t render aid until the streets are clear.”

One of the killers looked up to see us coming and raised his rifle.

*Bang, bang, bang.*

A barrage of gunfire cut him down, and more black-sashed figures were shot whether they held a weapon or not. Anyone who we could see participating in the violence was gunned down, and the masked men scattered, clearly not expecting to face significant resistance this soon. However, this only served to infuriate me even more, as I knew they were just going to run off to continue their carnage somewhere else. We had to stop them, had to hunt every single one of these terrorists down so they couldn’t hurt more people, but it seemed like they melted into the shadows as fast as we could advance.

As soon as the attackers withdrew, civilians poured out of the houses, even the burning ones, and ran toward our troops with frantic sobs of panic.

“Please, my son, they took my son.”

“They’re going to kill us!”

“My dad needs help, please, he’s bleeding real bad.”

“Have you seen my sister? She’s a little shorter than me, brown hair, and she had a blue shirt on. Her name is Lena.”

I did my best to scan for weapons as fast as possible, and we parted ranks to shove the frightened people through one by one as they were frisked. With our portion of the violence paused for this brief moment, the horrendous nature of the night came back with full force as I was brought face-to-face with the victims. In movies or video games, the villains had always been cut-and-dried, all the henchmen behind them irredeemably evil, and when they got their due, I had always cheered. After all, who mourned for someone who would support the bad guys? Yet, standing here now, I felt nothing but pain and sadness for the broken, wounded, terrified collaborators as they passed by me. They were weeping, bloody, their eyes glazed with shock. More than one family was incomplete, some could barely walk, and the smallest children tried to cling to our legs in desperate fear of the unknown. True, they had once been our enemies, but this . . . this couldn’t be celebrated.

*That could have been me, if the tables were turned. What if ELSAR had taken me in instead of New Wilderness? What if this happened in Louisville, and my dad or mom sided with them to keep me safe? Would I want someone to hurt them just because we picked the wrong side?*

“Head for the college.” I told a pale-faced woman who supported a man with a bleeding leg. “There’s more of us there, they can help you. Go to the university, it’s safe there.”

The word spread like wildfire amongst the refugees, and they hobbled off into the dark to try and find a way to our headquarters. I had no idea if they would make it or not, but I couldn’t stop to do more. My job was the same as Chris’s; put an end to the carnage and stop those responsible.

Dragging in a ragged breath that tasted of burned gunpowder and soot, I caught Chris’s eye across the several yards separating our platoons. His face bore the same anguish as mine, the same fury, the same disgust and heartbreak. We’d both hoped for so much more, dreamed about building a better place for everyone, a fresh start, a second chance. This was the thanks we got? After everything we’d done, all we had sacrificed, *this* was how our efforts were to be repaid?

*How on earth are we supposed to have elections if this keeps happening?*

“Keep moving.” Resolute despite it all, Chris waved the convoy onward our various squads huddled behind the armored vehicles as we slowly resumed our march down the street. “We clear this block-by-block. Someone get on the radio to let our rear units know they’ve got more people coming.”

With that, we grimly continued on into the smoke-filled abyss of Black Oak’s streets, the air filled with more gunfire, sirens in the distance, and the screams of those we had promised to protect.
