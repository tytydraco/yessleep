My name is Thomas, and I’ve been a long-time lurker on Reddit. After my first night as a security guard at the abandoned St. Mary’s Hospital, I feel compelled to share my story. I thought it would be an easy job: walking rounds, checking doors, earning easy money without a boss constantly breathing down my neck. But I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

After months of temporary jobs and mounting debt, I had no choice. St. Mary’s offered stability, but what I didn’t know was that this hospital had its own set of rules. Rules that had to be followed. Or else you’d disappear.

My first shift began with a meeting with Marco, the senior guard. A broad-shouldered man with a grim face, hardened by years of working in this place. He barely looked up from his coffee when he greeted me.

‘You’re the new guy?’ he asked without lifting his gaze from the table.

‘Yeah, Thomas,’ I replied, extending my hand. He ignored it and instead pointed to the chair across from him.

‘Listen up, kid,’ he started, his tone serious. ‘This isn’t a normal job. There are rules. You follow them, or you’re gone. Simple.’

I frowned. ‘What do you mean?’

*‘Rule one: If you hear footsteps behind you when you’re alone, don’t stop. Don’t look back. Just keep walking.’*

My heart skipped a beat.

‘Rule two: The third floor. You only go up there if you have no other choice. The stairwell is a trap. People who go up don’t always come back.’

‘Why not?’

Marco stared at me. ‘Don’t ask too many questions.’

*‘Rules three and four: If you see something that shouldn’t be there like a door opening on its own or a light turning on ignore it. And if you see people where they shouldn’t be, stay away. They want you to come to them.’*

A chill ran down my spine.

‘And the last rule?’ I asked softly.

*‘If a room suddenly feels much colder than normal, don’t go inside. And if you see something move that you can’t explain, turn around and walk away. This building responds to your presence.’*

An uneasy silence followed. I wanted to laugh, to call his bluff, but Marco’s stare was unwavering.

We started our rounds through the hospital. The hallways were empty, the walls yellowed with age. The air was cold, as if the building itself was hiding something.

As we walked, I heard a faint beeping in the distance. A door? The sound seemed to come from a corridor we had just passed.

‘You’ll hear noises like that often,’ Marco muttered without turning around. ‘Ignore them.’

The silence grew heavier. Suddenly, I heard something else: a soft whisper, like voices just beyond my hearing. It sounded as if they were floating through the halls. When I stopped to listen, the sound vanished instantly.

‘This hospital is alive,’ Marco said. ‘In its own way.’

I shivered.

As we continued walking, Marco told me about St. Mary’s history. In the 1950s, the hospital was known for its experimental medicine.

‘Electroshock therapy, medically induced comas, unethical brain surgeries,’ he listed. ‘They pushed the limits of science. And sometimes they went too far. Patients disappeared. Families received letters saying their loved ones had been transferred, but no one ever heard from them again.’

‘What happened to them?’ I asked nervously.

‘No one knows for sure,’ Marco answered. ‘But some experiments never stopped.’

His words lingered as we walked on. The hallways seemed longer, darker. And then it happened.

The temperature dropped suddenly. An icy chill wrapped around us, as if we were not alone.

‘Marco, do you feel that?’ I asked, my voice shaking.

He stopped and gave me a firm look. ‘Keep walking. Don’t stop.’

Ahead of us stood the stairwell door. It was open. I remembered Marco’s warning: the third floor is a trap.

From the darkness came a soft, scraping sound. Like something dragging against the wall.

‘This isn’t good,’ Marco whispered. ‘We need to leave.’

My breath hitched. ‘What’s up there?’

Marco was silent for a moment. Then, almost inaudibly, he said, ‘Something that was never meant to remain.’

We turned around and walked back. But then around the corner. In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed. It was brand new, pristine white. And beneath the sheet lay a body.

My blood ran cold.

When we looked away for just a second and then back, the bed was gone. The hallway was empty. The tension in the air slowly faded, as if something had decided to let us go.

Back in the security office, I felt relieved. The rest of the night passed without incident. But as I walked outside, I heard it again. The scraping. The breathing. The footsteps just beyond my hearing. But following my every step.

When I reached the elevator and pressed the button, I clearly heard someone breathing behind me.

Outside, I took a deep breath. But one question lingered in my mind.

Should I come back tomorrow?
