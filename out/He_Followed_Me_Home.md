I’ve been working at the same grocery store for a couple of years now. It’s a decent gig—decent pay, regular hours, nothing too exciting. Most of the time, it’s just the usual crowd: busy moms, bored teenagers, the occasional older man buying a single can of soup. But a few weeks ago, something happened that still makes my skin crawl.

It started with a man.

I first noticed him when I was working the evening shift. He was standing outside, near the edge of the parking lot, not doing anything in particular. Just standing there. He wasn’t near a car, and he wasn’t coming into the store. Just… watching. He was tall, a little scruffy, with a ratty baseball cap pulled low over his face. I didn’t think much of it—maybe he was waiting for someone. That happens all the time.

But over the next few days, he was there every night.

Same spot. Same clothes. Same blank expression.

It was weird, but I figured maybe he was just homeless, or maybe he lived nearby. He didn’t seem to be causing any trouble, so I didn’t pay much attention. I’d see him when I got off my shift around 9 PM, still standing there, still watching the parking lot.

Then, last Tuesday, things got a little stranger.

I was closing up for the night with my coworker, Julie. We were the last ones in the store, doing the final rounds, making sure everything was stocked and cleaned. The man was there again, at the far end of the parking lot, barely visible under the flickering streetlights.

As we were locking the doors, I mentioned him to Julie.

“Have you seen that guy? He’s been hanging around here every night for the past week.”

Julie squinted through the glass doors and nodded. “Yeah, I’ve noticed him too. Kinda creepy, isn’t it?”

“Do you think we should call someone? It’s just weird that he’s always there.”

Julie shrugged. “He’s probably harmless. Let’s just walk to our cars together. Safety in numbers, right?”

I agreed, but the weird feeling in my stomach wouldn’t go away.

That night, as we were walking to our cars, I kept glancing over at him. He hadn’t moved. Just standing there, barely illuminated by the lights. I could feel his eyes on us, even though I couldn’t see his face clearly. Julie waved it off, laughing nervously as we unlocked our cars.

“You’re being paranoid,” she said. “He’s just some guy. If he was going to do something, he would have by now.”

I nodded, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I got into my car and locked the doors, watching him in my rearview mirror as I drove away. He didn’t move.

The next night, I worked late again, but this time I was alone. Julie had the night off, and I was closing the store by myself. I kept thinking about the man, wondering if he would be there again. When I finally turned off the lights and locked the doors, I stepped outside and scanned the parking lot.

He wasn’t there.

For a second, I felt relieved. Maybe he had finally left.

But when I got to my car, that relief turned to cold, hard fear.

He was there—standing right behind my car.

My heart pounded in my chest as I fumbled for my keys, trying to unlock the door as fast as I could. He didn’t move, didn’t say anything, just stood there, staring at me. His face was still hidden under that dirty baseball cap, but I could feel his eyes on me.

I got in the car and locked the doors, my hands shaking. I kept my eyes on him as I started the engine, praying he wouldn’t come any closer. He didn’t. He just stood there, watching me, not even flinching as I backed out of the parking spot.

I drove home that night with my heart in my throat, constantly checking the mirrors, half-expecting him to follow me. But when I got home, there was no sign of him. I figured maybe it was over. Maybe he was just some weirdo who liked hanging out in parking lots.

But it wasn’t over.

The next night, I didn’t see him outside the store. He wasn’t standing in his usual spot, and for a moment, I thought maybe he had finally disappeared for good.

Then I got home.

As I pulled into my driveway, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

There, parked at the end of my street, was a car. The same car I’d seen parked near the store a few times. And standing next to it, in the shadows, was the man.

I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to go inside and let him know where I lived, but I also didn’t want to stay in my car, alone in the dark, with him watching me. My hands shook as I called the police.

When they arrived, the car was still there, but the man was gone. The officers looked around, but they didn’t find anyone. They told me to be careful, to make sure my doors were locked, but that there wasn’t much else they could do. They promised to have a patrol car swing by my neighborhood for the next few nights, but I could tell they didn’t think it was a big deal.

That night, I barely slept. Every noise, every shadow outside my window made me jump.

The next evening, I was off work, but I couldn’t relax. I kept thinking about the man, wondering if he was still out there, still watching. I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I decided to go for a drive, just to clear my head.

As I drove through the quiet streets, I felt a strange sense of dread building in my chest. I couldn’t explain it, but something felt wrong.

I circled back toward my house, and as I turned onto my street, I saw it again.

The man. Standing in my driveway.

I slammed on the brakes, heart racing, as I watched him walk toward my front door. He wasn’t rushing, just moving calmly, like he belonged there. I couldn’t breathe. My hands gripped the steering wheel so tight my knuckles turned white.

Then, without thinking, I hit the gas and sped straight toward him. I don’t know what came over me—panic, fear, anger—but I wasn’t going to let him get any closer to my home.

He barely moved out of the way in time. I swerved, tires screeching, and sped down the street.

I didn’t stop until I was halfway across town, parked in front of a police station.

That was the last time I saw him.

The police never caught him, and I never found out who he was or what he wanted. I moved out of that house a week later. I don’t work at the grocery store anymore. I couldn’t handle the idea of seeing him again.

But even now, in my new place, miles away, I still can’t shake the feeling that he’s watching.
