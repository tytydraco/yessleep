My name is Andrew Winfred and if you are reading this, that means that im dead. Before my death i wish to finally share to the world my story, or better yet, a story of a woman called Alex Crowley, How i got to meet her, and how we both lead to each others demise. The experiences i had whilst in her presence were of the most exquisite agony and the most unique pleasure i ever had. And i feel that before i leave this world forever i should share all the uncommon circumstances that brought us both together.

It all started 6 months ago, i was 19 entering college. I am from a relatively wealthy family and both of my parents were able to afford my degree on psychology. They always loved me and respected me in a way that i never really grew to really appreciate until very recently. Only recently i realized the indeed the undying care and love from my parents shaped me into who i am today. And while i merely accepted that as my reality i never realized how different things could have turned out

I always been very catholic, just as my family was. And i was planing to bringing those beliefs in my day to day life, my plan was to work on the suicide hotline after i got my degree. Doing gods work helping people all over the country cherishing their lifes and helping everyone i can to life as fully and as well accomplished as they can, but things started getting complicated when alex entered my life.

Everyone on that college knew the girl who would sneak in the campus pretending to be a student, stealing food and stealing things from the students. we never managed to find who her parents were but after being caught too many times, she simply vanished, never showed up again.

This until while i was walking down the street back to my apartment i saw her. Right in my neighborhood there she was, dressed in revealing clothing, in a terrible make up, smoking a cigarette. Ive seen women like this before, this is where many prostitutes would station themselves in search of customers. Whatever financial situation she was, it has led her to this, a truly sad sight to behold, i remember when i first got to have a good look at her, i found her beautifull.

So young, so delicate, about to be used up and discarded like an animal, such a body about to be trespassed by some man older than her for nothing than a cheap buck. In my heart i knew i had to do something, i approached her and acted like i was a customer i told her i had the money and i led her to my apartment, i was really nervous but i knew if i could maybe show her jesus christ, or anything else she could have to replace this need she has in her life. 

My first assumption was that she was nothing but another young girl that lost her way in a world of drugs and alcoholism and maybe someone like that just needed someone who would really care for her and show her a way to a better, more fulfilling life. Plus, like i said, i had money to spare. At least i had enough to hold her atention for a few hours 

As i got her in my apartment i noticed a few bruise marks and scars in her arm, in her legs, and some in her face. All of them she tried (and failed) to hide with make up, specially in her face, the make up in her face was dark and strong, like her eyes were floating inside two voids of pitch darkness

Her hair was black (obviously dyed) the ink was so strong it felt like her messy hair could stand on their on. And of course, the foul stench of cigarettes emanating from her was almost unbearable for a guy like me, who barely even saw a cigarette in my life, specially when she opened her mouth.

As she entered the first thing she went to do was going to the bathroom make herself pretty for what she thought would be a night of intercourse. I stopped her right away, i asked her to sit on the couch while i made some tea and a sandwich, the poor thing looked so thin that a mere breeze of wind could knock her down. Still she sat down gracefully on the couch like a lady from the victorian era, keeping eye contact with me at all times, her eyes penetraded me with those big eyelashes and a light pouting on the lips, big crimson lips that cried for atention.

I felt incredibly uncomfortable (and she definitely noticed that) so while i was brewing the tea i decided to break the ice and ask her where is she from. She answered something im sure is a lie she says to every client who asks that, she said she was born and raised in that same town, wich felt like something she just says to avoid talking about herself too much.

I decided to right away tell her i had no intention of having sex with her. She looked slightly puzzled and irritated, for a second breaking that sexy character she maintained during our interaction. Then i assured her i was still willing to pay for her time. After that she asked me what the hell did i wanned with her, i was really sure how to answer that honestly so i just offered her the tea and the pbj i made.

She hesitated for a second but she quickly got comfortable accepting what offered her and lost that graceful pose in wich she was sitting to a more comfortable and relaxed pose. She took of her leather jacket revealing a black tank top with an image of baphommet underneath, and thats when i saw the true extension of her wounds, scar and bruises all over her body. 

No doubt many of those wounds were inflicted with a knife. Who was hurting this pretty thing? How did a soul from god reached a state of such state of desecration? I was in a visible state of shock looking at her body when she noticed it, she looked at me in a smile, dead in the eyes she gazed and said: "like what you see?" My gaze turned back to hers, for a few seconds i couldn't say a word until i slightly more than muttered the words "who..... who done this to you?"

Her smile widened as she told me about a client of hers, Anthon Lavey, a man who got a kick out of hurting and cutting little things like her. A cruel and sadistic man who happened to be her best and most loyal client, although this explanation still baffled me very much. I asked her why, why she subjugated herself to such thing, why did she allowed her body to be used and desecrated by evil people like this mr Lavey

She told me i would never understand as long as i live. Back then i didn't understood what she meant, but now i know. She looked into my eyes, my atitude, she figured me out in an instant, I'm a man who got everything i wanted in life, a loving family, money and a future, she just got me so quickly, its just sad how long it took for me to get her.

I asked her to please explain. I told her i only bought her for the night so she could have someone to talk, someone to share her problems, someone who would sympathize and help her with whatever she is going through. She didn't looked very impressed by my response but she didn't say anything, i held her hand and asked again almost imploring to her, please, please tell me what you are going through, i want to help, let me help. And to this day i don't know if she really got moved by my words or if she just didn't had anything better to do at the moment.

She pulled her hand out of mine almost like she was disgusted by it. She again looked at me dead in the eyes, those pretty black eyes piercing mine like a dagger as she told me: "you have a good life here, a nice apartment, money to live comfortably, what i assume is a nice family, a future, so trust me, you don't wanna go deeper in a world you can't get out of. If you want my body, you can have it, it is yours, you paid for it, but i will not accept some stupid therapy section with an 19 year old boy who never experienced what life really has to offer yet"

After that she got up, picked up her jacket and headed to the front door. I stopped her on the way there, i told her that i would never forgive myself to just leave a child of god like her in the hands of such cruel world without knowing if she would be allright first, so i said that i payed for our time, wich meant that she was obligated to satisfy whatever i asked of her, like she said that night she belonged to me.

With that money i would buy myself, not her body, but me, i would buy rent for me into her life, into her head. I would buy myself as part of her life. She realized there was no talking me out of that, she let out a sad sigh and she sat down back at the couch. I realized she finished her sandwich and i said i would make more, if she told me why she let that man hurt her, it was clear what i wanted out of that conversation so she finally started explaining her situation

Anthon Lavey is a charming and very rich man who bought her almost every night, and almost every night he would drug her and she would wake up full of wounds. But she said that despite all the pain that man caused her, he has a way of getting into her head, he has a way of making her come back for more thinking this time, this time it will be different.

Its a cursed comfort zone, comfortable allowing other people to use you, too scared to do anything about it, thinking deep inside, deep inside, you deserve it. She explained to me very clearly although at the time, despite my best efforts i still couldn't understand why she keep letting this happened

She seen that she was right and i couldnt just understand right away, so she paused for a second, this time she looked conflicted, she was thinking of what to say next to help me understand. Thats when she got up, leaned against the window, looking at the city below it. She was already stunningly beautiful but, looking at her spotlighted by the pale moonlight, reflecting that blackness of her hair and make up, with that beautiful view of the city at night underneath the stars.

Its like I've seen an angel, and angel with bruises and black wings. Thats when she lit up a cigarette and said whilst still looking at the view below: "let me tell you a story" i was still sitting at the couch when she said that, i didn't knew if i should stand up and join her at the window or something, after all she wasn't even looking at me anymore, she stared at the sky thoughtful, like she was reccolecting something

So i was still sitting at the couch when she began the story: when she was 12 she was a member of the girl scouts club, she didn't had many friends so she asked her to join so she could attempt to socialize with the other girls that she looked up to and admire. Yet, she never got much attention, they never even realized she was there. But so it happens that every week the girl scouts have a meeting at the house of one of the members and one day, the meeting happened at her house. Unfortunately that day she wasn't feeling very well, she had a tummy ache and her mom got a device they had for when she felt a tummy ache, an electric vibrating matt that they put on the couch. Every time she got a tummy ache she used to lay down on her belly in that device to help diminish the pain until it goes away. And she was laying there when the girl scouts came in she was already feeling better so she took the matt and put it on the side of the couch. She tried her best to speak to them but she kept being interrupted and ignored. disappointed she returned to the living room, she sat at the side of the couch where the vibrating matt was when suddenly she felt something. A great tingly feeling down there she never experienced before, she immediately returned to the other girl scouts and told all of them that they had to try out this matt.

One by one they took turns sitting on it, they felt great and they all adored her for making that discovery. For a second there, she was finally having a taste of what is like to be the popular one, for a second they started to like her, for a second she got the acceptance and attention she so much craved. But that second didn't last long, her mom returned with cookies she was baking and saw her sitting on the matt by the side of the couch.

Infuriated she kicked out all of the girl scouts out of her home and when she was alone with her, she confronted the girl. She screamed "i can't belie i am raising a little whore!" When she ripped out the plug of the matt from the socket, and she was very specific saying she literally ripped it out from that cable. And started beating her with it, there isn't much a terror quite like the one of a child being disciplined by a father, back when you are small, delicate, being hurt by someone twice your size, someone who you trust and you believe that loves you

When she finished that story i wasn't quite sure what it meant, what was she trying to say? The story ended right about the same as her cigarette and after she was done, she just headed to door about to leave again. I stopped her once again i still didn't understand what did her story had to do with Anthon Lavey and her wounds, but she was visibly quite tired and she simply said that if i wanted to know more, i know where to find her, and with that she left, no more words where spoken and the only remnants of her presence there, was the smell of her cigarette, something i can still smell to this day

The next night there she was, same alley, slightly different outfit. Like the night before i invited her in and this time i made her a decent meal, i prepared the dinning room for both of us and she sat down and ate in a very polite manner, sometimes i wonder if she forgets I'm not like her other clients, and she don't need to keep this act graceful act with me, and she can be her normal self around me. Her truth, her real beauty, all disguised behind a mask of make up and several wounds all over her body

This time i noticed new ones, mr lavey been busy but i didn't wanted to touch that subject just yet. During our meal i simply asked her how was her day, after that her hands stopped, for a brief second, like she was trying desperately to find a way to change the subject. The wounds in her arm so fresh, there was still some blood dripping out of it, not that she would notice it or think of it anything out of the ordinary

"What do you want with me?" She asked in an annoyed tone. To that i just said that if she is in this thing with Anthon Lavey for the money, she can just say to me how much he pays her, i would pay her even more to not go to his place, to never see him again and finally let those wounds heal.

I could see that during our second meeting she was lowering her defenses a little bit, just a little bit. Noticing that i just said that she is safe with me, nothing needs to hurt her anymore, i care about her well being, and it hurts me seeing her go through this. Its funny, my first assumption when i met her was that she was a drug addict but at this point after meeting her the ideia of drugs having anything to do with it has vacated my mind completely.

She reacted with a very sad look on her face, like there something in her mind that was in conflict with itself. Noticing that i simply got off my chair and walked to her side of the table, i raised her head a little bit putting my hand on her chin so she was looking at my eyes, then i said: "please, i don't want you to get hurt anymore, i will pay anything you ask, i promise that man will never hurt you again as long as i am here"

After that i embraced her and her eyes were in the point of crying, but without shedding a single tear, she returned to embrace holding tightly and then she said in my ear just above a whimper: "i got nowhere else to go, nobody else to count on"

I immediately say in a affirming tone that she could stay with me, ill let her have my bed while i sleep on the couch, ill feed her and help her get through this. That did it for her, she seemed genuinely grateful for my help and that night, i slept on the couch

The next morning she was gone but i could always manage to find her in that same alley, same time, slightly different clothing. And keeping to my promise, she was always welcomed  at my house, every night i would invite her in and feed her and i would always sleep on the couch and the next morning, she was always gone.

But there was a price for staying with me, she had to tell me more about her, i needed to know what was she thinking, what did she did during the day, and most importantly, what could i do to help that poor girl. Ask and you shall receive, every night she would light up a cigarette and tell me a new story

She told me to leave it be, to let i while i still could, oh i wish i did, but by the intervention of some god or devil, fate had simply decided that i needed to have her in my life, i just needed to know how deep this rabbit hole goes, and our alice here, finally told me everything i needed to know, starting with her name, you are and always wil be the cross i carry with me, my crown of thorns, the spear at my ribs, the whip at my back and the vinegar at my tongue. You, and only you, Alex Crowley

From her i heard stories of horror, pain and pleasure that i could never not in my whole life begin to describe in this short story so here's my best attempt to simplify it, from the best of my ability

Alex Crowley was indeed born in this same city as i did, her father left mother when she found out she was pregnant with her, causing her to fall deep into drugs and alcoholism. Her mother would keep trying to fill the void her in life staying on abusive relationships, one after the other, Alex would recall all of her step fathers and all the things they used to do with her. Its hard to say what caught my attention, was it the stories she told me of rape and violence that she had from since she could remember? Or was it the completely casual way that she had of telling me those stories. All smoking a cigarette, looking at the window, reccolecting.

Her mother felt this need of having attention and what she considered love from all this men she used to invite into her house. She had a talent for attracting the worst people this world could offer, abusers, sadists, and all type of people who got off on hurting people weaker than them. And it didn't took long till those monsters set they're predatory eyes towards little old alex, since she could remember there was always a step father, there was always bruises in her skin, there was always someone using her up to fill  they're sadistic needs

Her mother was so desperate for those men, she needed them so much that she was to the point of using her daughter to call their attention. She was born a very pretty little girl and her mother would always turn a blind eye to the abuse she suffered. She never had the courage to  confront them, to run the risk of them leaving like her first husband, so she would allow, just allow them to do what they pleased

There was never a rhyme or a reason, there wasn't a god she could pray to or a family she could rely on, she was lost, naked in a vacuum, completely by herself....



"Chesire puss please" said alice timidly "tell me wich way should i go?" The cat answered: "well that depends a whole lot on where you want to go" and alice answered: "well I don't care much where..." then the cat interrupted: "then it doesn't matter where you go", "as long as i get somewhere" alice continued, then the cat said in a grin: "well if you walk long enough you are sure to do just that" he said before vanishing...



Once one of her step-fathers called her friends out to her mom house, they tied her up to the heater and took turns on her, deflowering all of her holes at once. She could describe the feeling with such perfection that her words instantly send shivers down my spine, i couldn't even begin to try to explain in my own words the sins that were so masterfully painted into the sinister canvas that were her words, tales of mysery and suffering on legendary scale, even withing the pyres of hell 

She could describe the feelings of being hurt, of feeling dirty, ashamed, terrified, to feel a panic take over her body as they filled her up with their hellish poison. And at the end of every day she would in tears return to her mothers arms, used, violated, wishing for a different world, a new life in a new place. Deathly dreams that would never come into fruition.

Every night i would pay for her stay, i needed to hear what else she has been through, i wanted desperately to help that soul now, more than anything. This was now what my heart desires most but i needed her there with me in order to do it, she kept sleeping in my bed, i was always afraid when she wasn't there, wondering where she could be, with whom she could be.

Every morning i washed the blood from my sheets, she always came with a new wound, in her arms, in her legs, and everywhere that i could see. Who i need to be? What do i need to say? What do i need to do? My god, guide me in your light, show me the way to help this poor soul, this child of yours that is suffering, please I'm beggin you my lord

It was the 4th month since i started inviting her in, at this point i stopped paying her a while ago, she didn't even seem to notice, she just finished telling me a story of when her fourth step father beat her with a broomstick because she walked in while he was having sex with her mother. She haven't told him about her daughter yet because she knew he hated children, so it was for the surprise of both when she entered the room to talk with her mother.

After finishing the story she went to my room to sleep as usual but for some reason i wanted to look at her there, maybe watching her peacefully sleeping would bring some solace into my weary soul. Oh how wrong i was, i opened the door and watched her with a switch blade, her pants where lowered down and she was administrating deep cuts into her thighs, she didn't even noticed me coming into the room, she was just so numb with the pain she didn't even noticed.

The next morning she was gone as usual, then the next night again, more cuts and bruises. This time i decided to confront her over her problem, i finally understood what was going on with her. As she lit up her cigarette right before starting the story for the night i got up, went to her side by the windowsill and asked straight to her: "there is no Anthon Lavey is there?"

For the first time i saw an expression of shock on that pretty face, she took a while without answering then simply lowered her head, not saying a word. Like the night we met i raised her hand putting my hand gently in her cheek and i told her once again, she has nothing to fear, she is safe with me. She didn't seemed very touched by my words

"Nothing you can say, or do, will stop me from continuing to do that to myself" thats exactly what she said to me as i stared into her dark eyes. What must i do? What should i say? My heart worries to a point of obsession, how can i help? If i can help.

At that point i was so puzzled, why? Why must she do that? Why must a soul that already went through so much continue to punish herself even further? to desecrate her own body until its in mere ruins of its former glory?

I wanted to ask why at that moment, but would there ever be any words she can use to express the way she feels? Could she ever merely explain the state in wich her mind was? That moment i realized, that she can't she won't ever be able to simply tell me, no matter how much i wanted to know

My angel with dark wings, your breath is of fire and your touch is of ice. Oh dear Alex, she is indeed, she is everything and more. But i won't let this build up inside of me, my care for her only grew stronger the longer i spent with her and im not gonna back down anymore.

I asked her how did she cut herself? With a switchblade? Razor blade? What methods did she use? She seemed puzzled by my question, but she looked deep inside my eyes and realized my intention. Like i said she could never explain to me the reason she did what she did in a way i could understand. So there was only one alternative, she would have to show me.

I asked her to lay on my bed like she used to every night, i was shaking in fear, i had no ideia of what i was about to witness. Some sort of profanity so dark i could hear the devil laughing all the way from hell, i handed her the switch blade, but she said she wouldn't need it, i had no ideia what was gonna happen next. And after that day, i was never the same

She started to undress, she removed her boots, her leather skirt, and her underwear, keeping her fishnet stockings on as she lay bare on my bed, she didn't seemed not a bit ashamed. And dear god, the scars! such tapestry of the purest agony and suffering known to man, a canvas of misery that few men ever had to unfortunate opportunity to witness.

She grabbed needles from her purse and she started inserting them one by one, going from her inner thigh up to her pelvis, tracing and intricate pattern across the skin. after she was done she gently dragged her fingers across the exposed needles on her skin with an expression of pure peace of mind in her face.

She pulled them off one by one, each one of them letting a small droplet of blood as the needle was removed. After that she grabbed the switchblade, in the spot where the needles originally were she started carving a little x, where the lines intersected exactly where the little hole from the needle was, xs all across her skin, carving them up with such precision like she done that many times, carving the flesh aside her vagina up to the skin above it.

She spread her legs displaying her work with pride, letting the blood flow freely through her thighs, her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy, she wasn't a ashamed or in pain, she looked up to me in a expression so serene, like the one you would see in a image of a saint you would find in a church. Her haunting smile i can remember vividly to this day, smiling as she bled into my bed, her scarlet essence dripping into my sheets and all over her body, but that was just the beginning

She grabbed the switchblade once again and with the tip of the blade she started stimulating her clitoris, sometimes putting enough pressure to cut that delicate area deep enough for little droplets of blood bleed into her vagina, and what i heard during that was what i can only describe as a symphony of pain and pleasure that would only be heard again in deepest pits of hell.

Her moans of pain and pleasure terrified me, i saw her bare in front of me, her lower area unshaven and bleeding, her orgasmic sounds did little to arouse me. Terrified by what that woman did to herself i couldn't stop but fear for my own safety as well. She was clearly insane to some degree, but after all, who really isnt to be honest

She grabbed a container of whiskey from her purse and she ingested it like a shipwrecked man who found drinkable water after days of thirst. After that she continued, down her leg she started sliding the blade on her thigh, the blade leaving its trace of crimson pleasure down her skin

After that she grabbed from her purse a red candle and she lit it, then right before my eyes she started pouring the hot wax right on the fresh wound she just opened, closing the wound and cauterizing it at the same time, and the sound of the hot wax burning in her skin while she kept that same joyful and blissful expression was something so twisted and profane it felt like a nightmare. Oh but she can feel its right, so she doesn't close her eyes, she simply allows the pain to take over her, waves of orgasmic agony coursing her body in a delicate dance between pain and pleasure, heaven and hell.

As the wax burned her skin she started touching herself, mixing the pain and pleasure in such an intricate way one would have to train its whole life to learn the precise balance required to achieve complete and utter bliss, tears flowed down her eyes, of both joy and agony, as she finished herself. Finally givin an end to this devilish display of masochism 

She simply grabbed a cigarette, lit up, and starting smoking, in that same position, like nothing even happened. After the initial shock of what i saw was over i felt an instant gag reflex, i went to the sink to throw up but nothing came out of it. Then i heard footsteps from behind me as she whispered in my ear: "how do you feel?" "scared" i said answering honestly as i turned back to her. She was still bottomless and bleeding, with a cigarette in her hand, looking at her, i didn't knew what to say, so i just asked: "and you Alex? How do you feel?" Then she simply answered: "you are about to find out"

Her answer thrilled me to the core, yet, i still wanted to know what would happen next. She took my hand and draged me to the bed, i could feel her warm blood from my sheets stain my clothes and as i layed there in anticipation, watchinh as she whiped all the blood she could from her legs (with my sheets) and covered up her wounds with wrapping paper, keeping ot real tight, almost cutting the blood circulation from her thigh before putting on her underwear back.

Then she pointed the switchblade at me and she just simply asked: "now how do you feel?" And i told her i was terrified of what she would do to me. Then she told me that this was a good feeling. A thrill, an excitment, like adrenaline. Having someone threatening me with a knife was indeed something i never experienced before, and all the hairs in my bidy stood straight as she very slowly dragged the blade across my skin, not putting enough pressure to cut me, but just enough to terrify me to the core

I was afraid, yet, i wanted to know what would happen next, what was it? Was it her expression or pure glee and joy she had while hurting herself? Was it the sounds of orgasmic pleasure she made while she bled? Im not really sure, but something made me curious, something made me want to know more, something made wanna knkw how deep this rabbit hole goes.

After she was done threatening me with the switchblade she put it back in her purse, then while gently caressing my face with her bloody hands she told me in a soft voice: "pain is such a natural part of life yet people cowardly run from it, isnt it funny? Running away from your own life? What would you be left of? In a vaccum? In an abyss of emptiness? Pain fills that emptiness with divine grace. I can show you, i can show you sensations beyound the ones if this world"

I felt so tempted to say yes but i was terrified, i did not wanted her to hurt me. I told her that and she looked really disapointed, nontheless, she still slept in my bed that night, and i on the couch. To my suprise the next morning i woke up and there she was, peacefully sleeping, for the first time she didnt escaped in the morning while i was sleeping. Could it be? She feels comfortable enough here to not run away? My heart raced in excitment at the sight of that, i wanted her to be comfortable in my presence, i felt filled with pride and joy having made such a conection with her.

But that excitment last very little, once i realized who was sleeping in my bed at the moment, who i was really making a conection with. As i made breakfast for us the images i saw yesterday where roaming in my mind like a demon, i was still in shock even after having slept. And a few hours later she woke up, still wearing only a shirt, underwear and her fishnet stockings, completely casual and at peace, it brought me joy making breakfast to her. Still the scars from yesterday were still pretty fresh in her thigh but i tried not looking at it

Thats when she started basicall living there, and being true to her word, nothing i said or did ever stoped her from mutilating herself, every night. At least now she didnt had to hide from me, and free food and shelter i supose were to good to resist, she went to my where every night, at about midnight, she got herself busy. Blades, candles, needles and little chains and hooks, sewing needles, sometimes even matches and cigarettes, were all weapons for her to use against her own skin 

And now, she didnt even hid from me, in fact, every night before i go to sleep on the couch she went to me and said she wanted to show me something, i know exaclty what she means and every night is a different form of self mutilation. And there i was standing, sometimes sitting, watching that twisted show she put on every night, fullfilling her voyeuristic fantasies. Sometimes she would hurt herself in the arm, the shoulder, the belly, mostly in her pelvis and her thighs, easier to hide later, but there were times where she couldnt resist, legs and arms were her favorite. She told me that the tissue in those areas were the most satisfying to cut

In fact, she became much more talkative during that time, spending so much time together we discussed a lot of things, she told me the difference betwen satanism and Luciferiarilism, she told me where she got the name Anthonn Lavey and much more about herself in general. It was clear she didnt got out of her way just to get atention but she seemed...... satisfied enough whenever i gave it, whenever i asked if she was okay or if she needed anything. I was just happy she didn't needed to sell her body in order to live anymore.

But after 26 days of living that way everything changed, i had a dream that night on the couch, it was me and her, she was slicing my skin with a blade while kissing me, that dream evolved to us having sex i knew the face she would make very well and it was strange beacuse till then i never thought of her that way. I got up after the dream ended and i went to my little altar to pray that jesus christ would clean my mind from those impure thoughts but as i got up in the middke of the night i saw it. My kitchen knife, shining with the light of the moon coming from the window

It called for me, i wanted to know, i wanted to join her world, i liked her so much but she never seemed to share the same feelings for me and after that dream... Its so strange, to this day i cant tell whether i was looking for a way to understand her better, understand what type of joy she got from hurting herself. Or weather i was so desperate to make her like me that i was to go so far to cut myself to prove her i can be like her

Nontheless that blade was too tempting to resist, i grabbed it and slowly dragged across my arms, i started with very little cuts, i could barely feel it. Then i progressed into more agressive ones, the hand holding my knife was shaking in adrenaline my whole body was quacking in antecipation of what was about to happen as i cut myself deeper and deeper, my arm was burning and blood was dripping on the floor.    

Suddenly i heard footseps from behind me and the she was, wearing only her cat t shirt, underwear and grey socks but i could barely tell out of how dark that room was. And she was bleeding from almost everywher, and the blood, oh the blood, the blood shined in bright red light reflecting its scarlet brightness across the room. She saw me, she knew what i was doing, she grined so wide, it would be a terryfing sight to see in other circunstances but at that point, i wasnt not the least bit afraid.

She draged me down to the kitchen floor, i was laying in my own blood that dripped from my arms, then she grabbed the kitchen knife and slowly dragged on my shirt but this time, she cut it, she cut my shirt and cut my abdomen deeply beneath it, i screamed in pain but she took her bloody fingers into my lips and simply said: "sssshhhhh.... allow your body to feel it, feel everything, surrender yourself to the agony"

I tried not to think of the pain, i tried to think of something good, i wanted to distract myself from what was going on. Then i remembered the dream i just had, she was bouncing on my hips, sitting on me just like she is now. Suddenly, in the wound she just opened, the burning pain of having my torso sliced almost an inch under my skin, it suddenly enhanced the pleasure from the thoughts of my dream, and the most amazing thing happened.

It was hurting, but it was hurting good, there she was sitting over me, a knife in her hand, a smile on her lips, and i was feeling all of it, I AM FEELING EVERYTHING, my entire body was doing the most delicate dance betwen pain and pleasure, until actually felt aroused, the feeling was working, and she felt my arousal under her. An invitation to continue with whatever she was doing, she put the knife close to me and this time, i did not attempt to avoid me. Bless me Alex, bless me with feelings and sensations beyound what any mortal has ever felt before

At this point i welcomed it, i wanted to know what she got in store for me, i relish this feeling of desperation and desolation, its like, im where i always wanted to be but only realized now. My lord, my father who art in heaven, please look away, beacuse im about to do something you are not gonna like very much. After she was done carving slightly tiny bits of my skin (now with my permission) i started to cry, but not because of the pain, beacuse it was right there when i realized and thought. "My dear god have mercy on my soul, because now after all this time, after all i heard that she went through, and everything she has done to me, i realize that now, i have fallen in love of that woman, the cruelest and relentless feeling of all, has layd its curse upon me, and there was no god or demon that could save me now...."



"Over there, you will find a mad hatter" said the chesire cat in a grin, "oh no thank you" said alice scared. "Well if you go that way, you will find the march hare" the cat continued, "why thank you, i shall visit her then" alice then said excitedly, "of course she is also mad" chesire cat finished, "but i don't wanna be amongst mad people!" Alice said worried. "Well that cant be helped, we are all mad here hehehe. You might have noticed..... im not all there myself" the cat said while vanishing slowly, leaving only its eerie grin behind.



3 months after that, every night, we would indulge in the same rituals of sado masochism. It started small, she would cut me very lightly leaving only a small trace bebind the next morning, but she was a creative girl, she knew all the many things she could do to cause pain, and i enjoyed that delicious feast of exquisite agony with much delight. The days went by, the cuts got deeper, the scars larger. It became i who had to hide them from the other students from my university, i was failing the classes miserably.

Why should i even care at this point? I already found enlightment, i am ultra alive, i feel everything, i started to look at all the other students, my former friends, with such pity. There they are going to live a boring life as maybe a psychiatrist, a doctor, pediatrician. Going back to their homes everyday, kissing their wifes, eating dinner. Every night i see the devil and i laugh at its face, i finally got it, i understood each and every intricate feeling Alex felt, everything she knew, i now know, nothing can hurt me anymore. I return home everyday and there she is, ready to receive me in the worm embrace of agony.
