Tommy was born with a condition called macrocephaly, an oversized cranium due to excessive fluid in his skull. The condition narrowed his sinus cavities, making it difficult for him to breathe through his nose. His head was oversized with a pronounced, sloping brow ridge over his eyes that gave him a permanent scowl.

He had many surgeries as an infant to combat the fluid buildup. As a result, his forehead was pockmarked with scars from the halo screws drilled into his skull. The doctors were successful in saving his life, however Tommy never fully recovered from the damage, leaving him with the mental capacity of a toddler for life.

I grew up next door to Tommy. Even though he was three years older, my Mom scheduled playdates for us so his mother could get a break from time to time. The first time his mother brought him over he wouldn’t look at me, he just eyed my toys and breathed raggedly through his nostrils, whistling with each exhale.

“Tommy, this is Abbie, can you say hi?” she asked.

Tommy glanced briefly in my direction, offering a quick flail of a wave with his hand.

I waved back sheepishly.

“Oh he likes you!” she said, forcing a weary smile that I grew to understand more and more over the years.

“You play nice with Abbie, okay Tommy?”

Tommy nodded, and she let him loose.

He ran to my pile of toys, going for the trucks first. Trucks were also my favorite, so I had to stifle a pout as I looked up at my mom when he grabbed my semi-truck and rolled it across the carpet. I swallowed my frustration and grabbed my next favorite truck, the ambulance, and tried driving it alongside him to play along. Instead of playing with me, Tommy took my truck and drove it himself. This continued with each truck I picked, Tommy would just take it from me and add it to his growing convoy.

Our first playdate was only a half hour, but I remember being so mad at Tommy because he didn’t share. At the end when his mother told him to thank me, he ran over and gave me a hug and planted a wet, snotty kiss on my cheek.

“Good,” he said, and then ran back to his mom. She choked up as tears brimmed in her eyes as she hugged me goodbye, managing two words, “Thank you.”

When they left, I told my mom what he did and that I didn’t like playing with Tommy, that he wouldn’t share the toys. They were my toys! She sat four-year-old me down and explained that Tommy was different, that he would always be different, and would never grow up the way I would. Because of that, we had to be caring and understanding towards Tommy and his mother, because life would always be more difficult for them. I didn’t really understand what she was saying then, but I agreed that I would find a way to play with Tommy.

After a few playdates, Tommy learned more about sharing and that he didn’t need to have every toy. I also learned how to play with him. If he had a toy that I really wanted, I would find another one, making a huge fuss about how great it was. Eventually he would see me with my toy and would grow jealous, and would offer to trade. And at the end of each playdate, he would hug me and give me his usual snotty kiss, saying “Good.”

My mother invited him to every one of my birthday parties. The other kids would look at him funny, not understanding why he was there or why he couldn’t sit and wait for me to blow out the candles before eating a cupcake of his own (along with his developmental issues, Tommy was also allergic to damn near everything). I tried to explain to mom that the other kids didn’t understand Tommy, but she again reminded me of our talk when I was four, that Tommy was special and that we needed to care for him.

His mother enrolled Tommy in public school, not that there were many other options for him in our small town. Our mothers stood with us at the bus stop the first day of school, taking pictures of us and smiling as we waited for the bus.

When the bus arrived, Tommy followed me on, but then screamed when he realized that the door had closed with his mother outside. He ran back down the aisle, pounding his fists on the bus door as the driver pulled to a stop. The bus drove away, leaving Tommy crying in his mother’s arms as she waved to me from the side of the road, still soldiering on with that weary smile. The ride lasted about twenty feet, but it was the only time Tommy took the bus.

At school, Tommy spent most of his day with the special education teacher. His mother shadowed the first few days, but eventually she was able to leave him longer and longer until he spent the whole day at school. I would see him from time to time in the halls and during lunch and recess.

It was in third grade where Tommy earned the nickname that followed him through high school – Tonka.

Tommy had a giant yellow dump truck that he played with at recess every day. It was old with rust around the rivets and in the corners of the truck bed, perhaps a hand me down from his absent father. Every day after lunch, he’d sit in the mulch along the side of the playground by the row of pine trees, loading up his dump truck with pinecones, dirt and needles. When the bed was full, he’d blow raspberries, mimicking the sounds of the truck as he drove it down to the other end of the mulch bed, beeping as he slowly dumped his cargo.

He did this over and over, delivering his payload from one end of the mulch to the other, every day, the entire recess. When the whistle sounded to call us back to class, he’d park it under the biggest pine tree and run to get in line, snorting the whole way.

We weren’t allowed to bring toys from home, so no one was really sure where the truck came from. But when a teacher approached him and tried to take it from him, she learned the second reason for Tommy’s nickname.

Even in grade school, Tommy was built like a fucking tank.

“You’re not allowed to bring toys to school, Tommy,” Mrs. Darcy said, looking down at Tommy as he stared up with a smile on his face. His smile shifted to confusion as Mrs. Darcy grabbed his beloved dump truck, emptying its payload before carrying the yellow metal toy back towards the school.

“You can have it back at the end of the day,” she said.

He was on her before she reached the blacktop, knocking her face first into the ground and pummeling her with his fists.

“My truck!” he screamed as he gripped her hair in his hand, yanking her head back. It took three teachers to restrain him so that Mrs. Darcy could crawl out from underneath him. He was built like a bowling ball, so he managed to wiggle free from their grasp and snatch up his dump truck, running back to the mulch beds. He stayed there as the rest of us lined up and went back inside for afternoon class.

From my seat by the window, I watched him after finishing my math quiz as he filled his dump truck and drove it down to the other end of the mulch beds. He was on his third trip when his mother arrived flanked by the police resource officer. Tommy smiled, giving his mom a big hug as he rumbled off the playground, as if the earlier ugliness had never happened.

It was two weeks before I saw him again. I only knew he was back when he tapped me on the shoulder as we lined up at the door for recess.

“Abbie! Can I go first? Please?” he asked. He smiled, showing his yellow gapped teeth as he put his hands together as if praying. I nodded and let him pass. He ran as fast as his short little legs could carry him, snorting the whole way to the mulch beds and the giant pine tree in the middle. To no surprise, his Tonka truck was there waiting for him.

The attack on Mrs. Darcy was Tommy’s only major incident until we got to high school.

It was our sophomore year. I was on the honors track, doing well in my studies but firmly embedded in my status as a nobody band kid (I was second clarinet, a slight step above nobody). Tommy spent most of the school day in his special education classes at the far end of the building. If he ever got himself worked up over something, his Mom gave his teacher my name. Every now and then I’d hear my name over the intercom and I would go down to Tommy’s classroom and sit with him until he was settled. It didn’t happen often, maybe once a month.

There’s something about sophomores that makes them easy targets for nicknames and hazing. Perhaps it’s the newfound awareness and sensitivity to social status, either having it and wanting to keep it or lacking it and needing to gain it. As a result, anything embarrassing or even endearing from childhood is data mined by the resident school assholes to torment those with high levels of insecurity.

The king of these assholes was a senior named Kyle Sellers. He was a popular kid, funny, a good athlete, and had a knack for finding that one thing about yourself that you were hypersensitive about. Even if you weren’t, you would be by the time the rest of the school got hold of it.

The only time Tommy was with the rest of his classmates was during lunch, which was when he caught Kyle’s attention. Tommy was on his way back to his classroom when he walked past Kyle’s table where he sat with the school’s A Listers – Kyle’s football buddies and their cheerleader girlfriends.

“Hey Tonka!” Kyle yelled.

Tommy turned, pointing his finger at his chest. “Who me?”

Kyle laughed and nodded. “Yeah man! You’re the kid who had that big yellow dump truck back in third grade, the one who beat up the teacher at recess, right?”

Tommy nodded.

“You still have it, man?” Kyle asked.

His gang snickered at the table as they watched Tommy shift from foot to foot. A few of his football goons mimicked Tommy’s nasally breathing and nervous shifting as they waited for his reply.

I watched from my table of fellow band nobodies, unsure if I should intervene. On one hand I was already pretty low on the hierarchy of social status at our high school so I wasn’t risking much if I came to Tommy’s aid. On the other, Kyle Sellers was a fucking monster who could make your life hell once he set his crosshairs on you. I decided to wait it out and watch.

Tommy grinned, nodding enthusiastically. “You wanna see it?”

Kyle’s eyes lit up.

“Fuck yeah I want to see it! Can you bring it to school tomorrow?”

Tommy looked up, tapping his index finger against his jaw, grinning as he tried to make it look like he was thinking about it.

“If I do, can I wear your jacket?” Tommy asked.

Kyle stood up, revealing his varsity letterman’s jacket. Black wool with an embroidered ram’s head on the chest above his name and white buttons up the front and white leather sleeves. On the back were his three varsity letters for basketball, football and baseball.

“You like my jacket?” Kyle asked.

Tommy nodded.

“Tell you what, if you bring your truck, we might even see about getting you a jacket of your own.”

Tommy’s eyes lit up. “You mean it?”

“Hell yeah, what do you say, guys?” Kyle turned to his football compatriots at his table. They nodded and grinned, all playing along.

Tommy pumped his fist. “I’ll bring it!”

“That’s what I’m talking about! Up high, bro!”

Kyle put his hand up for Tommy to high five. Tommy smacked it, hard. So hard Kyle shook his hand in pain as Tommy scurried back to class.

I arrived in school the next day to see Tommy trudging up to Kyle and his group of friends as they sat at their table in the commons before the bell. Tears poured from Tommy’s eyes. He didn’t have his truck and was visibly upset about it.

Kyle hushed his table as Tommy approached.

“Tonka, what’s up pal?” Kyle said.

“Mom wouldn’t let me bring it!” Tommy said, crossing his arms in a huff as he stomped his feet. “Can I still have a jacket? Please?”

Tommy put his hands together, the same way he did in third grade when he asked to cut in front of me in the playground line.

Kyle huddled with his friends, all of them snickering and whispering as they devised a plan. After a short deliberation, Kyle shushed them as he stood to put his arm around Tommy.

“Hey man, it’s okay. I know how moms can be. Tell you what, maybe you can do something else for me, would you like that?”

Tommy nodded as he dragged his forearm across his nose. Kyle winced.

“Find me today at lunch, I’ll think of something.”

Tommy pumped his fist, his earlier sadness replaced by renewed excitement. At the varsity table, Kyle and his minions laughed.

I waited until just before the first bell, when Kyle was by himself on his way to Algebra before confronting him.

“What are you planning on doing with Tommy?” I asked.

He turned, looking me up and down in his condescending way. He smirked.

“The fuck are you talking to me for, band kid?”

He said it loud, drawing attention to our conversation. A few stragglers in the hall hung back, listening. My plan for a private conversation was no longer happening.

It was enough to make me want to walk away, but I stood firm, exhaling before I spoke.

“Tommy doesn't know when he’s the butt of a joke so your comments don’t really affect him. So please be nice to him or leave him alone.” I added. “That’s all I wanted to say.”

I don’t think I made eye contact once during the whole conversation. I walked away to the sounds of the hallway stragglers giggling as Kyle called out my new nickname.

“Good talk, Retard Fucker.”

By lunchtime, my nickname had shortened to just the initials as it worked its way around the school. I’d hear people whispering “RF” and pointing as I walked by, the football players yelled it out when they saw me. By the time I sat down at lunch, everyone at my table had heard it and was looking at me with a mix of pity and disdain. Pity for the unfortunate nickname, disdain for not wanting to be seen with me and get caught in the crossfire.

I decided it best to sit by myself.

The genius of the nickname was the initials rather than saying it. For those who weren’t in the know it led to the question “What’s RF stand for?” followed by a cupped hand to the ear, whispering the answer as the listener’s eyes widened.

My nickname wasn’t the only news to travel around school that day. In my new seat by the lunch line, I saw Tommy huddled up with Kyle and his football bros. They were giggling and laughing as they looked over lunch counter for Tommy’s mission.

Tommy grinned as he got in line, taking a tray and walking up to the lunch counter. It was Wednesday, fish sandwich and fries. Tommy took his basket of food, grinning as he lifted the bun off his sandwich.

He sniffed it, curled up his lip and yelled, “This smells like dirty pussy!”

Kyle and his friends fell to the ground, howling with laughter. Everyone who heard it was laughing, even some of the teachers.

The closest teacher, Mr. Caldwell, masked his amusement as he approached Tommy.

“Tommy, you can’t talk like that, okay bud? Those aren’t nice words.”

Tommy nodded. Mr. Caldwell gave him a shoulder pat and sent Tommy on his way.

That was it. No punishment, no reprimand.

By the time he reached Kyle and his friends, the table erupted with cheers and high fives. The school had no idea what they had just unleashed. Tommy, who could get away with saying almost anything, and Kyle, who had a limitless supply of teenage boy humor and insults at his disposal.

As if on cue, Kyle walked by my table with his arm around Tommy, now wearing Kyle’s letterman’s jacket. He smirked as he looked at me, mouthing my new nickname.

*Retard Fucker.*

The rest of the semester, Kyle used Tommy as a weapon to unleash his childish pranks on the school. He had Tommy to yell “Fuck” in the hallways during semester exams. He made him walk up to Mrs. Langham, the front office secretary, and tell her she was “one hot MILF!” Since his favorite was doling out nicknames to anyone who got in his way, Kyle used Tommy as the means of publicizing the new monikers. It was an effective, lethal bullet to anyone’s social standing.

Talking to Tommy about Kyle was a non-starter. Tommy was too innocent, too pure of heart to realize Kyle was using him. To Tommy, Kyle was his best friend. Although the teachers bristled at Tommy’s behavior and his expanded vocabulary of swear words, they praised Kyle for taking Tommy under his wing and befriending him. His selfish act was treated as an act of charity. The school paper even ran an article on their unlikely friendship. The headline – *Football Hero with a Heart of Gold*.

As a result, he became somewhat of a school mascot. Not Tommy; Tonka.

At pep rallies Tommy would run around the gym wearing jersey #00 with TONKA written across the back. He danced and pumped his fists to rile up the crowd like Kyle’s personal hype man. If it weren’t for Kyle using him as his personal prank machine, it would’ve been quite wholesome.

Later in the school year, however, Kyle pushed his luck with Tommy too far.

It happened during a Varsity women’s basketball game. Kyle and his crew were unofficial cheerleaders for the women’s team and would lead the crowd in chants, taunt opposing players, and just play grab-ass in the stands while occasionally pretending to care about the game. We had a big game against our crosstown league rival, so Kyle wanted to do something special.

How the events unfolded seemed to differ depending on who you asked.

According to Kyle, he dared Tommy to stand outside the visiting team’s locker room and loudly sing our school fight song. Annoying, yes, but harmless. I found out later from Tommy’s mom that Kyle told Tommy to sneak into the locker room and steal a jersey from the opposing team so they could wave it like a flag. Tommy said no at first, until Kyle said he’d make good on his earlier promise to give Tommy his own Letterman’s jacket. But it didn’t matter; Kyle’s version of the story was corroborated by all of his jock friends, so the school took his side.

The shriek of the girls as Tommy ran into the locker room caught the attention of their coach, who ran up to find out what was going on. Everyone at the court just sat and waited as a huddle of coaches and school administrators discussed what happened as Tommy sat on the ground against the wall with his arms crossed.

When word of what happened made it to the parents in the stands, they called the police. Despite his learning disabilities, Tommy was eighteen, and the girls in the locker room were underage and in the process of dressing for the game. The incident was handled as an act of sexual deviancy against minors. A confused Tommy was led away in handcuffs, asking Kyle when he was going to get his new jacket.

When I left band practice that evening, I passed Tommy as he sat in the back of the police cruiser in front of the school superintendent’s office. He grinned at me, his usual yellow gap toothed smile as he lifted his handcuffed hands up to wave. I smiled and waved back.

In the days that followed, Kyle and his friends quickly spun their version of the story in school. He said they tried to talk Tommy out of running into the locker room but he wouldn’t listen due to his fucked up brain. All of his previous acting up, the yelling in the lunchroom, the nicknames, even the dump truck incident in third grade came back up to support the narrative that Tommy was a monster with no remorse for his actions. By the end of the week, Kyle had most of the school convinced that he was a victim and not the ringleader.

Tommy’s case was handled by the public defender’s office, who after meeting with Tommy ordered a competency assessment. There was no trial; Tommy was sent to a psychological hospital for evaluation and treatment.

I wanted to speak on Tommy’s behalf before the court but his mother talked me out of it. She said it wouldn’t change anything. I remember looking at her, a skinny frail woman who somehow managed to wrangle her barrel chested son by herself for nearly twenty years. All the doctor visits, the surgeries, meds dispensing, not to mention the nightly baths. She was exhausted, and no one would blame her for feeling a little relieved to unshoulder that burden onto the state.

Four months after he arrived at the psychiatric hospital, Tommy suffered a heart attack during a prolonged episode of obstructive sleep apnea. In the short time Tommy had been there, he gained sixty pounds due to the increased drug regimen they put him on after one of his physical outbursts. He was in a coma for six days before his doctors declared him functionally brain dead and his mother agreed to disconnect the life support.

Tommy was buried in the cemetery not far from the high school after a small private funeral. The only people present besides his mother were Tommy’s special education teacher, my mother, and myself. When I hugged his mother at the cemetery, she was a hollow shell of her former self, emptied out and withered. She was two years younger than my mom, just barely over 40, but she had the wrinkled hands and the white hair of a woman twenty years her senior. She thanked me for always being kind to Tommy.

A For Sale sign was planted in her driveway the next morning. Moving vans arrived about a week later. Before she left, she dropped off some of my old toys that Tommy had taken over the years from my house. Among them was Tommy’s beat up, rusted yellow dump truck that earned him his moniker back in grade school. I stowed them in my closet.

Back at school, life moved on. The school posted a print out of Tommy’s obituary in the commons but it came down quickly after someone crossed out his name and wrote TONKA in black sharpie. Kyle continued his asshole ways, finding other targets to pick on and torment. I’d see him in the halls sometimes, he’d smirk at me but never said anything. Other times, when he didn’t see me, I’d follow him and think about how satisfying it would be to crack him over the head with my clarinet. I didn’t think I had enough strength to kill him, but that wasn’t what I fantasized about.

I wanted him to suffer.

I daydreamed about all the ways it could happen, from getting mangled in a car accident to having his arms caught in a thresher, his flesh pulled and twisted until his arms ripped from his shoulder sockets like deboning the wings on a Thanksgiving turkey. Injuries involving his arms fascinated me the most; to take away his precious throwing arm, the one that made him all state in three sports and put him on the path to becoming the king asshole at school.

I didn’t know how to get my hands on a thresher, but I did know where my mom kept her .22 pistol hidden in her nightstand.

A stupid thought, but it persisted nonetheless, taking root in my mind and growing with every smirk I saw on his face. I wanted his actions to have consequences. I owed it to Tommy and every other kid Kyle had mentally tormented during his four year reign over the school.

I even knew the best time to do it. Seventh period, when Kyle had Study Hall in the library. Not that he used it for studying. Most days he’d ball up his Letterman’s jacket around his head like a pillow in the back corner of the library and take a nap. I worked in the guidance office as an aide that period, giving me the ability to roam the school on office business.

All I had to do was get up close while he was sleeping, bury the tip of the gun into the crook of his elbow and pull the trigger. BANG. No more elbow.

I didn’t care that I would get caught. I wanted the chance to tell Kyle’s true story, of how he manipulated Tommy and made life Hell for so many kids at school.

Being the science nerd that I was, I made a few practice runs to perfect my plan. Like a laboratory experiment, I had to define all the variables and solve for X.

Mom left for work every morning at 6:45, thirty minutes before my bus arrived. After she left, I snuck into her bedroom and unlocked the gun safe in her drawer. The passcode was my birthday. I didn’t take it with me, not yet, at least. I didn’t want to risk getting caught with it unless it was the day of the event. I used a placeholder instead, a hairbrush, that I hid deep in my backpack, leaving it tucked in my locker for the day.

When seventh period rolled around, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. After a quick trip to my locker, I’d make my way to the library which was a glass enclosed room in between the math and science halls on the second floor. The best time was twenty minutes into the period, giving Kyle enough time to get settled and fall asleep. His favorite spot was the desk in the back corner of the library, right up against the glass wall of the library. He slept with his elbow pressed up against the glass. I could do it right from the hallway. The shattered glass would act like shrapnel, might even take out one of his eyes.

I chose the day before the end of the year senior awards ceremony as the day I would go through with my plan. The ceremony was held in the gymnasium with all of the school there to watch, almost like a pep rally. Working in the guidance office, I already knew that Kyle was slated to win the school’s Athlete of the Year award. The office was even preparing a video presentation of his highlights to play at the end when he received his award.

How fitting would it be for a meek band kid to take that moment away from him?

Just after midnight the night before I took Kyle’s future from him, I was roused from my sleep by  a rattling noise coming from the closet of my bedroom. Startled, I sat upright in bed, listening.

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as my closet door slowly opened, followed by the sound of a rickety metal dump truck rolling across the floor.

My first thought was that it fell and knocked the door open. Then I heard the distinct, unmistakable nose whistle as the truck rounded the corner and rolled across the floor along the side of my bed.

“Tommy?” I whispered with a shaky breath.

The truck stopped. I held my breath, waiting in the silence.

Although it was quiet, a voice carried through the darkness, breaching the veil between this world and the next.

Two words, plain and clear.

*My truck.*

Tears stung my eyes. My initial fear in the moment subsided as a great sadness washed over me.

“I’m so, so sorry Tommy,” I said between sniffles of tears. “I should’ve protected you. I should’ve done more.”

I felt a presence beside me, a shadow filling the space where a person might stand. Goosebumps pricked my skin as I felt a long slow exhale against the side of my face and neck punctuated by a nose whistle that I never thought I’d hear again.

I held my breath as the shadow presence lingered beside me, breathing in Tommy’s labored manner. My emotions shifted from sadness to fear as I waited for the shadow to move or do something.

I felt the unmistakable feel of one of Tommy’s snotty kisses against my cheek. Again the voice carried over the darkness. Two more words.

*Abbie. Good.*

The shadow pulled back. On the floor beside my bed, the dump truck rattled as it rolled over my carpet. I giggled softly through my tears as I heard what sounded like Tommy’s voice imitating the air horn as the truck bed raised, dumping its cargo onto the floor.

After that the truck fell silent, not moving again. It was still there in the morning when I woke up.

The next morning after Mom left for work, I loaded up my backpack with the secret cargo, burying it deep in the bottom of my bag under my books. It was bulkier than I was prepared for, and almost decided against going through with it but after some rearranging I managed to fit everything in there. I stuck it in my locker, hiding it until seventh period. Considering what I was about to do, I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I would be.

When seventh period arrived, I excused myself as planned. I made my way up to the second floor hall to my locker to retrieve what I had hidden there. The halls were empty, but even if they weren’t it wouldn’t have stopped me. As I approached the library, Kyle was sleeping right where I expected to find him.

I stepped closer to the glass, watching him sleep. I noticed something that slipped my detection earlier, part of the reason why Kyle slept the way he did hidden in the corner with his jacket balled up around his head. I snapped a quick photo, then stepped quickly down the stairs to the teacher’s lounge, exiting into the parking lot.

It was different from the plan I originally wanted for the day, one that I hadn’t even tested, but I didn’t think they’d put out an APB for an honor’s band kid sneaking out of school during the day. I wasn’t going that far anyways, and would be back before the period was over.

I crossed the parking lot of the school, making my way to the road, cutting into the cornfield on the other side. Stepping over the spring stalks of corn, I climbed over the wrought iron fence that surrounded the cemetery. Tommy’s grave was in the newer section but still difficult to find having only been there once during the funeral.

A tear slid down my cheek as I found it. The dirt of his grave sprouted with white shoots of grass in front of his newly placed tombstone.

“Hello, Tommy,” I said as I opened up my backpack. “I brought you something.”

I placed his metal dump truck on the ground in front of his tombstone just below his name. A warm spring breeze kicked up as it rattled back and forth on the packed dirt.

I told him goodbye, promising to visit him again soon to play trucks.

Getting back in school was easier than I thought. I passed through the office, waving to the secretary. No questions, no reprimands.

Splicing the picture of Kyle into the highlight reel was a little more challenging than my original plan of turning his elbow into hamburger sprinkled with glass confetti. The end result was way more satisfying, and worth more than the five days detention I received for my prank.

After an awards ceremony where he was named Athlete of the Year followed by a five minute video montage of his on the field success, the lasting image of the day was a still frame photo of Kyle, the king of the assholes, sucking his thumb as he slept in the library.

The gymnasium erupted with laughter. The teachers, the kids, everyone was laughing and pointing. Someone started chanting, “Kyle is a thumbsucking baby!” and soon the entire gym was singing along.

Kyle stood dumbstruck at the podium as it all unfolded, holding his trophy. He stormed off the stage, shouting obscenities as all the students mimed sucking their thumb at him as they chanted. Even his douchebag buddies joined in, sucking their thumbs and pointing at him as he ran by.

It was petty. It was childish. Most of all, it was glorious.
