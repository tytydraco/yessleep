I’m sorry.

I was supposed to watch you. I was supposed to be your protector. 

I found you there, amongst the damp and the muck. Summoned by the prancing shadows that swarmed you. You lay so still now. Nestled neatly between the pieces of yourself they ripped and tore and prodded. 

I didn’t know you…but I know I should have protected you. I should have kept you safe from the ones who mauled and mangled. They cheer and dance around you now. Revelling in their work. 

They’re waiting for me to leave. They want me to leave you here. Leave you alone to their hunger. They know you are no use to me now. Not now that you are splayed out, staining the ground around you with that colour that makes me feel ashamed. 

But you lay so still now. 

Cradled in the grass and the weeds. Your tiny body curled and twisted, splashed with colour your family was never meant to wear. The shadows dance. Prancing impatiently close. If they had the words I’m sure they would shoo me away.

But you lay so still now.

I swat at your dancing attackers. Grief and shame grip my chest. I didn’t mean for this…it wasn’t my fault. You must know, I didn’t want this. How could I have known you were laying here? As I lay wrapped in the gift of your forebearers. 

I hadn’t known you lay so still.
And I am sorry.

Protected you would have grown, you would have stood. People would have walked by and awed at your life. Rushing to steal a glance at your pearly presence. Cooing and reaching out hoping to touch you. Protected you might have known a time beyond the damp and the cold. A time after the biting wind and rain that clung to you in your final moments.

But you lay so still now. 
I am sorry. 

The stench of metal and the tang of rot stretch out to me. Bile rises to my throat. There’s too much of you. She will notice soon. The weight of your absence by her side, the weight of her mindless neglect. She’s not used to protecting something so fragile, so easily claimed by the ones who tear and poke. It was just a moment she turned her back.

You lay so still in the bag I place you in. 
Limbs popping and your now ruined softness falling about you. Pieces of you spill out, fought over amongst the shadows that chew and crunch. 

You lay so still when I placed you in the hole.
Your form now cradled beneath the grass and the weeds. Enveloped by the earth that should have sustained you.

I’m sorry.

She will look for you. 
The shadows will prance around where you used to lay so still. 

She will call for you. 
As the grass and the weeds and the flowers take root, springing from the abundance of your sacrifice. 

Be still now.

She will know better next time.
