"It has always been there," said Gonzalo after taking a sip of his beer.

Compared to previous days, the bar was unusually quiet. The summer was ending, and so was the influx of tourists and life that the season brought to our little town. Granted, it wasn’t the biggest bar. And it was rather narrow. To the left of the entrance there was a row of a few tables that stretched all the way to the back, where the restroom was located. And to the right lay the counter, and a busy bartender drying some glasses with a washcloth.

We were seated on the first table of the row, the one near the door. On the other side of the bar was the only other customer, one of the town’s drunks. All alone, occupying the biggest and last table, next to the bathroom.

"Yeah, that lighthouse is one of my earliest memories," I replied. The image was still engraved in my mind. It was located right at the edge of a tall cliff and looked very similar to the many other lighthouses in northern Spain. The first floor of the building was a cube made out of ancient stonework. It had been left intact when the building was renovated a century ago. From the base, rose a decrepit spire that overlooked our quaint fishing town. Almost anywhere you looked there were spots of concrete the elements had exposed. It was hard to believe that once it was completely painted a clean, pure white. Upon the spire laid the cabin from which the light used to shine when the lighthouse was still operational, but now its windows were shattered.

“That’s not really what I meant. Of course it’s been there since we were born. It’s older than the town itself. I’m pretty sure it’s older than the Tower of Hercules. It has always been there,” Gonzalo quickly cut off my train of thought.

“About that. I’ve always wondered why they would build a lighthouse in the middle of nowhere. It doesn’t make much sense as it is now with how little traffic the town gets. But back then? It made even less sense. Why would sailors want help to reach, well… barren coastland? It’s kind of eerie, don’t you think?”

Gonzalo was about to reply, but I instantly interjected again. “And that’s not all, this town has way too many missing person cases for how small it is!”

“Again with the ghost stories, Álvaro? Oh yeah! This town sure is cuuursed!” he said mockingly.

“Oh, come on! You know the stories too. The postman, the street cleaner… How many strange disappearances have we lived through growing up in this small town? And how many have our parents lived? It’s certainly odd, you gotta give me that.”

Gonzalo scoffed and began gulping down the rest of his beer. That short moment of silence gave me the chance to observe him. He hadn’t changed a bit since I had last seen him two years ago. We had been best friends since I could remember. We grew up together and we were inseparable. That is, until we went off to college. He went to Santiago and I got the opportunity to study abroad. However, this summer we were both going back to our hometown to visit our families. And now, here we were, drinking in the best bar in town, catching up.

“So… are we finally going to explore it?” Gonzalo blurted out as he finished his drink.

I hesitated. We had talked about breaking into the lighthouse many times when we still lived here. But, we ended up chickening out every time. Well, to be honest, I was the one who always got cold feet. Gonzalo was braver than me in that regard.

Nevertheless, we weren’t going to get many more chances to do it. We seemed to be leaving this town, and to a certain extent our friendship, behind. So, for old times’ sake, I decided I would go through with it this time.

“Ok, let’s do it!” I replied with a smile.

“For real?” His eyes then lit up when I nodded in response, while finishing my own beer.

We then each went home to prepare for our trip, and we agreed to meet at midnight at the dirt road that led to the lighthouse. Once there, it was a five minute walk.

The hour came, and we began making our way up the little path. The air was cool and humid. A light breeze accompanied by the soothing sound of waves crashing against the shoreline brought the familiar odor of the Cantabrian Sea. In front of us, the dim glow of the moon illuminated the green pastures that populated the cliff. Atop it, I could make out the towering silhouette of the lighthouse. And behind it, endless dark sea. No wonder the Romans dubbed this region as Finisterre, the end of the earth.

Amidst this dismal landscape, my mind began to wander. When I was just a kid, the postman went missing. One evening he went to take out the trash, and he just didn’t come back. His wife reported him as missing to the police that same night. They did a thorough investigation, but nothing was found. Until a few days later, when his body washed up on the shore a few miles east. It was mangled and bruised, but the cause of death was determined to be drowning. The authorities ruled it out as a suicide, believing that he chose to end his life by jumping off the lighthouse’s cliff. However, most of those who knew him were skeptical of that theory.

“You alright there man? You look like a sad puppy,” Gonzalo brought me back to reality. “Yeah, just thinking,” I replied. “Always thinking,” he chortled. I let out a nervous chuckle in reply. I told myself I had just creeped myself out thinking about the missing person cases. But, deep down I knew every part of my being was telling me not to step a foot closer to that lighthouse. Despite this, I pressed on forward. We were about to reach the gate of the building when, suddenly, a blood-curdling scream pierced through the night like a needle through our eardrums. It came from the lighthouse.

I saw Gonzalo run towards the door and I ran to the window and he began to slam his body against the door and I couldn’t make out anything inside so I joined him and we kept on tackling it until we heard a crack and then it fell down and I fell inside with it he quickly made his way inside while I got up and we and shone our flashlights and… nothing.

The first floor was empty. It was decently sized, we were in the living quarters after all, but it smelled like fresh air hadn’t graced those stone walls in decades. The place was full of litter. Old tin cans, worn down plastic wrappers, glass bottles of diverse origin, and the like. There was an old dilapidated armchair in the back. You could tell it used to be light green, but now it was completely covered in grime. Made sense, the air was filled with dust particles. Looking at the beams of light our phones projected, it seemed like it was snowing inside. Then, in the east lay a wardrobe that had been devoured by woodworm and towards the center there was a small puddle. Nothing else. Except for a metal ladder next to the puddle that led to the second floor.

Now that the adrenaline rush was over, I took a closer look at my surroundings. Through the gloom, I discerned a black looming figure staring at me from the darkest corner of the room. So tall it almost reached the ceiling. I pointed my flashlight that way. Nothing. But when the light shone on the armchair, it looked like someone was creeping behind it. A grinning face hiding behind the back of the chair, gripping it with its claw-like fingers.

My imagination was playing tricks on me, and I deeply regretted having gone inside. However, worse was that it sounded like someone had just been murdered where we were standing. And yet, the place looked undisturbed. How could it be? Where was the victim? And the murderer? What if he was hiding in the wardrobe? What if it was a way to lure victims inside? I wanted to get out.

“It definitely came from the first floor,” Gonzalo whispered, breaking the deafening silence that had engulfed us.

I nodded. “We need to get the hell out of here and call the police.” We wearily started walking backwards, with our eyes looking inside at all times, vigilant. Once we were out, I dialed the emergency services while we quickly advanced along the dirt trail back to our town. The man on the phone told me the police would take around half an hour to arrive, and asked us to wait for them along the footpath that headed to the lighthouse.

I told Gonzalo what the operator had said to me, and after a brief moment we both stopped walking, seemingly in unison. For some reason, we began staring at the lighthouse, barely visible in the night. “About what you were saying earlier”, Gonzalo spoke up, “I think the previous mayor agreed with you when he shut down the lighthouse. There wasn’t really any reason for it to be operational. There’s barely any sea traffic here, and the coastline isn’t even dangerous. I guess the people of yore must have had a reason to build it.”

Right after those words left his mouth, another harrowing scream emanated from that accursed place. “That woman doesn’t have thirty minutes”, he blurted out as he left my side and began to run back up the path.

“What are you doing?!” I shouted. “She needs help!” he yelled back. “You stay there and wait for the police like the operator said.”

“What the fuck are you doing?! It’s dangerous! Come back!” I repeated. But he couldn’t hear me anymore. Or he ignored me. Either way, he kept running towards the lighthouse.

As his silhouette got lost in the inky darkness, I was left alone in the middle of the trail. The light of my phone’s flashlight didn’t reach far. All I could see was grass gently swaying with the wind on both sides of the path, and in the back the familiar shape of the lighthouse looking over me.

I didn’t know what to do. On the one hand, I couldn’t let him go alone. What if he got hurt? We had no idea what was going on in there. But, on the other hand, I was scared. I was terrified. I wanted to run home and leave Gonzalo behind so badly. I hated myself for that thought. And I hated him for going back to that lighthouse. Why couldn’t I be braver like him?

The truth is, I did know what to do. I knew from the start. Of course I was going to stay put. I was a coward. So, I told myself I was making the decision to stay because I had to wait for the police like he said.

And then, again prompted by the situation, I began to reminisce. Another woman also drowned before I was born. She was a street cleaner who worked the graveyard shift. Same as the postman, one night she just vanished. However, she was found just a day later in the thicket behind town. Her body lay dead beneath a tree, her lungs filled with seawater. Drowned in dry land.

This time, however, what brought me back was the sound of thunder in the distance. A light drizzle followed. I didn’t know it was going to rain tonight. While I was pacing towards a nearby lone oak to take shelter, yet another scream deafened the calming sound of rolling tides and oscillating blades of grass. But. now, it wasn’t a woman’s scream. It was a man’s. It was Gonzalo’s.

I quickly turned to face the lighthouse. That black spire against the sea. Now it wasn’t just a random lady screaming. It was my friend. I needed to go help him. I took a couple of steps towards it and stopped. The noise of the thousands of thoughts rushing through my head. It felt like the silent night was howling at me.

I imagined countless scenarios. Knives. Flesh. Blood everywhere. Each made my heart race even more. I was paralyzed inside my head. Water droplets hit my face. Frigid stings. My eyes swelled up with tears. I had to help him but I couldn’t.

But then an image flashed in my head. Him rushing towards the lighthouse in aid of a woman we didn’t even know. I wished I could do that, I wish I could be so bold. And now, when it was him who needed help, I wasn’t going to do anything. Rage began to smolder in my chest.

“No. Stop fucking wishing and do something” The heating fire spread throughout my torso. Rage turned into determination. “Just do it” I muttered as I began to strenuously lift the feet that felt like they had been anchored in the open sea.

Flashlight in hand, I crossed through the gate. I swung my phone frantically around the first floor to try and locate Gonzalo. Or anything that explained the screams. But it was as undisturbed as moments ago. Some old furniture and a ladder in the center. So, the rush of adrenaline powered me forward. My feet splashed against the puddle I had to step on to reach the stairs. Climbing up the ladder, I could hear that the rain outside had become a downpour. Raindrops barraged the walls of the lighthouse in tempestuous warfare.

I reached the second floor and shined my flashlight around. The kitchen. Rusty pots and pans lay next to an old wood-burning cooking stove. Gonzalo wasn’t here. It was barren aside from that. I had entered the tower. The modern part of the lighthouse. A spine of rusty vertebrae coiled around the spire. Stairs I raced to climb.

I put my foot down on the first step and nearly slipped. The stairs were wet, soaking wet. Had the rain gotten inside? How? I scanned the room again and found that the only window on this floor looked tightly shut. However, I also noticed a trail of moisture leading from the ladder to the spiral stairs that I had missed before. Perplexed, I resumed quickly advancing up.

Beneath the deafening sound of the storm outside, I could make out another noise. Bangs on a wall. Although infrequently, something was definitely crashing against the walls at the top of the building. And it wasn’t rhythmic, it didn’t follow any pattern. The bangs seemed to be random. This didn’t deter me. It only added wood to the fire.

I passed the third floor. I did a sweep of the room. Gonzalo wasn’t here either. So I kept speedily moving up. The stairs were still drenched. And another sound was added to the concoction in my ears. Everytime there was a bang, I could also pick up something else. A splash, like tides breaking at the shore. But it wasn’t coming from outside, it was coming from the lantern room.

It didn’t make any sense, where was Gonzalo? Where was the woman we had heard scream? This did unnerve me. It began to tear at my new found bravery, and I hesitated. “What the fuck?!” I muttered. In spite of this, I pressed on relentlessly towards the top of the lighthouse.

The splashes and bangs increased in intensity as I inched closer. I stepped foot into the lantern room at last. The atmosphere became thick and heavy. Immediately, I noticed that the sound of the tempest had become stronger, as the glass panes that surrounded the room to let the light shine through were shattered, and the pouring rain was getting in.

My light was pointing at the pillar in the center of the room. Embedded in it was a massive rusty light bulb. It didn’t let me see the other side of the room, but I could tell it was quite spacious for a lantern room. The pillar was just concrete, but it was soaked, and the lower half of it was stained a reddish tone. In the periphery of the beam of light my flashlight projected, I could see water, also colored something between red and pink. It reached around ankle height, which was oddly high given that there was barely any water where I was standing, just a few steps away.

I advanced to get around the pillar, and as I did so I could see the water level unnaturally rise, almost like a hillside of liquid. I followed the rising seawater with my flashlight until I reached the peak. A liquid mountain that was a meter away from reaching the ceiling. I couldn’t really make out what I was seeing with my torchlight, until the entire sky lit up for an instant.

Like the flash of a camera, the image I saw got engraved in my mind. In front of the broken glass panes of the lantern room, still water climbed up to a summit a couple of meters high. Crimson seawater, stained with blood and with some algae suspended inside. Close to the bottom I could make out the shape of feet or legs inside of the water. Contrarily, near the top, the liquid was a deep murky red that didn’t allow the light to shine through. But, there was something poking out. An arm. The sleeve soaked red. Bent the wrong way at the elbow. I could tell it was his arm.

The strike of lightning faded out and before I had time to react, I heard a gasp for air. I pointed my flashlight towards the sound and saw Gonzalo’s head peeking out of the crimson watery peak. His mouth agape, it was a gory mess of blood and seawater. Some teeth had been ripped out. He had a colossal bruise on the left side of his face. And, in between his locks of drenched jet black hair I could see his bloodshot eyes. He was looking at me. I had never seen so much terror in his gaze.

Immediately, the water shifted. It moved towards the broken panes, before quickly rushing in the other direction. A thunderous crash rang throughout the lantern room, the water had slammed against the pillar like a wave breaking at the cliff. Gonzalo screamed, his body colliding violently with the column.

I stood there, petrified. I physically couldn’t move forward to help him. My body wouldn’t let me get out of there either. I could only watch as the seawater receded as if pulled by the tide at shore, and then again thrusted with unnatural force towards the central column. This time, though, he didn’t scream. The water was so full of blood I couldn’t even see his body when the blob of liquid leaped out of the broken panes, carrying Gonzalo with it.

My momentary paralysis then inexplicably lifted, and I raced to the edge of the lantern room. I arrived just in time to observe through my flashlight how the scarlet seawater fell into the ocean, merging with it like the countless drops of rain. The blood quickly dispersed in between the turbulent waves and Gonzalo’s lifeless body plunged into the water, to be carried away by the current.

I stood there, observing the raging sea under the storm, mesmerized. I felt like I had just been in the presence of something powerful. Ancient and powerful. Primal. The bastard child of mother earth. I couldn’t have been the only one to witness it. All the people who went missing. They saw it too. They were its victims.

A force so old, it must have been here for centuries, millenniums, even eons. And the lighthouse. The people before us knew. They knew what was here. They didn’t build the lighthouse to aid ships in reaching the shore. It was a warning. Its sight heralded the presence of something that we weren’t made to understand. Because at Finisterre, the earth ends and the endless ocean begins. It doesn't belong to us, and never will.
