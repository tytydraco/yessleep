I’ve never been one to believe in the wild conspiracies of the world. Flat earth, lizard people, it all sounds like make believe nonsense to me. Even so, it’s clear to me that the government hides things from its population.

Take the disappearing train from 2021. Never heard of it? It’s pretty obscure. An entire train disappeared mid track, along with all of its thousands of passengers. Not a single person was recovered. The company who made the train were so beside themselves they made a replica train in the passengers’ honor. A sad story, but one with an uplifting ending. Unfortunately, it isn’t true.

I was in the train when it disappeared, and I was the only one to escape. Most of the people in the train have suffered from a horrible fate, but I hold out hope that some of them are not beyond saving.

I’m getting ahead of myself. My wife Delilah always told me that. She would say, “Ronald, you’re moving too fast. I can’t keep up with you!” which was her polite way of saying “Ronald, what the fuck are you talking about?” Usually she’d say it when I was explaining the rules to a game badly or telling a story that always turned into a rambling mess with no clear direction.

So, just this once, I’m going to structure my story. I don’t have much time, but this is important. Bear with me, but I need to start from the beginning.

We were crossing the countryside, going from Montana to my wife’s sister’s place who lives in Seattle. Her sister had never seen the baby, so Delilah was excited to show her. Her name was Roberta, but we called her Bobby. Little Bobby was the best girl in the world, and you can’t prove me otherwise.

Now, since Bobby was so young, she didn’t have to have her own seat, allowing her to sit in either Delilah’s lap or my lap. This was important because the train was PACKED. I never expected every single seat to be filled in a train in the year 2021. However, the price was such a bargain it didn’t raise alarm bells quite yet.

Bobby started crying the moment we left the station. I expected her to cry at some point, but immediately? A small part of me felt disappointed by it.

A man a few rows behind us said, “Oh, for heaven’s sake. You brought a child here?”

I’ve never encountered people who hate children before, though I’d heard that child haters exist. I just pretended to ignore him as Delilah helped the crying Bobby.

The man was old, and didn’t take care of himself. He had unkempt hair and didn’t shave. To be honest, he probably didn’t bathe himself either.

The man was dead serious. “If you want to get out of here alive and save everyone here, follow my instructions exactly.”

A feeling unlike anything I’ve felt before washed over me, and by the cries in the compartment, it was happening to everyone else. It was pure agony, like my insides were trying to come out of my body.

The man said, “If you had been standing up, you would have been killed instantly.”

Murmurs in the train car stirred. I didn’t want to believe him, but after that sickening feeling, I didn’t know what to believe. The man was still serious.

“Listen to me. If you want to save all of us, follow my instructions exactly.”

Who is this man?

“First, get out of your seat and grab your child and make him sit in your seat.”

I’m not giving up my seat to my newborn girl! I wanted to protest.

“Then, hide in the bathroom until the ticket collector comes in here. Quickly!”

I didn’t want to listen to the man, but also, I did have to use the bathroom, so I decided now would be an okay time to humor him.

I ran into the bathroom the moment the ticket collector opened the door. When the ticket collector asked for the baby's ticket, who was in my seat currently, Delilah handed him my ticket instead. I felt like I was committing a crime. A wave of guilt washed over me. Eventually, though, the ticket collector went away.

After the ticket collector closed the door, the man yelled, “Now, quickly! Get out and sit in your seat!”

The urgency in his voice compelled me to move forward and sit in my seat. I accidentally forgot about Bobby, who was still in my seat.

The moment I sat down, a wave of agony unlike anything I’ve ever experienced washed over me.

The man sighed. “The seat protects you. But, anyone whose ticket is collected by the ticket collector is tracked. If someone isn’t in their seat, they’ll search for you until they find you. They only give the okay when all tickets and seats are accounted for. Your newborn allowed the perfect cover for a stowaway.”

What is he talking about? Who’s they?

“Now, quickly. Get out of the train. Come back for us. We’ll be waiting.”

I looked out the window. There was a dark cloak of blackness outside. What was this? Whatever it was, we were no longer on Earth.

Instinctually, I decided to follow the man and open the door. Luckily, we were in the last compartment.

The door on the other end opened. “Stop right there!” Someone shouted.

I looked back and when I saw what was looking at me at the end of the door, I jumped. Jumping out of a still-moving train was terrifying, but one look at that thing that spoke to me was all the justification I needed. It had the same voice as the ticket collector from earlier, but that was most certainly not the ticket collector.

And it was definitely not human.
