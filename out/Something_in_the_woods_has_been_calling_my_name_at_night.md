I never counted myself much of an outdoors man.A city boy,born and bred,that’s me.Up until a few months ago I’d never even set foot in a forest,and I would’ve kept it that way had I not been forced out of my previous life.You see,I was a factory worker until recently.Worked half my life in that damn place,until I got myself into a bit of an accident with some heavy machinery.I’ll spare you the details,but let's just say my leg’s barely good enough to stand on now,let alone to support the heavy lifting and running around my old job required.So yeah,I not only got sacked,but I also had a four digit hospital bill to cover.I started looking for a job as soon as I got out of the hospital,but as you might imagine the employment market isn’t exactly teeming with opportunities for a guy with nothing but a busted leg and a high-school diploma to his name.That’s why  when my phone rung with an offer,I agreed no questions asked.The job,regretably,turned out to be a posting as a security guard in,you guessed it,a stretch of forest in the middle of buck-fuck nowhere.More specifically,I’m guarding this half-built mountain resort.Eventually,this place will have everything-five star spa,ski lift,horse base etc.,but right now its just a skeleton of a building and a bunch of construction materials lying around.Construction’s been halted for a few months now because,according to some research I did on the place,the legality of the whole thing is…contested.  
  
Anyway,my first day at the job was weird..After my boss’ chauffeur drove me to the place ,I was introduced to the man that would be my coworker-Louie.After giving me a quick tour of the compound and explaining the way shifts worked(me,him and another guy would run 24 hour shifts,with two days of rest in-between) he gave me the keys to the security booth and invited me inside,It smelled like cigarettes and the white walls reminded me of the hospital,but it was spacious enough and at least it was warm.While Louie was packing his bag to leave,I tried to strike up  a conversation  
‘’So…you get any wild animals up here?’’  
‘’Oh yeah,plenty.Keep your eyes on the trail monitors and you’ll likely see some deer tonight.””  
The booth had about a dozen monitors,each showing the feed of cameras placed on the site ,some of which were placed on top of the huge metal fence surrounding the place and were looking toward the woods.  
“”How about anything dangerous?Like wolves,bears maybe?’’  
Louie seemed to go quiet for a bit,his face going taut.  
‘’There’s..thing’s out there for sure.But you don’t gotta worry about the wildlife-this fence will stop anything short of an elephant stampede.It’ll mostly be just rabbits scaring the shit out of you when they cross the motion-cameras ,anyway .’’He gave a nervous chuckle,but I could tell something was still bothering him.  
“Well,I sure could use a rabbit’s foot right now!”,I said,shaking my bad leg.It was a dumb joke to lighten the mood,but Louie did not seem to appreciate it.   
‘’Listen,’’he picked up again,clearly uncomfortable.’’I gotta tell you something,cus  I promised the guy I took this job from’’He took a deep breath and looked me dead in the eye.  
‘’If you start hearing your name,like if something starts calling your name at night-you gotta quit,’’  
From the way he said it,I could tell this wasn’t a ‘’prank the new guy’’ type thing.Still,I was very confused.  
“What…what the hell does that mean?”  
“Just promise you’ll do it,okay?It's sort of like an agreement between everyone who’s worked here.”  
Still confused,and a bit freaked out,I said “Sure Louie..sure”.  
“Good.See you next shift.”  
He gave a nod and left,leaving me the only human in the area for miles after he drove off.  
Night came fast,and despite my best efforts,I nodded off at about two AM.The beep of one of the motion cameras detecting something jolted me awake.  
This was the first time I got a feel for how this place was really like.  
Frantically looking across the monitors to see which camera it had been,I saw something moving across the cameras around the fence.It was dark,and the feed was black and white,so I couldn’t recognise it until it stopped right  in front of the gate.  
A wolf.It was my first time seeing one,so I was more excited than scared.Until I saw what it was holding in its mouth.  
The rabbit was still alive and struggling,as the wolf had bitten on the skin over its back.From what I had heard,wolves don’t play with their food,so I found this weird.What happened next was much weirder.  
The thing dropped the rabbit,then pinned it down against the ground with its front paws.For some reason the audio feed on the video doorbell at the gate turned on,so I could hear the rabbit's squeals of pain.I also heard the tearing of skin and sinew when the wolf bit on its leg and tore it off.It then walked away from its prey,closer towards the fence.Then,and I swear this on my mother,it looked right into the camera,right into my eyes,and tossed the rabbit’s foot over the fence with a shake off its head.I shivered all the way until the thing left the field of view of the cameras.The rabbit,dying and squealing,stayed on the trail in front of the gate until the sun came up,when I finally mustered up the courage to go out and throw it in the dumpster for the construction rubble.  
  
The guy switching with me couldn’t come fast enough.When he came in ,he scanned me with a knowing look in his eyes and chased me out of the booth without even introducing himsel.fAs you can imagine,I debated with myself whether to come back  for the next shift  on the way home.Then the chauffeur handed me my check,  
It would not only be enough to pay the hospital bills,it could also get me some rehab therapy,maybe make my leg right again.  
  
When I came in for the next shift,I didn’t tell Louie what had happened.I just took my place in the security booth seat.We made some small talk again while he was packing up.Louie came into work with his own car,so he could afford to idle a bit after his shift,as there was no chauffeur waiting for him.  
“So…Greg told me you looked quite shaken up when he came in.’’he said while smoking out the booth’s window.’’  
‘’Yeah…Don’t feel like talking about it though.’’  
“‘Uh-huh.Sharing usually makes it worse.Its why me and the wife don’t talk no more.”’  
This caused me to turn to him shocked.  
“‘You mean… about the job  or…”  
“ In general.I came home after a…pretty bad night.Told her what had happened  
She wanted me to quit.I wouldn’t.She lives with her mom now.”  
He took a long puff of his cigarette,then went quiet again.  
“Louie…why didn’t you quit?” I asked,hoping his answer would strengthen my own resolve.  
He put his cigarette out on the window pan and,on his way out ,said  
“My kid started college last year.My other kid started chemo this summer.See you next shift.”  
His words stayed with me long after the sound of his beat-up hatchback faded in the distance.  
Nothing happened during the day.A few of the motion cameras freaked out a few times for no reason,but I think that's pretty common.When night fell,I locked my door and turned on the electricity running through the fence.The security measures were a bit extreme for something in the middle of nowhere,I know,but hey,rich people are paranoid. And ,well,I sure was thankful for them.I waited with baited breath for something to happen.but as the hours passed,nothing did.  
1 AM,2 AM,nothing but the sound of crickets and the occasional hoot of an owl.Even at 3 AM,when I was at  my most scared nothing occured.I almost nodded off again,but forced myself awake with an energy drink.I was actually getting bored and my mind started wandering .I remembered Louie talking about deer and found myself wishing to see one,as I never had  before and they’d always seemed like such noble creatures.A loud rustling sound brought me back to reality.Here it comes,I thought,clenching my fists and looking at the monitors.Something was moving across the cameras again,but much larger this time.  
It was a bear.A big ‘ol bastard.And it was scared shitless.It was running so fast that I was able to make it out only because it damn near tripped over itself  across one of the cameras.Now I was the one scared.Was the wolf back?But why would a  600 pound bear be scared of a single wolf?  
Anyway,as the grizzly disappeared into the woods, something else started setting of the cameras.I tensed up,my hand clutching the taser,the only means of self-defense we were permitted,in a white-knuckled grip.When the motion-activated light on top of the gate tuned on I saw what had gotten the bear so scared.  
It was a deer.I breathed a sigh of relief,leaving the taser back on the table.I looked to the monitor again,as I wanted to admire the animal,but then I noticed something weird.The deer was moving in a weird way-stilted,like it had suffered some head trauma or something.It walked to the gate and looked at the camera .  
“Oh ,god.Oh god not again.”is the last coherent thought I had that night.  
The deer…started slamming its head against the tree nearest to the gate .Not like it was  scratching its antlers or anything,it was just…hitting itself.  
Thwump  
The god-forsaken doorbel’s audio turned on again.  
Thwump  
I could see pieces of broken antlers cartwheeling through the air as that second hit caved its skull in.  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
I tried to turn the sound off but couldn’t.  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
I wanted to cover or close my eyes,but was scared to let that thing out of my sight.  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
Thwump  
The top of its head was nothing but a mess of bloody pulp and shards of bone by the time it was done.With one of its eyes dangling out of its socket,it turned  towards the camera again.  
And it smiled at me.Not at the camera-at me.Then it slumped to the side and dropped dead.  
Me and Greg threw it in the nearby river the next morning,as we figured the smell would be too bad if we left it in the dumpster.  
I don’t sleep at work anymore.Don’t sleep much at home either.  
The next few weeks were a blur of physical  rehab therapy sessions,friendly conversations with Louie and Greg,and uncomfortably long and hot nights in the booth.Things were surprisingly calm at work for a time.Well,not calm-there would be weird noises,flashes of eerie light deep in the woods occasionally,a flock of dead birds dropped out of the sky once,but nothing as bad as the first two nights.  
That is,until I got a middle of the night call from Louie.  
‘’You gotta come in here,man.please,I have to get outta here.”’  
It was one of the rare nights where I had managed to fall asleep,so it took me some time to catch what he was saying.  
“Louie…wait ,what?It's Greg’s turn tomorrow.I’m at home.  
“Greg’s not picking up.Please.It…its calling my name.For hours now.Please…”  
I was all the way awake now.  
“Sure,sure,alright,I can be there in an hour and a half.”  
“Thank you.Thank you so much.Oh god…I’ll keep the gate locked.Ring me when you’re close.”  
He sounded like he was about to cry.Poor Louie,I thought.Poor me…  
My car was less than fit for braving the rocky roads leading to the construction site,but I made it,albeit at the cost of my front bumper.  
Louie didn't stay for chit chat this time.After unlocking the gate,he got straight  into his car and drove away,faster than you would assume a beat-up hatchback could go.  
.I brewed myself some coffee and ate the leftovers I had hurriedly picked  up off of the kitchen table to distract myself from the fact that I was alone  and in this place again.  
As I was steeling myself,telling myself that it was only  a few hours until Greg would come in,the motion sensor at the gate gave a beep.Preparing myself for whatever horror this shithole had in store for me this time,I saw…Louie.He was on foot ,waving at the camera.  
“I forgot my hat,” he said.  
True enough,his hat,with his town’s local football team logo, was propped  on the back of the chair.I reached for the button that opens the gate but,and I thank god every day for this,I stopped myself.There was something wrong with Louie.He was fidgeting in place,incessantly tapping his foot-a far cry from his usual tired old- man self.And the way he spoke was..weird,like he was chewing the words up as he was saying them.  
“I forgo-ot my ha-at’’was more like it  
“I’m just imagining it”I thought”Or he’s just tired.’’Still,I  turned on the microphone connected to the doorbell to ask.  
‘’Louie,...where’s your car?”  
He did not respond.  
“Just-t open the doo-or”  
He was visibly struggling to get the words out,and also seemed incapable of standing still-rolling his shoulders,turning his head,still tapping his foot.  
‘’What if he’s having a seizure or something” I thought.God knows what so much stress could do to an old guy like him.I reached for the microphone when I noticed something weird.See,aside from the regular cameras,the fence also has thermal sensors.When an animal or person walks in front of one,a little red light starts blinking in the corner of the monitor.The monitor showing the front of the gate,the one I was looking at Louie on,was not picking up anything.I quickly switched to full thermal view and…Louie was gray,no heat at all,like a tree,or a rock…or a corpse.  
“I’m not opening the gate Louie”I said,my voice shaky, through the microphone.”I’m sorry.’’  
He did not respond.He just looked at the camera and leered at me.It was not a smile that belonged on Louie’s face.On any human’s face.He…It then reached for the gate.Now,I want you to know that the gate is heavy,like rally heavy.It would probably take three or four grown men to force it open even a little,without the help of the button in the booth.  
This thing,by itself and with its bare hands,almost opened it  enough to pass through in a couple seconds.I grabbed the taser,not knowing what the hell I would even do with it-it would take a lot more than a few volts to stop something that could do that to a metal door.And then it hit me-Louie had turned off the electric fence before leaving.Just as the thing was squeezing through the opening,I turned on the electricity.The current traveled to the iron door…and onto ‘’Louie’.It threw him back,almost outside the view of the camera.  
Thing is,that fence was built to keep bears and such out,so as to protect the horses which would eventually be shipped into the horse base portion of the resort.For humans,even a quick brush against it might be enough to put you out.’’Louie,who had taken the current directly ,laid on the ground for a couple seconds, and then stood up like nothing had happened,aside from some serious burns on his hands and face.  
With a jerking motion,he swung his body to the frontal camera.  
“Se-e y-you nex-xt shif-ft”’ is the last thing I ever heard from Louie.He turned around and,half- walking half-dragging himself,disappeared into the woods.  
They never found a body. His car was found crashed  against a tree a little ways from the site.  
I would’ve quit after this,I really would’ve.But they raised our pay when me and Greg said we were gonna resign,and my physician said I might make a full recovery if I kept doing the rehab therapyBesides,I haven’t heard my name being called yet.I did hear someone whisper a nickname my dad used to call me when he was alive ,but that doesn’t count,right?  
Right?
