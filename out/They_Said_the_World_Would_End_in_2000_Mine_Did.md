They said the world was going to end in the year 2000.

Even up here, in Russia, people believed it. Not everyone, of course. But enough. They called it Y2K. Some Western computer bug that would make satellites fall, erase bank accounts, and send missiles launching themselves from silos out in the Urals. I remember watching a segment on Channel One where a serious man in a cheap suit said that toasters might start fires, and that planes could simply drop from the sky. I was seventeen then, full of cigarettes and borrowed confidence. I obviously thought the whole thing was bullshit. But my mother, God rest her, filled the pantry with tinned meat and pickled cabbage like we were going back to siege times. My uncle Georgi, who never trusted anything with wires, buried his savings in vodka bottles out behind the woodshed. In Moscow, there were lines for kerosene heaters. Priests gave televised blessings to entire apartment blocks.

And then... nothing. January 1st came, and the world kept turning. The lights stayed on. The missiles stayed put. Even the ancient computers at the train station kept blinking like they always did, their green letters shimmering like insects. We all laughed. Shrugged. Opened our windows to let in the frozen air and the smell of fireworks. “See?” we said. “It was all nonsense.”

But the laughter didn’t last. Not for long.

It was three days into the new year when the thing appeared in the sky above our sleepy town. No one saw it arrive.  It was just *there* one morning, hanging silently above the treetops. It was like it had always been there, like it had *grown* there, bloated and black against the pale winter sky. We thought it was a blimp at first. Maybe some kind of military zeppelin — a leftover Soviet experiment, finally trotted out for some reason none of us could understand. But the longer you looked at it, the harder it was to believe it had anything to do with us at all.

It was too big.

Not just big like a plane. Not even big like a stadium or a battleship. It stretched from one edge of the woods to the other, blotting out half the sun as it hung motionless above our homes. It didn’t move. Didn’t spin. It just *hovered*, utterly still, its underbelly a smooth, seamless black. Not metal. Not matte. More like glass held just above freezing. Dark, silent. Impossibly still. It felt wrong. It was as if the sky had been peeled back and something huge was pressing through from the other side. People gathered on the snow-covered streets in their winter coats and hats, pointing, squinting. We all just stood there, staring up like cavemen seeing an airplane for the first time.   
  
And then it spoke.  
  
There was no warning. No radio disturbance, no hum of speakers warming up. Just suddenly, this voice. Not from above or around. It was everywhere. Inside your teeth, behind your eyes, in the base of your fucking spine. Deep, low. Metallic. A single command, booming and cold as the wind outside:

**“Return to your homes.”**

Some people screamed. Most just froze. It sounded like a god was speaking to us. My mother clutched her chest. My uncle Georgi dropped his thermos into the pile of snow at our doorstep. It came again, even more booming, to the point that I could feel it echo inside my skull:

**“Return to your homes.”**  
  
Most of us glanced at one other, our breath fogging in the freezing air. We didn’t say a word. We didn’t need to. That deep, gnawing certainty that something was very wrong was evident on each of our faces. A few decided not to listen. Maybe they couldn’t accept what they were seeing. Maybe they needed to prove it wasn’t real, that it was some kind of illusion. A trick of light, a military drill gone wrong — *anything* but whatever *this*… was. Or maybe they were just the kind of people who, when faced with something unimaginable, endeavored to step forward instead of back.   
  
Brave, maybe. But more likely: stupid.

They started walking toward the tree line. Two men, a teenage girl, and someone’s grandmother I recognized by her limp. They hadn’t taken more than ten steps before it happened. From underneath the pitch black shape, something flashed. Not a beam. At least, not at first. It was just a flicker, like a camera flash in reverse. The light sucked in, and then…  
  
**Crack.**  
  
Imagine the sound of thunder, but somehow underwater. That’s the closest thing I can think of to describe it. They didn’t scream. They didn’t get the chance. They just dropped. All four of them. Limbs twisted. Heads gone. The snow around them went red. We all held our collective gasps. I heard someone whimper behind me. Or maybe it was me. I don’t remember.  And then, silence again. The giant flying machine, or whatever the hell it was, didn’t move. 

None of us did either.

We turned and went back to our homes.

For a little while, we thought maybe the rest of the world would come for us. We still had power then. Heat. Lights. The old television still worked, though nothing on it about hostile, hovering aircrafts occupying the skies of northern Russia. Channel One was showing a cooking program the morning after the killings, cheerful and oblivious. We switched through every channel, every frequency we could reach. Static. Reruns. Cartoons. A few looped broadcasts of weather updates for cities that weren't ours. One man on some fringe station mentioned a “brief satellite anomaly” but that was it. The feed cut halfway through his subsequent sentence and never came back.

And then, the lights went out. No buzz, no flicker, no surge. Just gone.

The heaters shut down. The refrigerator stopped humming. We were drenched in sudden, freezing darkness. You could hear the walls creak as the cold began to slip its fingers into every corner of the house. My mother went to the window and pulled the curtain back with a hand that was already shaking.

It was still there.

Its scale never got easier to understand. My mind kept trying to shrink it, to make it *make sense*. But it couldn’t. It was too big for that. Bigger than anything humans were supposed to be able to make. It wasn’t just *above* the town, it was *over* it. A lid over a pot. Round, smooth, almost gentle in its shape. Half of it disappeared into the clouds, which parted and curled around it like smoke. At times, it reminded me of an enormous black egg, pressing down against the firmament, as if the sky itself was straining to lay the damn thing. It gave off no glow, no signal, no gleam of acknowledgment that it even noticed us. And that, I think, was the worst part. It didn’t look angry. It looked… patient.   
  
Days passed. Then weeks. People kept to their homes. No one had to say the quiet part out loud: we all remembered what had happened to the first four who stepped out of line. But eventually, as strange as it might sound, we kind of got used to it. The voice didn’t come back. There were no further announcements or warning lights. People inevitably got bolder.  
  
First, a few children wandered into the yards. Then a neighbor swept snow off his steps. Then someone started hauling water from the old well behind the post office.   
  
And nothing happened.   
  
We were afraid, yes, but you can only keep people cooped up for so long before they get tired of waiting for permission. Soon, the streets were full again. Not bustling, but alive. Quiet movements. Nervous conversations. Shovels scraping. Cans being traded.

And then, the stories started.

Rumors passed over fences and under doors. Someone said a teenager from the outskirts tried to hike through the woods toward the main road. He made it almost a kilometer in before the light came. Another said it was a hunter this time, one of the old fossils who still kept snares in the trees. His dog came back without him, shivering and half-mad, soaked in blood that wasn’t its own.

But eventually, they stopped being rumors.

We started seeing it.

Every time someone strayed too far, too deep into the woods or too far out past the town’s edge, the beam would come. No warning. Just a flicker. A sound like thunder cracking underwater. And then, silence again. Nothing left but a name for us to whisper behind closed doors. It didn’t seem to matter why you went, or who you were. The boundary was invisible, but real; an imaginary fence built by something that didn’t care if we understood the rules, only that we obeyed them.   
  
Really, what choice did we have? We lit fires. We rationed what supplies we had left. We walked circles around a town we could no longer leave. And all the while, the thing above us watched. If it was even watching at all. Maybe it was just waiting. For what, though, none of us could even begin to guess.   
  
It didn’t take long for my uncle to snap into full conspiracy mode.  He started talking about government experiments, alien invasions, divine punishment. Whatever theory fit the day. Normally, I’d have laughed at him. Called him a drunk or a nutcase. But given the circumstances, I couldn’t blame him, even if his ramblings weren’t helping alleviate tensions.   
  
Because the fact was... none of us had answers. In the vacuum of overwhelming certainty, anything started to sound believable. Even the crazy stuff. Fuck, *especially* the crazy stuff.

Then one night, maybe a full month in, I saw something fall.

I was sitting at the window like I usually did, smoking what passed for a cigarette and just watching the thing. It hung there in the sky like some colossal black tumor nestled in the stars, bigger than it had any right to be. I wasn’t expecting anything to happen. Hell, I wasn’t even really awake. Just caught in that exhausted trance we all seemed to live in by then. And then, I saw something small, something glowing*,* detach from the bottom of it. It was faint, pale blue. It drifted downward in a slow, unnatural arc, too gradual to be a flare, too quiet to be a drone. I watched it sink behind the rooftops on the far side of town, over near the old lumber yard. What was left of it, anyway.

I didn’t wake my mother. Didn’t tell Georgi. Didn’t even go outside. I just stubbed out the cigarette and went to bed. I don't know why. Maybe some part of me already knew that whatever it was, I didn’t want to understand it. 

After that, things changed.   
  
Yelena, my neighbor, used to talk the paint off the walls. You couldn’t check the mailbox without getting a ten-minute recap of her week, her ailments, her sister’s awful new boyfriend in Novosibirsk. Then, one day, she just randomly stopped coming out. Didn’t wave. Didn’t smile. Just stood behind her living room window, day after day, eyes fixed upward, mouth slightly agape. I waved to her once. She didn’t even blink.  
  
And then there was Pavel, the pharmacist. A kind man. Soft-spoken, always smelled faintly of peppermint and rubbing alcohol. One morning, I saw him crouched in the snow outside his shop, drawing in the slush with a stick. At first I thought it was a game, maybe something for the neighborhood kids. But when I looked closer, the shapes were all… wrong. Big, looping spirals. Jagged grids. Crooked boxes nested inside one another like matryoshkas dolls, only they didn’t fit together right. When I asked him what he was doing, he didn’t even look at me. Just kept whispering under his breath and drawing like it was the only thing keeping him warm.

The strange behavior didn’t stop with Yelena and Pavel. If anything, it spread.

At first, it was subtle. People were quieter in general. They started forgetting things, sometimes staring off at nothing for whole minutes before snapping back to the present. There was this eerie stillness, like the whole town had been gently sedated. I once watched a man walk into the middle of the square and just stand there with his arms hanging loose at his sides, lips moving in slow, silent repetition. Marina from the bakery stopped baking altogether and instead started organizing her shelves by color and shape. The entire front of her shop became this mad little mosaic of flour bags and canned goods, like some deranged art installation. And no one said a word. The madness was quiet, not violent. It was as if something was rewiring us from the inside, one synapse at a time.

Then the disappearances started.

A boy from the northern blocks didn’t come home. His mother wandered the streets asking if anyone had seen him, but her voice sounded distant, like she didn’t really expect an answer. A day later, the ice over the nearby lake broke, but there was no body. Just his scarf hanging over the frozen reeds, clean and dry. Still, no one panicked. No one rioted or rallied or stormed the woods with torches. We didn’t know what we were up against, and that made it easier to pretend we weren’t up against anything at all.

Until the day I saw it.

It wasn’t night, or some foggy, cinematic hour. It was noon. The kind of dull, brittle daylight you only get up north, where everything feels sharp and colorless. I’d gone out to fetch fuel for the generator. My uncle had gone missing earlier that morning, and I needed something to do besides sit there waiting for the worst.

That’s when I found him.

Behind the shed, near the old, dried-up riverbed, along with something… else. At first, I thought it was a deer. Maybe a moose. Something large and hunched over the snow, with a crown of tangled shapes rising from its back, or maybe its head, it was hard to tell from the angle. Antlers, I figured. Misshapen, maybe frostbitten. Something wild and possibly injured. That was my first thought.

But then it moved, and I realized it couldn’t be any animal I knew. It didn’t jerk or flinch or shiver against the cold. It *unfolded*. Smooth. Purposeful. Like a piece of furniture being opened by invisible hands. The limbs, if that’s what they were, uncoiled from themselves with a kind of mechanical grace, joints clicking softly in the quiet. It was too fluent, too deliberate. It seemed to operate on pure, raw efficiency. It was crouched over something. At first, I couldn’t tell what. Just a shape, slumped and pale against the snow. But as the thing shifted, one of its many tendrils retracting with a subtle whirr, I saw the face. 

I saw my *uncle’s* face.

He was lying on his back, stiff as a board, eyes wide open and bloodshot. His mouth twitched, ever so slightly, and something — *several* somethings — were feeding into his nose. Cables. Thin, twitching lengths of metal, like worms made of piano wire. They pulsed faintly as they pushed in and out of him, threading deeper into his skull with this slow, grotesque rhythm. There was no blood. Not much, anyway. Just a little crust around the nostrils. Like a bad nosebleed. His chest rose and fell rapidly. The muscles in his jaw spasmed every few seconds, as if something inside him was shorting out. The thing straddling him looked almost bored. Or maybe that was just me, trying to assign human logic to something that clearly wasn’t human. Not even close. 

It didn’t look like a spider. Not exactly. Vaguely arachnoid, to put it charitably, and even that’s not a good description. Spiders make *sense.* They have symmetry. Form. This thing had too many legs, and not enough structure. Each of its limbs ended in something different, one with claws, one with pincers, one with a needle-thin filament that vibrated so fast I could hear it hum. Another was tipped with a flat disc that pressed itself to Georgi’s temple and rotated, slow and wet, like it was polishing bone. It only barely had a center, which was just a cluster of moving parts wrapped in plating that rippled like muscle, its surface studded with little blinking nodes. Not eyes. Sensors, maybe. Or cameras. Or something worse.

It didn’t notice me at first. Or maybe it did, and simply didn’t care. It lingered over Georgi a moment longer, one of its finer instruments twitching once at the edge of his nostril before withdrawing, slick and shining with something I didn’t want to identify.

Then, just like that, it pulled back.

All of its wires slithered free with a wet sound, the kind that made my stomach turn. Georgi’s body shuddered once, just once, then fell still. The thing rose. Not with any kind of organic effort or strain, but like a puppet suspended upright by strings. Its limbs unfolded fully now, revealing their full, mind-numbing complexity. Some bent in ways that made no physical sense. Others hovered inches above the snow, flexing and recalibrating mid-air as though gravity were optional.

And then it turned. Or rather, it reoriented. The cluster of its core pivoted with a series of soft whirrs and clicks, and suddenly, all those little blinking sensors were facing me. Focusing.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. I thought maybe if I stayed still, it would lose interest. But something from within it rippled across its exposed circuitry, and the thing started moving toward me. Its limbs touched down in a sequence that defied rhythm, each “step” out of sync with the next. They struck the ground in patterns that didn’t match. Some of its appendages sank into the snow and stayed rooted there. Others flitted and scraped through the air, twitching like antennae, dragging along the side of the shed with enough force to gouge deep, splintered grooves in the wood.  
  
I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. As soon as I realized I was its next target, I turned and bolted, boots skidding on the icy path leading back to the house. Branches slapped my face. Snow flew up around my legs. My lungs burned, but I didn’t stop. The house was maybe thirty meters away, but it felt like a continent. I slammed against the back door, yanked it open with numb fingers, and threw myself inside. The door didn’t close all the way behind me. There was no time to fix that. I ran through the narrow hallway, feet thudding on the warped wooden floor, heart punching at my ribs. I almost called out for my mother but stopped myself. What would I say? What could I say?

Then I noticed her already standing there. 

She was in the front room, just at the edge of the kitchen. Her arms were at her sides, palms open. She looked eerily calm, though her eyes momentarily flicked toward the corridor behind me. Her breath fogged gently in the cold air, as if she hadn’t even noticed how frigid our home had become. I opened my mouth to warn her, but she raised her hand.

“It’s alright,” she said, voice strangely serene. “It’s just here for you.”

Just here for me.

I backed away, heart thudding now not from fear, but disbelief. She wasn’t joking. There was no panic in her voice. No tension in her posture. Just quiet acceptance, as if she were introducing an old friend who’d shown up without calling first.

Behind me, the door creaked wider.

I didn’t look. I didn’t want to see it inside the house. Instead, I turned and ran again, this time down the crooked steps into the basement, where the cold was deeper, older. I slammed the door shut behind me and slid the heavy bolt across. It stuck halfway, but I forced it, grinding metal against wood until it clicked into place. The uncaring blackness swallowed me whole. I stood still for a long moment, waiting to hear the sound of it descending the stairs after me. But the silence held. There were only the faint creaks of the floorboards above and the wind outside, brushing against the eaves like distant breathing.

In the dim light leaking through the slatted basement window, I found the old shelves where we kept the winter stores. Cans of beans and stew. Glass jars of pickled mushrooms and cabbage. Bottles of cloudy water, some frozen solid. I pulled a blanket down from the pile in the corner, wrapped it around myself, and sat on the freezing concrete floor. Might as well get comfortable, I figured.

Days passed. Then weeks.

I didn’t leave. When the bottled one ran out, I collected meltwater from the corner where ice crept in through the broken windowpane. I ate from dented tins with my fingers, no longer caring if the contents were congealed or expired. Sleep came in fits. My dreams were scattered, full of metal limbs and red lights blinking just behind my eyelids. Sometimes I thought I could still hear it moving upstairs; slow mechanical steps tracing circles above my head. Sometimes I imagined my mother’s voice, calling me softly, as if to let me know that dinner was ready. But mostly, there was only the cold.  
  
Eventually, I ran out of food as well. I waited another day, then two more, just to be sure. I listened for any shifting upstairs, but there was only silence. Not the comforting kind. The kind that presses against your ears like static, thick with the absence of everything familiar.

On the fourth day, I climbed the stairs.

The basement door stuck in its frame, swollen with damp. I braced my shoulder against it, shoved until the latch gave with a brittle clank, and stepped out into… sunlight?  
  
I wasn’t in my house anymore. In fact, I wasn’t in a house at all. The walls were gone. So was the ceiling. The cramped kitchen, the lopsided bookshelf in the corner, the stove with the broken pilot light — everything had vanished. I was standing on bare earth, staring at a sky that was too clear, too wide. The ground beneath me was still shaped like home. Vaguely. I recognized the contours, the slope where our garden used to be, the shallow depression where the road curved past the birch grove. But everything built by human hands was gone. The houses, the fences, the telephone poles, the signs, the swings, the power lines. All seemingly erased from existence.

Only the forest remained.

It stood in the distance, just as it always had, dense and unbothered. Tall pines and ancient oak trees reached upward with no awareness that anything had changed. The crows still called from the canopy. Somewhere deeper in the woods, I heard the slow knock of a woodpecker. But where the town had been, there was only open ground. No wreckage. No burned-out shells. Just naked ground, open and clean. The outlines were still there if you looked hard enough — shapes pressed into the dirt like bruises on skin. I could see the rectangle where the house stood. The circle where the well used to be. Faint lines where the road once ran. A ghost town without ghosts.

I began to walk. Slowly at first, then more urgently, hoping that maybe the next street, the next corner, would still be there. But there were no corners. Only the same open terrain, repeating itself over and over. Hills that rolled too evenly, roads that faded into the earth. It felt like a stage left standing after the actors had gone. The props had been cleared. The play was over. Only the backdrop remained.  
  
Above, the sky was empty. The ovoid, dark mass that once hung heavy overhead had vanished without a trace. The spider-like thing — the one that presumably served as an extension of its cosmic will — had disappeared just as quietly. No churning noise in the distance, no smell of ozone, no gouged paths in the forest floor. My mother was nowhere to be found. Neither were Yelena, Pavel, uncle Georgi or anyone else I once knew. Whether they’d been taken, dissolved, or simply unraveled from reality, I couldn’t say. Maybe they were still there, in some form I couldn’t see. Spread thin across the air like ash.   
  
I never got an explanation. That was the worst part. When it arrived, it simply loomed. And when it left, it didn’t take anything you could weigh or bury or burn. It took the shape of our lives. It didn’t destroy the town, it unstitched it from the world, neat and silent, like we’d been written in pencil and the eraser finally came.  
  
I still don’t know why I was spared. Maybe I wasn’t. Maybe I’m not. Maybe it was luck, or timing, or something else I’ll never understand. And even if I wanted to explain it, even if I tried, who would believe me? It’s been twenty-five years. There’s no proof. No crater. No wreckage. Just flat land and outlines that have faded almost to nothing.  
  
They said the world was going to end in 2000. They were wrong, but only technically.

The world didn’t end then. Not all of it.

Just mine.
