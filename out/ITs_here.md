The first time I noticed Him-It was 8 days ago in class. The day had started off pretty usual, the lazy yawn as I got up from my bed, the slight stagger and dizziness from my iron difficiency and the dread from having to go about another long and boring day. I arrived in class 30 mins early, I always preferred this as I would get to pick my usual favourite spot, a corner at the far back, discrete and private. Here I could daydream however long I wanted, occasionally I would take short naps without having to worry about the lecturer noticing me and making a whole scene about it.

Anyway, it was Monday 8am, I had been in my little corner of heaven long enough to watch everyone slowly come in clud in their best outfits some of which seemed no different from basic underwear but I digress. The lecturer Miss Purity an ironic name considering her bitchy personality stood there in her 4 inch heels to her 5 foot 4 height, tight white skirt that purposely actuated her curves and overdone makeup, she smiled widely at her audience specifically the men/boys who were practically a decade younger, I hated her to the bone but that's for another day, she took out her notes, cleared her throat and announced, "alright class let's begin our first lesson of the day, the topic, Conflict Theory by Karl Marx."

The lecture went on and on for about an hour or so, pretty normal nothing out of the ordinary, my eyes had started to get drowsy and I instinctively started to clear a small space on my desk to take a power nap. My body relaxed concurring with my decision, my right cheek cushioned my face on the wooden desk and my eyes slowly started to close. I was about to let out my last yawn before clocking out when something jolted me awake.

"So pretty", were the words that sent shivers down my spine, I shot upright and instinctively looked to my left, the voice had been rough and crude, like an old man with a bad voicebox. But what had shocked was neither the words nor the voice, it was the fact that it felt as if whoever had said them, had done it next to my ear, like a direct whisper. As I looked around my face contorted in shock I was met with confused stares from my classmates, their expressions read, "what's with the weirdo?" Had I imagined it, was it just in my head?  I took a deep breath and decided that I was probably sleep deprived and overthinking things, I turned my head towards my desk ready to continue with my sleep when I saw It.

My eyes had gotten a glimpse of something, something strange and out of place, was that a mirage, a trick of the light I wondered, I had to be sure, slowly I raised my head, my eyes cautiously moved from the desk, to the neighbour infront of me to Miss Purity my target. My body stiffened, my body hairs shot up, I could hear my heartbeat in my ears, my back felt wet and cold, was it sweat? My breath was labored and my eyes were wide staring at It.

Standing next to her was an organism, a being,
 a creature, an entity, it stood at 6 feet, pale white, Its left arm was hidden behind her but the right hand specifically the fingers carresed Miss Purity's hair, they were long and crooked like a withered tree branch, the fingers gently stroked her hair letting the long strands gracefully dance on its tips, then it smiled, fuck the smile, it stretched from cheek to cheek, the cheekbones felt wrong, they were too high, too distinct, too close to where the eyes should be, "oh wait" I realised, it doesn't have eyes.

The only facial features was the smile, the barely noticeable nose and the ears, they were big like a bats, every few seconds they'd shudder as if vibrating, drops of sweat were now dripping onto my desk, what was It? And why wasn't anyone screaming, I carefully looked around, everyone was doing their own thing, talking, laughing, sleeping, the victim herself Miss Purity was her normal self, no sense of alarm, no fear, was I high! Had I gone mad? Then I heard it again, "so pretty", this time I saw it, the movement of it's mouth as it talked, I let out an audible shudder, then just as quickly covered my mouth with my hands, "had It heard me?" It had.

The creature, slowly cocked It's head upwards, Its face moved from the right corner of the room as if scanning for something, Its ears seemed to vibrate faster, as if they were excited, I could feel the dread, the terror, subconsciously I knew what it was looking for, specifically who it was looking for, me. I felt the tingle, the drop in blood pressure, the tear as we came face to face and It's smile widened, "you see me." It said as I collapsed to the floor.

I woke up with a startle, I was breathing heavy, my vision was blurry as I looked around frantically, where was I, was I safe, was I dead and more importantly where was It? I felt a touch on my shoulder that almost sent me on a direct ticket to heaven, it was the university doctor, I had collapsed in class, my classmates had carried me here, that was 9 hours ago. The doctor informed me that my blood pressure was slightly allevated(no kidding) but other than that I was okay, she recommended rest and a proper meal, I nodded in agreement and left not wanting to bring up whatever it is that I saw or I'd end up in the counseling office.

The sun had began to set, on my way home my mind was locked in a battle of sanity, was what I had seen real, was it the result of an overactive imagination, now calm my psychology mind took over trying to make sense of the ordeal, I concluded that no I was not insane, I was probably fatigued, whatever I thought I saw was too unrealistic to be real. The next few days proved me right, no incidents occured, the nights were uneventful and the days normal, everything was back to normal, or so I thought.

*Present, it's Monday 9pm, the date 12 May 2025. The date is important, the time is important, I want you to know, I need you to know! I live in Nairobi Town, Kenya I don't have time for specifics, I am Male 26years old. This information is important keep it. He's here, It's here, I can feel Its presence right outside my bedroom door, I have baracaded myself and I'm pacing up and down my room. All lights are off safe for my phone, I have called the police I doubt they'll make it in time, this is my last will, my story, don't forget me!

I had gotten home at around 7pm excited to watch a Korean show I was bingeing, everything had been okay till the familiar chill hit me, the lights flickered a bit before going off, I was scared but calmed my nerves, slowly I had risen from my sofa and felt my way to the cupboard where my torch was, I turned it on and scanned my surroundings, everything was normal, I tried the light switch it didn't work, I took a deep breath and convinced my body to stop shaking I was just shook nothing more, everything is alrig... the torch slipped to the floor.

I heard it, It had found me, "hello there," the menacing words froze me to the bone, it sounded close, real close, like an arm stretch away, the torch illuminated the room halfway enough form me to see that there was nothing there, where was It? Knees buckling I crouched and slowly picked up the torch, hands shaking I directed the light from one corner of the room to the other, the light danced from the sofa, to where the tv was, to the water dispenser, to the doorway leading into the kitche... the door was open, It was standing there.

What happened next had been purely out of primal instinct, I ran up the stairs into my bedroom, I shut the door and dragged my wardrobe so that it lay against the door, I was safe for a moment, reaching into my pocket I pulled out my phone and dialed the emergency number 112, I was frantic, short of breath, I explained, they thought I was pulling a prank, I cried, they empathized and promised to send someone. As I stood there my body weak, my clothes drenced in sweat I kept wondering to myself why me? 

I could hear Its footsteps as it climbed the stairs one by one, as if taunting me, like it knew I couldn't escape, I was helpless, useless, a sitting duck. Realising the hopelessness of my situation I opened Reddit, a trace had to be left, someone had to know. 

Its standing right outside my door, I can feel Its breath, it's heavy and fast paced, like a wild animal preparing for a meal, the door knob creaks, the wardrobe shudders, It's trying to get in, I take a step back, one after the other, my eyes are fixed, fixed on the door, my ears attentive, it stops, all movement stops. Why did it stop? Did the creature leave? What's going on? My back comes into contact with something, the bedroom wall? No, it's warm, it's soft, it's skin! I freeze, my legs give way, my eyes go blank, "there you are!!", I hit POST.
