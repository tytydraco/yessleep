“This is endless.” I thought. I glanced at my watch and saw that it was already thirty past ten. I realised everybody had already left and I was the only one still here…but I still had some more to work on. I had a quick sip of Coke which was now half full. As time ticked by, my head was throbbing with more pain. To make it worse, the white, flickering lights made me feel dizzy and the brown mouldy walls. “I should have slept early last night,” I wondered.
 
I staggered towards the balcony and breathed in. “The night sky looks so beautiful,” I whispered. Something was a bit off…the stars in the sky looked different, like plastic. I gazed at the city, but the road was empty, and the buildings had no lights. I suddenly remembered my medication.
 
In a rush, I went to the bathroom to take my medication. I have this strange habit of taking my meds. It gave me comfort to take them without anyone knowing (even though I was alone there). It felt weird to be the only one here. Every room was dark except my workspace. I shut the stiff, grey door and reached for my pill bottle in my deep pockets. The doctor told me once to take the white pills during the night and the red pills during the day. I think the people who put the pills inside the bottle are stupid. They should sort the coloured pills separately instead of mixing them together. 
 
I firmly grabbed the lid and tried to twist it to its full potential. My veins were now clearly seen; I was getting frustrated. I yelled and screamed as I tried to open the bottle. POP! The lid flew miles away and the pills scattered across the floor. “How could this get any worse!” In a flash, the lights go out. Infuriated, I grabbed a pill and swallowed it and decided to find where the fuse box was. As I ran the moonlight illuminated through the window and it felt like those spotlights which were following where I went.
 
With a bang, the lights came back on, and I felt relieved. I came back to the bathroom to put the pills back in. I walked back to my workspace and turned back on his computer. The lights shone against the grey walls and made a shadow of me tirelessly working. After hours of typing and writing, it finally came back to a point where I had finished my work. I decided to take a sip of my coke, but it was empty. I threw the can in the trash, muttering some words. I took a glimpse at my watch, but it was frozen to thirty past ten. I cursed the watch but at the same time, I had been wearing it for 10 years now. I packed my belongings and walked to the exit. As I walked to the exit, it was strange how my breath was getting louder and louder. Except it wasn’t my breath.
