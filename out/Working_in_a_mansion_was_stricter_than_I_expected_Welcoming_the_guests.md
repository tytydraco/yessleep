As morning came, I hadn’t slept a wink. No matter how tired I felt, who knew what would happen if I were to fall asleep. Instead, I had plenty of time to think over what happened last night. Was I going to encounter more monsters as I continued to work here? Would that security guard be able to help me? I could not decide on what the right answer was.A soft knock echoed through the attic, disrupting my restless thoughts. Startled, I turned toward the sound. “Ben, are you awake? May, I come in?” Sophie’s voice on the other side.“Sure.” I replied flatly. She entered, holding a tray of food, in what I assumed was breakfast. As she placed it down, she greeted me with a warm smile that seemed out of place amidst my swirling confusion.Was she unaware of this mansion’s nature? No, that didn’t make sense. She has been in this mansion for God knows how long. Surely, she must have come across something. “Good morning Ben, it seems you didn’t sleep very well. I discourage you from staying up late as that will affect your performance.” She said with a condescending tone. That bitch, she definitely knew what was going on. “Today, we’re going to continue-“

“Would you entertain a question I have?” I interrupted, frustration echoing in my voice.

“Why, of course.”

“Last night, as I was lighting the candles, something very odd happened.” Her expression remained unchanged. “Some… creature appeared and attacked me. Does any of this… sound familiar?” My tone simmered with anger as I paid close attention to her reaction. “You must have not lit all the candles by midnight like I instructed you.” Her voice was devoid of emotion. This confirmed it, she set me up.

“Oh, my apologies, but ***YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THAT MY LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER HAD I NOT LIT UP THE FUCKING CANDLES ON TIME!”*** I snapped as rage coursed through me.

She, on the other hand, remained composed. “I believe you were informed that this job would be very strict.”

***“THERE’S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE THREATENING AND STRICT! SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?”*** I replied, as I breathed heavily.

She leaned closer, her words sharp like daggers. “And what will you do now Ben? You must have realized by now that the rules hold more importance than you thought.

”Her face was now inches from mine. “Will you perish Ben? Or will you continue your duties, to see another day?”

My anger was replaced with sheer dread. What the hell was wrong with this woman? How could she be so cruel to someone she’s only just met? Yet, she was right. I had no choice but to comply, until that security guard helped me escape, that is.

She seemed to understand my submission as she stepped back. “If you’ve made your decision, please finish your breakfast and meet me downstairs in 15 minutes.” Her cheerful tone now returned, as if nothing had happened. As she was about to exit, she turned around to face me, inches away from the door.

"Oh, I almost forgot to mention, guests will be arriving tonight. So be on your best behavior.” And with that, she left. Leaving me alone with my thoughts once more.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I looked like a mess. Or should I say an elegant mess. The suit made me look the part of a butler, but the dark circles forming under my eyes betrayed my predicament.

I hesitated before stepping into the library, feeling a peculiar sense of apprehension gnawing at the edges of my resolve. The grand double doors creaked slightly as I pushed them open, revealing a world of knowledge and mystery within. Sunlight filtered through the tall windows, casting elongated rays that danced across the antique, mahogany shelves.

The air carried the scent of old books, musty and rich with the passage of time. Tall bookcases lined the walls, filled to the brim with leather-bound tomes, some with fading spines and others with gilded lettering that caught the sparse rays of daylight. The ambiance was simultaneously cozy and haunting, with the library's vast expanse inducing both a sense of wonder and a flicker of fear.

As I took a few cautious steps forward, the floorboards creaked beneath my feet, echoing softly in the otherwise silent room. Apparently, the guests were going to purchase some books from Mrs. Montague and the library had to be reorganized with the main books showcased on the display at the library’s front. This time, I hadn’t received any odd instructions regarding this task. Perhaps, I didn’t have anything to worry about, at least for the time being.

As I traversed the aisles, I was surprised at how grand the library was. Everything seemed to be spotless, yet some books looked ancient to say the least. The books I was trying to recover were called: “*Shadowed Servitude, Elegance Amidst Chaos, Bound by Duty. Freed by Knowledge*.” Now that sounds fancy .All I had to do was find and place the three books in the display cases within an hour. Nice and simple.

After walking for a couple of minutes, I came across ‘*Bound by Duty. Freed by Knowledge*’. I was never much of a book person, however an odd sense of curiosity started to overwhelm me. This book was apparently very pricey and rare to find. I wanted to distract myself, so I succumbed and began reading through the first pages since there was plenty of time to spare.

My stomach growling snapped me out of my immersion. It seemed stress was getting to me. Despite having eaten 20 minutes ago, I felt hungry once more. Glancing at the watch Sophie had provided, shock coursed through me.

***It had been 5 hours since I entered the library.*** “Impossible” I muttered in disbelief, as I had only read up to page 40. I wasn’t that slow of a reader, so the watch must have malfunctioned. My confusion grew as I looked around. The library seemed to have grown exponentially, its aisles stretching out like endless roads and the towering bookshelves casting long, imposing shadows. All the lights had gone out and I couldn’t even see the ceiling anymore.

Panic seized me as I made a dash toward the exit, hoping to escape whatever the hell was taking place in this library. As I reached the doors, I slammed into them with all my might, but they remained resolutely shut, mocking my futile attempts to break free. Breathless and disheartened, I turned around, my eyes landing on the unchanged display cases.

A realization struck me like a bolt of lightning. “I see now,” I hissed under my breath. “I’m not getting out unless I find all three books.”

The weight of this realization settled upon me, fueling a sense of dread as I braced myself for the daunting task ahead. It was then I heard a loud thump echoing through the transformed library. The ground shook as the sound was getting louder and louder. It was as if cannon balls were being fired in this surreal space. I darted behind a nearby bookshelf, my heart pounding in my chest as I watched, paralyzed with fear.

A colossal creature emerged from the elongated aisles. Its size was about 20 meters, with a body covered in numerous eyes as its skinny limbs waved with each step. ***“What the fuck is that?”*** I repeatedly said to myself, as I tried to still my trembling body. I had to find the other two books without getting caught by that walking disaster.

Thankfully, the library’s basic structure remained unchanged, so I could at least try to navigate towards the remaining books. At a slow and steady pace, I rushed to the many sections of the library, trying my best to avoid detection. After a while, I found ‘*Shadowed Servitude’*, leaving one book remaining. At this point I had searched all over the first floor, so I shifted my focus to the second floor.

As I ascended the staircase, I started to believe I could once again make it through. The giant’s thunderous stomps made it easy to sneak by and also helped me keep track of its position at all times. Not to mention, the library provided plenty of cover to hide behind.

As I reached the top, an unsettling hush enveloped the air, shattering my sense of security. I scanned the surroundings frantically only to realize the giant had disappeared from sight. Its absence was eerie, as though it had been erased from existence, leaving behind an unnerving void. I don’t know where the hell it had gone, but I better take advantage of this opportunity before it comes back. To my surprise, I found the final book within a minute. “Alright, now to head bac-“

***The eyes.*** People refer to them as the gateway into the soul. Maintaining eye contact is usually considered a way of showing respect or confidence, yet as a multitude of wide-open eyes fixated upon me, I was gripped by an overwhelming sense of dread. The giant’s eyes were all-consuming, unblinking, as if they belonged to an entity devoid of any known existence.

I felt a chilling shiver crawl down my spine, unable to break free from their piercing gaze. Did that thing even have a soul? I barely leaped aside as its fist slammed into the second-floor structure, shattering the ground into jagged fragments.

I rolled to the ground, struggling to stand amidst the collapsing floor. I glanced around, only to discover the staircase was destroyed, leaving me no choice but to swiftly slide down the disintegrating floor while tightly clutching the books. If I let them go, I would be as good as dead. With adrenaline surging through my veins, I bolted forward, driven by sheer momentum. Despite the deafening noise, I sensed the looming giant closing in.

I decided to make a right turn and darted into the building-like bookshelves. In response, the giant barreled through the shelves, creating tremors that shook the entire structure. Using its rampage as cover, I stealthily slipped past and reached the display cases. Swiftly placing all the books, I heard the doors unlock. The giant, somehow alerted by the sound, made a desperate final attempt to catch me, darting on all fours. Inches away from the exit, an immense force yanked at my leg. ***Crack.***

Raw anguish seared through me as I stumbled forward, barely managing to reach the doorway. I glanced back to see the giant’s twisted appendage grasping my ankle, its grotesque fingers coiling around my leg like steel.  The creature's powerful grip was relentless, and I could feel its breath close behind me, hot and humid. In a stroke of luck, I managed to tumble out of the library.

I rolled to the floor, clutching my leg in agony. Oddly enough, after two seconds the pain had completely faded. I glanced at the door to see the library had reverted to normal. At the same time, the watch started ticking, it had just now been an hour since I went in. So, was it all an illusion then?

As I collected myself, I noticed Sophie standing there, utterly speechless. Her eyes were wide open, as though she had just witnessed a ghost. A wave of calmness washed over me, as my heartbeat returned to normal. Surviving that ordeal seemed to have given me an unexpected confidence boost. I simply glared at her, without saying a word.

Breaking the silence at last, she murmured. “Well done, Ben… I’m certain our guests will appreciate that fine selection of books.”

With a scoff I replied, “Yeah, fuck you as well.” Her brow furrowed, suggesting brewing anger. I rose and dusted myself off. “What’s next on the schedule?”

She took a deep breath, composing herself. “For the time being, take some time off. I have set your watch to alert you when your break is over.”

This seemed like the perfect opportunity, so I made my way to the security guard’s office. As I entered, he greeted me with what seemed like genuine excitement. The office was in disarray, papers strewn across the desk and multiple monitors flickering with different sections of the surrounding forest.

Amongst the chaos, a solitary picture frame rested between the monitors. It displayed a younger girl standing beside the security guard. A relative? No, that didn’t matter right now.

“Hey! You actually made it!” he exclaimed, extending his hand. I ignored the pleasantries.

“Tell me how to get out of here.”

Recognizing he was overstepping boundaries, he took a step back. “Listen, I don’t want to raise your hopes. There is a very high chance this plan might not succeed.” He said with a hint of nervousness in his tone.

“It’s fine, even a small chance is better than nothing.”

He sighed. “Would you like the good news or the bad news first?” He said, crossing his arms.

“I desperately need some good news.” I replied, leaning against the wall.

“Well, good news is, I found an opportunity to get you out of here. Bad news is, that opportunity will come in two days.” I grit my teeth. I had to endure two more days of this shithole? Fantastic.

“And what exactly is the plan, once the two days are up?”

“I’m sorry but I can’t tell you yet.”

“Yesterday you asked me to trust you and now you won’t even tell me what the plan is?” A hint of unease grew within me. This man must be deceiving me, or at the very least he was hiding something important.

After a pause, he changed the subject. “What is your job?” Confused, I asked. “What do yo-“ the ticking of my watch interrupted our conversation.

“It seems breaktime is over.” I reluctantly headed towards the door.

“Hey! You still haven’t told me your name!”

“It’s Ben. Ben Ashford.”

“Nice to meet you Ben, I’m Nolan. Nolan Bennett.” He extended his hand once more. This time I shook it.

“And one last thing. Please Ben, don’t die you hear?”

“I don’t plan on dying yet.”

I knocked on the familiar heavy wooden door. From the other side, I heard a faint “come in Sophie.”

I pushed the door open. “Tea is served.” I announced as instructed and Mrs. Montague’s eyes were wide open. An unexpected change to her otherwise emotionless face.

“…Thank you, Ben.” She said, as she poured a cup. “Would you care to sit?” Since my task had been accomplished, I thought I could get away with a bit of honesty. “Will I suffer a horrible death if I refuse?” I said, while glaring at her.

She looked down, “No…But I believe you have some questions for me.” She replied, in what I assumed, was her attempt at making a caring expression.

I started feeling agitated. “You know what? Yes, I do have a question for you.”

I sat down across from her. “Why the hell did you invite me here to this deathtrap of a mansion?”

She twirled a lock of hair around her fingertip. “Because …we required a butler. And, well… because of your circumstances.”

“My circumstances?” I interjected sharply.

“Indeed, due to your lack of immediate famil-”

***“Shut up.”*** I interrupted, burying my face in my hands. Memories I wished to forget were beginning to form in my head and it was all because of her. After a couple of seconds, I sighed deeply, leaning back on my chair.

“You’re all the same you know that? Each and every one of you. I haven’t done a single thing to you people and still, you all treat me like shit. You toss me to the side leaving me to rot and go about your day as if nothing happened.” I tried my best to withhold the tears welling in my eyes.

Mrs. Montague observed me intently, her expression unfazed by my words.

“Before I came to this mansion… my life was complete torture, I honestly thought things couldn’t get any worse than they already were, yet here we fucking are.”

I leaned forward, placing my hands on the desk. “Tell me Mrs. Montague, what the hell did I do wrong to deserve this kind of treatment? Why do you all wish to see me suffer so badly? ***ANSWER ME!”*** My voice echoed through the office, plunging the room into a heavy silence.

“Ben… what is your job?” she said in a hushed tone of voice. Again with that question. Nolan had asked me this very same question before I left earlier. I decided to respond this time.

“My job? I guess my job is to be a toy for whatever the hell lives in this wretched mansion.” Having said that, I got up to leave.

“Ben-“ She tried to protest.

I glanced back at her. “I can’t understand you, not one bit.”

As I placed the silverware on the table, my mind focused on maintaining proper alignment between forks, knives, and spoons. *“I have some business to attend to. Simply observe how the other maids perform to set up your side of the table.”* Was all I got. The maids around me were working very efficiently to say the least. There was just one problem, they wouldn’t say a word.

Not just to me but ever since I came here, they hadn’t opened their mouths once. Still, I was exhausted from the many arguments and a little silence was greatly appreciated. As I finished setting my side of the table, I glanced back and forth between my side and their side. It looked pretty much identical to me, and as I was about to call it a day, I suddenly got a strong feeling of being watched.

***Ten.*** I heard numerous voices, sounding excited, yet unsettlingly synchronized, echoing in unison. It was as if a whole crowd of people had entered the room. I flinched as my anxiety rose, scanning the room to see nobody besides the silent maids.

***Nine.*** The voices persisted. Sweat pooled on my forehead, and my teeth began to chatter uncontrollably. Out of all the threats I had faced so far, I could at least see them. This time however, it was as if their voices penetrated my mind directly.

***Eight.*** I had to figure out what the hell had gone wrong this time, it probably had something to do with the table. But what in the world could possibly be wrong with the table?

***Seven.*** I frantically started moving the silverware, trying to adjust them minutely, hoping that it would somehow halt the countdown. Even going as far as using a nearby ruler to count the distance between them.

***Six.***

***Five.***

***Four.*** The voices were starting to sound louder and inhumane as they continued to count. *Dammit I’m running out of time.*

***Three.***

***Two.*** I had no more time left to lose. I could only move one more piece of silverware. My eyes focused on a single knife that looked inches away from place. *Please, please let this work*, I silently pleaded.

***One.*** The air seemed to thicken around me, the anticipation nearly suffocating. Silence enveloped the room. Seconds stretched into an agonizing eternity. I was unable to open my eyes, bracing myself for the impending unknown. But nothing happened.

Cautiously, I cracked open an eye, then the other, to find everything eerily still. The voices had stopped. The room was quiet, the tension dissipating into an unnerving calmness. Relief flooded through me, as I stood up.

The maids worked diligently, seemingly unperturbed, unaware of the turmoil I had just experienced. Never mind them, I’m getting out of here. Stepping into the hallway I almost bumped into Mrs. Montague.

“Ben… I assume you’ve completed your task?” I furrowed my brow, feeling a mix of frustration and exhaustion. “The table is set.” Having said that, I tried to walk past her.

Memories of our earlier tense conversation flashed through my mind, the memory alone being enough to sour my mood further. I couldn't bring myself to look at her face, knowing that any interaction might lead to another bout of discomfort.

The mansion's unsettling events weighed heavily on my mind, leaving me on edge. It was becoming increasingly challenging to function in this place, let alone maintain any semblance of composure in Mrs. Montague's presence. All I had to do was survive two more days.

“Wait Ben! Are you alright?” Her touch on my shoulder stopped me in my tracks.

“Just another shitty day.” I replied, without looking back.

As the evening came, so did the guests. A couple in their 40s accompanied by their young daughter. They took their seats at the table alongside Mrs. Montague, engaged in lively conversation that echoed through the room. Despite their animated chatter, my fatigue weighed heavily on me. Standing beside Sophie, I struggled to focus on their discussions, my sleep-deprived mind wandering aimlessly.

“Are you alright?” I snapped out of my drowsiness. The father faced my direction with a look of concern. I assumed all hell would break loose if I were to tell him what was actually on my mind. “I’m fine sir, thank you for your consideration.” I replied, adopting my best formal tone.

“Daddy, I’m bored.” The little girl interrupted, nudging her father.

He shifted his attention. “Mrs. Montague, would it be alright if my daughter explores your estate? She was very excited about coming to a mansion of this size."

She looked skeptical for a moment. “I don’t see why not."

The girl excitedly stood up. ”Let’s go!”

“Sweetie, we have some important things to talk about with Mrs. Montague.”

The girl pouted in response and rushed over to me, tugging at my sleeve.

“And what is this?” the little girl pointed for the tenth time.

“Painting.” I replied, dying on the inside. This little shit has been running me around the manor for the past hour asking about the various objects decorating it. We took a seat in the hallway, my legs appreciating the thought. Ever since this morning I’ve been working almost nonstop without any sleep.

“Tell you what, I’m going to close my eyes for a few minutes. You just have to stay in this hallway with me. Got it?”

“Kay.” The kid said as she looked around the invariable hallway. How could she find this hallway so entertaining anyway? I had no clue. I shut my eyes and for a few minutes I was at peace.

“Ben, Ben! Wake up, I found a weird door.” This fucking kid. Ever since we began wandering around, she always required constant attention, no matter what she was doing. I suppose rich children can be quite spoiled, or in this case neglected.

“Yeah, every door here is weird.” I mumbled, as I drifted between awake and asleep. It was the simple truth, that every door in this mansion looked way older and more refined than average doors we see in our everyday lives. No wonder she would perceive it as weird. “But Ben, it’s super weird.” The little girl persisted.

“And I’m super exhausted, so let me be for a moment.” I dismissed her. After a few seconds she spoke up. “I’m gonna go check it out.” Excellent, I finally had a chance to rest, even if it came abruptly from babysitting this little girl. If only she knew what this mansion was actually capable of, I don’t think she would be this excited. Wait a minute, weird door? Having seen with her the mansion almost in its entirety, she never once used that word.

I opened my eyes, the dim light of the hallway revealing an ominous red door at its far end. I blinked, half-expecting the vision to dissipate, but the door remained, a stark anomaly in the mansion's decor. I had never seen that kind of door before, and the little girl was slowly walking towards it. I started to rush toward her.

***“Hey! Stop!”*** I shouted but to no avail. She continued walking as if in a trance. The door in response slowly creaked open, revealing multiple arms extending from its depths. *God please no, not the kid. Please.* I sprinted forward, my body protesting from all the strain it had endured, but I persisted. Tears formed in my eyes, as each breath sent shockwaves of pain as I desperately closed the distance between us. She was now mere moments away from the door’s grasp.

All this time, I’ve been busy taking care of myself. Whether that would be surviving the terrors of this mansion or surviving the monsters of my everyday life. I never had any time for someone else, not that I had anyone to begin with.

Yet, amid the chaos, a strong but unfamiliar desire started to emerge within me. The desire to keep that little girl out of this whole mess. I grabbed her a few inches away from the door and with a swift motion I leaped to the side, landing on my back. With bated breath, I watched as the door shut tight, seemingly displeased by my intervention.

I heaved a sigh, overwhelmed with relief, and turned to the girl. She blinked repeatedly as if she had just woken up. “Ben, I’m sleepy.” She mumbled. I hugged her tightly, as I rested against a nearby wall. Initially, I convinced myself it was to reassure her. Yet, in truth, it was my way of finding solace, grappling with the reality that I had almost gotten this child killed.

Later that night, Mrs. Montague invited me to her office as she had something important to discuss. As I entered her office, she didn’t seem to notice me as she was preoccupied with a small rag doll in her hands. “You wanted to see me?” I announced my presence, standing just inside the doorway.

To my surprise, she flinched at the sound of my voice. “Ah Ben, my apologies. Please have a seat.” she replied, hurriedly tucking the doll away. What a strange woman, playing with dolls at her age?

“What do you want?” I asked, desperately needing to retire for the night.

“Did you encounter anything while escorting the little girl?” This woman was desperate to upset me once more. However, I was too out of it to argue, so I explained briefly what happened.

She sighed, her tone unusually soft. “I see, thank you for your hard work Ben. If you would allow me to say so, you’re a very kind person.”

I was caught off guard by the sudden compliment. “Now, where did that come from?”

“Instead of blaming the mansion’s inhuman nature, you hold yourself responsible for that child's close call, even though it was beyond your control.”

I leaned forward, frustration evident in my tone. “Don’t misunderstand, this is also your fault. Why the hell did you invite more people here? Am I not suffering enough for you?”

She fidgeted with her left leg. “I assure you… that is not the case.”

“Then what is?” I demanded, growing more agitated by the minute.

“Ben, will you please answer some questions I have?” Her persistence grated on my already frayed nerves. She never seemed to address my most pressing concerns, no matter how hard I tried. “What is your job, Ben?”

After a few seconds of tense silence, I sighed deeply. “Fine…I’ll play along, just this once. In the ad, I thought my job was going to be that of a butler, but… you know the rest.”

As if satisfied by my answer she continued her interrogation. “What were you provided with once entering the mansion?”

I sighed, recalling the inventory. “A watch, my suit, a room to stay in… oh and the rules of conduct.” She nodded once I mentioned the rules.

“Do you consider your job unpredictable?”

“God, yes! Where the hell are you going with this?!” My frustration was reaching its peak. I was on the verge of storming out of her office once more.

“Ben… What is my job?” She finally asked, her eyes locked on mine with an intensity that made me uneasy.

“Huh?... The mansion head?” My response came out more like a question, puzzled by her line of questioning.

“Precisely, my job is fairly unpredictable as well.” After that statement, an eerie silence filled the room.

Seconds passed by, and Mrs. Montague's unbroken stare felt like a challenge, as if expecting a response to this perplexing conversation. I couldn't comprehend the purpose of these inquiries. Asking me weird questions, then prompting me to ask her about her own duties.

Suddenly, it dawned on me. It was subtle, a faint whisper of realization. My job felt ‘unpredictable’ because of those accursed rules ingrained into my mind. *“Rule 5: Follow any given tasks to the best of your ability.”*, Was the rule I had broken multiple times so far. Or at least, that's what I assumed, considering it seemed illogical for the others to have any impact in this bizarre mansion up to this point.

“Do you also have rules of conduct?” I hesitantly asked. Her expression relaxed, as if I had hit the jackpot.

“Ben, does the earth rotate around the sun?” I believed that to be a yes. I found the tension in my body fading from this pleasant surprise. I had misunderstood her all along. Still, she had her own list of rules and apparently couldn’t talk about them directly. Despite that, something remained missing here. Why would the mansion head have her own set of rules? Wasn’t she the leader here? If so-

***“Well, aren’t the two of you getting along nicely now?”*** A voice interrupted from my left, and to my surprise an overgrown eyeball had materialized in the middle of the wall. It felt as though it was staring into my very soul. My body tensed as I prepared for the consequences. Had I broken the rules again? This time, the creature could talk as well.

An almost primal instinct flowed through my consciousness. *This being existed on a whole different spectrum.* I felt a touch on my shoulder, and as if to calm me down, Mrs. Montague offered me a reassuring glance as she stood beside me.

“To what do I owe the displeasure of being in your presence this evening?” She glared at it. It was the first time I had seen a genuine expression from her. Even someone like me, who can’t read the mood, could tell she absolutely detested the creature standing before us.

***“Now now, no need to be on guard. I simply wished to officially welcome our newest member.”*** It replied with a calm and collected tone. It then shifted its gaze to me.

***“I must say Ben, I’m very impressed with your performance so far. Out of every butler I have come across, all…quit within a few hours, without exception. Yet here you are, surpassing my expectations with apparent ease. I truly respect your resilience.”***

Was I being praised? Even so, I wasn’t happy in the slightest. This whole time, that fucking creature was the one responsible for this ordeal?

***“You see, I believe diligent workers deserve recognition and reward. So, my beloved Eleanor, would you kindly explain to Ben the nature of this place?”***

“I don’t suppose you would be willing to make a promise, regarding your request?” She replied, her voice carrying a blend of irritation and authority.

***“Always so perceptive.”*** After that, they both spoke in incomprehensible language. I wasn’t sure what they were going on about, but I didn’t dare interfere.

***“And with that, I’ll be taking my leave for the evenin-“***

“Wait, there’s something I have to ask.” I hesitantly interrupted as I stood up.

“Why are you doing this to me? Why are you trying to kill me?” I wasn’t able to see its face, but I could tell it was smiling.

***“Why do humans consume meat Ben? That is, of course, to survive. You devour the meat without a second thought, despite the anguish the poor animal endured for you to attain that meal—its life, its happiness, its joy… and its pain—all ending up on your plate.”***

My fear was being replaced with disgust, the malice carried in those words resonated within me.

***“As Eleanore will explain in a moment, I have occupied this mansion for many years. As you can imagine, it grows dull, simply waiting for my next meal to arrive. Even the taste grows bland and so, I seek entertainment before I dine.”***

Amidst my hopelessness, I smirked, as I tried to mask my shivering body. “Yeah? Well, you can go fuck yourself for all I care. I’ll only die on my own terms.”

***“We shall see.”*** And with that, the eye disappeared into the wall. I collapsed to the floor, my legs giving out from exhaustion.

What followed was an explanation of what I had been experiencing during my stay here. Apparently, this mansion served as a prison for that thing. Despite that, they weren’t able to completely seal its influence, leading to the establishment of rules. They were meant to give us a chance to survive and every member of this mansion was provided with their own set, including Sophie and Nolan.

Said rules couldn’t be spoken directly, with me being an exception as I wasn’t meant to survive this long. I learned that Mrs. Montague had initially sealed this entity using a kind of grimoire, but some pages were missing, and she was desperate to recover them. Hence the visit of today’s guests, which held the possibility of having crucial information about the missing pages. Unfortunately, it led to a dead end.

“This is too much to take in.” I muttered, running a hand over my face.

“That is completely understandable, Ben. I’m deeply sorry you’ve been entangled in this mess.” She replied as she lowered her gaze, her voice tinged with regret.

I exhaled heavily. “If what I just heard is true, then you can’t blame yourself for this. If anything, it’s that thing’s fault. You quite literarily have a rule that forces you to hire someone each month.”

“But-“

“But nothing. To be honest, I’m just relieved to see someone actually care, even in these shitty circumstances.” She was silent, seemingly accepting my praise.

“By the way, Eleanor was it? Can I call you that too?” I added, trying to shift the depressing mood.

Her eyes somewhat lit up. “Why, of course. But Ben… why are you so merciful towards me?”

“Because you let me sleep in the attic, I guess.” I chuckled. She didn’t laugh at my joke, however her expression appeared to soften. After that we bid each other good night and I headed to the attic.

As I laid down, a recollection of today’s events replayed in my mind. I still hadn’t fully digested this surreal environment. Part of me desperately wished it was all a dream, something from which I could wake up. My life was in danger with pain and suffering lurking around the corner, just like my old life.

A somber expression overtook me as I unclasped my metal charm, the moonlight casting its glow upon it. *“Dad.”* I whispered, my voice barely audible in the quiet room. That night, I had no pleasant dreams. Only memories I had long tried to bury.
