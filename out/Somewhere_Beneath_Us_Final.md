I stared at my phone intensely, wrestling with whether I should try again or not. Two calls over the course of a year wasn't a lot, but given the circumstance, it felt like two too many. My thumb hovered over the dial button for nearly a minute before I clicked the lock button and jammed the slab into my pocket. There was no use. It would only be another missed call and a dose of disappointment. Besides, Jan was probably wondering where I was. With a sigh, I popped the car door open and stepped out.

*Knock, Knock, Knock… Knock!*

"Just a minute!" I heard a warm voice call out before the front door opened. Jan smiled brightly at me "Hey, come on in! I was just about to call you and see where you were."

"Sorry, I got a little caught up with something," I told her, hugging her from the side as I slipped my shoes off. Together we stepped over a baby gate and into the living room.

"Andi, look who's here to see you!" Jan announced as we entered.

"Doel!" The toddler declared as she began to hobble over to me to the best of her ability. I scooped her up with a smile.

"Hey, sweet pea. You're getting pretty good at that, huh?" she stared at me with a big grin, but her attention quickly went to the same place it always did. I held up my hand for her to see, and she eagerly grabbed ahold of a finger. Gently, I tensed my muscles, causing the prosthetic to slowly close around her hand. She watched, amazed as if I had just done the greatest magic trick on the planet. To be fair, it still surprised me sometimes with how well it functioned.

I took a seat on the floor and began entertaining Andi while Jan and I caught up. It had only been a week since we had last seen each other, but with how fast our lives were moving, it seemed like there was always too much to keep up with.

"Sorry I can't stay for dinner tonight. Tell everyone I said hi, though."

"Of course. And no worries. You'll just have to host next week to make up for it." Jan said with a smirk.

I chuckled and helped Andi place a shape into the correct slot on a toy before looking back up to her mother. She was gazing out the window, lost in thought. She had lots of windows in her house, all big and open, peering out into the sunny world outside.

"You okay?" I asked.

Jan nodded, "I'm just still getting used to all of this. I can't believe how different things are from just a year ago. I used to have dreams just like this when we were back there. I still worry that I'm suddenly going to wake up, and we'll have never escaped.

"Yeah, me too. Although mine are nightmares, and I'm afraid I won't wake up. But I always do. And if you've been dreaming this whole time, then I'd be worried about how much you're sleeping."

Jan laughed, and I smiled, but it faded quickly. We made light of our situation, but it was clear that while we had left the house, it had never left us.

&#x200B;

When I opened my eyes for the first time after passing through the exit, I found myself in a hospital room. It was quiet and dark, and had it not been for the machines I was hooked up to, I would have thought I was still back in the house. I knew I wasn't, though, because of what I saw outside the nearby window. City lights twinkling and sparkling beneath a starlit sky, and cars buzzing busily through streets below. Civilization. Life. My vision blurred as relief swept over me. Of course, we had always told ourselves we would make it out of the house, but deep down, I never thought I truly would. I should have died among the cold, labyrinthine halls of old rooms and structures, yet by some miracle, I was in one piece.

I looked to my right and saw a panel on the bed. It was all labeled in some kind of Asian lettering, but there was a small button with a nurse icon on it. I lifted my arm from the bed to click it but stopped as my muscles didn't move quite how they used to. That's when I remembered. I wasn't entirely in one piece.

I stared at what remained of my arm, taking it in. I had been in so much shock initially that I barely had time to think about it. I did recall the wound looking very, very crude, though, about a fourth of the way up my forearm. I wasn't surprised that they had to amputate everything that remained below the elbow. The stump was currently fitted with a tight white sleeve, and the thing that was the most strange to me was that even though I could feel where my arm actually ended, it still felt like the rest of it was there. As if I could move it if I tried hard enough. There was even a slight pain in the ghostly appendage on top of the discomfort from the stump itself.

I ended up reaching with my other hand to call the nurse, and within minutes there were four of them in the room checking my vitals and running all sorts of tests that I couldn't understand. However, the doctor did speak some English, and she did her best to guide me on what I needed to do for them to make sure I was okay. She also told me that they called my friend and let him know I was awake. I didn't know what that meant until Frank knocked on the doorway, and the staff permitted him to enter.

Frank was never big on affection and emotion, but when he saw me, he smiled big and rested a hand on my shin as he watched from the end of the bed.

"I'm so glad you're awake, Joel. They didn't know how long it would take."

"Hey, Frank." I said, happy to see him but confused, "Where are we?"

"Sapporo, Japan."

I raised my eyebrows at him.

"Yeah, I know. Hang tight. I'll explain everything I know once we're alone."

It took a bit, but after their doctors and nurses finished making sure I was okay, we were able to be left alone for a bit while they went to call a translator. Frank sat in the chair next to me and began to give me the rundown of what had happened after I had blacked out.

Apparently, we were the last ones to go through the exit, and as he opened the door, we stepped out on top of a residential building roof. A couple nearby, tending to a rooftop garden, got quite the shock to see a rough, grizzled man carrying an unconscious boy in his arms, blood leaking from a severed limb. Frank quickly realized they didn't speak English, but his frantic expression and the sight of me were a universal sign for 'call for help'. It was at this point, when all he could do was wait, that he noticed we were alone. There was no sign of Jan, Bea, Grace, or Claire. We had arrived here by ourselves.

When the paramedics and authorities arrived, they quickly rushed Frank and me to a hospital. They placed me into surgery and held him back for questioning. The situation clearly wasn't optimal for the story we had planned for, so Frank had to improvise a bit. Once they brought in a translator, he told them that we were Americans that had been kidnapped a few years back. Since then, we'd been traded around in an underground market. We had just escaped during our most recent transport from the back of a truck and ran to the building for help. When they asked about my arm, Frank told them that only he had managed to escape the shackles they kept us in. We were running out of time, though, and in desperation, I had to hack my own arm off with a loose panel from the truck wall.

To give credit to Frank, it was a really good cover story to come up with on the spot and under so much stress. However, the problem was that there were too many holes in his report. There was absolutely no blood trail in the building until the door to the roof, and even that raised the question of why we had fled all the way up there to get help. It was starting to place suspicion on Frank. Luckily, when the Japanese police contacted the American Citizen Services and confirmed that we were missing persons, it put a hold on the investigation. At least for a couple of days until they could gather their files on us and send them over to help with the case.

During that short time, something else happened. The Police got a call saying that another case had just popped up in a town in Iceland. There were four other missing persons from the same file, one of them being injured, just like me. They had the same story of kidnapping and escape, which both quelled, and raised suspicions. How likely was it that two groups from the same investigation on opposite sides of the world would turn up at the same time? When it happened that two days later, more missing people turned up in Australia, one of them being from another case thirteen years ago, things began to seem more suspect than ever. The officials were quickly realizing there was more to our stories than we were letting on.

I was getting stressed out just by hearing Frank explain all of this to me, and I was kind of glad I had been comatose the entire time. However, I wasn't pleased that I had been in said coma for almost an entire month.

"Bea," I asked, sitting up in my bed. "She was hurt too, did she…"

Frank shook his head, "I wish I knew. There's been no way for me to contact them this whole time. I don't think they want us speaking with one another until they can get their footing on how they want to go about all of this."

"So what happens now, then?"

"I've been told we wait. They wanted to get everyone gathered back in the U.S. so they could streamline things, but I told them I wasn't going to leave you alone over here. They have me held up in a hotel in the meantime. Constant surveillance, of course. I'm sure now that you're awake, though, they'll be shipping us out soon enough."

"Good. I want to know that everyone is okay. Thanks for taking care of me, Frank."

Frank nodded and then dropped into his usual demeanor, staring out the window. I chuckled to myself.

"What's so funny?"

"Nothing. I just think that's the most I've heard you talk in almost five years. Maybe even ever."

"Well," he smiled, "I'm feeling a lot better now than I was then."

&#x200B;

I took a big gulp from the water glass before me, relishing the crystal-clean, chalk-less taste. It was amazing how many things were once mundane that now brought comfort and joy into my life. Even after so much time back in the world, they still hadn't lost their charm like they once had before. The smell of actual, real cooking food was another one of these things.

"That smells great, Jan. what's the meal tonight?"

"Slow-cooked pot roast with some roasted vegetables and French bread." She announced like a contestant on a cooking channel.

"Wow, you've become quite the chef lately, huh? You host, like, every other week."

Jan chuckled, "I know, it's funny. I always wanted to learn more about cooking but never had the time. Now that we don't have to work, though, I feel like I have too much time. And since I've got Andi to look after, this is a hobby I can do from home."

"Well, I support your new passion one-hundred percent," I said, tearing a piece of bread from the loaf and eating the heavenly fluff.

"Hey, participating customers only!"

"I'll pay you back when I host next time."

"What about you? You' find anything new to fill all of your free time with?"

"Kind of. I've been doing a lot of writing lately. I'm thinking I may start working on a book."

"Oh wow, really? I didn't know you were so prolific!"

I chuckled, "I'm not exactly. Not' even very good at it. I'm not doing it for my own sake, though…."  I told her.

I owed a friend the story he wasn't around to write...

"So, what's the book going to be about?"

"Well," I started slowly, "I did have a pretty good idea for a horror story."

Jan turned from sautéing her vegetables to give me a quizzical look. "Joel, are you sure that's a good idea? I don't think *they* would like that."

I shrugged. "I feel like our story needs to be told one way or another. All those people who we lost at that house should be remembered, even if the world thinks they're still just missing. Besides, you heard what they told us. We can try to tell people about what happened if we want. Nobody would believe us anyway."

"I suppose," Jan said, returning to her cooking.

I looked back to my glass on the counter and, this time, raised my prosthetic to it. Slowly, the mechanical fingers closed around it, and I lifted it to my mouth. I never thought I would be able to do that with my right arm ever again. It was thanks to Benjamin that I even could.

&#x200B;

The following weeks after I had woken up in the hospital were excruciating, in more ways than one. Learning to function without a dominant arm was difficult, to say the least. Plus, the pain I hadn't felt in my coma was finally catching up. I was thankful that a good portion of the wound had healed while I was out. The other part that was driving me mad, however, was not knowing the fate of my friends. Whatever the reason, we had all exited in different places, and since the authorities weren't letting us contact one another, I just had to wait to see if Bea was okay and if Daniel had made it back with Ben and Alice. It had been nearly two weeks when they finally gave the OK to discharge me from the hospital and fly me and Frank back to the states.

Frank and I were escorted by four officers during the flight process, and when we touched down in Arkansas, we were taken straight off the plane and loaded into black SUVs. It was around this point that we began to suspect the situation was a lot bigger than just asking us questions about our accounts.

"These aren't police anymore. This is government." Frank whispered to me as we drove.

The drive was long, taking us out into a compound deep in the woods. I was starting to get incredibly worried about what would happen, and I could tell Frank was too, but we kept quiet. There was nothing we could really do to fight, so we figured all we could do was wait and see. The car passed through a gate, and we were taken out of the vehicle and led into the building. It was nice inside, full of modern offices and people in suits. An official-looking government seal that I had never seen before adorned the walls, featuring the acronym 'P.A.P'.

Our escorts approached the desk as we entered and exchanged a few words with the secretaries before leading us down a hall and into some back offices. They opened the door to an interrogation room and then showed us inside. Any reservations I had about the situation were quickly put on hold.

Our group was already waiting for us around a big table as we entered. Though it would have been wiser to pretend we didn't know each other, we couldn't resist our emotions. For the first time since the bus, we were seeing one another in the outside world, free and alright. Everyone stood and rushed forward to greet us, and as I hugged them one by one, through the crowd, I saw him. He smiled at me, and I could tell he was just as speechless as I was. I stumbled forward and embraced him.

"I-I'm so glad you're okay." I could barely choke out.

"I'm glad you are, too," Daniel told me. He stepped back and looked at my arm. "My God, kid, what did you get up to after I left?"

I chuckled and wiped tears from my eye, "I got into a fight."

"Well, I'd hate to see the other guy."

I shook my head, "I missed you so much… After we left, I thought I'd never- I thought you were dead."

"I thought I was too. You kids did it, though. I am so unbelievably proud of you."

A smile spread across my face, but it faded fast when I realized-

"W-where's Bea?" I asked, turning to Grace, Jan, and Claire. They all exchanged looks, then Jan spoke first. "She's still at the hospital. We tried to get them to wait until she was better, but they wanted to do this meeting now."

"What's wrong with her? Is she still hurt?"

"The doctors got her stabilized, but she's in a coma. She lost a lot of blood and damaged a lot of organs. I'm so sorry, Joel…."

I tried to remain calm, but my breathing began to pick up, and I had to sit. There was no way. I wouldn't accept that we had come this far just to lose someone now. Bea had to be okay. She needed to pull through, or I didn't know what I would do. Daniel put a hand on my shoulder, and I turned to him, suddenly remembering something else.

"Daniel, Ethan, he… He-"

"I know, kid. Ben told me." He said solemnly. I could see tears welling in his eyes. "Like I said, I am so proud of you all. So, so very proud."

Just then, the door to the interrogation room swung open, and a woman entered, flanked by two officers.

"I'm sorry to interrupt an emotional moment, but I must ask you all to have a seat." Her voice was kind but sharp, with crisp diction and proper speech. She slowly stepped over to the long table and lay down a few files full of paper. "Now, I don't want you all to be concerned. You're not in any trouble. We are aware that you are victims here, not criminals. However, we need to ask you some questions and ask that you fully cooperate. Do you understand?"

The way she worded her sentence didn't sit with me right. 'we are aware you are victims'.

I shifted nervously in my chair and peered around the room to find that everyone looked just nervous as I did. These people might have been an official organization, but that didn't mean we should trust them.

Jan spoke first, "What do you mean? Did everyone here not already give accounts to the police when they found us?"

"You have. However, your stories have many inconsistencies and circumstances that would be impossible in your situation. They also are too perfectly similar. I'm sure you've figured out that we are different from the traditional law. Your story has made an excellent cover that we'll use for the media, but our job is to find out where you all have truly been. As I said, we hope that you'll cooperate."

All of us exchanged glances, trying to telepathically think of a new plan at that moment. We hadn't accounted for this, and clearly, something was wrong. It was the kind of thing you see in movies where the government takes aliens to lock them up to do experiments. If we told these people the truth, there was no telling what might happen.

Ben broke the silence after a moment, "And what repercussions will there be if we can't tell you what you want to hear?"

"I prefer to not make things tense, but we will need the information one way or another. We'd have to hold you for as long as it takes to change your mind. If that takes too long, we may have to move on to other means."

That set a much heavier tone upon the room.

"But we are telling the truth," Grace said. "What more do you want to hear?"

The woman stared at her, then reached into the top folder, withdrawing a picture that she slid across the table for all of us to see.

"Do you recognize this vehicle?"

"Yeah." Dan grunted, "That's the bus we got taken from."

"Taken. You all say you were kidnapped from this bus, yet when it was found, the vehicle was still in drive and swerved off into a ditch. Why would it still be in gear if you were run off the road and taken? There was also no sign of foul play found within the cabin. It was almost as if all its passengers just disappeared into thin air."

"Our captors were thorough," Dan remarked.

The woman smirked, showing emotion for the first time before turning to Alice. "What about you, Miss Hensley? You went missing thirteen years ago and just happened to show back up at the same time as this lot. Were you also taken by this trafficking group?"

"I um… I was-"

"You and your classmates?" the woman added.

Alice didn't know how to respond and just stared. She was the one variable we hadn't accounted for.

The woman sighed and continued, "Listen, I know whatever happened to you all must have been a traumatizing circumstance." She said, looking at me and my missing limb, "And I know that trusting the government is not always easy."

"Especially when you make threats," Dan muttered under his breath next to me. I kicked him in the leg.

"But I'm certain you want to put this ordeal behind yourself and return to your normal life. If you tell us what we need to know, we can ensure that no more conflict will come of this. We'll take you back to wherever you'd like, and from there, you can resume your lives just as they were."

Once again, we all began exchanging looks. The woman was right. We were all so tired of the pain and the lost time and the house. We knew we could never forget what happened and that it would follow us for the rest of our lives, but we certainly wanted to try. It was a long, long pause before anyone spoke again. Benjamin.

"Okay." He said, "I can tell you; at least what I know. But I have a condition."

The woman perked up, but her expression didn't change, "Go ahead."

"I want everyone in this room to be well taken care of for the rest of our lives. I want the medical bills taken care of for my friend over there and the one back at the hospital, and I want any future expenses covered as well."

"We can arrange that."

"Nobody should ever have to worry about finances anymore either. Any house, car, or even bag of groceries; I want them to be already paid for. These people have been through enough. they deserve to never have to worry again."

"That's quite the demand, Mr. Halloran."

"Well, we have quite a long story to tell. I'd think it's worth all that. Besides, I used to serve under special operations. I know organizations like yours can afford it."

The woman thought, staring Ben down before raising her chin, "Alright, Mr. Halloran. If that sounds agreeable to everyone else, I'm sure I can make all of that happen. As long as everyone cooperates."

Ben looked at all of us, who nodded in agreement. They were going to get the information one way or another. This was probably the best-case scenario. I turned to Daniel and gave him a look that he returned before I cleared my throat. The official looked over at me, and I spoke.

"That sounds good, but you'll probably want mine and Daniel's accounts in more detail. We um… we saw a little more than most."
