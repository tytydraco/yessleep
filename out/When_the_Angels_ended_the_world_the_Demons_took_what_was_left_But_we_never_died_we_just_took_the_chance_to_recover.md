Hello, bet you never expected to hear from me again?  
It's me, the guy who was nearly gutted by one of the horned asshats.

My search party didn't find me, but somebody found me.  
Well, some*thing*

He's not human, he's not a demon, he's allegedly an *Angel*.  
Well, he claims to be one, but he isn't bigger than the Statue of Liberty, nor is he feasting on expectant mothers, but he does have one thing.  
He has two scars on his back, perfectly symmetrical and too perfectly sliced to have been done without something being removed.

Plus, the scars aren't the only thing; the actual skin is slightly bulged, even though only the scar tissue should be.  
So, I think he's telling the truth, so I'm keeping an eye on him.  
Oh, for the note, his name is Jo, short for Jofiel.

But, that's not what you wanna know. No, you want to know what's happened in general, so let's get on with it, shall we?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was unconscious for a week, having passed out from blood loss.  
I was found by a small group of people, mixed between humans and my new *angel* friend.

I was taken to another civilization, smaller than Genesis, but far better defended.   
They called it Rebirth.  
They'd taken over an old university, but using Jo's knowledge about Demons, they were able to keep any offenders from getting inside.

The storage is less than Genesis's, but they've got better supplies, and they've even managed to get power.  
Not sure how, but I think they might be using solar power or hydroelectricity, despite both being relatively risky.

I think Jo was the one to heal me, since nobody was sure the wound I had could've healed naturally. Turns out I got an infection, something "hellish" and profane, Jo's words, not mine.  
The infection would've made me a Demon, not sure how, and I don't really wanna ask.

Jo was happy to see me awake, since he was afraid I wouldn't recover properly, especially since my kidney and liver barely survived being impaled. But I was persistent, even when I neared the end of my finish line.  
I wasn't fully convinced, until I heard about my condition entirely.

According to Jo, the Demon that attacked me sliced deep into my gut, further than I thought, and nearly cleaved open both my kidney and my liver in one swipe. If it had gone any deeper, I'd have been dead in less than a few minutes, but I got lucky, especially when I killed the thing fast enough.

He even had medical photos, simply as a method of hopefully deducing future conditions. All of which showed me: myself, my insides, or the black soot-like substance that was growing around the four slashes across my gut.  
The substance allegedly smelled like sulfur, so I wasn't overly surprised to learn it was demonic, but the transformation/conversion thing did surprise me.



Once I was cleared to leave, I immediately hoped to get out and return to Genesis, until I saw Rebirth.  
The place is surprisingly flourishing, with plants actually managing to grow, but I'm still unsure how.

They've got functional water fountains, which they were using to collect water in bottles, which were stored in the cafeteria.  
The cafeteria was made into a makeshift feeding bay; they'd regulate the giving and passing of food while trying their best to take dietary requirements into account.

The nurse's office had become a makeshift hospital, with anybody who was hurt being kept there. Anybody who showed signs of the "demonic infection" was dealt with, usually by being exterminated.  
I thought it was horrific, until I saw one of the people they'd taken as an experimental subject.

The "demonic plague" as I called it, was more horrific than I thought.  
The body would twist and shift, like rubber, but the bones wouldn't, so they'd snap and heal every time they were broken.  
And they'd never die, not even after reaching total demonification, so we'd need to give them the release of death to "cleanse their souls" of demonic evil.

I thought it was crazy, the idea of souls becoming monsters, but Jo was adamant, even showing me somebody who was beyond saving.  
It was a little girl, around 8, and she seemed fine, if you ignored the giant slash in her chest and the black fungus-like soot across the wound.  
The most unsettling thing, aside from the wound, was her personality. She was calm, almost bubbly, and was desperate for somebody to hug, even as the black soot began drooling from her mouth.

"Early stages mean they're pretty irritable, but relatively likely to heal. By this stage, they become strategic; they aren't swallowed by the hive mind like the rest. After this? They become no different than the one you just saw. Driven by pure animalistic instinct, or by the hive mind controlling them." Jo explained to me.

At first, I worried that I might still have some of it within me, but Jo was sure he'd purged it from my system.  
I remained unsure, but I was hopeful, so I let the possibility rest.

Now, I'm writing this from Jo's sleeping quarters.  
I was concerned that my previous post would be my first and last, but I guess destiny had other plans.  
I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm not done yet.

Hopefully this isn't my final post either, so, check you later
