I've been having a reoccurring dream recently, it's been keeping me up a night so it's time that I should share this moment with the world. If this is long. I'm sorry, this is every detail I recall. 

In this dream I'd feel like a spectator, I could hear and see everything, but couldn't do anything and people couldn't hear me.

All I could see is a dark house with one light on which was in a boys bedroom. Him and his best friend was watching a video, from what I can hear It's to do with paranormal games, it went from known ones 'Elevator To Another World' and 'The Closet Game', but at number two, my mind began to shiver. It was called 'Blood Smiles', this game, according to the video, had an 85% mortality rate. This game summoned a teenage spirit called 'Jamie' a murder victim, he was butchered by a home invader years ago, the city gave him the symbol of Torment, Fear and Insanity. The game was based around how much pain a person can take. Psychological Pain. Physical Pain. Emotional Pain. The game was run in three rounds with the pains I mentioned, if you could last throughout those rounds, you'd get one free wish. Anything. Money, Health, even Revenge on an enemy. 

The two boys dismissed it as an urban legend. I'll give them code names Boy 1 and Boy 2, they were 17 years old.  

Boy 1 felt confident that he could handle the three rounds and thought that the spirit was just a hoax, he wished for a bully called Callum to be dealt with. Meanwhile Boy 2 wasn't so sure, he thought of the ensured consequences that will happen when dabbling with something humans cannot control. Boy 1 tries everything to convince Boy 2 to risk thier lives to get thier wish. Boy 1 began to change his wish to get two wishes on for Boy 2 to get their reward. Boy 2, after a lot of hesitation he reluctantly agreed. Boy 2 began googling the rules and the steps to start the game. There are 13 rules goes as follows: 

1. In Red Paint You Must Write Jamie's Name On A Piece Of Paper.
2. You Must Prick Your Finger And Give A Drop Of Blood. 
3. Have A Gold Locket Hang From The Ceiling. 
4. Slide The Paper Under The Bathroom Door. 
5. At The Stroke Of Midnight Knock On The Bathroom Door Thirteen Times and at midnight footsteps can be heard  in the bathroom. 
6. Never Look At Jamie In The Eyes Or Ask Questions, He'll take your soul. 
7. You'll notice he'll be in the room when the locket begins swinging and a drop in temperature. 
8. Candle Light Is The Only Light Allowed.
9. You cannot leave the house due to Supernatural Force.
10. At The End Of The Game at 3:33, You Must Go To The Bathroom, You Shall Speak The Jamie Politely To Leave. "Thank you for playing the game, but you are now not welcome, leave now." If Jamie thinks you were rude, his spirit would butcher you. 
11. When Telling Jamie To Leave, Look In The Mirror, but don't look into your own eyes, as you can be switched with your reflection. 
12. You shall hear a saddened moan when he leaves.
13. Your Prize Will Be Given The Next Morning. 

Boy 1 smirks at the last rule thinking the prize was going to be easy. He was going to be wrong. So wrong. Boy 1 grabbed a paint brush  and wrote 'Jamie' on the paper. Boy 2 grabbed a pin, his hand shook as he did it. He pricked his finger and blood dripped onto the paper. Boy 1 did the same. Boy 2 hung a gold locket of Boy 1's mother to the ceiling fan. Boy 1 slid the paper under the bathroom door. The time was 11:55. They stood beside the bathroom door looking at thier phones, they trembled as each minute passed then it became 11:59, Boy 1 raised his fist, and as it turned midnight Boy 1 smashed on the door 13 times. The heard feet drop on the floor like a sloppy noise, and a cold force came through the door. Something flashed and they saw Jamie's spirit . He had a white shirt, with a bright red cross on his body,  hollowed eyes, a stitched and bloody smile. 

Round 1, was Psychlogical Pain. Boy 1 had a confident look but it came to a close as his eyes began to see the most disturbing, torturous and the most brutal visions he could possibly have. His mind forged his family, all smiling but thier jaws began to drop, their eyes hollowed, skin paled and grew claws like witches they tried to slice thier claws aiming to kill . Boy 1 began to go Bezerk. Boy 2 on the other hand's vision was different a wall bashed into him from behind, and two side walls closed in. A Man with a hatchet, the man's face was disfigured, his mouth and eyes were glowing black, swinging a hatchet, as he got closer the floor opened dropping Boy 2, spikes on walls began slowly going towards them. Boy 2 felt dread the sense of death coming onto him, as the spikes began to poke him his vision came back, he couldn't stop shaking not wanting to look into the darkness. Boy 1 was rocking in a fetal position. 

Round 2. Physical Pain. Boy 1 from being in the fetal position. Instantly began feeling a burning sensation, like the type of burning sensation when you graze you knee ripping most of the skin layers off. Boy 2 was plagued with unbearable back pain like he was dealing with osteoporosis hugely struggling to walk and falling on the floor, feeling like he couldn't walk or even move. His breath was cut short with chest pains, heaving and wheezing and coughing blood, he felt stitching being sewn on his back he ripped his shirt off and looked on his back in the living room and it spelt "Burn". Back to Boy 1, as he dealt with the burning sensations, he began feeling tumours fatty tumours like he was going through Dercums Disease, the tumours spread from his ankles to his neck, his tumours began to weaken him making him drop to his knees, like Boy 2, stitches began forming on his back it spelt the word "Fall". The time was 2am. The Final Round Approached, they had a slash on thier backs claw Mark's came and stayed on thier backs. 

Round 3. Emotional Pain. Boy 1, began hearing moaning, it was in a familiar voice, it was grandparents, his grandparents were dealing with health problems already. Hearing the voices, moans, and wails of pain, he felt old finger crawl into his ears, the dread and depressing feeling. His mind felt like a duvet began covering his mind. Boy 2, His Eyes Teared as Jamie reminds him of the heartbreaks of families passing away, mainly his mother. His failures that and the shouting at him, making his failures known and his deepest feelings known. The moment began to gain in intensity breaking thier minds piece by piece down to the last piece. The moment began passing down as they were on thier last legs, the voices stopped the tears stopped flowing. The two looked at the clock and it was 3:32am. Boy 1 ran towards the bathroom and looked into the mirror at his own reflection, he recited the sentence "Thank you for play, but now you're not welcome, leave now." The painful moan came and the game was over. 

Their wishes were granted. Callum, Boy 1's bully had died on his way to school in a hit and run accident. Boy 2's wish came too, thier family won 852 million dollars from the lottery. But joining the 85% mortality. They went into insanity and died two days after the game.
