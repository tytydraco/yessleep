I used to make a lot of videos of me singing and painting. I ended up getting millions of subscribers. I loved all of my fans and I loved all of the kindness and motivation that the community brought me. It was a fantastic way for me to express my creativity.

I would post videos weekly and I would even paint and sing certain things that my fans requested. I truly loved it and I miss it. I will always cherish those days.

It's unfortunate that I had to delete my account and let all of my social media vanish into the void. But, I had to. I had to do it for my safety. 

At first, I thought it was fun having a big community and having all these fans that felt like family to me.
The sad part is that I was naive. I was ignorant to the fact that creeps exist and will do a lot of deranged and inhumane things to get to you.

When I started to get really popular, I noticed that some men would send me some flirty messages. And, then, messages that were obsessive.

I initially thought that it was creepy but it probably happens to a lot of Women. I figured that it wasn't anything special. But, as months and years went by, it only got worse. What really caught my eye was a particular user. 

He would comment very odd things on my post. 
The first one that comes to mind is, "You're the love of my life. You're my beautiful wife. I see you sing and paint for me every single night in my dreams." 
Some comments and even messages would be even weirder. 

I blocked him but he kept making accounts and continued his obsession. He would send me messages threatening to do awful things to me. Threatening to torture me and kidnap me. Anything that you could imagine. His reasoning for it was that I shouldn't have blocked him.

As days, weeks, months, and even years went by, he only got worse. I decided to ignore it as best as I can.
I tried my hardest but he wouldn't give up. It went further than just social media. 

Gifts and letters started being sent to my house. 
The gifts would be roses, candy, teddy bears, and all kinds of things that I mentioned liking in my videos. He would even send things that were talked about in videos that I made years ago.

I don't know how he got my address but I was scared as fuck. I didn't call the police because I felt like I didn't have enough evidence. I was also scared about what he might do to me if he found out. If he somehow knew what my address was, what else could he know? 

I continued posting videos and acting like I was fine when I knew deep down that I was horrified. Every morning, every night, every day was draining. I never knew what would happen. I was in constant fear. Luckily, I was a surprisingly great actress. None of my fans realized that anything was wrong with me.

It all got worse, though.

I was getting ready to post a new video but I kept getting distracted by a sound. It sounded like slight knocking on my doors and windows. I tried to ignore it and tell my self that it's nothing. I stopped trying to make myself feel better when I heard a loud sound coming from the front door.

I got up and went to check it out. My heart fell into my stomach and I stood still. Not moving a muscle out of pure fear. My front door was open and it was quite obvious that someone had broken in. 

I quickly grabbed my phone and called 911. I was horrified and panicking, being consumed by fear. 
I remember hearing a young girls voice ask if I was okay.

I was stuttering and right as I was about to give a clear answer, I was stopped by a man's voice yelling at me. I looked at him, in utter fear and attempted to scream but he threw the phone at the wall and then tried to hurt me. I quickly bit him. And, without thinking, I rushed over to the kitchen to grab a knife. 

My body still remembers what it was like to get grabbed up by him and shoved into the kitchen counter. He left a nasty bruise on my hip. 

My mind still holds the memories of him pulling out a knife. My ears still remember the sound of his voice saying, 

"If I can't have you, then nobody can. You're just like my ex wife, always trying to run off with other guys. You thought you could get rid of me? I'll show you what I did to her!"

I'm forever proud of myself for kicking him in the crotch. After kicking him in the crotch, I proceeded to run out of the front door because I knew that I didn't stand a chance when it comes to a physical fight against him because he has the strength of a pure monster. He was a real life horror movie villain. 

I went to a neighbors house and she let me in. I used her phone to call the cops. She looked terrified as she listened to me speak but I could tell that she was glad that I was okay. 

When the cops showed up, they searched everywhere in my house, searched all around the neighborhood, searched everywhere. They couldn't find a single trace of him. 

I looked for him on social media. I couldn't find him because he deleted his accounts and left not a single ounce of evidence behind. 

That terrible night is why I deleted my social media. I even moved in with my parents for awhile. Hell, I even changed my own name. I wanted safety. 

I will never go back to me being a popular youtuber. I will never go back to that identity ever again. 
This may have happened years ago, however, the fear has never left my soul. 

I feel bad for my fans and I find it quite sad when I see videos about me. People wonder what happened to me. I wish I could tell the world about what really happened to me but I can't. I can't jeopardize my safety. 

I hope that nobody has to encounter that man ever again. I fear for all of the women on the internet because of him. And I still wonder about his ex wife. Was he actually married or did he develop a obsession over her just like he did me?
