The year was 1997 and me and my best friend from college, we'll just call him K (It's based off an old chemistry joke about Potassium, we became friends because of it), were working on a project for some digital street mapping company that popped up along with a lot of other ambitious computer app companies, it died along with them too. But it's the project we worked on that really matters. You see me and K had already completed the entirety of the city we lived in at the time for the company when it went over. We ended up keeping all of the files as the company definitely didn't need them anymore. (I can't confirm it, but I heard the CEO had committed suicide shortly after his company went under. Poor guy.) 

That project ended up sitting in storage for quite a while, after all we had no use for a detailed recreation of an entire city, especially one without any interior details. It wasn't until 2002 we even had a thought about it, in fact, I still remember the moment K reminded me of it. We were in the lab working on a project for Yahoo Mail, we had to fix some inbox glitch or something. K looked over at me after a moment of silence, and said "(me) do you remember what we did with that project for that map company?" The moment he said that I reeled from the memory of programming that just for it to shut down halfway through the planned prototype's build phase. It proved useful after all this time though, me and K had been dipping in game development for a few companies at this time, since we made most of our money from commissions, and VideoGames made up a lot of the market now.

Once we booted up the models, we realized that we already had most of what we needed for a pretty solid open world game. The size of the map was huge! I mean, it was an entire city span! All we really needed to do, was to make interiors for buildings we wanted used, then to make some enemies, and a playable character! We made a basic player script, and decided to really focus on interiors and AI for the enemies. K was better at the modeling stuff, and I did better with the programming, so we decided to split the work in the most efficient way we could, I made the AI, and he did the world map. It wasn't until 2005 when the company shut down that we really put our project into high gear. Since the need for on-demand commission programmers wasn't very high anymore, the company ran out of money, so me and K were out of a job. The company had to sell everything, so me and K ended up buying all of our gear from the company for a pretty good price. We set up a new computer lab in a little single-bed apartment and split the rent. We both got new jobs, and came into the lab at different times, so we didn't really get to see each other there much. One thing we did a lot, was we left sticky notes on the monitors with bugs the one needed fixed while the other was in. (Cellphone's were bulky then, and neither of us had one.)

I came into the lab one day, and I noticed a sticky note on the monitor, it simply read 'please fix the bug that makes it so enemies can change the environment, it's screwing with my landscape.' It was definitely a littl weird, but I figured it was an issue with the vertices of the enemies getting caught with the ones in objects or something. It was an issue that arised with making my own engine, one I had thought that I'd fixed. When I went into the code though, I couldn't figure out what was wrong? I tried to recreate what I thought he was talking about, when I saw it. The NPC's weren't clipping or fusing with the environment, or at least I didn't think that was the issue. They were moving stuff around somehow. Chairs, couch's, TVs, car's, trash bins, whatever moveable object's there were in the game, they'd been pushed around the map. I programed the AI to ignore pushable objects, and it seemed to be working finally. It had already been hours, and it was super late, so I called it a day and forgot to turn off the computer.

I had work back to back at the office job I worked at the time, so I couldn't go into the lab for a few days. When I was finally able to come in though, I found a few sticky notes sitting on the monitors, they were all pretty similar, with an example being:

"Bug with district #3, street #12, lamp post #7 model inverts upon night cycle start"

However, i also noticed a note that read the following:

"Come in dude, actually fix the enemies interaction with the world map please, it's gotten worse, and I don't want to work on the world map much more until it's fixed, the game's somehow saving the changes and I have to manually fix it in the editor and export a new build every time, it's making it frustrating to work on."

This got me pretty worried, how could the enemies be making permanent changes to the project? That shouldn't be possible outside of the editor, and the project is only run in a debug window, there shouldn't be any connection? No matter how far I scrolled into the code I couldn't find anything with any remote connection to this bug. By this point the 'bug' was more like a virus because I couldn't fix it or figure out where the problem was originating from, I knew it was either a problem with the world map, or the enemies AI. 

I looked through the changes he was writing about and it was a mess. I could tell before I ran it that K had fixed most of whatever changes were made other than slight graphical glitches here and there with the world map. The game had pretty much been repaired, but the moment I ran the program it all jumped into chaos. The map was rapidly changing, building were moving being destroyed and.. built? The map went from a city to a massive cluster of mesh's in about 2 minutes, I was honestly too awestruck to shut down the program, or really do anything. The landscape looked desolate with no NPC's or proper buildings standing anymore, all there was now was an  enormous collaboration of warped walls and broken objects, It was like a massive corrupted city inside of a broken tower. After everything settled, I shut it all down and went home.

I didnt go back to the lab for at least 2 weeks, I didn't go back until I realized I couldn't get ahold of K, and no one else knew were he was. When I finally went back I found K, sitting in the same office chair he sat in when we first started in that lab together all of those years ago, he sat there with his wrists slit, and he was dead. I saw something out of the corner of my eye in the computer screen, a face. I saw it staring at me for a brief moment before the computer went dark, and no, I don't mean a picture of someone looking in my general direction or something, I mean a face, in the game me and K have been working on for years, staring at me. I didn't get a good look at it, but it was disgusting. It looked like the enemy model i designed with K, mixed with his face, and bleeding out of every pore, I threw up. I couldn't handle it, the blurry image of that thing etched into my brain, while I was forced by my own eyes to stare at my best friends body. After what felt like years of waiting I finally called the cops, they got a statement from me, I left out the part about the computer for.. probably good reason, and after some time I could finally go back into the apartment, not that I wanted to. 

K's funeral was small, he didn't have family, and I was his only friend. It was held on a Saturday morning at 7:00 AM. The day was cloudy, the sun was no where to be seen. After the funeral, I went back to the lab. I knew I couldn't leave that computer, or any of those files intact, I had to do something. I'm writing this to you now as I wait for the fire to consume me. Don't come looking for this lab, and don't try to recover anything from it. The devil lives inside this computer, and I programed him.
