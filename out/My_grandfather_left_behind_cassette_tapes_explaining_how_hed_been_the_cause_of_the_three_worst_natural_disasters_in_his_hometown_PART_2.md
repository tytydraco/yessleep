[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y2836i/my_grandfather_left_behind_cassette_tapes/)

First and foremost, I’d like to apologize for ending my last post so abruptly. I had just finished transcribing it and…well…let’s just say that hearing it for a second time certainly didn’t dull the impact it had on me.

I remember that after posting it, I sat silently in my room.

I remembered something about my grandfather.

I remembered how whenever I’d visit, he’d always have a plate of pancakes ready for me.

I was sure it had been my grandmother who’d them for me , but I can now clearly remember my grandfather’s strong muscular back facing me as he flipped pancake after pancake, wearing a ridiculous apron that would always make me giggle as he’d put the maple-syrup mountains in front of me.

It was only this memory that gave me strength to listen to the second tape.

The second tape was also labeled with a Sharpie, but this one read “WOLF”.

The transcript below is one I made a week after the first one.

Why did it take me so long to put finger to keyboard key?

Well, lets just say that I needed some time to let things sink in.

&#x200B;

The following is what the second tape had recorded on it:

*\*Ten seconds of silence\**

*I…don’t need you to believe me David.*

*Hell…even I doubt it.*

*I also wondered if those memories were just the result of a child’s imagination.*

*Kanterville really was leveled by a massive tsunami, but as time passed…I’m ashamed to admit that I forgot about Rosanne. At first, I forgot her voice…then what we used to do together…then her name…and then I lost her smile.*

*I was sixteen or seventeen.*

*The tsunami that leveled Kanterville had been caused by a massive landslide into the reservoir.*

*I feared large bodies of water like lakes and even coasts and found sharks too horrendous to look at.*

*And I had long forgotten the reason why.*

*I just did.*

*Every day was the same.*

*My mother would always be applying iodine to any new wounds she might gave gotten, and there would always be three more beer bottles to be weary of when walking through the house.*

*During that summer, I’d take long walks in a forest that bordered my town.*

*It was much, much larger than the one between my town and Kanterville, and I would walk in it for hours every day.*

*If I was lucky…I’d see a particular deer and her small fawn.*

*I always enjoyed observing them more than anything else.*

*The way how the mother nuzzled her young and how she helped him standup up when he himself couldn’t always warmed my frozen heart.*

*I always wondered how my father could be below a wild animal…but he was.*

*The days all melted together.*

*I could only get a sense of time by seeing how the small fawn would grow.*

*The fawn and his mother could reliably be found in the same spot most of the time; a small clearing out in the woods.*

*I would always hide behind this large jagged boulder and observe them, envious of their peace.*

*Well, one day, after a particularly bad day at home, I was out on my walk in the evening.*

*I went to the boulder as always and climbed it to get a good view.*

*But instead of seeing the fawn cuddling up against its mother, I saw it shaking madly while a grizzly bear dug at its mother’s carcass, eating and sheering off meat as though it were a person eating a watermelon.*

*It was massive David.*

*To this day, I have never seen a bear that large.*

*It couldn’t even be considered a bear.*

*When it lifted the mutilated deer by its head, its entire length, from its skinny hooves to its crushed head,  went from the ground up to the eyes of that bear, which meant that the beast was at least six feet tall on all fours.*

*Never has time slowed down for me as much as when I realized this.*

*Each bite seemed to last forever.*

*I had to escape.*

*I needed to.*

*But then, after it was done with the mother’s carcass, it turned its attention to the small fawn.*

*I should have run.*

*But instead, I shouted with all of might at it.*

*David…I can only say that I made it as far as I did because of the uneven terrain and because my bipedal physiology gave me an advantage in dexterity.*

*Otherwise, I’m not sure there would have been anything left of me.*

*I somehow ran deeper into the woods than I would have ever been willing to go during daylight, let alone nighttime.*

*All I know is that by the time I came to, I was standing in front of a gigantic cliff overlooking the forest.*

*The sun peeked out just barely enough for me to make out the monster lumbering towards me out of the thick vegetation I had absentmindedly walked through.*

*I was dead in that moment.*

*Either the cliff would take me, or that bear.*

*I chose the former.*

I wanted to die.

*Home wasn't safe.*

*And this forest wasn't safe either.*

*I told myself to jump.*

*I commanded myself to jump.*

*But my legs were nothing short of nailed to the ground.*

*The monstrous brute stood up on its hind legs, and looked like a wave that was about to engulf me.*

*It breathed heavily, as though its breathing was depended on a corroded and rusted engine piston.*

*Its pupils held nothing behind them.*

*Only hunger.*

*Hunger for me.*

*I closed my eyes shut the moment I knew it was about to attack.*

*But then something unexpected happened.*

*A sound much louder than the roar of the lunging beast.*

*Then nothing.*

*It was as if the sudden gunshot had made the monster go away.*

*I was covered in blood.*

*The bear lay in front of me, its head blown to smithereens.*

*My savior came out of the dense vegetation and he stood still once in my line sight.*

*He was an older gentleman, maybe about seventy, same age as I am now, if I had to guess, but only his face showed it.*

*His hunting jacket held a great wave of muscle and grit at bay, and his stained teeth smiled warmly.*

*Ferguson was what he went by.*

*He had a modest cabin not too far.*

*I took a shower there.*

*He gave me food.*

*And I fell asleep to him telling me stories about his time in the second World War.*

*The next morning, I was back home, invigorated with a new sense of life and meaning.*

*My parents couldn’t care less.*

*My old man was happy to have me out of the house for most of the day and my mother was too broken to hold any concern.*

*So, I spent most of my summer that year visiting Ferguson.*

*He would give me books which made my imagination run amok.*

*He would tell me stories which never failed to leave me in awe.*

*And he always had the patience to listen to whatever I had to say.*

*He taught me how to shoot a rifle.*

*He taught me the value of life and why there must be patience in living it.*

*And he taught me how to love myself, so that I could enjoy my life.*

*He was the parent I wish I had always had.*

*The first day of school was approaching, and I knew I had to go.*

*Despite everything, I had managed to get good grades, and was in the works for a scholarship at a college in the next town over to study chemistry.*

*I knew I couldn’t visit Ferguson anymore because I would have to give it my all this last year, and he understood.*

*But even so, I didn’t feel right to just leave as suddenly as he had come into my life.*

*I wanted to give him something as a thank you for everything he’d done for me.*

*And I knew just the thing to give him.*

*…*

*A scarf.*

*I know it might sound odd, but the man barely had any clothes at all, and I knew that winter would be upon the town soon, so I resolved to make him a scarf.*

*It was a challenge, I should say, and I was barely able to make a passable scarf that I was confident to give to him.*

*I still remember that day David.*

*My father had had a particularly bad fit that day, and I could only leave at night.*

*I trekked through the dense vegetation alone, muscle memory being the only thing guiding me through the suffocating darkness.*

*I carried the scarf in a present I had wrapped, and my thoughts overtaken with the image of me giving the scarf Ferguson and the sight of him smiling.*

*But soon I was stopped dead in my tracks by the sound of leaves rusting behind me.*

*The sound of my father’s drunken voice just about made my soul collapse.*

*I was on the ground before I knew it, my left arm, my jaw, and my right shin broken, and Ferguson’s scarf lay right in front of me, before my father.*

*The smell of gasoline wafted through my nostrils, and I was too late to act when I heard the strike of a matchstick.*

*The darkness receded, tearing out of me the hope I had for delivering the scarf to Ferguson, much like how one would pull a fish out of the water.*

*My father’s berates failed to reach my ears.*

*I was deaf to every other sound, only able to register the sound of the flames crackling in front of me.*

*It was then that I felt that familiar twinge of anger again.*

*The very same one I'd felt that day so long ago.*

*Small at first, but it wasn’t long before it started to fester.*

*Each word coming out of my father’s mouth was like another bucket of gasoline onto the small wicker of flame in my heart.*

*The flame kept growing hotter and hotter and larger and larger within me.*

*I tried keeping it in, my instincts all too aware of the memory I had long since suppressed into the bowels of my mind.*

*I really did.*

*I used every ounce of will and strength that I could to keep it in.*

*But I sneezed the moment he called Ferguson “just another heathenish kiddie-fucker”.*

*I sneezed with all of my might.*

*My snot was burned to nothing by the fire I sneezed it into.*

*I realized my mistake the moment I made it.*

*I no longer felt any anger.*

*The fire started to sputter, and I saw the orange flame morph into a bloody red.*

*I started to crawl back.*

*My father saw this and his eyes became like those of an angered bull.*

*He rushed at me, but as he stepped over the burning scarf to do so, a massive flame whipped up and wrapped itself around him like a tentacle.*

*I then saw him burning as the fire started to spread.*

*They weren’t even flames David.*

*They looked like infinite Mandelbrot spirals, claws like the waves in Japanese silk art. They tore everything, sheering him off bit by bit, disintegrating more like vengeful acid than denaturing fire.*

*As my father turned to ash, flames started to slither out.*

*They slithered.*

*Oh god...they slithered.*

*Like great pythons, or fissures forming in the earth, they approached nearby trees and started to consume them too, like a horde of locusts wiping out entire fields.*

*Even from afar, it felt like I was standing at the edge of a volcano.*

*The air felt like pressurized steam, scalding my skin like boiling water.*

*I couldn’t run for the life of me, but even if I could, that ability would’ve soon been taken from me by what happened next.*

*From my father’s ashen remains, the fire that consumed him rose like billowing smoke.*

*And in that great wall of heat and insatiable gluttony, I saw a pair of eyes form and focus on me.*

*They were wild.*

*They were feral.*

*But they weren’t like those of the bear.*

*They weren’t empty.*

*They were two pockets of volcanic magma that burned themselves in my mind and corroded my will to escape.*

*I was going to die. I knew as much.*

*But then, while the fire was still stationary, gathering nutrients by burning the forest around it, something stepped in between us.*

*It was a deer.*

*A deer much bigger than any other I had ever seen.*

*Its size was more reminiscent of a large moose.*

*Without warning, the gigantic deer lowered itself in front of me, and I immediately knew that it wanted me to climb on top of it.*

*I was barely able to do so, but the moment I laid myself over it like a rag over a towel rack, it leaped up and started to run.*

*The speed with which it moved is indescribable to me even now to this day.*

*The wind, broken by its humongous antlers like ice broken by the bow of a sturdy ship, rushed through me with such force that it ruffled my hair like a great and mighty gale.*

*I thought I was finally out of danger.*

*I thought that God had saved me.*

*But then I turned around, and realized that the devil would not let me go that easily.*

*The flames were approaching.*

*No…They were running David.*

*It was they who were the great and mighty gale, approaching us a like an enormous dust bowl.*

*Among those searing flames, I saw those eyes again, but to my horror, the flames around them started to mold and form until they vaguely resembled a gray wolf.*

*That was my hunter.*

*I was its prey.*

*Everything in its path was its prey.*

*And one of those things was me.*

*A dark cloud of ash hung over the forest.*

*Me and my helper would soon be surrounded.*

*Escape would become impossible.*

*But then, just when hope was lost, a figure burst out from behind one of the bushes and ran past us.*

*Ferguson held his rifle and was still as spry as ever.*

*I wanted to scream at him, but he paid me no mind. All I remember is him turning back for a quick smile before the deer leapt over a slanted cliff and slid down.*

*The fire wasn’t upon us anymore.*

*I could see the clearing not long after.*

*But as soon as we were near it, the deer suddenly stopped and I was launched forward as if riding a speeding motorcycle that had abruptly come to a screeching halt while still going at full speed.*

*I skidded off the grassy ground, and the deer disappeared behind the thick woods.*

*Not too far away, I saw my father’s car.*

*I dragged myself in it and, to my great luck, the keys were still in, and with that, I drove off.*

*I thought about going back for Ferguson.*

*I thought about stopping for my mother.*

*I thought about shouting out of the car that there was a great fire.*

*But I didn’t.*

*I felt as though I had been wronged by everything and everyone in town.*

*It had abandoned me.*

*My father had abandoned me.*

*My mother had abandoned me.*

*The love of my life had abandoned me.*

*And, as embarrassed as I am to admit this, I concluded that my surrogate father had just abandoned me as well.*

*I knew I’d always wanted everything to burn to ash.*

*So I drove.*

*And as I drove, it started to rain.*

*I thought God had come to help.*

*But I soon realized that he didn’t want me to escape from my sins so easily.*

*The car skidded off the watery road and turned over, and I barely managed to climb out, more injured than before.*

*I could see the entire town in the distance from where I was, and rising above the woods, I saw a great mountain of flame.*

*The rain was powerless to extinguish it.*

*Its heat made the water evaporate before it touched it.*

*It was like a hide that protected it from a volley of arrows.*

*I saw it lean back, smoke billowing around it like fur for its fiery musculature, and now that it looked more like a wolf, it unleash a howl that echoed throughout the land, like a volcano exploding.*

*I saw as it spilled out of the forest slowly like the lumbering bear, consuming everything in its path.*

*I am unable to put into words the despair that I felt as I saw this.*

*The rain weighed me down, as though the countless hands of those having turned into ash were forcing me to watch what I had unleashed.*

*I felt hopeless.*

*I wanted hope.*

*And then I thought that God had finally abandoned me as well.*

*That's what I assumed when the urge to sneeze came upon me again.*

*I didn’t feel angry.*

*I jabbed my index fingers in my nostrils as far as they would go.*

*I had no intention of creating another monster.*

*But when my lungs reflexively expanded, the snot was pulled down along my throat, which made me violently cough it out of my mouth; my hands unable to block it in time.*

*I coughed the snot on a puddle, and I saw the water go terribly still despite its surface being violently pelted by the rain.*

*The wolf destroyed and consumed in the distance.*

*I was sure it would grow to the size of a mountain and burn the entire continent to a barren wasteland of nothingness.*

*But then the puddle started to rise.*

*I saw it morph and mold itself into what I could swear was the tiniest of deer, like a miniature glass sculpture you’d find in a pawn shop.*

*It moved towards the edge of the hill I was on and started to run down it like a sled.*

*With every gallop through the forest, collecting the dew in every leaf, as well as the rain falling from the heavens, it grew larger and larger in size.*

*The once tiny deer became gargantuan wave that pushed forwards, its antlers reared down.*

*I saw it collide with that flaming wolf, whose size it now matched, and like an elephant colliding with the ground after being thrown off of a skyscraper, it exploded into a blast of shimmering rain that shot itself in every which way, like an atomic bomb if I do say so myself, the steam rising up back into the sky reminding me of a mushroom cloud.*

*I passed out then, either out of exhaustion or relief, maybe a combination of both, but the next thing I know, emergency services were picking me up, and I later saw on the news how there wasn't a town named Kanterville anymore, along with hundreds of square miles worth of forest.*

*At the time, there was only a gigantic sizzling crater that has now become, as I record this, a vast plain of recovering nature.*

*They could never give a conclusive death toll, as there were no bodies to speak of.*

*There was nothing to speak of.*

*I went to live with my aunt.*

*I got my degree.*

*And I forgot about this incident as well.*

*I forgot about Ferguson much like how I forgot about Rosanne.*

*I forgot about both of them, even thought they’d sacrificed themselves to save me.*

*I guess I didn’t want to remember.*

*I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.*

*But I guess fate didn’t want me to forget.*

*I say this because one day, in my dormitory, I found a mailbox on my bed.*

*Inside...I found a scarlet scarf in perfect condition, with a faint stench of gasoline and only a small burn mark where I remembered my father tossing the match.*

*I didn’t go to class for a week after that.*

I *just...laid in bed with that scarf wrapped around me.*

*\*a full minute of silence\**

*Having said all that David...do you still love me?*

*How do you feel knowing what you know now?*

*It’s okay if you hate me.*

*I just wish I could have told you all of this in person.*

*But most of all, I just want to ask you one last thing.*

*Did you like my pancakes, David?*

*Because I loved whenever Ferguson made me those pancakes to eat every time I visited.*

*I only wish that you’ve enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed them.*

*For his sake.*

*And mine as well...however meaningless that must no doubt be now for you.*

The fourth and final tape rests right under the screen of my computer.

&#x200B;

I don't know why ,but I have a feeling that "RAVEN" may take me longer to transcribe than the other ones.

&#x200B;

I hope I'm wrong.
