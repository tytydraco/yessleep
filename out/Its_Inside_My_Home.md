I don't know how to explain this without sounding completely insane, but there's something in my apartment right now and I think it wants to hurt me. I have no one I can tell in person. I'm too scared they won't believe me or try and have me committed or something. Most people won't believe you if you tell them some kind of entity you can't see is messing with you. I'm not even sure how many people who read this will believe me, but I have to do something. I just want to know if anyone else knows what's happening or what I can do to stop it.

I really don't think I summoned anything. I don't do anything like that. Before any of this happened, I didn't believe in the supernatural in any way, shape, or form. So I don't think that's it. This all started last week. I walked into my apartment after work and was hit with that uneasy feeling deep in my stomach. You know when it just feels like something is very wrong? That's what I felt. I couldn't pinpoint what, but something was off. I even tried checking under my bed and in my closet for anything that could be hiding. Nothing was moved or changed and nothing new was in here. I figured I was just having bad anxiety at the time.

While in bed that night, I felt a weight on my body, like someone was holding down my shoulders. Whenever I opened my eyes I couldn't see anything but the weight was still there. I was too scared to move but also too scared to go back to sleep. So I laid there the rest of night feeling the weight. As the sun came up, the weight slowly lifted but I felt restricted all over my body. It was like my clothes were too tight. At times I felt a tug around my throat like I was being choked. The restrictive feeling continued until I left my apartment's parking lot.

At work I felt fine. Completely normal. I was so scared to return to my own place, I called a friend and spent Tuesday night with her. There was no tightness around my body that night but I did feel what I could only describe as a slither down my arm. It felt like a worm was sliding down my arm just under my skin. I looked and didn't see any moving bumps, so I just brushed it off at the time. Realistically, I knew I couldn't just keep crashing at my friend's house, so I went back home Wednesday night.

As soon as I got on my porch, I felt the restriction clutch at my body. I knew that it wasn't just anxiety at that moment. The next few nights were the same. Restriction while I was up and moving, even if I was completely naked and a weight on me as I slept. One night I managed to get up, just to see, and I was able to move but my whole body felt heavy. Have you ever been really sick and it feels like your whole body is three times heavier than normal? That was how it felt. I was able to fall back asleep, but sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night because it felt like I was being crushed.

When I'm not laying down and trying to go to sleep, I feel that slither on different parts of my body. It's like something is gliding right on the muscle inside my body, but I swear, I don't see anything under the skin. So I don't think there's anything inside of me. I think whatever entity is in here is messing with me by doing this. Saturday night the slither was deeper in my body almost, entwined around my ribcage. I felt the movement on each rib, slow, winding around one a couple of times and then slinking down to curl around the bone below. I even felt it move across my spine at one point.

I know people will suggest going to a doctor, but for what? It's just a feeling. They'll probably try and tell me I'm having some psychosis episode, but I'm not. Nothing is actually inside of my body, but something is making it feel that way. I swear something is here. It's in my home. Nust a little while ago, after getting home from work, I heard whispering. Not words and honestly, I couldn't even tell you if it was a guy or girl's voice, but there was a whispering sound. It was this very fast chattering that I couldn't make out, but it sounded angry. Then the slither came back, but in my gums. It moved from the back of my mouth, across the roots of my teeth right below the gum line.

I think things are escalating fast, and I don't know who I can contact for help. I can't just pack up and move and I don't think staying in a hotel or friend's house for a few days will do much. Anytime I go out it's always back here. And I can feel that slithering while I'm out, it's faint but there. This needs to be eliminated right here at the source. What would I even need when I don't know what this entity is? A priest, an exorcist, a witch, a psychic? 

The most troubling that happened and really pushed me into posting this now just happened a few minutes ago. I was brushing my teeth and glanced up at my reflection and noticed the teeth in the mirror were sharp and jagged, almost like a shark's. When I went to take a closer look, the reflection faintly smiled. I also noticed, the reflections eyes were an emerald green butâ€¦my eyes are blue.
