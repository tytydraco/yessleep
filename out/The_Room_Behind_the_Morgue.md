When I was twenty-six, I moved away from my family to New York City. I had never been particularly close with them, and so the move didn’t bother me all that much. Our grandmother on my mom’s side had been the glue that stuck us together, and once she died, the family dynamic disintegrated. We only got together for big events, like weddings and funerals, both dismal affairs. 

You may find my attitude off-putting. To that, I tell you honestly, I understand. Most people do. I ask you more to pay attention to the contents of the story I tell, rather than my somber disposition. 

So, when my cousin got engaged, that meant my parents implored me to come back to Connecticut for the engagement party. I could already see the way it was going to go - lots of long conversations about where I had been, reminiscing about the old days before our grandmother died, when we still acted like a family. 

Reluctantly, I packed an overnight bag and took the Metro North to New Haven. There’s a decaying quality about that train ride, watching as concrete crumbles to stone walls. I passed time by fixing my hair in the window. My parents picked me up at the train station so we could all head to the party together. They filled me in on all the recent news - this uncle had developed dementia, this one had finally succumbed to his alcoholism. What topics I should broach, which I should avoid because they were still sensitive subjects. I figured it would be best to give my congratulations and remain mostly silent, since I had a habit of putting my foot in my mouth. 

The engagement party was being hosted at my aunt’s house, and the dead-end street was already lined with cars. Looking through the chainlink fence to the backyard, I could see that everyone was dressed in bright colors. Apparently, I hadn’t made a careful consideration on the color I was wearing because I was in all black. Again, a dismal affair. Immediately, I felt the disconnect, the lack of belonging that I had always felt as a child. It made me a bit squirmy to be honest, and I spent most of the party rubbing my elbow awkwardly. 

I said my congratulations to my cousin, who had always been a sweet girl. We had been good friends when we were younger, but family is always fickle like that. I have no ill-will towards her - of course, I always wish her the best - but we had long since gone our separate ways and spending time with her only reminded me of our grandmother’s death. There was a reason I had once decided to move away. Regardless, we talked for a bit and I admired the flashy ring on her finger, though I made austere comments about it so as not to seem superficial. Eventually, another one of her friends came up to us and pulled her away from the conversation. My chest loosened in response. 

I scanned the backyard party and headed straight for the little table set up with a few bottles of liquor. I decided on whiskey on the rocks. 

There were cheap foldable tables set up with white tablecloths, surrounded by plastic chairs. I selected an empty table and sat, quietly nursing my whiskey and trying to avoid eye contact. Most people were stuck in groups of those they already knew - parties with mixed company are always so awkward. I turned my attention to the yard, and the dogs. It was a seasonably warm October day, and the sun was filtering gently onto the sparse grass, so I didn’t mind the time spent outdoors. 

As I took another sip of whiskey, now halfway through my glass, I made eye contact with my aunt. She smiled, nodding her chin and shifting her gait towards me. I’ve always liked my aunt. She is one of the very few truly pure souls on this planet, and I do believe if there were a heaven she would go to it. I sat a little straighter, not averse to the company. 

We went on the usual roundabout of conversation, an awkward one-armed hug while she lamented how it had been so long since she had seen me. She smelled like tropical shampoo and coffee. 

“What are you up to?”

“Oh, you know, just working at the hospital still.”

“Oh, I hear you, the same for me. As a nurse?”

I shook my head. “No, not a nurse like you, just a lab tech. It’s okay, though, I like repetitive work.”

“Really?” She asked me. “I don’t like the repetitive stuff, but that’s what’s so great about being in the ED. Every day is different!”

I smiled. “I like the comfort of routine. When you helped me get into that volunteering program at your hospital, I did all these repetitive tasks that no one else wanted because I loved to do it.”

“Oh yes, the program for teens!” She nodded, folding her fingers together and laying them on the plastic tablecloth. “Yes, they still have that going on. What a great program.”

“I bet they have stricter standards now,” I said as I took another sip. I could feel the alcohol starting to loosen my tongue. It felt nice. “They probably wouldn’t get away with some of the things they used to do anymore.”

At that, my aunt’s face darkened slightly, her expression confused. “Like what?”

I swirled the ice in my cup, watching it circle. “Oh, you know, like they used to leave me in the room behind the morgue by myself to sort through the archived tissue slides. They had me get rid of all the old ones, past ten years old, the ones we didn’t have to keep anymore.”

My aunt didn’t move, just stared at me. “What room behind the morgue?”

I took in her confused, slightly alarmed expression. I shifted my weight a little, cleared my throat. “Um, you know, you would walk into the morgue, the main part where they do the autopsies, and then through the back space where they hold the bodies, and then there was this door and this room with all these filing cabinets, up to the ceiling. It was a tiny room, more like a closet.”

My aunt didn’t say anything, just sort of stared at me, her mouth open slightly. 

I took another sip of whiskey, unease starting to twist my stomach. “Maybe they didn’t really want anyone down there, which is why I’m the only one they took there, and I bet they definitely don’t do that anymore because there’s no way any other kids would agree to being left in the morgue with bodies being stored down there. I mean, I’m sure they don’t allow that anymore. Sorry if that made you upset, to hear that they were doing kind of shady shit.” I didn’t mean to swear, it just sort of slipped out with my word vomit and nerves.

But my aunt shook her head, holding up a hand. “No, no it’s not that.”

I swallowed. The sunlight faded in my peripheral vision. “What is it then?”

She made a clicking sound with her tongue. “It’s just…I mean I’ve worked in that hospital for thirty years. I started there right after school. I’ve been in just about every room in there and…”

“What?” My hands curled into the plastic chair. 

She shook her head, making confused eye contact with me. “There’s no room behind the morgue.”

Suddenly, I was hit with a wave of frustration. “What? That doesn’t make any sense. The door was in the far corner, where the ground started to slope up a little because the floors were warping.”

My aunt didn’t respond to what I said. She was staring somewhere behind me, lost in thought. “Who used to take you down there?” She asked.

“It was an older lady who worked in the lab.” I remembered it clearly. “Cindy, she said her name was.”

My aunt chewed on her thumb and didn’t say anything. “Huh.”

Eventually, someone tapped on my aunt’s shoulder and pulled her away. No one was capable of running the party by themselves, they needed her to do it for them and so she could hardly have a moment’s peace. I nodded my goodbye, but left the conversation feeling small and foolish. How could I misremember such an important detail? Maybe the room wasn’t behind the morgue, but near it, and I was just confused? But no, I remembered the details clearly. The bodies on gurneys, covered by white sheets, feet sticking up at the ends, straight and taut. I remembered the smell of stainless steel, disinfectant, and formaldehyde. I would leave the little storage closet with cuts on my fingers, because sometimes the slides were sharp and I remembered one time the cut got infected because the slides were dirty. And most of all, I remembered Cindy. Small, a bit hunched, and she never said much. She had these fuchsia glasses that hung around her neck. 

I got up to hurry back to the liquor table, and swiftly poured myself more whiskey. 

My aunt hadn’t said anything else about the matter during the rest of the party, and when we said goodbye, she just looked at me kind of straight-faced and said that she hoped I stayed well. I figured that maybe she was just disturbed that they had brought teenage volunteers down into the morgue and left them there without anyone knowing. I figured I had probably just gotten poor Cindy in trouble, if she still worked there and wasn’t dead yet. 

On Monday, I took the train back into the city, and my life resumed as normal. Work and bustle and the memory of the party on the previous Saturday fell into my memories. 

A few days later, I arrived home after work, greeted by the dark apartment, and set my things down. My phone vibrated in my pocket so I took it out to look at it. 

There was a long message from my aunt. 

Aunt G: *Hello Lil, hope you are doing well and had a safe trip back home. I did more investigation into what you said after our conversation. The thought of some secret room, where they take children and leave them without my knowledge, quite honestly, disturbed me. So, I investigated the morgue, even going so far as to check for false walls and hidden doors, with no luck*. 

Beneath this paragraph, she had inserted a photo of the wall space I had mentioned. It was smooth, no indication of any closet door. My toes went cold. 

*I even went as far as to ask for a blueprint from the building manager. The plans also show no indication of a room in the place you mentioned. Furthermore, we have no record of an employee in the lab named Cindy, not in the last fifty years. We’re worried about you, Sweetie. Keep in touch.*

I closed the message. This peculiarity troubled me into the night and still to this day. I know that some of you will say that perhaps I am delusional, perhaps it’s just a consequence of my dreary temperament and an overactive imagination. Perhaps I remembered wrong, though the neon fuchsia of her glasses is a memory that sticks with me to this day. I was a quiet kid who didn’t have enough friends, and so maybe I had invented one. Perhaps I was a lonely enough soul for this entity to find me, and latch onto me. Perhaps I too float in the liminal spaces between life and death. It remains to me more of a curiosity than a concern. Cindy was a pleasant woman, albeit a bit odd, and never seemed to mean me harm. Still, I wonder about the nature of these encounters, and liken it to the world of the parallel and unearthly. I know many will not believe me. 

But, I was never one to need reassurance. And in this case, of the Room Behind the Morgue, I know what I saw.
