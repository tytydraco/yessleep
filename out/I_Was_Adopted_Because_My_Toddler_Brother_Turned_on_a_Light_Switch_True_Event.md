My parents had severe COVID. My dad asked me to cut our neighbor Mr. Jensen's grass. He had just returned from the military and had cut ours while we were on holiday, so I returned the favor. My parents were too tired to watch my 4-year-old brother, Tom, at night, so they said I could stay up late and watch him.

I played Fortnite and kept a video monitor on full volume so I could hear if he got up. On Monday, Tom woke up around midnight and was messing in his room. I put him back to bed. On Tuesday, it was the same. I noticed he had kept trying to play with the door handle.

By Wednesday, the day I cut the grass, I was on my computer when I saw the monitor. I saw Tom get up and fiddle with the light switch. Instead of going, I just watched. It was weird. I got the video from the SD card and pulled up a Morse code translator online. My heart pounded as I entered what I thought was a pattern. To my shock, it translated to "BURGLAR." Just as I was trying to convince myself it was nothing, perhaps from being tired, I heard a loud bang from downstairs.

I sprang up out of my room and ran to the landing to peek downstairs. As I ran past my parents' room, I heard them also jumping out of bed. My dad had a gun, so this kind of helped the situation. I glanced downstairs but to my surprise, saw Mr. Jensen with his gun raised, pointing and pivoting it around the kitchen like he was assessing it. I realized he might have seen the lights and he knows Morse code.

I went a few steps down to tell him there's no issue, but he whipped the gun towards me, quickly moved it away, and later said he recognized me.

I tried to say, "My brother upstairs messed with the lights, and nobody's in danger." But it came out as, "He's upstairs, it's the lights," because I was so scared. The police later told me Mr. Jensen thought I was saying the burglar is upstairs and that I did the lights, like it was me asking for help.

Because of this, when my dad came springing down behind me, Mr. Jensen reacted instantly with total accuracy. He shot my dad, who tumbled down, dead. I was half deafened by my mother’s scream.

The police arrived quickly. They questioned everyone and took Mr. Jensen away. He later admitted he saw the lights and the word burglar and misunderstood what I was saying. He also admitted his paranoia and PTSD from serving had made him do what he did.

My mom died from COVID 13 days later. I remember just crying and crying next to her bed at the hospital. I’ll always remember that the ventilator she was on was a German brand named Bür-Gliër.

So, here I am three months later. They did the math and the chances of that happening were one in 6.284 million. But just in case it happened again, I asked my new parents to raise the light switch in my brother's room so he can't reach it for the next few years. They are my third set of parents, and I refused the previous two because they had neighbors. Now we live in the country, far from anyone else.
