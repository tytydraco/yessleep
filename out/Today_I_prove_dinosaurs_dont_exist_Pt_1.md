**Part 1**

If you trust in God, He will provide for you. That’s what my mother always said. When things got too much, my mother would kneel beside her bedside table with a small gold cross her grandmother had given her, clutched tightly in her hands. She’d pray and reflect with Him on what she should do next. As a young girl, I didn’t always understand why she did this. Not until my husband Tim died.  

He died in a head-on collision after a freak stroke at thirty-five. Crashed the car right into some oak trees outside the hospital downtown. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Our kids were younger then, middle school and elementary age. They slept in my bed for months after the accident. We were all a little more afraid of losing each other. I’d squeeze them so tightly to my body as if I could somehow reabsorb them back inside me. Keep them safe and warm forever. I didn’t sleep for days after he died. I barely ate. I couldn’t believe it. We were supposed to grow old together. Watch our kids grow and become people. Welcome grandchildren into the world. Visions of memories that would never happen haunted me for weeks after the accident. Until one day, I heard a voice. It was low and soothing. A man’s voice that reminded me of Tim’s. *The drawer. Open the drawer.* 

My hands trembled as I reached out for my nightstand. It was the only drawer close to me. Pulling it open, the gold cross glittered underneath my lamp. It cast the necklace in a bright, rainbow halo that brought tears to my eyes. It lay atop my small bible like it had been waiting for me this whole time. I grasped the cross tightly between my fingers. So tight that it dug painfully in my hands, but that pain reminded me that I was alive. I slid to my knees in front of my nightstand. I prayed for hours, conversing with God back and forth. All my fears, shattered dreams, and dread became His. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders when I rose again. I haven’t taken off the gold cross since. I often moved to grasp it in times when I felt scared or uncertain. The times I needed His strength the most. 

After that day, I never walked alone. I started encouraging my kids to go to church with me every Wednesday and Sunday. I enrolled them in church sports, Sunday School, and summer camp. My eldest, Ellie, took to it like a fish to water. She flourished under His light. However, my son Grant was much more resistant to the change. Without his father, I struggled to make sure he had all the teachings a young boy could get from a strong male figure. I encouraged him to speak and meet with our pastor for guided sessions with Him. Grant always hesitated and was nervous, always so unsure of himself. 

I blamed myself for not noticing some of the more concerning signs in my son earlier on. He liked to play with my makeup and run around in my heels as a young boy. I noticed how his eyes lingered on attractive men in advertisements and TV shows. I tried asking him about any girls he may have a crush on in school, but he always brushed me off. 

“I’m too busy with school, Mom.” 

Then I found the messages he’s been sending to his friend Malcolm. Grant and Malcolm have been attached at the hip since the fifth grade. Now that he is starting high school, I know a young boy’s feelings can get tangled up with his hormones. I told him that I loved him, but I wanted him to be with me and Ellie in heaven. Everything I’ve read about being a part of the LGBT community tells me it makes you more depressed, more likely to be in abusive relationships, and increases the risk of STDs. Grant was quiet for most of our conversation. I told him that God would guide him to the correct path only if he was willing to listen.

Things were better for a while after that. I would occasionally take Grant’s phone to check on his activity, but he stopped messaging Malcolm. He even started texting a girl named Lex, and it seemed like they were planning a third date together. I told him how proud I was of him for starting to move past his confusion with Malcolm. But I’ve started to notice other ways Grant keeps pulling away from me. He stopped helping me in the garden, stopped going to church, and kept to his room most of the time. He was moody and unpredictable. This worried me a lot. I kept pestering him to join us for church and perhaps even meet with our pastor for a man-to-man talk. Ellie told me I was being too much. She thought I was pushing him away by trying to force him into acting a certain way. What a ridiculous thing to say to me. As if fighting for the soul of my son wasn’t the most important job of a mother.  I told her she was young and that when she had kids herself, she would see that I was right. Kids think they know everything, but being older means I’ve experienced more. I know what the world is really like out there, and I don’t want my babies to be swallowed whole by all the hate and ugliness inside people’s hearts.

However, last Christmas, I found out just how much my son was hiding from me. ‘Lex’ was just a fake name Grant put in for Malcolm’s number. He was sneaking off to have dates with him. I was furious. I don’t remember everything I said, but I grounded him and took his phone away. He wouldn’t talk to me for weeks. I told Grant I wanted him to be safe, but that I didn’t trust him. How was hiding things from me a demonstration of any sense of responsibility? I had called Malcolm's parents, but they obviously didn't see the danger like I did. We agreed there wouldn't be any more sleepovers while all of this got sorted out. I set up a meeting with our church’s pastor to talk about these urges Grant has. Ellie disagreed with me again. She says he’ll just end up hiding more things from me if I ‘freak’ out every time he does something I don’t agree with. I am not freaking out about anything. Grant will grow out of this phase; I am sure of it. Everyone gets confused sometimes about who and what they like. He’s only fourteen! The world changes. I don’t want him to make a decision now that will impact him negatively for the rest of his life. 

“It’s only for the month!” I exclaimed. “You’ll meet with Pastor Cobb on Thursday evenings for the next couple of weeks.” 

Grant slammed his bedroom door in my face. Yelling and threatening seemed to do nothing these days. Plus, he needs to use his phone in case he gets in any trouble, so I can’t withhold it forever. Thursday night, I brought my stoic son to the Pastor for their first session. I sighed heavily, sliding onto a wooden bench outside Pastor Cobb’s office. My hands rose to grasp the golden cross around my neck. My head was throbbing. I closed my eyes against the bright fluorescent lights of the church hallway. 

*Lord, show me another way.* 

My eyes slid open. Across from me was a large corkboard of flyers and events the church hosted. Amid the bright colors and shapes trying to catch others’ attention, one paper was stark white and plain. It drew my attention immediately. I couldn’t make out the words from where I was sitting. It was tucked into the bottom right corner of the board underneath a youth bible study poster. 

***Do you know how humanity began? Be a research participant today to see yesterday! Travel back with us at WyrmHole to experience the history you can only read about. Participants must be over 18 to apply. Financial incentives are available for participants after completion of the two-week research program.*** 

My eyes widened. A two-week course learning about early Earth atmosphere and animals, and a trip back in time? I couldn’t believe it. I ripped the sheet off the wall and crumbled it in my hand. Part of me was furious that someone would post such a thing here. I should have told Pastor Cobb that way we could have pulled the footage to see who planted such a heinous flyer. There should be some sort of law against this kind of thing, right? *This is nothing but a scam*, I thought, storming towards the trash can.

Something inside me hesitates, though, as my hand hovers over the trash can. *Do you know how humanity began?* Of course, I do. Everyone who is saved knows God created the Earth. But time travel? Was such a thing accessible to someone like me? A quick Google search told me how WrymHole is a private company started by Kilm Matthews. He wanted to create an extinct animal safari excursion for other billionaires for $500,000 a trip. A few accidents and disappearances later, WrymHole is in some serious legal trouble. However, none of the families of those lost could do anything with the waivers signed beforehand, absolving Matthews of all liability. The scandal discouraged many of his investors, causing Matthews to branch out for other opportunities. This research project was being hosted by a big university two hours away because of his generous donations of research equipment and offers of various grants. Apparently, scientists from around the world were coming together to answer this question. How did humanity begin?

I was so distracted by the flyer on the way home that I didn’t ask Grant how his session went. He didn’t seem eager to share with me anyway. My eyes widened as I saw Ellie’s jeep in my driveway.

“Shit!” I exclaimed to myself. I had completely forgotten we made plans for a family dinner before I scheduled Grant’s wellness sessions.

 I ignored his giggling at my slipup as I stepped out of the car. I half ran inside, feeling somewhat flustered at the smell of cooking food inside my own home. It felt wrong almost having my nineteen-year-old cook me dinner. Mostly, I was just embarrassed that I forgot about our dinner plans. My apologies came out all jumbled and awkward. I shooed Ellie away from the stove, but she lingered still in the kitchen. I fussed over dinner instead of addressing her sudden nervous energy. She always hovers behind you when she’s deciding to ask you a question. Ellie cleared her throat but did not say anything. My lips thinned as irritation burned beneath my skin. It boiled over, causing an acidic sharpness to leak into my tone.

“What is it now, Ellie?”

I stirred the pot in too large strokes, causing pasta water to splash onto the stove top. I hissed as it barely missed the edge of my palm, but it leaked over the edge and soaked my pants.

“Is everything alright, Mom?”

“Just peachy,” I said between clenched teeth, dabbing my pants with a hand towel.

“It just seems like you and Grant are both stressed out.”

I let out a bitter laugh. “I can’t imagine what he’s stressed out about. He’s intent on resisting every bit of help I offer. I think he’s doing it on purpose.”

Ellie hesitated before answering in a quiet voice. “That’s not very nice, Mom. He thinks you hate him.”

“Well, you would know more than I do, honey. Grant doesn’t talk to me anymore.”

I hadn’t hidden the resentment in my voice very well. They talked behind my back, and I knew this. But I hadn’t realized until now how angry that made me feel. I did everything for them. Every decision I made impacted them, so I couldn’t make mistakes like they could. The two of them were lucky they hadn’t experienced what I had as a kid on top of the grief of my late husband. I took a stuttering breath at the downward turn of my thoughts. This anger was too sharp and too hot. Is this what my mother felt like every time she called me ungrateful as a child? I didn’t like this feeling inside me so I quickly looked for a way to change the conversation. I began asking Ellie about her classes at St. Jones. It is a local Christian college that I also attended in my younger days. I learned accounting and became the main bookkeeper for a lot of local churches. Ellie wants to be a teacher. She was so sensitive, though, I didn’t think she could handle how tough you have to be to do a job like that.

When she asked me how the week went, my mind could only circle back to the WyrmHole flyer I took. I laughed at the idea of it with Ellie as I pulled it out, not wanting to show how such an offer made me feel so scared yet excited at the same time. I don’t think I’ve felt such a way since accepting that places like Heaven and Hell were real, and that I could end up in either one day. This is a terrifying show of power to remind humanity that His way is the right way. Why else would I feel such peace thinking about my death and finding eternal life?

Ellie took the flyer with a curious glint in her eyes. “I think I’ve seen a few of these up at St. Jones. Why don’t you join? Time traveling is a rich person's thing! You may never get the chance again.”

“It’s not the time traveling that’s the problem. It’s the destination! The arrogance! How can I join something like that when my book tells me exactly how the world was created? I don’t need to see anything.”

“Well, who says 7 days didn’t mean 7 billion years?”

I whirled around on her, half shouting in disbelief. “What did you say?”

Ellie frowned, hunching her shoulders forward slightly. “It’s just a question my philosophy teacher asked us. Why does 7 days have to be so literal? Why couldn’t 7 days mean 7 billion years in reality?”

“W-well, t-that’s because…it says 7 days and that’s what it means! The Bible is the word of God, Ellen. Is this really what I’m paying money for you to learn? This was approved by St. Jones?”

“It’s a class there, of course it was, Mom. And I think the question is valid. Time travel is possible! Men have landed on the moon over 60 times now. Besides, we know that the Ancient Greeks and other civilizations used stories to explain the world around them. Zeus and Poseidon are no more real than they were used to explain strange weather phenomena. The tide and waves are controlled by wind, not a raging sea god. So, why can’t 7 days mean 7 billion years?” 

The fact that the question stumped me more than anything made me even angrier. I know the truth. I didn’t need a trip back in time or liberal college professors to tell me what I know. Why couldn’t Ellie see that? Why couldn’t Grant? Did the word faith mean nothing to kids today?  But then, it dawned on me. I knew what we would find at the end of that research trip. A big, vast nothing waiting for God to build with his just hands. Maybe this is what I needed to convince my kids that listening to me – to God – would always lead them in the right direction.   

I realized now, with sudden crystal clarity, why this research study fell into my lap. This was a test from God. I would be the one to prove God existed, for I knew nothing existed at the start of humanity without him. Taking the flyer back from my daughter, I gestured for her to hand me my phone. Slipping on my reading glasses, I typed the number in. I couldn’t keep the smug grin off my face as I scheduled a phone interview for the project. 

Soon, Grant and Ellie will know the whole truth. We all will.
