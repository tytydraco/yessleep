Back in the summer of 2017 or 2018, I was visiting my home country and spending most of my time with family. I would’ve been around 9 or 10 years old at the time. On some nights during that trip, I would sleep upstairs in my grandparents’ room. Those summer nights were memorable but one moment in particular has stuck with me ever since  something that, to this day, I still can’t fully explain.
At that age, I was in this weird phase where I had an obsession with watching or reading about creepy stuff during the day. I felt brave in the daylight, scrolling through creepy stories or watching horror clips, thinking i could handle it but at the night i think of every one of them whenever i wake up suddenly at midnight and scare myself to sleep. One of the things that really got to me back then was that creepy sculpture from Japan — “Momo.” That nightmare fuel haunted my brain for weeks. The face alone was enough to keep me up at night. So 
I would lie there wide awake, panicking, imagining all kinds of monsters lurking outside the room
One night, while I was lying in bed trying to force myself to sleep, I stared out the window. The glass on the windows had this pixel-like, textured surface, which made it harder to see outside clearly. It was dark and quiet — a very peaceful summer night. But then, out of nowhere, something bizarre happened. I suddenly saw this long, bright orange and yellow flame-like object pass by the window. It moved at a slant, and from what I could tell, it was roughly the length of a door, but not too thick. because of the windows texture, I couldn’t see every detail clearly, but it had this slow, smooth movement, lasting about three to four seconds before it disappeared from my view.

It looked kind of like a meteor, but it didn’t behave like one, it moved slower than what I’d expect a meteor to move, plus it was way too close to the window so i don’t think it’s possible, and there was no sound at all. No crash, no boom, nothing. Just complete silence, which somehow made it even more unsettling. The object was so bright that half the room actually turned an orangish color for a few moments. I remember freezing in fear. At the time, I genuinely thought it was the devil or some kind of spirit coming for me, my brain, already on edge from the creepy stuff I’d been looking at during the day, went straight into panic mode. I didn’t move, didn’t even breathe heavily,  just covered myself under the blankets hoping to go sleep. I probably would’ve pissed myself if I wasn’t so focused on trying not to be noticed by whatever that was.

Looking back now, I’ve thought a lot about what that could’ve been. A hallucination seems unlikely, because it wasn’t just visual — the light actually lit up the room. If I had imagined it, I feel like it would’ve been more like seeing some kind of scary entity, not a glowing object outside the window. Maybe it was a fireball or a meteor or even some space junk burning up in the atmosphere. I’m still not 100% sure. But whatever it was, i need to know, it’s been bothering me now that i remembered about it, if any of you would know what it was that would help me a 
lot.
