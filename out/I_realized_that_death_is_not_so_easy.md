I never once thought about death. When the doctor told me that I don't have many days on this earth, I felt a lot of numbness in my mind. The last thoughts I had were about death. Often the sights there are mind-blowing. But in death houses everything becomes normal after weeks or months. The dead will remain only memories. When I came to know about my illness at home, my house has also become a house of death. That too while I was still alive. How quickly life changed. What a dream.
Problems that started with a little fatigue are now taking over my life.


I could hear my mother coming closer, half asleep, crying. It was normal for weeks.But as mentioned earlier everything became normal in one or two months. My fear of death had also changed. The pent-up crying and moaning in the house had ended.

One departure I experienced firsthand was that of my grandmother. That was about 3 years ago. Grandma was sleeping in the room next to mine. It seems like I can still hear my grandmother moaning and groaning from there every night.

In the weeks leading up to her death, Grandma was behaving very strangely. Talk to yourself. Laugh alone at night. My mother and aunts reasoned that when they are dying, their loved ones and devils come to see them. But I didn't have any such problems. Not only that, I don't believe in such things. But such courage is all gone.

Two or three days before her death, grandmother had a scare. At night, Grandmother would put something on each chair and sofa. Sometimes old cloths, or some old utensils. I have heard my mother scolding my grandmother when she saw this. Someone will sit on it and leave without seeing the mother and grandmother will take it all away. Grandma used to do this regularly even though she was sick. Grandma used to do it with my help when she was too tired.

The crying that night when my grandmother died was too much for me to bear. The memory of my grandmother's day hurts my heart.

Today I realized that truth. That death is not so easy. My fear of death had changed. But I can't sleep today. A small pain arises from inside the chest. It will increase slowly. Sometimes it spreads to other parts of the body. Sometimes it seems to last for weeks. If that happens... my courage for so long has ended. I have to say goodbye to the world after enduring a lot of pain. Today, I just want to sleep somehow. I forgot the head set in the kitchen. I thought I should call my mother and ask her to bring it. Then I thought no. Just don't lose my mother's sleep. Although she doesn't show it on the outside, she is very worried about me.

Enduring the pain, I slowly got up and opened the door. As the indicator light was on, I felt that I should not wake anyone up by turning on the light. Similarly, the cut on the threshold is coming in through small gaps.

I walked into the kitchen as usual. But unexpectedly I saw that one sight. A kind of fear was born inside him that he had never experienced in his life till now. The legs started shaking. At first I thought it was just a feeling. But no.

A dark figure sits on a chair in the hallway, facing me. Not even a sound comes out of fear. It felt as if the chest pain was increasing. The taste of blood was slowly coming to the mouth. I couldn't even scream, I sat on the ground and left.

That's when I realized something. That one form is not the only one here. Dark human figures are staring at me on all the empty chairs. There is also a figure sitting on the chair inside the half-closed room. All the forms are staring at me. Only if I turn on the light, everything becomes clear. But I can't get up. Tastes like blood in the mouth. A sharp pain like a needle being stuck in the chest. When I thought I could somehow get up and turn on the light, the indicator light went out. The current has gone. Somehow I managed to stop and went back into the room.

I thought I'd grab the phone from the bed, but I couldn't do anything because of the pain. I lay there without even the freedom to cry out of fear. Tears flowed down his cheeks. There was a sense of peace as the blood slowly drained from his mouth. That night I slowly lost consciousness due to fear and pain.

When I woke up the next morning, I didn't feel much of a problem now. The past things were on my mind throughout the journey. Now I understand why many things my grandmother did. From then on, I used to put something on the chair in every room before going to sleep. No one would believe Grandma even if she said these things. All this will come to mind when you experience it in person. But I have told my mother not to leave empty chairs in the house.

Days passed and I did not see those figures. But one night I suddenly woke up when I heard a sound. I had not emptied a single chair in the house. But I had a small doubt in my mind. When I thought about it slowly, I realized that there was something that I had not thought about until now. I was lying with my legs folded. Then the rest of the bed...

My fear was true.

In that remaining space there was  a dark figure. I quickly tried to switch on the phone light. But the phone fell from his hand to the ground. I stretched out my leg and like a little breeze the figure passed through my body and disappeared. I got up and switched on the light. There was nothing in the room. I was sweating all over and everyone came running after hearing the cry. I know that no one will believe me if I say this. Maybe it's just my feeling. But when the figure disappeared, the voice sounded like a seal in my ears. I could never forget it in my life.

"Welcome to the world of death"
