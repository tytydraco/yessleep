If anyone told my teenage, drama-loving self that they would spend the better part of their adult life skulking about in the shadows and learning yet another obscure Latin chant, she would have scoffed at you. I will own that I’m kind of glad that I turned out the way I did; I was pretty insufferable and melodramatic as a kid because I wanted to become an actress and was told I was pretty enough for it.

With how things turned out, I should be glad that I have those tools in my arsenal.

I should backtrack a little. My dear husband told me that I have an interesting life and I should write down what I’ve seen and done. He knows - broad strokes - what I do and what I’ve done. After all, I was the one who saved his ass one night, but that’s another story.

My name is Jane Lane, and I am a supernatural exterminator. I didn’t become an exterminator by choice, but by necessity.

To know how I became one, you need to know about my first creature sighting.

I was always told that I had an active imagination growing up. I would spend hours telling my parents fantastical stories of dragons and princesses, of magical talking birds who would grant wishes and mermaids. They listened with fond indulgence and tolerated it until I got to be "too old" for these kinds of wild tales.

I remember that day distinctly. It was days before my eleventh birthday, just days before I started middle school because I was young for my grade. The stories I told my parents were the ones I had polished to a gleaming shine in my mind. There was one that I never told them because it scared me.

There was a creature that I often saw out of the corner of my eye. It had been there for as long as I could remember, just out of sight. It wasn't much bigger than me, and I was a small kid. At the time, I was hard pressed to tell anyone what it looked like in detail. It changed its appearance depending on the time of day.

The only consistent thing was that creepy, leering grin and the hollow, blank staring eyes.

It liked to lurk in the corner of the windows, especially when I was playing by myself. I could feel it staring at me but as soon as I turned to look, it was gone. I became jumpy and anxious, convinced that this creature was going to stand right next to me one day.

My anxiousness had gotten bad enough that my mother questioned me, rather sternly. I told her about the creature lurking in the window. Her frown of disapproval told me that this was different from the fantasy stories I came up with.

"Don't be weird," she said, absently and unaware of how damaging those words would be to me years later. "You're too old for this kind of stuff."

So, like any other obedient child, I kept my mouth shut about anything weird I saw. Don't get me wrong, my parents did the best job they could raising me. I did well in school, got all of the help I needed, was a good sister to my younger brother, and hell, I was even a cheerleader. I just never told them about the face in the window and never mentioned it ever again.

It got bolder over the years. By the time I graduated from high school, I knew that it was still the same size as I was when I was a kid. Sometimes, just sometimes, I would catch it staring at me from the middle of the window instead of the corner. It seemed to find especially glee when it caught me unawares and only retreated after it heard me let loose a stifled scream.

I did my best to ignore it, but it was always lurking there. I kept telling myself that it was my overactive imagination and that it was just in my head.

It wasn't until I went off to college that I knew that it was real.

My first year roommate and I got along okay enough. Both of us were far from home and stuck together randomly based off of the surveys. We had spent enough time with each other to be cordial but knew that we were just inherently different people. She didn't like to study and was more interested in extracurriculars. I was constantly reading just so I didn't see anything I wasn't supposed to.

It happened when she was out one night. I was studying because I had an exam the week after for a notoriously difficult first year engineering class. I had a movie going on in the background because I couldn't focus in the silence. I hadn't seen the creature since I moved, but old habits die hard.

There was a quiet tap. It didn't sound like it was through the door, but something on the same side of me instead. My skin prickled the way it did when something unexpected intruded on my consciousness. It wasn't my roommate because she had a key and the small number of friends I did have were either home for the weekend or out on a date.

It tapped again, loud enough for me to turn and look, just out of the corner of my eye. I saw the grin and the eyes, but it was close enough for me to see the blue skin and long nose. It took a single step towards me, and that was enough to make me turn and look at it head on. It had disappeared when I did so the last time.

Not this time. This time, it took another step closer and let loose a quiet cackle.

I'm not proud of this, but I let out the most blood curdling scream and panicked. I threw things at it, books, papers… anything I could get my hands on, I threw it. At one point, my phone bounced off of its creepy face without even making it blink.

The next set of events happened in quick succession. I had to confirm with Aoife afterwards, after she had taken me to see the professor.

I was still screaming when Aoife, my neighbor across the hall, charged through the door. She barely blinked before snatching my roommate's decorative sword off of the wall. The cold ring of steel - only slightly dampened by the dullness of the blade - made the creature turn to look at her.

It hissed once before disappearing into thin air. The only indication of its presence was the muddy imprint of its feet on my rug and the contents of my backpack and desk strewn across the floor.

Aoife clucked her tongue and barely had time to sheath the sword when the resident advisor came trundling down the hall. He frowned when he looked at the room and the sword in Aoife's hands.

"You okay? Do I need to call anyone?"

I shook my head rapidly, realizing how it looked. "Yeah, I mean, no. There was a huge fucking rat and Aoife chased it off."

His frown deepened as Aoife confirmed and handed me the sword. My hands shook as I hung it back up on the nails that my roommate and I carefully hammered into place on move in day. I could hear her convince him that we were fine, and that he could go back to doing whatever he was doing.

"You saw it, didn't you?" I demanded as she closed the door and started picking up my belongings. My hands were still shaking from the adrenaline, so I crossed my arms in front of me so she couldn't see them. I was so worried that it was a shared hallucination and she was going to tell me that I was insane.

"The imp? Of course I did," she replied, holding out my phone. She was annoyingly calm about this whole thing. "I'm not blind."

My jaw dropped. "Wait, it's real? That thing was real?"

The look she gave me was solemn, and in hindsight, reluctant. She held up my phone again at me and I took it, but I was still watching the micromovements in her face. I didn't know her history the way I do now. After all, she became my first partner, but that's for another time.

At the time, she was intimidating with her tall height and solid build. "Striking" was a better word to describe her than anything else. Other words were too mundane for the keen symmetry of her face and the piercing green eyes. We hadn't really crossed paths much with different classes and schedules. I remember seeing her show up two weeks after move-in and finding it strange that she managed to get a single room as a sophomore.

The only thing I really knew about her was that she was often gone as soon as the weekend rolled around. That's why it was so surprising to see her come bursting through my door on a Saturday night.

"It's real."

"How the fuck?" I know. I'm not eloquent when I'm upset.

"If I tell you," she said finally, "will you answer my questions first?"

"What the fuck?" I couldn't help it. It was absurd. "Questions? Why can't you just tell me?"

Her brow furrowed just enough for me to realize that I was being unnecessarily loud. I was mad because she was withholding answers and didn't tell me.

"I can tell you once I know some more details. Will you answer my questions?"

This was a battle I wasn't going to lose. This was a sophomore who managed to convince the housing director to give her a single room. I sighed as I sat down on my bed and gestured at my chair. "Fine. I'll answer questions."

"How long has that imp been attached to you?" she asked as she leaned against my desk instead of sitting down.

"What?"

She grimaced and took a breath in. "Right. Civilian. Sorry. How long have you been seeing that thing?"

I shivered at her tone and hugged my pillow to my chest. "For as long as I could remember. Five? Maybe earlier?"

"Have you ever told anyone?"

"Would you?" I snapped, then realized that it was wholly unnecessary. "Sorry. That's a sore spot. I told my mom when I was a kid but she told me to stop making up weird stories."

The rest of the questions weren't worth repeating. It was all of the details I wanted to tell someone but never had the chance to. It was strange to be talking to someone who was actually receptive to listening, even if it did sound like she was interrogating me. I'll admit that I felt a certain sense of relief, knowing that it wasn't just my imagination, but it just opened up more questions that I wanted answers to.

Aoife frowned as she listened, twisting a lock of her long hair between her fingers. At one point, she pulled out her phone and tapped away intermittently. I thought she was just taking notes for some bizarre reason until the phone buzzed and the screen lit up.

"Are you hungry?" she asked suddenly.

The question was absurdly off topic compared to the other ones. "What?"

"I had to bribe Gabe with a milkshake and fries to get him to agree to meet with you," she said in response, totally ignoring my very reasonable question. "I haven't eaten yet. I was sleeping when you started screeching your head off. I’ll drive."

I didn't believe her, since she was in jeans and a shirt that I would go to class in, not sleep in. I still went, though, because I wanted answers.

It didn't take long to get to where we were meeting Gabe. In fact, it was the local diner just a few minutes away from the outskirts of our campus. The walk to her car was still long enough that every little noise made me turn and look, though. I was more rattled than I wanted to admit. Knowing that the imp could be in the same room as me changed things.

When we got to the diner, Aoife made a beeline to a guy sitting in a booth by himself. He stood out because he was making careful notes in a notebook while referencing an old looking book. Most people weren’t there to study, and he looked entirely too sober for the hour.

“So,” Aoife said as she slid into the booth next to me, closing off my escape. “What did you find?”

It comforted me to know that Aoife was that short with everyone. The man frowned as he pushed his glasses further up on the bridge of his nose.

“Rude,” he drawled. “You’re the one who asked me to come out this late.”

His voice sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it. It had that odd cadence of the old school actors from early Hollywood, which was incongruous with his appearance. He looked like he had just woken up, bundled in an oversized hoodie and sweatpants but sounded like Frasier from that TV show.

“You said that you’d do it for fries and a milkshake,” Aoife replied.

“I really should have set a higher price tag,” he muttered.

“*Gabe.* She’s in trouble. It’s a goddamn Watcher and it’s crossing boundaries on its own,” she said through gritted teeth. “You promised you would help once I found out who it was attached to.”

I was getting mad, listening to them go back and forth like that while ignoring me. “Hey, I’m right here. Who are you anyways?"

He turned and gave me a stern look, and that’s when I realized who I was looking at.

This was the first time I had formally met Professor Gabriel Tao, one of the youngest professors on campus and a newer addition to the Classic Studies department. He stood out because of his age and the fact that he taught Latin. I didn't have reason or a chance to take his class, not with the engineering classes that loaded down my schedule.

He was also rumored to have a sharp tongue and an even sharper vocabulary.

Normally, I would be more respectful to professors but this guy really got on my nerves.

“Gabe, this is Jane. Jane, meet the guy who will help you with that imp problem.”

"So, *you're* the one that imp attached itself to,” he said as he leaned back, his head tilted as he studied me. “I’ve been trying to figure out who it was lurking around but I couldn’t pinpoint it. You’re an engineering student, aren’t you?"

"What is that thing?"

He blinked, looking a little taken aback at the ignored question. I guess he was used to it because he rolled his eyes briefly. "Do you want the full answer or do you want to know enough to just get rid of it?" he asked. "I have an idea of what to do but I'll need more details."

I glanced at Aoife, who was busy flagging down the waitress and putting in orders for us. She wasn't going to be of any help with that answer. I sighed and told yet another unfamiliar person about my childhood and the creature I kept seeing.

For annoying as he was, he was gentler when it came to follow up questions. He was mostly interested in the pattern of the behavior. The whole thing about it being in the same room as me gave him pause.

"This is the only time? No other time? Did you ever have sleep paralysis and thought it was odd?"

The intensity and specificity sent a chill down my spine. "How did you know?"

When I turned 16, I had my one and only sleep paralysis episode. I had ignored it because it never happened again. At the time it had frightened me because the sightings of the creature had ramped up in the weeks leading up to the sleep paralysis episode.

My parents were understandably annoyed after they made sure I was okay. I had woken them up screaming at three in the morning because I couldn’t move. I woke up because I needed to pee in the middle of the night, but the panic set in quickly when I couldn’t move. My parents ran into my room, thinking it was an intruder. As soon as they opened my bedroom door, the paralysis went away and I was able to move, limbs flailing as I regained control.

At the time, there was an odd noise after they left. I didn’t think of it much, but Gabriel’s questions helped me connect the dots.

It was the cackle of the imp.

It had followed me across the country to college.

Gabriel sighed heavily at my lack of reaction. “I fucking knew it. You,” he said while leveling a finger at Aoife, “owe me more than a single side of fries and a milkshake. This is much larger than that.”

Aoife just blinked and took a large, messy bite of her burger. “You’re the one who challenged me to bring you something ‘interesting,’” she replied, mimicking his accent on the last word. “If this isn’t interesting, I don’t know what is. Do you want a wendigo, or a skinner? You hate those physical types of beasties.”

“Um, explain, please? Clueless person here.”

Gabriel rolled his eyes at Aoife. “You really don’t want to know what is actually out there. So do you want the real answers or just how to get rid of it for now?”

I was a curious person, but not that curious. I pulled out my phone, ready to take notes. “Just how to get rid of it. I don't want to know anything more.”

The look on his face looked disappointed more than anything else as he rattled off some cursory instructions. There was an old oak in the woods near campus that would suit nicely for the site of the banishing ritual. Aoife chimed in on occasion, citing that she had some of the materials, or other options that would be better.

(One such item was a lacquered butcher block made of five different types of wood. That had sidetracked them for a solid five minutes as they argued the virtues of using combined versus pure wood planks. Gabriel sounded scandalized when he found out that she had indeed made it herself and that it was sectioned for easier transport.)

"Lastly, you need to do this on your birthday," he said. "Someone casted this spell on you and the only reason why it can break the unspoken barriers so easily is because someone did it on your birthday. These things… escalate and get nasty over time once it crosses the boundaries."

The implications made me sick to my stomach. "What are the chances that it was a coincidence?"

Gabriel's eyes flicked over to look at Aoife. I didn't have to look over at her to know that they were exchanging some non-verbal communication on how to tell me that someone in my life had it out for me.

"You know what? Nevermind. It's coming up soon anyways, during the most inconvenient time."

"When?"

I laughed ruefully. "December 21st. Longest night, traditionally."

Aoife let out an annoyed groan. "That's the day campus is closed, isn't it? You're definitely not staying on campus."

Our school had a short winter term, and we were allowed to stay on campus with limited dining room options. However, the week after finals was a full shut down for the holidays. No one was allowed to stay on campus unless it was specific circumstances.

Of course, I already had a flight booked to go home as soon as my finals ended. I picked this particular school because it was far from home, thinking that I could escape it. Knowing that it followed me, going to college so far from home seemed pointless.

Gabriel sighed. "Can you rebook your ticket home?"

"Maybe. I'll have to look into the fees but where would we stay?"

Aoife waved that concern off before Gabriel could even say anything. "I'll pull some strings. I have a buddy who lives close enough that we can probably bunk down in his guest room," she said, pausing briefly to consider a thought, "unless you're afraid of dogs."

I shrugged. Animals didn't really bother me that much, not when I had an imp haunting me for most of my life.

Gabriel still had a troubled look on his face as he leafed through the book by his hand. The small furrow between his eyebrows showed up as soon as I mentioned that my birthday was the same day as the solstice.

It didn't take much longer to wrap up. I was exhausted and couldn't really think of anything else to ask. Gabriel was the one who noticed that I was starting to nod off over my tea and suggested, not very gently, to Aoife to take me back to the dormitories. He said that he would get some temporary wardings and a charm ready the next day.

"I'll see you on the solstice, regardless," he said with a measured look. "Stay safe, Jane."

I wish I could say that something happened in the six weeks after, but in all honesty it was just regular college life. I went on a few dates with a guy who was in my engineering class. He was nice, but I think he wanted my notes more than he wanted to go on dates with me. There was another cute guy who I found more interesting, and it turned out we were from the same hometown.

Aoife dropped off a roll of translucent washi tape and a bracelet the day after. The bracelet was so simple that I could barely call it a bracelet. It was some black gem threaded on a piece of red yarn. I was worried that it would break, but Aoife just shrugged and said that as long as it's some sort of red thread and the stone was touching my skin, I could do whatever I wanted to do.

I ended up begging for a ride to the local big chain craft store and bought some red embroidery floss. It took some time to get something resembling an okay bracelet, but at least it wouldn’t break just by looking at it.

The washi tape ended up having writing on it. I thought it had just been a roll of plain tape until I applied the first piece right along the window sill. The writing flared against the dark wood briefly before disappearing. The translucent tape blended in so well that I was hard pressed to find it after I stepped back. I was a bit surprised at this bit of obvious magic, but if it kept the imp out I wasn't going to prod Gabriel too much about how it worked.

I still caught glimpses of the imp after the warding, though. Its leering grin gave way to an angry sneer. I chose to ignore it, because I was sick of being afraid and focused on getting a decent grade.

I should have still been afraid.

True to her word, Aoife found a place for us to stay once finals were over. It wasn't especially hard to change my flight, though my parents were a little disappointed when I told them that one of my finals had changed to the very last day (lie) and the earliest I could book my ticket out was the twenty-third (another lie). They promised that they would make up for my birthday celebration with a big dinner.

Her friend’s place was less of a place and more of a palace. She also assured me that they were going to be gone on some holiday trip, and we would be able to stay there while she house-sat and dog-sat for them.

I woke up on the day of my birthday in a strange bed with two giant dogs curled up against me. I was supposed to be at home, in my own bed. I was supposed to be texting the cute guy who wanted to go on a date with me when we both got back home and let him know that I was back.

But no, I was going to be in the woods at some ungodly hour in the cold because, just my luck, my mom had to give birth to my dumb ass at 11:30 in the evening in my old time zone. This meant that we were going to be out past two am to match the time.

Aoife was busy with some chalk markers and a piece of gorgeously lacquered wood at the large dining room table. She was carefully transposing whatever Gabriel had scribbled down on a piece of paper between his grading and lecture preparation. It was an interesting mix of strange sigils and some basic characters I recognized from my failed attempt at Chinese school. Her handwriting was strangely precise and regular, almost inhuman.

“Is this the board you and Gabriel were arguing about during dinner that night?”

She looked up, her lips twitching into a smile. “It’s a new one. The varnish just finished curing last night.”

I fiddled with the bracelet on my wrist absently. It was still a strange weight after so many weeks of wearing it and checking to make sure that the yarn didn’t fray.

“Do you see it?” she asked as she carefully consulted the piece of paper before taking a Q-tip and wiping away at one of the letters.

I let my head turn, just barely, towards the large bay windows of the living room. The sun was high, reflecting off of the snow that fell two days before. I could see it glaring through the windows with its palms pressed up against the glass. This was the closest it has been in a while and the sight of it gave me chills down my spine. “Yes. And it looks mad.”

She clicked her tongue in annoyance and looked over herself. The imp disappeared from the window. I didn't realize how tense I was until it left and I felt like I could breathe.

I ended up making us coffee because I didn't know what to do with myself. True to their word, Gabriel and Aoife didn't tell me what the ritual would entail and took care of the details. He said that they would let me know the day of, since my part would be simple, but I was growing more agitated just sitting around.

Aoife kept making preparations. She finished the board not long after I made the coffee. I watched as she moved methodically through checking whatever herbs and items they needed.

It was around lunch when I finally caved and asked Aoife what I would be doing. She frowned a little as she checked the silver knife she was sharpening with her thumb. "Are you sure you want to know?"

I nodded before she sighed. The sound of the metal on the whetstone continued as she talked.

“It’s going to get angry while we perform the spell tonight,” she said in a neutral tone. “The only reason why it’s allowed to stay in this world is because of its bond with you, and we're going to be removing that bond. You're going to have to keep it away from us."

My stomach dropped. “What?”

She leveled her gaze at me after she wiped down the knife with an oiled rag. It struck me again that there was such a marked difference between the two of us even though we were only a year apart in age. Her stoicism made her seem older at the time; over the years she grew into it and it suits her now. Back then, it was enough to make a grown man fall silent. It made me uncomfortable.

"Because the original was casted on your birthday, and your birthday is on the solstice, the reversal ritual turned into a two person spell," she said. Then she absently made a face. "Remind me to draw our blood when the time gets closer. Drink some water too, because I'll need a lot of blood."

*That* she did warn me about. Apparently with the modern invention of the preservatives and needles, they were able to get blood for these heavy duty spells more humanely and much earlier. There was a window of how long the blood would be effective for, but it was in the hours rather than the minutes like it was previously.

"You're trying to distract me. How am I supposed to keep something like that away from you guys?"

She shrugged and pointed her chin at the sword that she had laid out. "Do you know how to swing a bat? You'll be fine."

I didn't think so, and it was frustrating enough for me that I left in a huff and hid in my borrowed room until nightfall. Neither of them outright said it, but between their tones and how much spell work I had seen, they were heavily implying that if the spell didn't work… there was a possibility I would die.

I spent the balance of my hours writing letters rather than worrying. I kept them light, and marked them for the people I had intended them for. I still keep them in my work satchel to this day. Some I had removed, because the recipient passed before I did. Some are newer, as I added important people in my life. Some were larger. I write a letter to my husband after every large undertaking now, and he has three separate letters in his envelope.

Once I didn't have any more letters to write, I fell asleep. It wasn't until later that I startled awake to tapping noises. I panicked, thinking that the imp had gotten into the house somehow despite all of the warding. My heart raced as the light knocks stopped and the knob clicked open. Gabriel's silhouette was back lit by the hallway light.

"Are you ready? We need to make the last of the preparations."

I swallowed and nodded. The initial panic changed to something different as I followed him to the kitchen where Aoife sat with a medical kit and blood sample tubes arranged on the counter.

She made quick work of taking the blood, marking them clearly with a permanent marker. Gabriel took the time to run through the checklist of things that Aoife had prepared earlier that day. When he was satisfied, he picked up the well oiled scabbard and handed the whole thing to me. He handed over a dagger as well.

"Bundle up. It's cold out there. If it goes right, we shouldn't be long but it will be a short hike."

The grimness of the whole situation seemed far less exaggerated with the both of them behaving the same. As we trudged through the knee deep snow not half an hour later, I was glad that I wrote the letters and napped. Despite everything, despite the underlying fear, there was a sense of exhilaration to what we were doing. Sure, there was a sense of absurdity: I was a California girl in the middle of the woods in New England, wearing a borrowed down jacket that was a size too large with a sword strapped to my hip.

It was still exhilarating, nonetheless.

We got to the oak tree in the woods as the watch on Gabriel's wrist beeped the hour. We had half an hour until it was my birth time. It was late, but Aoife and Gabriel both looked oddly alert as they laid everything out methodically. His watch beeped the five minute warning just as Aoife finished arranging the candles and lighting them, casting a dim orange glow to contrast the bright white beams of our headlamps.

The wind picked up, threatening to blow out the candles, but they stayed steady and lit.

I heard a low snarl to the side of me from the woods. With one hand gripped on the scabbard, I turned to look.

The imp was standing in the bush. Its hollow eyes were focused on Gabriel and Aoife in rage and the once grinning face was fixed in a grimace as it crawled out of the bush. That was when I drew the sword and grabbed it in a two handed grip.

Gabriel's voice is what I would describe as an airy tenor, especially when coupled with his Trans-Atlantic accent. It deepened as he chanted rapidly in Latin. Aoife's husky voice joined in a counter chant after the first few lines.

"No! You cannot!" the imp shrieked, suddenly lurching forward at them. "No!"

I moved to intercept it out of sheer instinct, clumsily swinging the sword as I did. My inexperience handling the weapon showed. I hit it with the flat of the blade and the sudden impact jarred my wrists enough that it hurt. To my surprise, the imp started screaming more when the clean, oiled steel touched it.

That gave me more courage to stand my ground and swing at it again to make it back off. The snow was deep, and it made it hard to move. The imp was not tall, but it seemed to float on top of the snow rather than sinking into it. With the added height, its head reached my collarbones.

It clearly realized the height advantage, because once it recovered, it launched itself at me, knocking me over and sending the sword flying.

My world turned into a chaotic tumble of snow, blinding light and imp. It scrabbled at my throat under the snow as I thrashed. The snow had blocked a lot of my visibility and limiting the reach of my headlamp. The reflecting light was right in my eyes as I grabbed at the skinny arms and kicked as hard as I could to try and shake it off of me.

It was so, so strong! There was also something about touching the leathery skin that made me flinch away on instinct. The primal part of my brain was screaming to get away, and yet I was rooted to the spot.

I dimly heard Aoife screaming my name before Gabriel's sharp voice brought her back into the ritual.

Its hands were around my neck like a vise clamp. The imp was trying to choke me out, or bleed me out. Either way, it was strong and it hurt. Its small hands had claws at the tips, not nails. The stinging pain at my neck meant that it had punctured my skin. I struggled, trying to figure out how to get out of it when the edges of my vision started to go black.

"Die for Mistress!" it screamed. "Die!"

The reminder that someone wanted me dead, or hated me enough to curse me with this wretched thing my whole life, made me angry. That anger brought enough clarity to remember that I had strapped the dagger sheath to the other side of my sword belt.

I pulled out the dagger and stabbed at its back wildly. It screamed in pain as I felt resistance against the blade. I quickly stabbed it again, and again, before it grabbed my dagger hand and bit me. I screamed out in pain just as I heard the sudden crescendo of two voices behind me.

"***BEGONE***."

The creature wailed as its body disintegrated slowly. I was able to snatch my hand away when its horrible claw hands disappeared into smoke. I watched from below it, still pinned by its horrible weight, with my hands over my ears to muffle the awful screams. It was one thing to see it disappear from a distance, but another to smell the acrid reek up close. It was screaming one word repeatedly as it burned up, disappearing from our world.

*Mistress.*

The aftermath… well, it was messy to say the least. I was covered in the ashy remains of the imp and felt like a giant, aching bruise. Aoife’s forearm was covered in congealing blood. I could see the cut before Gabriel covered it with gauze after spraying antiseptic on the wound, making her hiss. Gabriel didn’t look much better, with the dark circles under his eyes. I didn’t want to know what I looked like.

The sky was starting to get brighter by the time we finally made our slow, limping way back to the car. When we got back to the house, all I wanted to do was sleep, but the two made me clean up. I stood in the shower, letting the hot water rinse off the blood, and barely stayed conscious long enough to make it back to bed to sleep for a few meager hours.

When I woke up, the room was bright with light. The aches in my body had gotten worse despite the rest, and the bruises were starting to blossom on my skin. I grimaced at the thought of having to explain this to my parents when they saw me.  My hand was hurting something awful from the bites, but it looked like Aoife had snuck in while I was sleeping to dress my wounds, because my hand was neatly bandaged in white gauze.

I made my slow, painful way down to the kitchen. Gabriel and Aoife were both in the kitchen. They caught sight of me and made me sit down.  For someone who didn't emote very much, she looked worried as she quickly dished out what was sitting in the pot on the stove. There was more gauze and medical tape on her forearm, but she was using her arm normally. It must have looked worse than it was.

“Is it over?” I flinched at the sound of my own voice. It was a rasp and my whole throat felt horrible, like someone had smashed my neck with a sledgehammer.

"It's gone," he said. "And someone really hates you for something. But you should eat. I’ll talk.”

In between bites of filling stew, Gabriel told me what happened with the ritual. Despite their careful planning and research, they were woefully unprepared for how strong the spell was. Breaking the bond demanded a sacrifice more than they had allotted for. Aoife had cut her arm to give more blood spur of the moment.

"I should have anticipated it," Gabriel admitted. "A Watcher doesn't stay in this world for that long without a significantly strong spell."

Hatred, he said, made it so strong. Eventually, the imp would have killed me when the person controlling me decided it was time. My blood ran cold at the realization that someone hated me enough to curse me and want me dead. It was a lot to process. I tried to go through life without causing harm and to hear that despite my best efforts, someone out there hated my existence.

Aoife cleared her throat after he fell silent. He shot her a glare.

"Oh, for fuck's.. There's also something else about you that contributed to it," Aoife said while crossing her arms in annoyance. "Gabriel didn't want to tell you."

"Tell me what?" I was annoyed. If this guy wasn't a professor I would have kicked his ass already.

"You have a gift. You’re what my mentor would call a ‘sensitive.’ It means that you tend to attract more of the ghosts and ghoulies than others," Gabriel said with a defeated sigh. "Most people tend to look at me like I'm a crazy person when I tell them."

I never really noticed anything unusual but maybe that was why I was such an imaginative kid, but okay. "So what does this mean for me?"

"Well, it means that this type of shit will keep happening to you. I can train you while I train Aoife, and you can learn to defend yourself, and take care of these things," he replied. He hesitated briefly before continuing. “I know that you didn’t want to know before, which is why I didn’t offer it immediately. But there’s someone out there who wants you dead, and you should learn to protect yourself.”

As annoying as he was, I had to agree with him. The ritual made me realize that I was caught flat-foot and unprepared for future dangers, and I hated being unprepared. He really got on my nervous, but I would put up with it in order to learn how to protect myself and not rely on others to be safe.

After all, someone wanted me dead, and their weapons were creatures not of this world.

I didn't want to be afraid anymore.

“What do I need to do?"

He smiled. “How hard would it be to get you to change majors?”

Spoiler alert: I didn't, much to his dismay and Aoife's amusement. And much to my dismay, there were times that I still was terrified out of my mind, but that's for another time. This… this was my inglorious start to becoming a supernatural exterminator, and the start of my path to finding the person who wanted to kill me.
