I'm getting close to escaping. I can feel it.



So, there I was, resting by Leviathan. A warmth radiated off it like shallow water in the summer, and yet also like something so cold it burned. I spent some time investigating it and found some strange things.



It's scales weren't made of normal scale material, I was ballsy and touched it. They were made out of metal. Also, its gills seemed to take in air. I say take in, because it wasn't breathing. The air just flowed into it, almost as if Leviathan was commanding the air.



There's a weird calmness around it too, almost like the primordial chaos cancels out the divine chaos. Maybe that's why it wasn't killed, but relocated.



After a while I was getting ready to move on, when I heard a familiar sound, a hissing crawling through my brain.



"Ah, poor human." The spite was more than apparent in its words.



"What do you want?" I didn't even look around. I knew it was somewhere nearby, but I didn't want to. I needed at least some control.



"My wants and my needs are far beyond your understanding," it spoke with annoyance, almost like I was an idiot for asking, "and they don't always align either. I noticed you've been here behind Livyatan for a while now. She's a hassle, that's for sure, but do you need assistance in getting past?"



I had to stop and think. It was like my knowledge had left me for a moment. I didn't understand who the snake was talking about. I know it's obvious, Livyatan sounds close enough, and I should've inferred the "she".



"Livyatan... you can get her to move?" I could feel the snakes presence besides me, but I kept refusing to look.



"In a sense. You see, there is someone that desires my banishment from this place. Someone that would do whatever it takes to chase me down. Someone she is scared of." The words coated my thoughts like honey.



"Who..." The word came out as breath, fear pushing it further.



"I can't tell you, dear, but if you want Livyatan to move, just say 'please'." I could feel the snake quivering with joy at the idea. I didn't know what else to do.



“Please.”



Without warning, the skies split open. Storm clouds spilled out of nothingness, forming into black masses. Thunder rumbled in harmony with Leviathan’s bellows. The snake had vanished. Then I saw a man in the sky, held up as if by wires. His robe was blacker than void, and when I looked at him, I felt cold inside. My very core began to freeze, as if every cell in my body was dying. Even the air forgot how to move. The world waited to hear him speak. 



Then he spoke. 



His voice was so soft, it was the first time I felt truly calm here, calm and comforted.



*“Al tira. Hineni Azra’el, malakh Adonai.”*

*“Be not afraid, I am Azrael, the angel of Adonai.”*



The angel of death. The one that killed the firstborn of Egypt. The one that killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. 



The reaper. 



As he spoke, the grass below him wilted away, the flowers lost their colour, the fruit trees shrivelled up and died. As he descended, a new sound came from Leviathan. Fear.



A groan so deep and ancient that hearing it caused the ground to shake and crack. The ancient beast slithered down, coiling further into itself and the earth. By the time Azrael landed, the beast was gone. Then he looked up at me. I felt my skin tighten, like something inside me was desperately aching to be with him, to fly with him.



*“Lo nivreta lihyot poh”*

*“You were not created to be here”*



I tried to speak, recalling all my classes on biblical Hebrew. Recalling my translation work. But nothing came out. My words themselves were too afraid to appear before him.



Suddenly I heard a host of songs from the skies. The storm clouds parted and I saw wheels within wheels, covered in eyes. They pulled a large throne, which glowed with colours I never knew existed. There were also four other beings with six wings, they covered their face with two, their feet with two, and flew with the last two. I heard their song, a peaceful song that travelled down my spine, urging it to bend, to bow.



*“Kadosh kadosh kadosh adonai tzeva'ot”*

*“Holy, Holy, Holy is Adonai of Hosts”*



My eyes burned as I turned away, the shiver of death still clinging to my skin like wet clothing, and I ran, still hearing their song.



*“Melo chol ha'aretz kevodo.”*

*“His glory fills the whole earth”*



The angel of death. The throne of God. The heavenly host. It’s all real. Seraphim, Ophanim, Cherubim and Malakhim all are real. I throw a glance behind me. The Ophanim pull the throne not by moving, but by making the distance cease to exist. The Seraphim move alongside them not by following, but by being in their space. The throne blinded me, and I turned forwards again, only to feel my foot get caught in an exposed root. I tripped and fell.



I rolled down a hill, seemingly going on and on, bushes and branches and twigs slicing my skin open as I sped past them. Suddenly I realised I was stationary.



I screamed in rage. I looked at my hands and arms to see cuts lining them. I was so close. I was almost at the water. I don’t know what I expected, but I could’ve maybe built a raft. I don’t know why I thought the water would be a good idea. I don’t know why I trusted the fucking snake.



I kept screaming until my throat was raw. Then I sat. Silently, waiting.



But nothing came.



No Cherub. No throne. No Seraph, Ophan, Malakh, Leviathan, Snake, nothing.



I began anticipating something worse. Behemoth, or Ziz. Maybe a Shedim. Maybe a Nephilim. Or, a curse. Yemach shemo v'zikhro. If all this is real, then so is that curse. What if I'm forgotten?



But nothing.



Hours passed with me sitting there, waiting for my judgement. Then I finally looked around.



I was in a glen of sorts. There were fruit trees all around, the sky was clear, the water flowed like liquid crystals. And there was a hole in the ground in front of me.



It was humanoid in shape, the result of someone shaping the clay and dirt. It didn’t take me long to realise I was seeing the dirt that made Ha’adam, the first human.



I looked around some more and saw two trees, the light scattering through their branches like a kaleidoscope of divinity. They looked so beautiful. The fruit looked so amazing. One of the trees, which glowed a soft white, had something that looked like pomegranate growing in the branches. The other, which glowed a deep blue, had something that looked more like figs growing. I know I’ve been an idiot here, but even I could figure out what I was looking at.



I was looking at the first temple. The birthplace of the first human. The place we think of when we hear “Garden of Eden.”



If anywhere here is going to be idyllic, it’s here. I need some more rest, and time to think, but I’m going to get out of here soon.
