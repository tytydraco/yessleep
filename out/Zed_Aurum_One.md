Justification and reasoning are separate concepts. Both are used to explain why an occurrence has taken place, but justification differentiates itself by arguing that the reasoning made it morally right. Righteousness has grown hard to determine. Life here proves far too complicated to assign such a simple label to any action or person. I have seen mercy pave a path for death and death a path for peace. Every day people commit crimes to save their families while others enforce order to service their greed. Virtue is a mask used by the wicked, and evil is a name cast upon those who give every fiber of their soul to a cause beyond themselves. I grow sick of playing by different rules than my enemies and keeping up appearances. If my home will be safer with a certain man dead, then I assure you that I will kill that certain man and relish in my clairvoyance. If a fire heals a forest in the end, I will not extinguish it. No action can be right or wrong when groups of self-proclaimed intellectuals must spend hours deliberating arbitrary ethical hierarchies to come to anything close to consensus, but outcomes are. Some roads lead to starving children and genocide, while others are lined with gold at the cost of a single grave. I see nothing more than an obvious choice that fools feign to be complicated. I could not care less whether you believe what I do to be justification or reasoning as long as you understand it and stay out of the way. It does not have to feel right if it means it does not have to happen ever again.

When I was young I would sneak away from home to take care of a family of myna birds that lived in the forests mere meters away. An old yet firm tree with thick, sturdy branches housed them, sheltered them, and provided for them to the best of its ability. I can still remember how the jagged yet inviting bark used to feel against my soft, unweathered palms and fragile, scarless fingers. In this tree they had made a lovely nest, but their lack of adaptation to their environment left them hungry more often than not. Handfuls of fruits and insects were accepted graciously as I took on the role of their protector in this strange and dangerous world. They would eat from my cupped hands, mimicking my every noise in a way that sounded how I imagine true affection would. Their chirps and hums were like music, composed both of their surroundings and the beautiful melody of nature itself.

After two weeks of protecting them, their eggs began to hatch. To an outsider, a baby chick must appear like some sort of sickening mass, but once you dedicate enough time to their well-being they seem almost adorable. Wet, scrawny feathers are ignored when influenced by the instinct to protect the vulnerable. This instinct is a powerful one, for better or worse, and my younger self had been a stranger to it.

Three of the four eggs had produced healthy offspring, already managing to resemble their parents. I imagined how they would grow up just as strong and lovely in every way, so caught up in my fantasy I had ignored the fourth. I had to look twice to assure myself I wasn’t seeing things, but there it was. The runt was so small it could have perched on its mother’s foot. Of course all newborn animals have this look of infectious weakness to them, but the condition of this bird made its fate clear to me.

I had always tried to read as much as I could whenever I was not training, sleeping, or eating despite my father’s insistence that my sister be the only smart one out of us. Having a large base of knowledge provides consistent usefulness to every scenario imaginable, yet in this moment I wished I knew less of birds. The common myna, native to the old world, has carried the cruelty of its home all the way here through its very nature. When one child comes out weak, they abandon it to save the others. No accommodations are made and no support granted. This runt was doomed from the start, but my young, ignorant mind could not just let that be.

When the parents pecked, my finger blocked. When they refused to feed her, I crushed up the food with some water in my hands and fed her myself. This act forced me to spend much more time with my birds, visiting them nightly for nearly a month. Eventually, the parents abandoned their nature in pursuit of my naive philosophy. At the time I had attributed this to a change of heart, but now I see it more as a conditioned behavior. With the bird family happy and whole, I felt proud for once.

One night, when I intended to sneak out, I came to the hall to find my father awake. His figure towered over me in the dim candlelight. Father was always an old man; I cannot imagine him with even a sliver of youth. His skin clung to his face as if his skeleton was trying to break free of its shell, with little other than a thin layer of dry, pale, textured skin standing in its way. His hair, even then, was nearly gone, leaving a rugged, wrinkly surface atop his pronounced skull. Despite all of this, he never appeared weak. Additionally, the long black pant leg of his old-fashioned suit stood far taller than my whole being at that age. To someone who knew nothing of him, this would have already been a threatening appearance. To me, who had been raised by him exclusively for my formative years, it was a blood-chilling experience.

“Do you intend to be tired for training tomorrow?” he asked, leaning down like a towering tree being felled.

I was smart enough not to answer this question.

While it was too dark to make out the details of his face, I could imagine the look of his smile as he stepped toward me and commanded, “Sleep.”

I said nothing.

I returned to my bed, seeing his lanky figure watch over me from the doorway as I closed my eyes. I lay there, frozen with terror. Not an organ in my body was tired, especially my mind. I frantically attempted to navigate this situation, eventually coming to the conclusion that the best thing I could do was to relax and ignore him. He made this strategy very difficult.

“One hour,” he eventually said, presumably accurately.

In that time I had heard the clock in the hall chime once, and even without it his prized pocket watch would have sufficed, so I believed this estimate wholeheartedly. He knew I was awake; nothing could get past him. After the hour announcement, I heard the shuffling of papers and the scratching of a pen. It had become painfully clear that he had chosen to document this. What he would do with this information the next day, I could not have known.

“Two hours.”

“Three hours.”

“Four hours.”

“Five hours.”

“Six hours.”

He stood there all night, looming over me. Neither of us slept. I had slipped out an hour after being sent to bed, so the seventh hour would mean the end of his punishment’s initial phase.

“Seven hours.”

At the sound of the pen’s scrape, I opened my eyes and stepped out of bed. I did not act tired, nor did I pretend as though I had really just woken up despite being motionless the whole night. I simply went through the motion with honesty. The only dishonest thing I did was try to hide my fear.

Training that morning was more difficult than usual.

I never dared to sneak out to see my birds again, nor did I ever stay awake for a moment past lights-out for the remainder of my time staying there. In passing I would think about them, wonder about their condition, and imagine the chicks growing up. It was a happy thought to cling to during challenging times.

Eventually, after being sent off to retrieve a stray arrow shot during practice one afternoon, I came upon a familiar old firm tree. Apart from the arrow lodged in its bark, the tree was just how I remembered it. By then it had been about a week since I had last seen it or my birds, so the familiarity was pleasant. I pretended to struggle with the arrow, a great risk for what I thought of as a great reward. Rising to my toes, I gained just enough height to peer over the edge of the nest and see my birds.

Six shriveled corpses hung limply together. No wounds or signs of illness were visible. They had all starved together.

For a moment I was sad, until I remembered what I had read. My eyes turned to the fourth chick. The loss had quickly turned into rage.

I ripped the arrow from the tree with ease and pulled out the runt’s misshapen corpse with my free hand. Filled with wrath for the first time, I felt it all come over me at once. An uncontrollable force compelled me, and my body tensed. I screamed and shouted, feeling my face glow purple with pure emotional energy. I hated this bird. I hated it so much. Pinned to the tree, I drove the arrow in and out of the carcass over and over again. Powderized and dry organs crumbled from dozens of gaping holes onto the rough bark of my tree, but the passionate stabbing continued. I kept going and going until nothing was left.

Exhausted, I reexamined my surroundings. The arrow in my hand was smoking. What had previously been a pristine arrow, elegantly feathered at the end and smooth with polished oak, was now rugged and inexplicably singed. The surface of my hand was covered in charred splinters and burns. Returning to reality, I dropped the arrow onto the soft grass and turned around. The real horror set in as I made out the figure of my father watching in the distance, hidden in his long coat. I had no idea how to explain any of this, let alone where to start.

Despite everything, the man stood just there. He was beaming with pride.

As of three hours ago, my father is dead. I killed him. I am General Zed Aurum of The Indigallo Federation Army, eldest son of Charles Aurum. I want someone out there to know why I did it and why it had to be done, whether or not those are the same thing. I have so many sins to tell.
