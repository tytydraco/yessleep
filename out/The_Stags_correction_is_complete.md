The cold is the first thing I register. 

Not metaphorical cold. The real kind. November cold. The kind that sets into your marrow and makes your teeth feel architectural, like stones mortared poorly together. 

I’m sitting at the edge of a logging road that snakes into the forest behind a rental I never should’ve chosen. My coat is soaked through. My boots are full of leaf‑sludge and freezing water. My breath comes smaller now. Compartmentalized. I can feel the seams loosening between parts of me I didn’t even bother to label before tonight.

Above me, the treeline quivers — not from wind, there is no wind — but from tension, like a tendon pulled taut beneath the skin of the world. This tension has a shape now. 

A silhouette printed into the universe in a way that refuses to be unseen. The Cortex Stag. I saw it six days ago. Or maybe years. Time stopped behaving politely shortly after it noticed me back.

I’m not writing this because I feel guilt. I don’t. Guilt would imply valuation. A breach of my own internal ethic. What I’ve done has always felt like neutral math. Clean, unsentimental arithmetic. But even math requires bookkeeping, and nature has become my auditor.

Let me explain how I got here. My hands are steady enough for now. That’s fortunate. It allows me accuracy, even if it can’t buy me survival.

I grew up without internal noise. Most people carry weather in them — storms, warnings, pressure systems. Emotional thermometers swinging like pendulums. I never did. Doctors eventually gave it the expected name. My disorder didn’t feel like a revelation. More like someone finally bothered to annotate the diagram. 

By the time I left home, interpersonal attachments already felt like thin paper strained over something structural. I didn’t feel disdain, or superiority. Only distance. A permanent perimeter around others. A line you do not feel the urge to cross unless crossing solves something tangible.

Killing was not ideology for me. It was never about power. Only about silence, finality, the control of external variables. That’s the misconception people always make when they mischaracterize people like me. They imagine theater. Some diabolical soliloquy delivered under a tragic spotlight. 

In truth it was clerical. Almost banal. My murders were brief disruptions, executed because they were solvable problems whose solutions erased loose ends.

Nothing spiritual. Nothing poetic. Nothing worth lingering on. So I didn’t linger.

Then came the forest.

I moved into that rental in late autumn because it was cheap and isolated, which suited my temperament, not my philosophy. The woods were dense. Tall pines interlocking overhead like cathedral ribs. The ground was a quilt of needles, mud, and rotting leaves. Evenings fell fast there, like someone slamming a book.

The first night it happened, I heard the buck. A deep, wet guttural bellow that should’ve belonged to an elk, but didn’t. It reverberated with wrongness, like a sound file played through a medium never meant to carry it. Not through air. Through architecture. Like it came from inside the beams holding the earth upright.

The next morning, leaves near my doorstep were arranged in a spiral. A perfect logarithmic pattern, clockwise, radiating with obsessive precision. I thought it was trespassers. A hunter marking a trail. Humans always leave signatures. But this was too intentional. Too correct.

I crouched to inspect it more closely.

That’s when the paralysis began. Not physical paralysis. The cognitive kind. The realization that you are being responded to, not observed. The woods were not a passive backdrop anymore. They were a system. A closed feedback loop with me trapped at the input terminal.

I saw it then — the stag — far between the trees. The distance impossible to triangulate. It was tall — easily eight feet at the shoulder — but gaunt, malnourished in a cosmic rather than biological sense. Its body looked like an anatomical engraving: hide translucent, muscles like drawn cables, bones faint unshapely echoes beneath. 

The antlers… god, the antlers. They weren’t keratin or bone. They were dendritic nerve trees, like the bare thought‑map of something animal shaped by something neural and inhuman. They hummed faintly with bioelectric static. Like a current perpetually deciding something outside the realm of decisions.

It turned its head toward me, not to make eye contact, but to make me make eye contact.
And the woods leaned in.

I mean that literally. Branches slanted subtly like compass needles tugged by a stronger pole. Needles on pines shivered in unison. Roots flexed under soil like muscles bracing. Animals that were not animals at all blinked in patterns—owls staring from branches that drooped sideways, foxes frozen mid‑step, beetles pausing in radial symmetry. The forest was not hostile, exactly. It was reactive, like white blood cells attending a wound.

I tried speaking, which was stupid, but instinct arrived late for me.

No sound came out.

Not because I was mute, but because the clearing swallowed the acoustic transmission before it registered. Like the world filtered me out for a moment. Like silence itself became a lens.

I walked backward slowly. The forest gave a low groan, trees subtly bending, permitted by no known physics. I memorized the angle of every trunk. Tried walking a rational direction away. This time it let me think I was escaping, which was worse.

Because then it followed.

The second time I fled, I was practical about it, like someone erasing a chalk line only to find the chalk is rewriting itself. I packed nothing sentimental, only what could be quantified: water, calories, a knife whose sharpness was as mundane as its purpose. 

No trophies. No relics. No mythology. What I carried was inventory, not identity.

The stag was already present in the air by then. I didn’t have to see it to know it had crossed some threshold. The woods had begun communicating its proximity in a language without syntax: spirals in dirt, branches whose shadows arrived before the branch, the slow twisting yaw of tree trunks like screws torquing subtly tighter. The forest did not panic. Nature does not hurry when it intends to finish a sentence.

I walked instead of driving at first, thinking movement on foot would allow me better observational resolution. Within an hour, the woods reorganized itself into pattern. 

Patches of moss, stones, clusters of fallen pine cones formed long parabolic arcs that mirrored the distance between predator and prey, even if neither of us fit those clean categories anymore. 

The pines around me stood too uniform, like columns built from a blueprint rather than grown from seed. As I moved, a subtle afterimage clearing bloomed behind each step—a dark absence in the detritus where nothing was crushed, only acknowledged and recorded. 

The forest was keeping negatives of my motion, the way old photos burn a face out of paper when exposed too long to light. Only this paper was soil. And the light was attention.

The snap of a twig cracked behind me so sharply it felt like punctuation. I turned and saw it standing there, motionless again, antlers humming faintly with strings of static discharge. The shape resolved only when I looked directly at it, like the universe economized detail until a witness demanded it. Its breathing was not breathing. Its awareness was not thought. It was physics wearing the rough silhouette of a deer. 

The forest shivered, as if it had inhaled.

I moved faster after that. Into towns. Away from biology and into geometry. My plan was simple: get to places where nature was decorative, synthetic, tamed by infrastructure. Places where soil lived under concrete, trees lived in squares cut by engineers, animals lived in logos or garbage bins, not wild systems. 

If the stag was a singular organism, perhaps environment could starve it of medium. But it was not singular, not organism, not bound by medium at all. It was feedback, consequence, a correction wave moving through reality itself, vectoring toward me regardless of substrate.

The first town was small, ringed by farmland. I saw its presence at the edge of a fallow field, half‑suggested in the way rows of corn tilted ever so slightly in an arc pointing to the same unseeable node. 

I stopped at a diner whose windows fogged unnaturally fast. Condensation filigreed the glass in branching antler shapes, lightning trees of neural patterning that spidered inward toward a point mimicking where my head sat when I crossed the line of the windowsill. No one else noticed. Of course they didn’t. Nature was auditing me, not the scenery. 

The world is efficient when it rebels.
I stayed in cheap motels during that leg of travel, and that’s when sleep began to collapse. Insomnia is the wrong word for it. Sleep didn’t avoid me; it became hostile when I tried to pass into it. Each time I dropped into a dream, I hit bottom immediately. No descent. No transition. Just impact. 

In one dream I was standing in a field of black flowers whose petals opened into concentric fractal spirals like equations solving inward. In another, the woods grew inside my bedroom, not bursting in, but assembling, quietly constructing a treeline from seams of drywall and carpet fibers, pine needles unspooling like hair on the floor. 

Every dream ended with a staring shape. Every shape resolved into antlers.

I tried pills. Melatonin first. Useless. Prescription sedatives next, taken in doses that flirted with toxicity because death was less interesting than inevitability. Pharmaceuticals made sleep deeper but not wider. They only provided more darkness for the stag to arrive in.

Then shadows began behaving incorrectly while I was awake.

One evening I woke from a blink‑sleep (seconds long, hours deep) to see lamplight pooling off the walls of my motel room. The light source was obedient, but the shadows were unsupervised. They stretched the wrong way first—elongating toward me instead of away, fine tendrils of silhouette creeping like roots under a door. 

When they pooled at my feet, they formed a perfect cervine profile: the long slender skull, the antler reaches like wiring diagrams, not biological crowns. The shape shifted and unshifted depending on whether I glared directly at it or pretended not to register. The shadows were writing its body in draft, waiting for final publication.

I left the motel that night without checking out. I walked until I hit the outskirts of a regional forest preserve. That’s where it escalated violently for the first time, like nature decided to go from marginalia to direct speech.

The preserve was fenced, curated by humans who thought they could appoint peace to wilderness. But nature disobeys appointments. It kept a meeting with me anyway. As I stepped past the chain‑link, the ground sank a fraction deep, like something beneath the soil conceded the shape of a footprint without conceding the pressure. 

Leaves spiraled outward in rings like disturbed water. Rings around a well. Rings around a sentence closing.

I heard antlers tapping in the distance, rhythmic, slow, metered. The sound propagated through dirt as though dirt itself was tympanic membrane. I jogged, then sprinted, then sprinted harder when sprinting was no longer a biological verb but a panic algorithm with diminishing returns. 

The trees around me began to twist with me, trunks corkscrewing into nerve‑like patterns, phloem and xylem extruding like vein lines on pale paper. Bark peeled itself into pages. Pages printed by no hands at all.

I reached a clearing whose geometry made no sense. The opening gap between trees was narrower on approach and wider behind me, like the forest had smiled open only one way. There was no deer in the clearing I saw immediately. There was absence. The understory had withdrawn its details. 

The forest knew I would resolve the shape myself if given enough white space. And it was right.

A vibration shivered through the ground. A low, wet hum, antlers arcing up in silhouette, the stag resolving incrementally, printed into existence like a digital render loading line‑by‑line. It did not look triumphant. It looked correct. I was the thing that bent first.

The confrontation did not feel climactic to the woodland. It felt like a foregone conclusion. A theorem whose proof had finally flushed its last assumption.

I turned to leave the clearing and found roots folded over themselves in archival spirals, tightens of soil unspooling like intestines of earth itself. Not gore—ecology. The raw rebellion of external consequence.
I ran again. 

The preserve became a maze. Corners turned convex when they should be concave. Trails I never walked developed bent pines whose shadows looked older than the trees themselves, like time stamp files were being back‑written. At one point I crossed a stream whose water froze mid‑flow into radial fractals around my reflection. My reflection was not mirrored, only indexed.

I collapsed after that. Physically first, then cognitively. When exhaustion finally hit bone, I found myself back on a logging road—the same road outside the rental—like the world had folded itself into a two‑point topography with me stapled between them.

The treeline above me now quivers again in tension. The antlers are close enough that I can feel them in the interference lines of my retinas. I don’t have time anymore. My heart is stuttering like a poorly‑printed photocopy. Hands still steady. That means I can finish.

So I will finish.

Because the only thing worse than consequence is unfinished consequence.

I can hear the slow measured taps again. Not hurried. Never hurried. Nature knows it has time when it wants to end a story.

If this record survives, know this: I was not chased by morality, law, justice, or ghosts. I was chased by a system older than ethics and larger than architecture. I was corrected by the world itself, the way nature corrects invasive species—with eventual precision, not malice.

My disorder did not make me godlike. It made me detectable, a null vector in the empathic ecosystem that nature itself has begun triangulating toward.
I am visible to it not because it enjoys seeing me, but because I disturb, and disturbance must be resolved by the medium around it.

The woods snap once more, distant but aware, like the final breath being drawn through lungs made of trees.

The static hum of antlers crescendos faintly. 
Approaching and unapproaching like a wave function collapsing only when witnessed.
I don’t expect salvation. I don’t expect sympathy. Both concepts feel like fiction.

But record‑keeping is not fiction. Order is not fiction.

And the Stag is not fiction. It is the world responding, refusing silence, correcting me until no part of me can remain unindexed.

My breath comes smaller now. The forest exhales with it, patient enough to take shape only when shape is needed.

This concludes the only way nature ever intended: with me shrinking to the point where the record ends not in triumph, but in resolution.

The antlers tap once more. The system closes on input.

And everything bends to witness it.
