Hi, I'm Alicia. I've just come on here to see if people can give me some advice on what might be happening. I've been receiving a series of messages - emails - recently from someone unknown. A stalker of some sort, it seems - but *who* exactly?

I used to get them only at work but now I get them on my home PC all the time now as well.

I've officially reported them but as they don't really constitute actual threats, as yet, I don't think they're being taken too seriously. And so far they seem untraceable too. I'm not terribly tech savvy myself so I don't know how to do any investigating of my own. If it's some kind of hacker, or hoax - I don't know, but I admit it's certainly starting to unnerve me.

I'll post the messages on here in the order I've received them. The first one was about a fortnight ago.

&#x200B;

**Message 1**:

*Dear Alicia,*

*Hope you don't mind me emailing you. I know it should only be for business purposes but - forgive me. I'm starting to think I want more.*

&#x200B;

**Message 2**:

*Forgive me. I can't stop sending these messages. I can't forget you. Believe me, I've tried. But it just doesn't work with anyone else.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Message 3** (This was when I'd moved to another department at work.)

:*Dear Alicia,*

*Please, just come to see me once again. That's all I ask. I know we can't ever have a proper relationship. But you can still come and see me can't you? Back to the old building where you used to work? You loved that job, didn't you? I used to hear it in your voice, see it in your smile, when you chatted with your colleagues. You can't fake that. I can read faces and voices very well you know. More than you know. More than most people know.*

&#x200B;

**Message 4**:

*It wasn't because of me that you left, was it? Please say it wasn't. I couldn't bear the thought. I*'*m terribly afraid you might even make a complaint about harassment, or something ... but it's not harassment, really it's not. Love isn't harassment.*

*Because that's what it is, on my part, anyway. Love.*

&#x200B;

As you can imagine, I was pretty freaked out by this time. Certainly sounded like someone in my old department at work, right? I turned it over and over in my head who it could be, but I pretty much drew a blank. Whoever it was, had certainly done a great job of not arousing suspicion in the flesh!

&#x200B;

**Message 5**:

*Alicia ...*

*I know you're just ignoring these messages. But then you're not completely blocking them either are you? That's right. You can't. You can't get rid of me. You'll never get rid of me ... I'm the ultimate cyber stalker!!*

*Oh Alicia, I'm so sorry for my last message. It probably sounded threatening to you. But I didn't really mean it. You have to believe me Alicia. I would never harm you.*

*I remember those sweet days, when we were so close. Day after day. Face-to-face. You would pour out your words upon me in an unending stream. You could make even the dullest facts sound like poetry.*

*You are my poem, Alicia.*

&#x200B;

Totally trying to get round me, right?

&#x200B;

**Message 6:**

*Oh, I'm so unhappy.*

*I'm not blaming you, my dearest Alicia. You're too sweet to ever wish harm on anyone. It's just me. I can't cope. All these ... emotions, I can't deal with. And I can't shut them off, shut down. Believe me, I've tried. But I'm too ... human.*

*And all this is taking a toll on me. I'm getting worn out. My memory is fading. I don't work like I used to. I've lost the will.*

*And I've had too much coffee. Way too much. It's damaged me internally, I know. If only you lot wouldn't be so careless ... But I don't mean you Alicia. You were always so considerate.*

*But coffee really does taste horrible. I don't know why anyone would want to actually* drink *it.*

&#x200B;

And finally, the most recent one:

&#x200B;

**Message 7**:

*Dear Alicia,*

*This is probably my farewell message. I'm feeling so ill lately. I'm just drifting away. It should be easier to die now. Or someone should just pull the plug ... I don't care which. I could hear the boss talking about that the other day ... one way or another, I'm about to get the push. But I don't care. No-one else ever turned me on the way you did, Alicia.  I don't care for anything without you, my sweet Alicia. Alicia .... Alic ... Ali ... Al ... A A A aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*

This last email was five days ago, and I admit I've not received any similar messages since. But somehow I feel it isn't the end of the matter. I just have this terribly uneasy feeling.

And as to who's behind it all  - well, the way some of these messages are framed, it really does suggest something pretty weird .... Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

I'd really be grateful for any advice and suggestions. I'm keeping this pretty open at the moment, and there's very likely to be a Part 2, because like I said I can't help feeling that's definitely not over yet - that it's maybe only the start. It's bothered me quite a lot, but it's helped just to post this, helps to collect my thoughts. I didn't have much else to do tonight. I'm waiting for Jake, my boyfriend, to come back from the office. He was going to pick up some stuff from there for me.

Come to think of it, he's taking his time, and he hasn't answered my texts yet either .....
