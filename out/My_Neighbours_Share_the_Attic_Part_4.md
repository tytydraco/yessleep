Luckily, I still had the glue in my pocket. I dropped the bricks on the floor and realised I’d crushed the photo in my hand. I knew Stu needed to see it, so I stuffed it into my shirt pocket and jammed my fingers in the gap between the board and the rest of the loft hatch.  

With only a little pain it was back open. I hastily and messily spread out the glue on the side of the hatch before manoeuvring the board into place so that I could pull it closed them the other side. Then I lifted the bricks I’d carried over onto the board before heading back onto the ladder and sliding it back shut. If the glue dried before anything came back, I knew it would hold for a while at least. 

I was now back on the landing, limbs black with soot and a crumpled picture of a boy being held by a father who’d soon grieve for him in my pocket. A grieving father struggling to remember why he felt the way he did or who that person even was. 

I checked the time. It was growing dark now and the old orange street-lights were in full flow. Heading down the stairs, I felt an odd bit of calm as I watched Stu come into view. For once he wasn’t in his chair. Instead, he lingered in the doorway holding the photo I’d left on the mantelpiece; one of him, his wife and Ricky. 

The toothy grin I saw was replaced by a half smile as he looked across it. Not a sadness on his face, more a knowingness. 

For a moment, I pondered the key question. Who was I looking at here? A senile old man in his last clear-headed moments desperately trying to recall the brief moments he spent with his son? Or a man dimly remembering his horrible crimes from a life that no longer existed, awaiting judgement from above. 

I didn’t know if whatever was coming through was supernatural judgement or not. In fact, I didn’t know the nature of it at all. But I did know which version of Stu, I preferred, and that was the one I wanted to protect. 

‘I think we should leave Stu.’ He turned to me, looking at the soot on my arms and face. He took a moment, as I worried if I was going to set him off again. 

‘I don’t’ he replied lucidly. ‘I don’t think we should David’. 

He gave me a calmness, the last older relative I had taking charge of the situation. It almost made me forget what I’d run into upstairs. 

Without looking away from the picture he continued, ‘no good taking an old codger like me out into the night, I’m ready’. He had a point, it was a long way to the car and it wasn’t his fitness that bothered me. 

‘Are you sure you know what you’re ready for?’ 

‘No,’ he rolled out in his warm Yorkshire tone. ‘I don’t think anyone would be. But I’m ready to accept what this is’. 

Suddenly my voice felt very young. ‘And what is it Uncle Stu?’ 

‘I wasn’t the best husband David.’ His voice was shaking now as he looked around for reassurance, ‘I don’t even remember what ‘appened or who it even ‘appened to anymore. But I know I can’t step away from it.’ 

I shifted my weight in place for a while. I didn’t want to leave him here, nor did I want to brave the streets on my own. I’d sealed the hatch like the police told me to, nothing had tried to come into the house yet I thought to myself, and I’d thrown a brick at whatever it was up there in what they deemed a public place. They’d see me as the criminal. They weren’t coming to help us. 

I handed Stu the picture of him and Ricky. ‘I found it up there, sorry it got a bit mucked up.’ 

‘Don’t worry.’ He said. His old smile had come back as he examined what I’d given him. ‘Come on sit down, I’ll make some more tea.’ 

So that’s what we did. We sat there and drank tea, while he told me all he could remember about the photos. That they were taken on the same day, that she took the photo I’d found up there and he took a photo of the two of them which was probably out in the world somewhere. 

I told him, I was feeling a little lost in life. That I felt I was getting a little older now; that I didn’t know what the future was going to hold for me; that the past felt ever further away and that I wish I could have taken a life like Sarah has. He listened to me the whole time. I was wondering whether he was putting on a brave face to listen to me. In all honesty I probably wouldn’t even have minded and then he started speaking. 

‘You remember that old car I used to have?’ He asked, ‘the one with the handle crank on it?’ I nodded. It was the one my dad told me couldn’t exist. ‘I remember you sat in the driver’s seat pretending it was a plane. We had so much fun I missed the goal in the cup final that year. The one where we beat Manchester United.’ I smiled back at him. ‘I didn’t mind though, I bought it on video a few months later’. 

There was a pause as we took another sip of tea. 

‘I was decades older than you are now when that happened. It was nearly 30 years after all this business that’s following me... You’ll be ok.’ 

The mood changed as I heard a noise upstairs. Something was knocking on the hatch up there. Stu started breathing heavily again.  

‘Stay down here,’ I told him. He nodded back to me. 

I walked back into the half and looked up at the hatch. But in all my obsession with upstairs I’d forgotten there was a much more obvious way into the house. Quick footsteps on the concrete steps outside told me someone was about to try the door I’d left unlocked since Stacy had left. 

Slamming my weight against the door, I could feel it opening just before I blocked it. I heard a very human ooft from the other side. ‘I wouldn’t’ve done that rock-a-bye junior' shouted a cocky voice from the outside. I locked the door and checked the windows to see half a dozen figures outside all with their faces covered. One pointed directly at me and rushed towards the window. They spent a minute or two jumping up and smacking their palms against it while we waited behind the curtain. 

About the time they got bored I began to hear the sound of fingers trying to wrap themselves around the edges of the loft hatch. 

‘We know this one’s rock-a-bye' the deep voice said above me. 

The wrapping hand turned into banging now and the sound of tiny cracks in the wood were coming through. They were lifting up the bricks I’d left there and dropping them back down again. 

The 999 operator picked up quickly. I spoke just as quickly, telling them something was trying to get in. I didn’t answer when they asked what I meant by ‘something’. My focus instead was on the challenge as to how to deal with it inevitably getting through. There was pretty much nowhere to hide in the house. These things were tiny and laid out the same across the street – they'd know the spots better than me. There were a few small knives in the kitchen I could use as a last resort, but not much I could use to Home Alone my way out of this. 

I did, however, have the step ladder underneath the hatch. Those bricks would make their way through, but I gambled they’d kick their way through at the end and slide their way down. Problem for anything coming through was it was pitch black without the lights, and you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. 

Luckily for me, there was an abundance of crap in my room. Pushing the step ladder to one side I pulled out as many clothes, photos, papers or anything that’d slip on carpet and threw it onto the landing underneath the hatch. As much as it hurt me to, the guitar made a hell of an obstacle in the dark. Lastly, I lay the step ladder down on its side and slid my way back down the stairs 

The hope was, someone would land awkwardly and think they were better off giving up. Depending what came through of course. I backed into the living room and decided to wait. Stu was back in his chair, breathing heavily. His eyes wobbled again, staring at the closed door. 

It was about then, I realised there was another way into the house which should have been obvious. The window crashed behind the curtain, and through it a hard object flew through and glanced the back of my head. The rest of it felt like a dream as I fell to the ground and dragged myself away to the kitchen. 

Stu looked down at me as the crash of the step ladder and a shriek came from upstairs. The police would later tell me they found a smashed guitar and a broken step ladder at the bottom of the stairs.  

Muffled voices continued before the unmistakeable stamp of heavy feet came down towards us. Later I’d see the sooty footprints of half a dozen grown men coming down those stairs and towards the living room, but right now all I could do was wait behind the door to the kitchen while both me and Stu kept staring at the door to the hall.  

When it smashed open, I was in no fit state to care, and had it taken longer for the ambulance to arrive I might not have been able to tell the story.  

What I saw were six young men looking expressionless at an old man sat in his chair waiting for judgement to come to him. They stood motionless in that doorway as I passed out. 

I’ll never know whether Stu stopped breathing before he saw them or not, and I’ll never know what stopped those footprints coming any further into the room. But if Stu was still alive to see them, they must have looked like miners.
