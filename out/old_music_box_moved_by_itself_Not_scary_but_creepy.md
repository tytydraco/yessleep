old music box moved by itself. Not scary but creepy

Hi, I'm not sure if this is scary enough to be posted on this subreddit. So if this is not eligible to post for whatever reason then I'll remove it. Anyway I just wanted to share this personal experience that I thought was creepy as it happened on my birthday. So anyway onto the story.

So one day it was my birthday and I was sitting in the living room minding my own business. A normal day.  However the old Peter Rabbit (its an old Victoria fictional character) decidex to play for a little bit. And we could all see it turning just slightly. Anyway it creeped me out a bit as it has never done that before and it's a pretty old music box. Of course there could be a scientific explanation but I do not know what this could be. Anyway I know this might sound silly to some but to me it sounded creepy. Anyway I would like to know you're thoughts if you have a scientific explanation.

Anyway I know that this subreddit has a minimum of 500 words but I don't really know what to say. Anyway I guess if you have any questions feel free to ask them but I would not be answering any questions that are not relavant to my post obviously. Also I will not respond to any rude comments so I wouldn't waste your breath. Also just to say that I'm not saying that I think this was an entire paranormal experience. What I'm saying is that I would like to know if there is a scientific explanation. Anyway I do hope I am reaching the five hundred word limit because its getting kind of anoyying to have to write five hundred words when all I wanted to do is write a simple summary. Anyway I guess what I'll also say is when I get an answer that I feel is explanatory I will delete this post. Anyway thanks for reading if you read this far. Nope still haven't reached five hundred words so I guess you can ignore the rest as it's just filler.
