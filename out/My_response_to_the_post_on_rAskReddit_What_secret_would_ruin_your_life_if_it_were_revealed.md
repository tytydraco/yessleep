So where do I begin? Well, let's just say this story is quite messed up. It all started in 2020 with the rise of the Coronavirus. The origin of the virus remains unknown, with speculation ranging from a bat in a Wuhan lab to various other theories. However, bats are innocent creatures in all of this.

How do I know? I'll explain later. Right now, I want to clarify that I'm far from innocent. I've confessed my deeds to someone, but they conveniently forgot everything I told them. I chose a hungry moment to spill the big secret.

Anyways, the important thing is to cherish your memories. Hold them close and keep them precious. The more cherished they are, the brighter and more filling they become.

I apologize for beating around the bush. The truth is, I didn't create the Coronavirus. Instead, it created me in a crazy kinda way. It enabled me by giving me a really strange superpower, one that is rather evil. I know it sounds absurd, but let me explain.

My superpower is causing memory loss, sometimes even dementia. Did I invent dementia? No, don't be ridiculous. I am more than capable to cause it though.

What do I gain from this ability? The Coronavirus has made it so that I can only derive sustenance and vitality from memories. It doesn't make much sense, I admit, but please trust me. However, I do have an appetite for this peculiar diet, so you'll be safe reading this account. Well, most of you, anyways. If you want to test whether or not I've taken a piece of your mind, try recalling what this post was about later today. See if you can even remember reading it. Eight out of ten of you will pass this test. Crazy, I know.

As for the truth behind the Coronavirus, it was revealed, and it is indeed incredibly disturbing. The revelation led to many tragic events, including suicides. Yes... it was that disturbing. The truth turned out to be far more complex than it seems.

But how did I erase this knowledge? Why don't you know about it? You knew before, but now you don't. Well, I collaborated with an elite group to suppress this information. They provided me with extraordinary supplements to enhance my appetite, and I consumed all the memories. They deleted the files, the YouTube videos, the podcasts, and the streams featuring people succumbing to despair from their own mind (after discovering the truth)...

Now, no one will know about the chaos unfolding behind the scenes and the crazy shit that once consumed the world.

"But wait," you might say, "you're revealing it right now!" Yes, indeed, my dear genius. However, this is all taking place on a fictional subreddit dedicated to fabricated stories. It's the perfect cover-up! I'm just joking, guys. See? It's as simple as that. Now, if you believe me, you might appear a little crazy. But maybe you are. Or maybe you're not. But then again, maybe you are. Or maybe you're not.
