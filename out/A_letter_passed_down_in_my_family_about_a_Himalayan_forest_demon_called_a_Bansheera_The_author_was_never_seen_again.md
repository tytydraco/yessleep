My love Shanti

This might be the last time I am speak directly to you. The past few days have been very difficult for me. Ever since I left home there had been this feeling of dread in the air. I know you told me to not take the mountain pass I still decided to take it as I want to reach Kamala soon. I know you believe that the retracted (Family name) put a curse on her unborn child, but I still think I am partially responsible for letting it happen and not going to our deo (devta or local god) soon enough as we all know he could have saved the child. I wanted to rush but I should’ve listened to you.

The second sunset after my departure I was resting under a deodar tree, I had crossed the Khagna pass and was trying to reach Godhna. That was when the snow came down and it snowed so much that my knees were in the snow in a few hours. I decided to set up my Pandal (tent) there only. You know this area has brags (leopards) and I wanted to avoid them. I wanted to go and empty my bladder so I found a tree far away from my pandal but I should have been more careful because I noticed later the next morning that the tree was marked by a forest deity.

That night when I slept I dreamt of you and Kamala, back when she was young. You both were playing and I approached you but the weird thing about this was I wasn’t in my body. I was behind a tree observing me approach you and kamala, almost like I was stalking us. Such a Weird thing to write, “I’ was stalking “us’’.

I woke up the next noon very late which Is strange as even you know that I have always naturally woken up in the early hours of the day no matter how tired I am and how late I sleep. As I got up I noticed that there were footsteps of a foot without any boots on the surface of the snow. It seemed like whoever made those footsteps walked on the snow as if walking on water. His feet did not sink in the snow unlike me, and the snow reached up to my thighs at points. I decided to not go further on this route as you know how remote the parts after Josh are. I decided to go back and around the mountain where the paths are laid. There was one more thing I noticed. The air smelled like a Khadu was nearby, but such animals never are in places like these. I reasoned to myself that there must be a khet (farm) nearby but I couldn’t have missed it since this area is all forest and my pandal was almost near the pass. I started walking back when I noticed my mistake and started praying to the deo as I could now see what was happening with me.

The forest deity whose tree I spoiled was a Bansheera. As I started walking back not even one kilometre had passed and I heard the cowbells of a khadu dingle in the distance behind me. This was a very malicious sign and I picked up my pace but now the snow had started falling again and it was becoming darker and more difficult to see because some mist had formed around me. I do not know how long I tried to walk away from the cowbells but it never went away. I must have walked for hours as I was very tired and getting cold and dizzy but never did I stop praying and asking the deo for guidance. At some point I sat down due to exhaustion and the cowbells stopped jingling behind me but the smell did not go away. I think because of the exhaustion I forgot to pray and I heard Kamala’s voice in the distance. She was calling me, begging me to turn back but I did not turn or reply because the elders always used to say “When the Bansheera calls, do not turn back or reply. If you do, you’ll have to fight as there is no flight.”

It was there, talking to me in Kamala’s voice for hours. Soon it became night, but it never stopped talking to me. It told me stories about our time together, about Kamala’s childhood and gossip about her sasural (husband’s home) as if it knew everything. It laughed and cried but never did its voice show any emotions. I was getting more exhausted when suddenly the voice stopped and even the smell went away. I thought my prayers had been answered and the bansheera had gone away. I started to drift into sleep when I heard your voice. The foul spirit imitated you as if you were in those woods searching for me and before I could realise what was happening I jolted upright and turned towards the sound. The first thing to hit me was the smell. A khadu doesn’t smell that bad all things considered but this was like smelling a hundred khadus together in an enclosed space. Then I saw me, it was me whatever it was sitting in the same position as me some 50 meters away. 

After this happened it retreated away into the forest. And so did the mist and the snowfall. Even though it had been snowing for hours at this point the snow hadn’t accumulated on top of the existing one. It was as if the fallen snow had also vanished. After all of this came the question of where the Bansheera had gone but by this time my fate had already been decided. They say that a bansheera has the power of a dozen khadu’s but even a strong man like me cannot take so many at once.

I think it gave me the night to prepare and rest as it only reappeared in the morning. I woke up and had the last food left with me to look up and see the other me sitting in the exact same position like me some 50 meters away. That is when I started writing this letter and I have noticed that everytime I look up it comes nearer and nearer. I think it will be right next to me this time as it was only 5 meters away from me the last time. I can only live if the deo decides to come and save me or give me super strength.

I just want to say that I love you with every part of me, and I love kamala equally and tell her that I am sorry. I am also sorry that I did not get to take you to Shimla. I know it was your dream. There is a wad of cash near the wheat barrel. Take it and go if I do not come back. I was saving it for that purpose specifically. It’s enough for one. Pray to the Deo for my soul.

Your loving husband
