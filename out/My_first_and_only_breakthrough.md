I’m writing this down because I have finally come to accept this reality. 

It started one night with me and 21 grams of mushrooms. I had built my tolerance up to the point where I could do large doses and not be severely affected. 

I had been constantly been taking higher and higher doses looking for an ego death. I had never fully given in to experience full visions or ego death. 

I think what made it hit really hard this time is that I took a month tolerance break before eating the mushrooms. 

In total I had one chocolate bar, and 20 grams of dried mushrooms. Before I went to sleep I ate all 20 grams of mushrooms and I ate 4 pieces of the chocolate bar which was roughly 1 gram. 

When I went tried to sleep it was around 11:30 I woke up suddenly two hours later at one am. I checked my phone and looked around.

 The darkness itself took form and shifted into beings. 

These beings had masks similar in appearance to Melpomene masks. But each of them had a different emotion. If you’ve ever seen Spirited away it was similar to no face. 

Except these beings had black skin tight suits with these masks. They morphed into reality itself and when I looked out the window one of these beings turned into the night sky and moon.

I had no depth perception, it was as if I was watching the curtains unveil and a  school play form right in front of me. 

As I was staring outside the window the light in my apartment complex go out. I heard the neighbors scream “Ya se fue la luz”

For you people who don’t know Spanish that roughly translates to “the electricity has gone out” 

Then it hit me, the fear rushed to my body. I couldn’t tell if I was tripping or not anymore. I fully forgot I even took anything. The sky and the moon then shifted back into these beings. Their presence and height couldn’t be made out as there was no depth perception. 

They stood over me and pointed and moved their chest and bodies as if they were laughing yet they made no sound. Think of them as mimes. 

These beings then proceeded to show me realities where I had no control. 

They morphed into the gym I usually go to and planted me in there. They let me gain consciousness but made me forget I had taken anything. 

I was working out in the gym as usual when I noticed an old guy who is usually at the gym who looks native. 

Except when I noticed this man he had a necklace adorned in gem stones and feathers . He then stared back at me and when he did… suddenly everyone in the gym stopped & dropped what they were doing and also stared at me. 

Having every single head in the gym jerk and stare at me was frightening. As soon as I realized this wasn’t normal the roof got torn on by one of these same beings from earlier. It had the smiling mask on its face. 

This being reached down and grabbed me and shoved me into the mouth of its mask. 
Except I didn’t fall into its throat or anything. I was simply transported into another reality. 

This time I was transported into one of those sitcom looking suburban areas. These houses were big two story houses that looked copy and pasted for miles and miles. I was looking at this from a third person point of view. When suddenly I was looking at this from a point of view of a pit bull. 

I saw the paper boy from my the front yard and I chased after him down the street. When he got down the road I was suddenly shifted back from a third person point of view. 

Like the point of view of a drone. When it started rising I saw the whole area morph back into the beings. The road morphed into a being with a skin tight grey suit and a white mask. The grass & hills morphed into a being with a green suit. 

The sky and sun morphed into a being with a blue suit and white mask. It was as if they were popping out from a screen. Again I had no depth perception as if everything was just an illusion. 

As soon as I had that thought these beings finally talked. They said nonsense that translated both into “You’re finally figuring things out/You’re begging to forget” 

It sounded as if they were saying these both but only speaking once. Think of it as the whole Yanny/Laurel thing. I would hear one thing and then the other despite them making the same noise. 

I was then transported into another reality. This time I was I was in my school, I was looking at my classmate and thought “damn, I wish I could fuck her” 

When suddenly she burst out laughing, “You’re a freak wanting to fuck yourself” 
I looked at her in disbelief and said what? 

When suddenly I could hear everyone’s voices in my head as they ridiculed me. They pointed out every single bad thing I had done. Every single desire I had had. Even my most private and personal experiences. 

They all laugh and pointed at me morphing into everyone I had ever met. Yet I could tell there were only 6 beings in total. They constantly morphed into different people and chanted “he’s finally figured it out, he’s begging to forget”. 

Much the same as the beings from before. When I realized this I was horrified and wet myself in the vision. This only added fuel to the flame and made everyone laugh harder. 

They said,
“Oh man. You’ve only been interacting with yourself” “what an absolute loser” 
My ex suddenly looked at me morphed herself into me

The girl I had thought about having sex with also suddenly morphed into me and laughed maniacally. 

“We’ve been telling you to come to our side but you refuse over and over again. You’d rather play these games with yourself than face reality and come with us” 

Then the whole classroom morphed into me and back into the masked beings. They proceeded to point and laugh at me yet they made no sound once again. 

Then suddenly I was transported into another reality. This time I was the hasbro operation game. These 6 doctors were operating on me. They constantly hit the metal wire and set off these funny alarms and sounds. 

They said “UH OHHHH WE’RE LOOOOOSING HIMMM” 

Their voices would go from slow pitched to high pitch. When suddenly one of these beings morphed back into the black suit and white mask and reached into the board/me and grabbed my heart and manually started pumping it. 

Just breathe and you’ll be okay they said, I felt my lungs fill up with air and the beeping of a heart monitor went from flatlining to beeping once again. 

Another being said “UH OHHHH, HEEEE’REEE WE GO AGAIIINNNN!!” 

I was then suddenly transported into a laboratory with 5 different classmates and one professor. One of these kids said 

“Professor we’ve finally done it!! We finally found the elixir to immortality! If my calculations are correct this should finally work!!” 

“Should we test it?” Another classmate chimed in. 

“I don’t see why not” the professor said 

“We’ll do it as a group!” The others chimed in. 

Everyone looked at each other and agreed. We split the elixir into vials with equal parts and we collectively drank as a group. 

Then suddenly a wormhole appeared in the middle of the class, I could feel myself being sucked in alongside the others. Then the black hole suddenly disappeared and we were once again in the class. 

Except we were stuck in the class, it had been transported into a reality of nothingness. When we opened the door there was nothing outside the class. Only darkness. We started to freak out and tried to figure a way out. 

When we stepped out the classroom we only floated in empty space. Yet when we went back into the class we were still floating. 

We could seemingly control if we floated or not. It was fun at first but we soon grew tired of “zero gravity” we were able to also control things around us and move them through telekinesis. No matter how much we seemed to walk or float we made no progress. 

The classroom was the same distance no matter what we did. We soon floated back into the class and tried to brainstorm a way to reverse this. 

Except it was futile. Nothing we did worked, nothing we did mattered. Millenia passed yet we did not age. We were stuck in time, helpless. 

“There’s nothing we can do, nothing we do works. There’s no returning back to our reality, our normal” said the professor. 

“I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!” One of the classmates screamed.  

“I’m going to end this once and for all, a life like this isn’t worth living” the same classmate these proceeded to bang their heads on the table until they were a bloody mess and fell back. 

When we all went to look they were laying on the floor with a peaceful smile on their face. 

The professor said, “looks like that’s the only way our children” 

The whole experience itself was similar to a mushroom trip. 

“I can’t accept that I can’t just kill myself. What the fuck is wrong with you guys. There must be a way out. I can’t simply just accept this and kill myself” I said

The other classmates  looked at me in disbelief and with a sorry expression. 

“None of this FUCKING MATTERS” I said. 

I started flipping over tables and throwing things. I even lay down my finger flat against my teeth the long way and bit down into my finger as hard as possible. Except I couldn’t go through with biting my finger off. 

I just lay there on the floor crying. Everyone gathered around me and just stared. 

When suddenly my surroundings morphed around me once again. This time I was on the floor in my living room. Except it was as if only my living room was transported into a jungle. 

My mother came up to me and asked “why are you crying son? What happened, why are you on the floor? 

I looked around in disbelief and the first thought that came to mind was to point at my brother and yell.  

“It’s all his fault, he’s the reason this happened”

My brother appeared on a tree behind her, he was on a branch. He started jumping side to side and pointing and laughing at me. 

He transformed into a little monkey with a cap and proceeded to do the same motion ridiculing me. 

All my family came to stare at me, it was my mom and dad and 3 brothers and 1 sister. 

(Notice how it’s all 7 people including me? This theme resonated throughout the whole experience. The same 6 beings, if you include me it’s 7. The rest of this earth is just me pretending to be other people.) 

(Back to the story now) 

My mom then preceded to roll her eyes except her eyeballs rolled around her sockets and into her skull. Transforming into one of the beings. 

“No silly, you did this to yourself. All of this is just you, why can’t you understand that?“ 

The rest of my family proceeded to transform once again into these 6 beings and chanted “You’re finally figuring it out/ You’re begging to forget”

It sounded like both of these things yet then only making the same noise over and over again. 

I was suddenly transported onto a world that looked like the surface of mars. There were tall buildings that looked futuristic yet ancient at the same time. Buildings that looked like Greek architecture made out of white stone, light, metal. 

It looked as if reality was collapsing in on itself. These buildings were collapsing and on fire. Chunks of the sky itself was falling and crashing into the ground causing even more chaos. It looked like the aftermath of a nuclear war. 

These 6 beings transformed into white cloaks with crowned wreaths made out of leaves. They were all running into beams of light like a beam that a ufo would make except there was no ufo. Just a beam of light coming straight out of the sky. 

“Come on!! You have to come with us” one of the beings said who had shifted into a beautiful woman. 

“NO!! I want to stay here. I’m scared. I don’t want to go with you guys. Just leave me” I said 

She rolled her eyes at me and said “Suit yourself, you’ll be nothing but lonely. This is your last chance. We won’t come back for you” she said 

I ignored her and layed in the floor and morphed into reality itself. I then got transpired into nothing ness. I was just in deep empty space. Forever alone. 

I then saw myself recreating reality, living countless and thousands of lives. I saw myself start out as a cave man. 

My mother was in a cave with me. She had a torch similar to a candle. She and my dad were also cave man attire.  

“Whats wrong with him?” My dad asked 

It was in a language unfamiliar to me yet I understood everything. 

“Idk my mom said, he took some mushrooms and now he’s acting like this” 

She grabbed my face and shined the light into my eyes. 

“Here,  just drink some water and it will all be okay my son. Everything will be okay just drink water”

In the cave I repeatedly called out for my mother, I could see her in front of me yet to me she was far away. My depth perception was off. 

“Yes?” She said, when I heard her reply back I simply said “Nevermind” 

She just looked at me confused and started crying, as did my father. 

Then reality itself once shifted into me in my bed. 

These beings hovered over me and said “once again you broke the illusion. Yet every single time you awaken you refuse to accept your reality. You would rather blind and numb yourself than face the consequences. We’re growing really tired of having so fix your fuck ups. If you do this one more time we might not be able to fix it. Now go back to your silly previous pathetic life and enjoy way you so desperately cling on to”

I woke up again this time for real. I looked around me and saw my room a complete mess. It was 6 am when I woke up. 

The power was out for reals and didn’t come back on until 8 am. 

I showered and changed clothes as I had really pissed myself. I later found out from my siblings that they did in fact find me and were holding candles because the power was out. My mother had given me water to drink and told me to lay down and just relax. 

My room was a mess, I had flipped over my coffee table that is 4x4 feet and weighs at least 100 pounds. Things scattered everywhere, all over the room. 

This happened in 2023, it took my two years to come to acceptance with this. And yet I still believe to accept what I’ve learned and what those beings were trying to get through to me. 

All of us are just one being trying so desperately not to feel lonely. We’d rather be stuck in this illusion than deal with the consequences.
