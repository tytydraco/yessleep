I sat on my couch holding the tv remote in a hand and a packet of crisps in the remaining hand, infront of me the tv was. It was dark outside, the middle of the night, and the owls were sleeping, and the moon hang in the air like the sun does during the day. I was home alone.

Over the last few nights there had been a number of strange occurrences:
Doors opening by themselves, Doors closing by themselves, Doors unbolting themselves from their hinges and launching themselves at speeds of near 35kmh into the air. 
It was clear my house had a ghost in it, and the ghost was mad. 

As i watched the tv, i felt a strangle tingle run up my inner loins that i was being watched. I twisted around hastily and peered at my shadowed living room. Nothing there. From my pants i produced a candle, rubbing two twigs together i started a small fire and set the candle alight. Then i got off my couch and walked towards the darkness.
"Bang!" said the shattering window, as a brick flew inside. Someone has thrown that, I thought to myself. The brick lay on the floor, on it written in blood said 'change the channel'.
I picked up the remote and switched the channel, the channel changed to the movie Goodfellas, when all of a sudden another brick flew in. It landed on my lap, and written in blood it said 'thank you'. 
Thats when i heard a door behind me open. It was the door ghost i was explaining earlier. A door flew across the room, missing me but hitting an unsuspecting wall. I threw the door back and heard a loud "Ouch!" coming from the ghosts mouth. 

During the fight i heard the show on the tv change, and as i was fighting the door ghost a brick flew through the window, hitting the door ghost knocking it out and saving the day.
In blood the brick said 'can you change the channel again please' 
'Yes' i said thankfully as the brick thrower saved me from the door ghost, 'show yourself i want to thank you for saving me'.
There was a moments pause and then out from the shadows stepped Martin Scoresese.

For the next few weeks i lay completely naked and hidden, spying on anthills. I watched the ants, they crawled, rummaged, walked, dug. I watched intently, the cool breeze against my bare body. Each day i would come to the same spot, overhanging the anthill in bizarre positions from an overhanging branch. 

One day when i returned home i looked inside to where the door ghost was previously lying. But this time that spot was empty. That implies the door ghost isnt dead and has escaped. 

I will end this story with an excerpt from my grandpa:
'I am your grandpa, hear what i say:
I am a trusty door salesman, i love doors so much, you can walk through them and you never know whats in the next room, every door is a possibility. 
However the market went dry, noone wanted to buy my doors, everyone already had all the doors they needed. This caused me to go mad. I set my one goal to completely destroy the open plan living industry, and make as many rooms so i can sell my doors.
The first house i went to was a big house on a hill owned by a very rich man, he had an open plan living with not many rooms, so sneakily i snuck into his house and started making as many walls made of bricks in the house as possible in order to sell my doors. However the owner, Martin Scorsese, was enraged and in a fit started breaking down the walls i had placed.

We got into a tustle and i was fatally killed as he threw a brick from one of the walls i made at me. 
"Enjoy the door to your coffin" Martin yelled as i died.

Im now a ghost, and the Parenting Council of Ghosts has said that i can leave the endless cycle of being killed the way i died, on the one condition that I help stop my grandson with his strange behaviour around anthills, but i find it rather challenging as he always beats me up with my own doors.

In my final words, I, Steven Spieleberg, will recite the chorus to my favourite song by the Wutang Clan:

Cash rules everything around me C.r.e.a.m get the money dollar dollar bills yall
Cash rules everything around me C.r.e.a.m get the money dollar dollar bills yall
