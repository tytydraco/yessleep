Growing up in a small town nestled between rolling hills, superstitions were as common as the sunrise. Among them, the belief that a dog's howling foretold a death held a particularly eerie grip on my hometown.

My grandmother, a staunch believer in such omens, often recounted tales of dogs howling in the dead of night, only for tragedy to strike soon after. As a child, I listened wide-eyed to these stories, half fascinated and half terrified by the idea of such supernatural warnings.

One day, while walking home from school, I heard it—our neighbor's dog's mournful howl echoing on the roads. I quickened my pace, eager to reach the safety of home. That night, the atmosphere at dinner was tense. My grandmother sat in her usual spot, her brow furrowed in deep thought. "Did you hear it?" she finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I nodded hesitantly, unsure if I truly believed in the omen. But as the days passed, a sense of unease settled over the neighborhood. News spread quickly—a beloved elder from down the street passed away. The coincidence was unnerving, to say the least. Whispers of the dog's howl and the old woman's death mingled in hushed conversations at the market and over backyard fences. Some dismissed it as mere chance, while others nodded knowingly, their belief in the superstition reinforced.
As weeks turned into months, I found myself attuned to the slightest sound of a dog's howl. Each instance sent a shiver down my spine, a reminder of the fragile balance between life and death.

One winter evening, a stray dog wandered into our yard. Its mournful howl pierced the silence, sending a chill through my bones. My grandmother's face paled as she clasped her hands tightly. That night, a phone call shattered the quiet. A distant relative, whom we had not seen in years, had passed away unexpectedly. The connection was undeniable—the stray dog's howl had heralded another loss.

In the years since, I've moved away from that small town, embracing a more rational worldview. Yet, the memory of those eerie evenings and the superstition that gripped our community remains etched in my mind. Sometimes, late at night, when the wind howls through city streets, I catch myself listening for echoes of a distant dog's mournful cry, wondering if some beliefs are rooted deeper than reason can reach.

I came back to my hometown recently, and one of my family friends was in the hospital. They also died recently. Needless to say, that was also followed by a dog howl. As the years passed, the superstitions of my childhood seemed to fade into the background of my life. I studied hard, left for college, and pursued a career in a bustling city far removed from the quaint, eerie traditions of my youth. Yet, the memories lingered, like shadows cast by the flickering flame of a long-extinguished candle. Even now, in the quiet moments between the rush of everyday life, I sometimes think back to those nights in my grandmother's house. I wonder about the nature of belief, the things we hold onto in the face of the unknown, and the ways in which the past continues to shape our present. Perhaps there is something to be said for the power of stories, the way they bind us to our history and our community. Or perhaps it's simply human nature to seek patterns in the chaos, to find meaning in the seemingly random events of life. Whatever the case, the howling of dogs will forever remind me of the delicate balance between life and death, the thin veil that separates this world from whatever lies beyond.

I am scared, to be honest.
