When I was a child, my family and I moved to a small town between two big cities. It was a very small town, with few inhabitants, few houses, and few shops, there really wasn’t much to do. I was a child, and I didn’t get bored easily; my imagination gave me hours and hours of fun.

When we arrived at our new house, I noticed that it was a bit old, but very beautiful. It had a large porch and a garden so big you couldn’t see the end of it at first glance. When I entered the house, I saw that they were still painting the kitchen, the bedrooms and that’s when I realized there was a basement.

I didn’t even ask my parents if I could go down. Before I knew it, I was already on the stairs, slowly holding onto the wooden handrail that looked like it had been built a long time ago, it seemed very weak. I went down carefully because there was no light, or at least I hadn’t found it yet.

When I finally reached the bottom, I saw that it was full of stuff. There were heavy looking metal boxes I couldn’t move with my feet. There was what looked like a very large table with something on top. I kept searching for the light, and when I finally found it… my eyes couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

On the table lay a strange body lifeless, dry, and with a dusty, earthy color. It looked like it had been preserved, almost mummified. I had no idea what it was, but one thing I was sure of: it was not human. Its head was huge, its eyes long, and all its limbs were extremely long, it seemed very tall. I just stood there, frozen, in shock. I don’t know if it was out of fear or curiosity.

I ran upstairs to tell my parents, but they didn’t believe me. I kept repeating over and over, “There’s something strange in the basement, please come!” They just kept laughing and saying, “What an imagination you have, sweetheart.” That night they sent me to my room to sleep, and I had no choice but to obey.

The next morning, I went back down to the basement without anyone noticing. I turned on the light, and to my surprise, there was nothing there. It looked like no one had ever been there. The boxes, the table, and that thing on the table… were gone! For a moment, I thought I was going crazy. Maybe it had all been my imagination, just like my parents said. Maybe I just needed more rest… I didn’t know.

I spent the entire day thinking about what had happened the night before so many questions and no answers. When night finally came, I stepped out onto the porch and saw, hanging from a distant tree, an old tire swing. I went over, sat on it, and started thinking. Nothing could get that image out of my head. Suddenly, I saw a bright light in the sky getting closer to me very quickly. I felt a horrible fear and started running toward the house when I felt something lifting me, I was no longer touching the ground.

I was being pulled up by that light, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. I tried with all my strength, but it was useless. I heard a loud noise, and suddenly, I lost consciousness.

That’s all I remember from that night. I blacked out and didn’t know anything else about myself. I woke up the next morning tucked into my bed, with a horrible headache and a red mark on my wrist. It looked like a symbol or a sign like a language I had never seen before. I told everything to my parents, and only then did they believe that something strange was happening, that maybe what I had seen in the basement had been real.

A week later, we moved out of that house. I left with so many questions in the air… but with a mark on my wrist that wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. To this day, I still have too many questions but of one thing I am certain:
someday, they will come back for me…
