I’ve always been a fast typer. My thumbs move across the screen without me even looking, trusting the auto-correct to fix my mistakes. I was sitting on my couch last night, scrolling through social media, when I realized it was past 11:00 PM. I knew my mom would be worrying, so I opened our chat to send a quick update.

I typed: Hey, just got home. I’m safe.

I hit send without looking. A second later, I glanced at the bubble. The text didn't say "I'm safe." It said: Hey, just got home. I’m in the basement.

I frowned. That was a weird glitch. I tapped the text box and tried again. Sorry, typo. I meant to say I'm safe.

I watched the screen this time. As soon as I hit the spacebar after "safe," the letters flickered and danced. The word deleted itself and replaced itself with the same creepy phrase: I’m in the basement.

My heart gave a small thud. I don't even have a basement. I live in a second-story apartment with nothing but a concrete foundation and a parking garage below me.

I went into my settings and turned off auto-correct and predictive text. I went back to the chat, determined to fix the mistake.

I typed: My phone is acting up. I am S-A-F-E.

Before I could hit the send arrow, the phone vibrated violently in my hand. The cursor began to move on its own, flying across the white box. It deleted my message character by character. Then, a new sentence started typing itself out, the gray bubbles appearing as if someone was on the other side of my screen.

He is watching you type this.

I dropped the phone on the coffee table. It landed face up, the screen glowing in the dark room. I looked around my apartment. Everything was quiet. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. I was alone.

The phone buzzed again. A new message appeared in the box, but I hadn't touched the screen.

Don't look at the closet.

My eyes immediately darted to the bedroom door. The closet door was cracked open just an inch. I always keep it shut. I felt a cold sweat break out across my forehead. I reached for the phone, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped it again. I tried to call 911, but every time I tapped the phone icon, the music app opened instead. It started playing a recording.

It was the sound of someone breathing. It was heavy, slow, and coming from a very small space.

I looked back at the text thread. A new message was waiting for me.

He likes it when you breathe fast. It makes the hunt shorter.

I stood up to run for the front door, but my phone screen flashed a bright, blinding red. A final message popped up, filling the entire screen in giant, bold letters:

Look behind the couch.

I didn't want to. I tried to keep my eyes forward, but I felt a hand—cold, thin, and smelling of old dirt wrap around my ankle from under the cushions.

My phone vibrated one last time on the table. It was a text from my mom.

Honey, why did you just send me a picture of yourself sleeping? And who is that standing in the corner of your room?

I looked at the screen, but the hand pulled me down before I could see the photo. The last thing I saw was my phone screen auto-correcting my final, unsent scream into the words: Everything is fine.
