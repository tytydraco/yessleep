Luke sucks at soccer. I have to admit it. I know as a dad that is a terrible thing to say. But it is the truth.

My eight year old son is much better at math than running about dribbling the ball on the pitch. But he has the time of his life every time he steps on the soccer field. His enthusiasm, often rubbing off on his teammates and, many times, even the coach.

Whether it is a practice session during the weekdays or a game on the weekends, Luke gives it his all, even if the end result is not to his liking.

And today would be a good example of that.

His team the Trailblazers got their behinds razed in typical lawn mower fashion with a 0-7 drubbing.

While Luke secretly likes to address himself and his teammates as ‘Messi’s Boys’, the game today was messy alright, just like it had been all year round. The kids are yet to open their account this season.

But I honestly didn’t mind. I was just happy to see my son pursue something with passion.

While he did sit and brood at the end of each game, it never dampened the zest he had for life. And the losses only made him more determined.

  So, it has become customary for me to treat a sulking Luke to an ice cream at his favorite joint after every Sunday game, where he would sit and go over the game specifics, in the hopes that a change of tactics would somehow lead to a change of outcome in the next.

His attention however changed midway when he suddenly spotted a large limousine stop at a construction site nearby.

“Dad, do you drive one of those?” he asked, his gaze fixed on the car while he slowly licked his ice cream.  

I wasn’t surprised at the question since I worked as a driver for a car rental agency. But we no longer had those stretch limousines at our shop anymore. Its popularity had waned over the years, and a lot of travelling businessmen now find them tacky to use in the New York financial circles at least.

“No buddy. But your grandpa did. In fact, he used to pick me up from school in that car often, and we used to go on long drives.” I said.

“I would like to travel in that too someday”, Luke replied back, his eyes still fixed on the car.

“Well, maybe you can take your date to prom in that thing in a few years. Hopefully you will learn to kiss a girl before that,” I said teasingly, while Luke shrivelled his nose in mock disgust.

The sight of the limousine however stirred up mixed feelings in me. My dad, Henry Pritchard walked out of my life when I was 10 years old. I remember it vividly even today. He approached me one day and announced that he was traveling abroad for a little while. He emphasized that I was to be the man of the house until his return, and instructed me to take good care of Mom in his absence.

When he picked up his suitcase and left the apartment, I ran to my room to look through the window that overlooked the driveway. There, I saw a large red-colored limousine parked out in front.

Dad approached the car and then turned around to look at me. He knew I would be watching him from behind the curtains. He simply raised his hands and waved at me one last time before entering the car. I never saw or heard from him again.

 My thoughts were suddenly interrupted when I felt my phone ring in my pocket, it was from my Boss Gary Mehicus.

“Hey Matt, we got a new booking today. Big fish by the looks of it. He’s booked us for the whole month. Insisted on you being the wheelman, said you came highly recommended. You think you can handle it for the entire time?” he asked me.

 “Sure Boss. Just tell me when and where,” I responded.

“Great. Take good care of him Matt. He might just tip you a sack of gold” Gary said laughing. ”Oh, and take Roy out for a spin” he added, before ending the call.

Roy, a custom-ordered Rolls Royce Phantom, is our best car at the rental agency. He is reserved exclusively for our top clients.

Gary and I visited the manufacturers and spent a few of days meticulously selecting every detail for Roy, from Arctic white leather seats to discreet bullet-proofing, wood veneers to upholstery, and every other amenity to achieve the best blend luxury and security.

Gary and I go back a long way. In fact, he was best friends with my dad, and they both used to work for the same rental agency. Gary is also my godfather, and when my dad went missing, he went the extra mile to fill the void in my life.

I developed a rebellious streak in my early teens, angry that dad had abandoned me and mom as a family.

For the first few months after his disappearance, I made it a point to peek at the window every day, sometimes for hours, hoping he would eventually turn up—a habit that never stopped and still continues subconsciously to this day, although I know better now.

However, back then, it eventually turned to anger, and Mom had a difficult time controlling me as a kid.

My grades started falling, I would randomly pick fights with children in school, and I even tried my luck being an errand boy for drug peddlers in my neighborhood. Gary had to intervene and introduced me to his love for baseball and driving.

He took me on long drives once every month for an entire year, and showed me around the countryside. It felt like a soothing balm for the wounded soul.

But my happiest moment came when I was in attendance at the stadium with Gary, and Tino Martinez’s grand slam of '98 unfolded right in front of my eyes. We all went delirious with joy in the stadium, as I found myself hugging and celebrating with random strangers. That experience changed my life and I emerged transformed as a person.

Gary also obtained a signed jersey and cap from the players during his time chauffeuring them on tours, presenting it to me as a birthday gift. It remains my most prized possession.

So when he started his own rental agency, I decided to join him as soon as I was finished with school, and have been working for him ever since.

My own childhood experiences motivated me to be the best dad I could be to my son. Since his mother was no longer with us, I always went the extra mile to ensure he had a supportive and loving environment.

I also tried to inculcate in Luke my love for driving and baseball, but the kid gravitated towards soccer. Fortunately, we still do share a common love for cars, and he always looks forward to long drives on weekends.

My mind got diverted again when I heard my phone beep, Gary had just sent me the details about the next client.

I dropped Luke at home and went to the office garage to take Roy out for a spin.

 A couple of hours later, I arrived at the address I had received on my phone. Situated a little bit on the outskirts of the city, I got there half an hour ahead of time.

I parked my car near a diner and noticed a large man standing by the entrance.

Dressed in a perfectly tailored pinstripe suit, he appeared to be in his early fifties, around 6’4" in height, with broad shoulders and a heavy set build. His salt-and-pepper hair was slicked back, and his beard was neatly trimmed. He casually smoked a cigar while holding a walking stick in his other hand, adorned with a prominent goat-shaped carving at the top.

"Mr. Thomas Devlin?" I inquired as I stepped out of the car. He nodded, extending his hand while clenching the cigar in his mouth.

"And you must be Matt?" he declared, with a booming baritone voice. I could see a couple of gold teeth glint in the dark as he flashed a warm smile.

"Yes Sir. I'm Matt Prichard, your chauffeur for the evening. I hope I haven't kept you waiting?" I inquired, feeling a tinge of embarrassment, despite being ahead of schedule.

“No young man. I usually like to stretch my legs and enjoy a cigar after a fine meal’” he said pointing to the diner behind him. Mr. Devlin looked a peculiar sight in this neighborhood, especially with the diner in the backdrop. 

Everything about him screamed money, so it did make me wonder why someone of his affluence would choose to visit this place, at this hour. But I could also sense an undeniable toughness in him, the kind of man who probably started from the bottom and had to work his way up the ladder.

A few minutes later, Mr. Devlin suggested we hit the road, and I promptly opened the car door, allowing him to ease into the backseat.

When I took my position behind the wheel, he handed me a gold card, which was the size of a normal government ID but much thicker.

It had a Trident symbol embossed on both ends. As I looked at it confused, he told me to simply place it on the GPS screen. I did as I was told, and the navigation system immediately sprang to life, displaying a new set of coordinates.

Mr Devlin realized my lingering confusion as I continued to stare at the card that was stuck to the screen.

“Probably a hidden chip embedded in that thing,” he joked from the backseat, his teeth glinting as I looked in the rear view mirror.

I quickly nodded in acknowledgment and began driving.

As we navigated through the city, Mr. Devlin shared that he was based out of Chicago and was currently in the city for a new business venture. He was not much of a conversationalist but instead showed more interest in my life, inquiring about my job and family.

It struck me as somewhat unusual for a businessman of his stature to delve into a chauffeur's experiences. He particularly relished the humorous stories I recounted revolving Luke, often breaking into a smile.

While chauffeurs typically have anecdotes ready on hand for bored clients, Mr. Devlin appeared genuinely intrigued by my life, almost as if, he was using it as an opportunity to evaluate me.

The navigation system then finally beeped to signal the arrival of the location, and a newly opened grand hotel loomed just a few feet away.

“Sir your card,” I said, as I retrieved the gold card from the screen and turned around in my seat to hand it to him.

Mr. Devlin said, “Keep it, Matt; it's your tip for the evening.”

“Don’t worry, it's genuine,” he chuckled as he noticed me glancing at the gold card a little longer than necessary. “And consider it a ticket, not a card,” he clarified.

Mr. Devlin then fell silent for a moment, remaining seated in contemplation as he gazed in my direction before resuming to speak again.

“Matt, I have a proposition for you? Would you be interested in hearing me out?” he suddenly asked me.

“Sure Mr Devlin, what do you have in mind?” I responded.

“I am looking for a driver I can rely on. Your name came recommended from a former client of yours whose judgment I trust. I was told that you are good at your job, professional, always on time, know your way around the city, and that you are discreet about the clients you chauffeur. Would you accept that as an accurate assessment of yourself?” he asked.

“Yes Sir. That would be correct” I replied back.

“Good. So here is what I have in mind. I need you to chauffeur my clients for the next 30 days. The details of the pick-up will be texted to your phone every day at 7:00 PM sharp. All you have to do is pick them up and drop them at the coordinates provided to you. That is all. Nothing more. Similar to how it happened between us today. A gold ticket will be given to you at the start of each drop, and that would be your payment for services rendered."

“I hope I have been clear thus far?” he stopped midway to ask me. I simply nodded back.

“Excellent. Now, I have 3 conditions you need to religiously adhere to. One, if you agree to take on this job, you cannot walk out midway. You need to see it through.”

“Two, under no circumstances are you to participate or involve yourself in whatever activity the passengers may be engaged in. Your job is to solely chauffeur them, and once you have dropped them at the designated location, you are to return back. There is no need for you to wait to pick them up again. “

“Three, you have to be discreet about this job, which means nobody else can know about it. That would include your boss or any other colleagues in your agency.”

“These are the only three rules you need to follow. Furthermore, payment to your company has already been settled in full for the proposed deal's duration, covering fuel costs and exclusively booking your services as a driver. So, you do not have to worry about other commitments either. I need you to concentrate solely on the job at hand. Are we clear?” he asked, pausing again to await my response.

I nodded in understanding, although I was beginning to get wary about what was on offer. The more the man spoke, the more I began to wonder if I would be getting into some kind of trouble.

“Sir, I need to ask. Does this job involve any dealings with the grey areas of the law?” I inquired delicately. 

My Devlin paused for a moment before speaking. “Maybe, maybe not. But I can assure you this. You will not get into any kind of legal trouble. I trust you have been a chauffeur long enough to know when to look the other way. Treat this job like any other, and you'll be just fine," he said in a matter of fact manner.

I still felt a sense of unease over the entire thing and started slowly shaking my head when Mr Devlin said, “Look, Matt, there's no need to rush your decision. If your answer is no, just keep it to yourself for now and you can simply text me your decision tomorrow. My suggestion to you is to take the night to mull things over. It's good easy money you can make in a month. You can probably use it to buy something nice for your kid.  However, there is no pressure from my side. Your employer will not receive bad feedback from me, if you choose to reject this offer. So, I’ll leave it entirely up to you.” he added, reassuringly.

I nodded back at him smiling, grateful that he was open and direct with me.

“Alright then. I guess it’s time to get back on my feet” he said, as he prepared to exit from the car. I quickly got out of the vehicle to open the door for him.

Mr Devlin shook hands with me and started his walk to the hotel. I saw him slowly climb up those stairs and enter through the doors of the newly built Trident Regency hotel.

The following day, just like I was told, I received a text on my phone at 7:00 PM sharp. It gave the location of the pick-up, and also reminded me to be on time.

I sat down and looked at the gold ticket that was lying on my bedside table. Picking it up, I examined it closely, feeling its weight in my hand as I patted it on my palm. It’s certainly worth a considerable chunk of money, especially if I was to come in possession of another 30 of them.

Plus, the elegantly embossed ruby encrusted trident on both sides of the card was only going to add to its value.

On one hand, I had a bad feeling about this, knowing full well the client from last night could be involved in a questionable line of work. But I also saw this as an opportunity to make some quick money.

It was only a month-long gig, requiring a few hours of driving each day.  I could easily be making 2-3 times my annual salary within that time frame. Maybe even more, once I get to know exactly how much these cards are worth.

‘I mean how bad could it really get?’, I asked myself, when I really thought about it. 

I might probably be required to drive people to an illegal gambling joint, or take a VIP client to visit his favorite hooker in the middle of the night. Nobody is going to hire a premium car service to indulge in petty crime, I reasoned.

My eyes then shifted toward my son Luke, who was immersed in his studies. He was busy tackling a new math problem, and that made me break into a smile. He was probably the only kid in the world who liked the idea of homework. Give him a few books that pique his interest and he needs to be constantly reminded to eat.

‘Maybe I could sell the tickets and deposit the proceeds in a bank. Leave it untouched for a few years, letting it slowly collect interest over time. And when Luke gets older, the money could come in handy to pay for college,’ I thought

The more I contemplated, the more I wanted to take on this job. So I replied back saying that I would be there. I got ready and dressed, and was out the door in twenty minutes.

Before leaving, I reached out to my regular babysitter, Jennifer, who lives with her family on the same floor in the apartment just next to ours. She is very fond of Luke and agrees to keep an eye on him whenever I am away for work

I got into my car and instructed little Roy to be on his best behaviour for the night. Starting the car, I rolled out of my apartment building toward my pick-up point.

Upon reaching the venue, my attention was immediately drawn to a man dressed in a clown outfit with a duffle bag slung across his shoulder. When our eyes met, I realized that he was my fare for the night, the designated passenger I was meant to pick up.

The clown opened the door and sat in the back seat. He reached into his jacket and handed me his ticket. I could see his knuckles were bruised, giving me the impression he was involved in some kind of brawl recently.

‘Great start Matt!!’, I thought to myself.

I received the ticket from him and placed it on the GPS screen and it immediately started relaying a new set of coordinates. The odd thing with this arrangement is that it doesn’t reveal the destination beforehand.

Instead all you get are directions for the next 50 meters ahead of you. The blue line on the screen updates only as much as the movement your car makes while driving.

I thought the whole thing was a little bizarre, but the ticket was doing its magic, dangling itself like a carrot in front of me every time I tried to wrestle with reason.

 I quickly glanced at the rear view mirror to take a look at my passenger.

He looked tired and worn out, and was resting his head on the headrest, trying to grab a quick shut eye.  Despite the heavy makeup, his face bore visible wounds.

Even by clown standards, I thought his outfit was unusual and odd. Instead of the rainbow coloured wig, he was wearing a wavy white one, reminiscent of those Barristers in British courts. There was also a white neck band jutting out of his outfit that people usually associate with lawyers.

‘What is this guy upto?’ I quietly asked myself, as the clown simply rested in the back seat of the car, whistling softly while tapping his finger rhythmically on his duffle bag, like he was getting ready to put on a show.

A couple of minutes later, the system beeped abruptly to signal the arrival of a certain Roza pharmacy, which was located on the opposite side of the road.

The clown thanked me for the ride and stepped out of the car. He stretched himself for a second and then opened his duffle bag to remove a bugle. He dug his right hand into his pocket to retrieve a knuckle buster and put it on.

The oncoming traffic suddenly came to a standstill, to make way for the clown as he crossed the road playing his bugle and twirling his arm raised in the air. The commuters cursed him as they passed by, but he remained unfazed and continued moving forward.

The clown then rolled his hand into a fist, and pointed it at the guy working behind the counter in the pharmacy, to signal him of his imminent arrival.

The employee just stared back from the storefront window, his face had gone white and he immediately bent down to probably reach for a gun, but the clown was prepared and suddenly took off into a sprint.

He threw away the bugle and rushed into the pharmacy, catching the customers inside by surprise. The employee by this time had retrieved a shotgun but only just barely, as the clown caught him by the collar of his shirt and banged his head against the counter. He then dragged the hapless employee to his side of the shop and yanked the shotgun away from his grasp.

The clown aimed the shotgun in the air and fired it once, suggesting to the customers that they would be wise to flee.

He then aimed the weapon directly at the employee’s face as he waited for the people to scram.

I could see him speaking something animatedly to the employee but I was too far away to pick up any of it. Once the people had cleared out, he emptied the shotgun and threw it behind the counter.

The clown then picked the employee off the ground and started raining punches on the poor guy. I watched in both horror and amazement as he caught hold of the guy’s shirt and started pushing him forcefully.

They both rammed themselves into the storefront window, shattering it and spilling onto the pavement.

The clown swiftly rose to his feet and began pummelling the employee again who lay sprawled on the sidewalk.

Each time he raised his knuckle-buster-fitted hand in the air, he looked skyward, as if inquiring with the Gods above, ' ‘Are you happy? Is this enough?’ before delivering another crushing blow.

And he kept repeating it again and again.

 The cars on the road just sped past him, momentarily blocking my view of the event from unfolding, reminiscent of a flickering tubelight illuminating a dark space in momentary bursts.

And when the clown’s fist did make contact, it was like a streak of lightning determinedly hitting its intended target. I watched the whole thing completely transfixed, unable to move mind or muscle.

I jolted back to my senses only when a large vehicle suddenly parked itself in front of the pharmacy, completely blocking my view. Up until then, it felt as if I had been in a trance. I immediately started my car and sped off.

As I continued driving, my mind struggled to even recollect if the vehicle on scene was a patrol car or an ambulance or simply, another taxi.

The surreal nature of the encounter left me unsettled, questioning the motives and actions of the unpredictable clown.

Despite driving in circles for the next twenty minutes, I eventually found myself back at the exact spot where I had left Mr. Devlin the previous night.

I brought the car to a stop but kept the engine running while I continued to stare at the newly built Trident Regency hotel, located a mere 20 metres away from me.

‘Maybe I should head up those stairs and meet Mr Devlin, and communicate to him in person that I am not interested in this job anymore. Or I could just ask my boss Gary to cancel the order. He would definitely understand if I said the gig was risky and wouldn’t probe me for details.’

Every instinct in me warned that I should pack my bags and lay low for a while. On any given day, I would have done just that. But I felt something awaken in me when I saw that clown in the pharmacy, and I couldn’t understand what it was.

I hadn’t felt this alive in years and I struggled to shake it off.

At the same time, I could also sense an overwhelming cacophony of contradictory voices in my head simultaneously coming to life - each fighting the other to gain the upper hand on who gets to dictate my future course of action.

 

*‘So what are you waiting for Matt? You saw the clown at work, how he went to town and made the world his own circus. How much more of a warning do you need?’*

 *‘But you have a deal to honor here ,Matt, and you have a duty to see it through. You didn’t hurt anybody. You did nothing wrong here. The clown would have gone through with his plan anyway, even if you hadn’t taken up this job.’*

*‘Oh, so this is how we're going to rationalize the events of this evening, are we? Would you consider taking a job knowing you'd be driving for smugglers dealing in stolen body parts? Or offering your services to a group that kidnaps kids as they return home from school?*

 *‘These are extreme examples Matt, and are being dished out to screw with your head. Don’t overthink this. The world isn’t a fair place. We all know that. Sometimes we got to make the best use of the opportunities that come our way. Remember, you have a kid you need to take care of. You have seen how smart Luke is. He could be a doctor  or an engineer someday. How else are you going to arrange the money for his college tuition? You swore to yourself the day you held Luke in your arms for the first time, you would be present in his life and not abandon him, like your father did to you.’*

*‘Wooow. This is low even for you ,Matt, to drag your father and kid in a mess of your own making. Did you ever stop to consider that you can land in prison over this? If day 1 could be this dramatic, what do you think will follow in the days to come? Are you planning on becoming the best father of the year from behind bars, while your kid grows up in foster care? Do you think the little bookworm can survive the bullying from kids twice his size? Why don’t you just admit it Matt, that you liked what you saw back there, and that somewhere deep within you, there is a flaw in your moral character…’*

I shut down the car and closed my eyes, resting my forehead on the steering wheel, trying to desperately filter out all the noise. I took deep long breaths as I tried to steady my mind. A little while later, I leaned back in my seat, and attempted to think things through again from scratch.

‘One night. Just one more night,’ I decided finally. ‘And if things don’t change for the better, we are calling it quits no matter what’, I said to myself a few minutes later.

I started the car again and raced home to get ready for the next day.

When the clock struck 7 the next day, I was already sitting in my car and started the vehicle immediately to get to the location.

While approaching the pick-up point, I spotted a solitary, tall figure near a bus stand in the distance.  Upon getting closer, I discovered that my passenger for the night was none other than Batman.

As I stopped my car and looked across the window, I saw the man’s cape fluttering gracefully in the wind, casting a dramatic silhouette against the backdrop of the city’s skyline. Batman then opened the door and sat in the backseat of my car.

“Gotham city?” I asked, looking into the rear view mirror offering half a smile.

I knew my feeble attempt at humor was not going to cut it with him, but I needed to assess the new customer, if I was to somehow try and prevent a repeat of last night.

“Somebody is getting real comfortable,” Batman growled back with a scowl, while handing me the golden ticket he held in his hand.

He then leaned back and looked at the road ahead in silence.

I placed the card on the navigation system and started driving, deciding to remain quiet for the remainder of the journey.

As the minutes passed, the man masquerading as Batman slowly began to exude a certain kind of warmth, almost reluctant to admit he was having a decent time.

A wry smile even appeared on his face as he relaxed to the rhythm of New York’s evening traffic, silently observing people go about their daily lives.

From friends laughing at each other’s jokes in the side-lines to people enjoying a quiet meal at a bistro to commuters getting involved in heated disputes with one another to lovers simply sitting on a bench holding hands - he soaked it all in, with a quiet sense of detachment.

I inwardly heaved a huge sigh of relief.

Hopefully, Batman won’t just suddenly barge out of the car, mid traffic, chasing after gangsters in a deserted alley. I also turned on the radio to play some music to further soothe the atmosphere.

And in a matter of minutes, both Batman and I were bobbing our heads, slowly jiving to the beat of a soaring jazz number. Though I had no idea about who the artist was, I could somehow feel the lingering edge from last night slowly wearing off, when suddenly, I was distracted by a beep from my navigation system.

I figured we had finally reached our destination and I gently slowed down the car to a halt.

But my heart began to race again, when I realized I had stopped the vehicle just outside a police station.

Before I could utter another word, Batman was already out the door.

“Keep the engine running,” he said, without looking back as he crossed the road to get to the police station.

I saw two police officers standing outside the precinct, drinking coffee and looking engrossed in conversation.

Their attention quickly turned towards the caped crusader, as he gently bowed his head while walking past them, offering also a quick two finger salute that caused both officers to break into a grin.

One of the policemen then looked in my direction, winking and smiling at me, as if signalling to mention the arrival of this week’s ‘weirdo’ amongst our midst.

‘SHIT…….SHIT ……..SHIT’ I cursed to myself, kicking my feet around in the car while pretending to smile back at the officer.

A policeman had spotted me, and the last thing I needed right now was to spend a night in a jail cell.

And I can say with certainty that this version of Batman is not looking to pay a courtesy visit to his ‘old pal’ Gordon.

I kept the engine running, with my hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, wondering if I should just quietly drive away. But my body had already frozen and a part of me actually wanted to wait and see what was going to happen, and that scared me even the more.

I scanned the surrounding buildings looking for cameras and to my dismay, I found them everywhere. It felt like they had been specifically installed just to keep an eye on me.

Then when I looked across the road to steal a glance at the precinct again, I found the same officer staring at me while his buddy was busy answering a phone call.

He had a curious look on his face, as if he was trying to connect the dots to a possible problem.

I suddenly felt a pit form in my stomach, when I heard loud noises emanate from the police building behind him. The screams of people echoed through the air, as unknown objects crashed and shattered to the floor.

The officer briefly glanced back before fixing his gaze on my panic-stricken face. Finally connecting the dots, he pointed his hand at me, looked me in the eye, and sternly yelled, “STAY!”

Soon after, gunshots also echoed from within the precinct. Both officers swiftly drew their weapons and charged toward the police building, guns pointed forward.

And everything began to unfold in slow motion from that very moment before my own eyes.

As they reached for the door, a colossal ball of fire erupted from the building, obliterating everything in its path. The explosion sent shockwaves, tearing the two mens' bodies to shreds.

One officer's head soared 20 metres in the air, landing on the bonnet of my car before bouncing off to hit the lamppost adjacent to me, and finally settling in the dead space between my car and the vehicle in front.

It belonged to the policeman who had smiled at me only a minute earlier and now his haunting lifeless gaze sent me into a panicked frenzy.  I quickly put the gear in reverse, only to hit the car parked behind me, setting off its siren.

My senses suddenly snapped back to real time. It was as if the clock had been sped up, and I finally started to experience the full chaotic atmosphere around me. The branches of the trees around the precinct had caught fire, the sirens of multiple cars blared in unison while the people nearby were scared shitless and ducking helplessly for cover.

I quickly tried to compose myself before turning on the ignition again and tried to swerve to the right as much as possible, to avoid the car from running over the severed head in front. But I wound up chipping it from the side causing the head to roll over inwards and catch the full impact of my rear wheel. Wincing in disgust, I struggled to steady my trembling hands while gripping the steering wheel.

“FUCK!!” I yelled out loud, once I had cleared a couple of blocks and when the nerves began to finally settle.

 I could already see visions of the police breaking into my home and cuffing my hands in front of my kid.

‘What is going to happen to my son? He’s got no one else in this world’, I thought to myself, my mind fraught with worry. 

I drove around the city aimlessly for the next 20 minutes, contemplating the increasing likelihood of my own incarceration.

Going to the police on my own accord made no sense, they wouldn’t believe my story anyway. I’d probably be tagged as an accomplice to the crime and, honestly, that wouldn’t surprise me. The cops can be ruthless when their own safety is under threat.

Then there was Mr Devilin himself and that wretched deal of his that I also needed to sit and worry about. Surely, I am not going to go through with the rest of it now, and he is not going to be pleased over it either.

So I thought it would best to probably lay low for a while until this all blew over.  I ditched my cell and stopped at a convenience store along the way to get a new burner phone.

When I reached my apartment at last, I immediately stuffed some clothes in a bag. Gently, I woke Luke up and helped him get dressed quickly. Together, we sat in the car and headed for Philly, where I planned to crash at a friend’s place for a couple of days before considering my next move. Eric Gunther, an old high school buddy, had moved to Philadelphia for work a few years back, so reaching out to him seemed like a good idea.

By the time I reached Eric’s home, it was already 4 in the morning. He was surprised to see me at his doorstep, with Luke sound asleep and resting on my shoulder, and immediately knew I was in some kind of trouble. He ushered me in and cleared the spare room for the two of us.

Eric and I agreed to get some rest first, and talk things over in the morning.

After gently laying Luke down on the bed without waking him, I settled into a rocking chair nearby.  As I leaned back, the exhaustion washed over me, and I immediately drifted to sleep.

When I woke up, it took me a moment to realize I was still at Eric’s place. I checked my watch, it was already 8:00 AM. I then glanced at the bed next to me, and realized Luke was already up.

‘He’s probably hungry or Eric’s already made something for him.’ I thought.  I could anyway hear the TV playing from living room

I slowly got up from the chair and walked toward the hall still groggy from last night. My legs suddenly buckled, and I hit the floor hard.

Eric’s severed head lay skewered on a pitch fork erected in the middle of the living room. I tried to get up, but my legs buckled again.

I crawled all the way to his room like a dog, and tried to open the door with my outstretched hand.

I had to grab onto the nearby wall to pull myself up and stand straight. That's when I saw my old friend's headless body lying on the bed. I puked my guts out right there.

 As I lay crouched on my knees, with my head still spinning, I suddenly remembered Luke. He was nowhere in sight.

I got up and searched every nook and cranny of the apartment. The bathrooms, the kitchen, the cupboards, under the bed, the attic, everywhere. He was nowhere to be found, and he is not the sort of kid to run off on his own.

I then went and started to check the other apartments in the building including the terrace and still found no trace of him. Finally I remembered the basement where I had parked the car and I immediately rushed to look for him there.

As I reached the entrance to the basement, I saw droplets of blood in the parking area and it led all the way to the trunk of my car.

My heart thudded in my chest as I walked slowly, my legs heavy like lead, refusing to move as I inched forward, terrified of what I would find.

When I finally reached the car, with trembling hands I opened the trunk and slowly peered in.

There, dead center, lay my burner phone, the same one I had purchased the previous night.

 As soon as I picked it up, it vibrated in my hand, revealing a new set of coordinates — coordinates pointing…. to my own home address.
