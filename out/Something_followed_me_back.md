I just need to put this story out there in a place where people won't just dismiss it as the imagination of a traumatized child.

Forgive me if the story is off, my memory is fuzzy as its been over 10 years since this happened but I'll do my best to be accurate.

I moved into the new house with my two siblings, my mother, and my step dad. It was the second or third house we had moved to during our stay on the military bases but this house felt... off. It had this way of making you feel weak and alone, like this house was a predator and you were its prey, well at least for me it was like that. No one else noticed the heavy feeling that something was very wrong, if they did it was well hidden.
No one was ever left alone at the house. Why couldn't we? No one ever answered me.

My life changed one night, made me understand why we followed the rule of not being alone.
It started when I heard tapping at my window
"It is obviously a tree branch" I told myself but it didn't take long before I curled up under my blankets in terror, holding my breath. Something was very wrong but I couldn't understand what it was. Then it hit me, "There were no trees near the house" and my room is on the second floor. No one should be out there.
After that realization hit me I felt a whole new wave of fear wash over me, a fear that I've never felt before or since. Every cell in my body was screaming at me to run but I knew better, if that thing knew I was awake something bad was going to happen. The tapping continued and I made the mistake of peaking out of my blanket at the window, what greeted me was a long shadowy hand. An arm and palm to big, the fingers thin and stretched out like a trees branches. I'm still not sure how I didn't scream.
I needed to look away. I don't know why but I had to look away. So I turned my head to face the doorway and wanted to cry.

Every night it got worse, little by little. It started with light tapping from the hand, then my closest doors would open slightly on their own, a monster under the bed, a figure i didn't know in the hall, something calling my name, anything could happen and I can't list it all.

Thankfully we moved out of that house and I've never gone back... but I think something came back with me.
Everyday I feel like im being watched by something, especially at night. I never see anything but I know somethings there and it isn't going to leave anytime soon.
I don't know what it is, it hasn't hurt me or anyone around me well I don't think so. It never shows itself.

Curtains help a little bit and asking it to not watch me when I shower also works but it comes back everytime. Someone told me it could be a kind of guardian since when I was in Georgia I was taken advantage of by my step "father", I was about 7, and this thing could be here to help protect me now.
If it is a guardian than I don't want to ask it to leave but im not sure if I should keep it around. It follows me and watches me very intently at night and when I'm talking to adult guys.

What should I do? How do I figure out what it is? I just want answers and no one i talk to has them so I'm turning to you guys in the hopes that someone can answer me.
