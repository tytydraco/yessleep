I found the arm early in the morning, lying on the concrete walkway like it was meant to be found.

It took a moment for my brain to comprehend what it was seeing. Pale skin against gray concrete. Fingers curled slightly inward, nails painted with chipped lavender. The wrist ended in a ragged break, muscle and bone showing where it had been torn free.

My scream was like an out of body experience, like someone else was screaming from inside me. I stumbled backward, tripped over my own welcome mat, and hit the door frame hard enough to knock the breath out of me. My phone skittered across the porch. I remember crawling for it on my hands and knees, gagging, my eyes refusing to look away from the arm even as my mind begged them to.

The dispatcher kept telling me to slow down, to stay focused on the sound of her voice. Police cars arrived, splashing red and blue across my neighbor’s houses. Officers blocked off the culdesac with yellow tape, and told me to sit on the curb while they searched around my house.

They asked questions for hours. Where was I last night? Did I hear anything? Did I have any visitors? Did I have enemies? Did I do drugs?

By the time they finally let me go back inside, the sun was low, and my house smelled like chemicals and rubber. All I wanted was to eat a nice dinner, and go to sleep, but my hands wouldn't stop shaking.

I stood at the kitchen counter staring at them, flexing my fingers, watching the tremors ripple through my skin. Stress had always been a trigger. My sponsor used to tell me to slow down and let the moment pass. I tried to breathe through it, but the rope was already fraying, and it finally snapped.

The next thing I remember was light through the bathroom window, and my brain pounding like it was trying to break free of my skull.

I was lying in the bathtub, naked, cold, my cheek pressed against porcelain. There was dried vomit in my hair and down my chest. My throat burned. My mouth tasted like pennies.

“What the hell,” I croaked to no one, pulling myself upright.

Early morning sunlight striped the tile, as I cleaned myself methodically. I Checked my arms and legs for bruises, cuts, burns. Old habits. There was nothing new, nothing I could see.

I crawled into bed and pulled the covers up to my chin. I closed my eyes for only a moment...

The door exploded inward. “Police! Get on the ground!”

Hands grabbed me, yanked me out of bed. My face hit the floor. A knee pressed between my shoulder blades. Cold metal snapped around my wrists.

Outside, my street looked like a movie set. Patrol cars lined the curb. Floodlights washed the houses in white. Two armored vehicles squatted at the entrance to the culdesac like guard dogs.

I kept saying I didn’t understand, that I’d already talked to them, but no one answered.

At the station they told me they’d found a head. A neighbor walking her dog that morning had found it in a bush near my front door. The head was female, and appeared to match the arm. They were still missing the rest of the body.

They asked me about my week over and over: what I ate, when I slept, how late I stayed at work, whether I’d gone anywhere unusual. It was especially embarrassing going through the breakup I didn’t want to talk about... that weirdo Sebastian who tried to make me wear a cat suit and do furry shit with him.

Eighteen hours of the same damn questions. They wanted me to confess, but I had nothing to confess to.

Eventually the pressure eased. They started exchanging looks instead of staring at me. They took the cuffs off and escorted me, once again, into the back of a patrol car.

They dropped me off back at home, and didn't try to hide the unmarked cop car idling across the street.

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling. There was no way I was going to get any sleep tonight.

I didn't have to worry about that, because someone knocked on my front door with authority.

I flinched, heart slamming into my ribs. Through the window I saw a uniformed officer on my porch. He looked pale, sweaty, and terrified.

I opened the door. “You have to come with me right now! It’s not—”

A clawed arm, fur matted dark, hooked under his chin and ripped backward. There was a sound like tearing fabric. The officer collapsed in a heap at my feet.

The catsuit was filthy, fur clotted with blood and dirt. The head was oversized, cartoonish, its mouth fixed in a permanent grin. The eyes were wide plastic circles that reflected my face back at me.

He dropped to all fours.

Slowly, he rubbed the side of his head against my leg. The fabric rasped against my skin. He purred and looked up at me expectantly, waiting for praise.
