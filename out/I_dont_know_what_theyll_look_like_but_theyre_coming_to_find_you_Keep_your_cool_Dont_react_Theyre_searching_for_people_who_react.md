*“What am I even looking at here…”* I whispered, gaze fixed on the truck that’d just pulled up beside me. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted - not a single other vehicle in sight. The front of the truck wasn’t what left me slack-jawed - it what was trailing *behind* the engine.

My eyes traced the outline of a giant rectangular container made of transparent glass. It was like a shark tank, except it had a red curtain draped against the inside of the wall that was facing me. Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play.

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. The stop light’s hazy red glow reflected off my windshield. My foot hovered over the gas, and I nearly ran the light when something in my peripheral vision caused me to freeze.

They had pulled back the curtain.

My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot acid leapt up the back of my throat. Judging by what was inside, that box was no shark tank.

A shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds, displaying the table from every conceivable angle. A flock of nurses, sporting sterile gowns and powdered gloves.

It only got worse once I saw the surgeon.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, his smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked and pale. His head was deadweight, rolling across his chest as the wheelchair creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch. Despite his rag-doll body, I knew he was awake. Even though I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life behind his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

The truck creaked forwards. I didn’t even noticed that the light had turned green. There was no one behind me, so I put my car in park and watched them drive away. Before long, they had disappeared into the night.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured the respite.

*By now, they’re likely operating on him. He can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

*Exactly like it was for me.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked at the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had undergone a month prior. Undeniably, he looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent goopy discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of a monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop. As he crumpled it up, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold…it’s a huge glass box. There was a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that's beside the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot.

Now, both of his eyes were leaking.

I ripped another piece off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but James’s expression was vacant. The lights were on, but nobody seemed to be home. I wondered if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“Thanks. So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw it again. That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for a bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise from behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my scrub pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth filled with perfect white teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town. Didn’t know much about him, though. I wasn’t aware of *why* he was homeless, nor was I clued in to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and unkempt, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He was a man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on the bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful about his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The surgeon didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away on his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

*“Oh my God…”* I whimpered.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny wrapped his arm around my shoulders, slowed me down, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make a sound through thick layers of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he said had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”*

I realize now that Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. When I tried to turn my head back to the truck, he forcefully pushed my cheek with the fingers of the arm he had around my shoulder so I’d be facing him. 

I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind, but the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting. I walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning it, so I did as well.

I caught a glimpse of the truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the surgeon’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the group. Slowly, it rolled past the alleyway. As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick wall of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate, and my voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”* I shouted. 

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. That time, I didn’t follow his lead. Instead, I uncrumpled the bill. In his erratic handwriting, Danny conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“If they can tell you’re uninhabited, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave.”*

*“You need to leave tonight.”*

\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied, but the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe. I heeded his advice. Some of his advice, at least. I pretended I couldn’t see them.

That said, it was nearly impossible to just pretend they weren’t there once they began driving in circles around my neighborhood. Every night, I could faintly hear them. The whirring of drills and the truck’s grumbling engine outside my bedroom window. 

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. They weren’t *completely* confident that I could see them. They weren’t *completely* confident that I couldn’t see them, either. Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t. 

I came pretty close.

\- - - - -

It wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted: catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

To that end, have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one incident for every fifteen thousand operations or so. For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under. For most, it’s painless.

Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. They induce complete and utter muscular shutdown without affecting the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell. That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of appendectomy, and I felt every single thing.

Sure, they saved my life. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

When I stopped by the coffee shop this afternoon, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, but then I saw who was on the operating table today. It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to elicit a reaction from me finally.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me scream. 

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work.

I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

Turns out he wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

\- - - - - 

I threw open the front door of our apartment.

It was pitch black inside. All the lights were off. The window blinds must have been pulled down as well.

My hand slinked across the wall, searching for the light switch.

I flicked it on, and there he was: propped up on the couch, head resting limply on his shoulder. There were trails of mucus across his cheeks. I followed them up to where his eyes *should* have been.

But they were gone, and there was no blood anywhere.

I heard a deep gurgling sound. I assumed it was coming from James, but his lips weren’t moving. Then, something crept over the top of the couch. Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved, but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical.

If you viewed the tail head-on, it bore an uncanny resemblance to an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Initially, it crawled back *into* James. The bulbous tail squished and contorted within the socket. When it settled, the facade truly was convincing. It looked like his eye.

Then, James blinked.

I turned and sprinted down the hallway.

Left without grabbing a single thing.

\- - - - - 

Danny called them *“larvae*”. I suppose that’s a good fit. Maybe that’s why the ones inhabiting James didn’t rat me out. Maybe they need to mature before they’re capable of communicating with other members of their species. 

Whatever *that* entails.

I don’t know many people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, be weary of the horrific. Be cautious of things that appear out of place. It might not be what I experienced, but according to Danny, it’ll be designed to get your attention.

Somehow, they’ll know *exactly* what will pull your strings. I promise.

Your best bet? Don’t respond. Pretend it’s not there.

In fact, try to act like my body on the operating table. Conscious but paralyzed. No matter how terrible it is, no matter painful it feels, no matter how loudly your mind screams for you to intervene:

Just [don’t react.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
