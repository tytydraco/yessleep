The first time I saw those words, my day started off like any other.

I went to work at my monotonously, mind numbingly boring desk job, clacked on the keyboard for eight hours and had the same bland ham and cheese sandwich for lunch.

As I sat in the break room, halfway through my sandwich, I opened the dating app I’d downloaded only recently. I was a fairly good looking guy, so I’d gotten plenty of matches and been on countless dates, but none of the women were really what I was searching for.

Somewhere between shoving the last piece of my sandwich into my mouth and deciding whether or not  to delete the app, my phone pinged with a match - Guinevere Motley. Curiosity got the best of me as I clicked on the notification and read her message.

*“Whatever you do… Don’t read this.”*

That was a strange way to get my attention… Usually they sent a pick up line or something funny.

Tapping on her picture, I noticed that there was only one, but geez was she stunning. Long, brunette curls cascaded over her shoulders and toppled down her back, and thick, dark lashes adorned seafoam green irises. My eyes trailed down the picture as I took in mile long legs and tasteful curves. The little white sundress she was wearing looked like it was made just for her. Heck, this woman was a bombshell.

When I went back to the message though, I realized that it had been deleted. Looking up at the clock, I noticed that I had about 5 minutes till my lunch break was over. With one more glance at her profile, I shrugged and deleted the app. She was probably a bot or a scammer anyway.

That night, I did the usual. Ran to the gym and worked out for about an hour and a half, picked up some tacos from my favorite food truck and sat down to watch an episode of Black Mirror. Everything was normal.

That was until about a couple of months later. By that time, I’d forgotten all about Guinevere’s cryptic message. Let me start off by saying that my morning did play out as it normally would have. I slept in until  10 AM, and then I spent the next hour out in the front yard mowing the lawn.

It was a particularly hot day, my plain white t-shirt soaked through with sweat. Tugging it off, I set it on the front porch before edging the lawn. By the time I got done, my hair was drenched and my shoulders were burned red. When everything was put back in my shed though, I couldn’t help but feel a bit accomplished. Besides Mr. Kelman’s house next door, I had one of the nicest yards on the block.

I noticed  the door of my mailbox hanging open, and I trudged over there to check the mail before shutting it closed. On the way up my driveway, I flicked through the envelopes with uninterested fingers. Water bill, phone bill, bank statement, junk mail, advertisement, Arby’s coupons and then… I paused.

My fingers quickly came to standstill when they landed on a plain, black envelope. Instantly, my interest was piqued. Turning it over, I saw that it was sealed with crimson colored wax. Now I was really invested. Who even sends letters like this anymore?

I slid my thumb under the seal, ripped open the envelope without a second thought, and tugged out the note inside. Thick, dark ink was scrawled across it and I took no time in reading it.

*Let me guess…*

*Despite my warning, you’ve decided to read this. I told you not to, but now it’s too late. By the time you’ve made it to this point, there’s little chance of turning back. The second your eyes landed on these words, you just couldn’t help yourself. I guess I shouldn’t blame you. I couldn’t stop myself either. The curiosity was simply too much to handle. So, let me at least tell you what you’re in for. I’m going to warn you right now… It’s not going to be pleasant, but you did this to yourself. Remember that.*

Pausing for a moment, confusion bubbled from within me at the words. What warning? Flipping the paper over, I didn’t see any writing on the other side. That was until I glanced at the back of the envelope. I could have sworn that this writing wasn’t here before? Surely I would have noticed it.

In huge, red letters the words, ***“Whatever you do… Don’t read this,”*** stared back at me. What kind of sick joke was this? With a quick glance around my neighborhood, I wondered if anyone had even seen who delivered the letter.

My interest only grew when I realized that there was no return address. Heck, my name or address wasn’t written on the envelope either. Perhaps this was meant for someone else? Surely, if it was for me, they would have addressed it to me. Brushing it off, I ripped it to shreds and tossed it in the garbage.

Right about that time, I noticed Ms. Brookfield on her front porch looking over. A smile stretched across her face as she raised her hand to wave at me. Offering a wave of my own, I suddenly got an idea. She was a nosy old bat, and she always seemed to sit out on her porch on mowing days, but in this instance, it might prove to be helpful. Maybe she had seen who delivered the strange letter.

Sauntering across the street, I walked up the steps to her front porch and offered her a smile.

“Hey Ms. Brookfield, how are you doing?”

A shiver raced over me as I watched her pale, blue eyes slide up and down my shirtless chest before speaking, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.

“A lot better since you got here.” A vulgar little chuckle escaped her brightly painted lips as she finally met my eyes. “I might be past my prime but, I’ve got the most beautiful little granddaughter that might -”

“Ms. Brookfield,” I started, cutting her off. “I apologize for interrupting, but the reason I really came over here is because I received a strange letter in my mailbox.”

One silver brow raised as she waited for me to continue.

“I guess I was wondering if you had seen anyone deliver it?”

“You mean the mailman?” she fired back, sarcasm melting into her words as she fanned herself.

“No, not the mailman.” I laughed a little awkwardly before saying, “I think this letter was hand delivered.”

With a shake of her head, she stood and walked over to her front door. Pulling open the screen door, she threw me one more glance.

“I see almost everything that goes on in this neighborhood, and I can assure you that the only person I noticed stopping at your mailbox was the mailman.”

“Okay,” I started. “Thank you, I-”

Slamming her screen door shut, she left before I could even finish my sentence. I guess since the “show” was over, she didn’t want anything else to do with me.

I shuffled a bit in place then shoved my hands into my pockets before scampering across the street and back onto my property. Nasty old woman wasn’t helpful at all. With a quiet scoff, I threw open my own front door and strolled inside, making a mental note to keep my shirt on the next time I mowed my yard.

Sunday was uneventful, and the strange letter was honestly the last thing on my mind. I had a spreadsheet I needed to get done for work, and I had to present it at 8 AM the next morning. My day flew by almost as fast as my fingers flew across my keyboard. If this presentation went well, I was sure it would end in a promotion and a raise.

Monday morning I woke up and was running a bit late. Luckily, I pressed and starched everything the night prior. Rolling up the sleeves of my crisp, white button down, I quickly threw on a tie, stepped into a pair of black slacks and slid into some shiny black loafers. With a glance in the mirror, I carded a hand through my still damp hair before deciding to add a bit of gel, hoping it would stay in place long enough to survive the meeting.

Everything that could have gone wrong that morning did. Throwing my car in reverse, I peeled out of my neighborhood and onto the freeway. Two people pulled out in front of me, I had to swerve when a chair came toppling out of an overly packed pickup truck and then to top it all off, I managed to get stuck in a traffic jam that was moving at a snail’s pace. The time was ticking by, and as each minute passed, I was getting more irritated. My boss wasn’t a man who  would accept any kind of silly excuse, so in fifteen more minutes I was as good as dead.

Trying to calm myself down, I switched through the radio stations but, strangely, all of them were static filled… Except for one. My fingers froze on the knob as a strange feeling of dread washed over me, the voice coming through the radio cutting through all of the noise outside.

*“Ryan…”* The voice, a sort of breathy whine, crackled over the sound system in my car as it whispered. *“You read it, didn’t you?”*

A mixture of confusion and indescribable fear began to blossom deep within me as I stared at the screen. Looking at the radio station, my eyes widened as I saw the station number: 66.6 glared back at me. What the actual-

*“Ryan.”* Repeating my name again, the voice wavered a bit before a hissing sound filled the car. It was so ear splittingly loud that I clenched my eyes shut and attempted to block out the noise with my hands.

When I finally pulled them away from my ears, the hissing sound dropped to a low buzz and something warm dripped from my ear, pattering onto my dress pants in slow, steady drops. Running a finger over it, I quietly panicked when red stained the pad of my fingertip.

With shaky hands, I reached into my glove department for a napkin and cleaned myself up the best I could.

By the time I glanced up at the clock, traffic was still at a standstill and I half expected the time to slap me in the face when I looked over at it. Instead, it still read 7:45. Closing my eyes, I blinked a couple of times before peering at the numbers again. What the heck was this? A minute later, the traffic cleared up and I was moving again.

I twisted  the knob on the radio, trying  to change the channel to something different, the incessant sound of the buzzing noise driving me insane. But that’s when I heard it again. That voice.

*“Ryan-”*

“How do you know my name!” I shouted. I must have looked absolutely ridiculous, but I didn’t care. “HOW,” I repeated angrily.

*“Ryan, I told you not to do it. It’s too late now. You’ve read it.”*

Ice cold terror raced through my veins as I gripped the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles turned white.

*“Listen to me,”* it whispered, the voice on the radio a strange sounding warble over the fuzzy static that was beginning to rise.

*“I want you to swerve out into traffic.”*

“What? No!” I shouted, my anger simmering dangerously close to outrage.

Without so much as a second thought though, I watched in horror as my foot pressed down on the accelerator and my hands twisted the steering wheel. Within a matter of seconds, the sickening crunch of metal rang throughout my ears as I crashed into another car.

The impact knocked me out cold, and when I awoke in the hospital sometime during the night, I learned that it was because of the airbag. The concussion I gained because of that made me feel like my thoughts were swimming through a thick blanket of fog, but that soon cleared within a few days.

What didn’t clear was the guilt that hung over me like a cloud. The people in that car weren’t severely injured, but I did find out that it was a mother and a young child. Both of our cars were totaled, but despite everything, it was written off as an accident. It was determined that I’d passed out before my car swerved into the other lane… But I could have sworn I was conscious?

The voice told me to swerve, I was sure of it, and that’s what made me feel so horrible about the whole situation. I would have taken full responsibility. Guilt was a heck of a feeling and I hated every second of it. I should have spoken up. I should have taken accountability. I should have fought just a little harder to block out the voice.

When I finally made it back to work at the end of the week though, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my boss had looked over the spreadsheet that I’d emailed and decided that despite me not being able to present it like I’d intended, he was very impressed. In fact, he wanted to see me in his office at 2 that afternoon to discuss it.

Deciding to go ahead and take my lunch, I headed to the break room and pulled out my usual sandwich. For some reason, I was only able to eat about half of it though, before I started feeling kinda sick. My eyes darted around the room for a trash can before I finally ran over to the sink.

Gripping the edge of it, I wasted no time in emptying everything in my stomach into the sink. The horrible burning sensation in my throat made tears well up in my eyes as I tried to get myself under control. And that’s when I heard it. The little radio sitting on the counter flipped between about a dozen stations before it stopped on one.

*“Ryan…”* It whispered.

“No… Please, no,” I sputtered out through gritted teeth.

*“I want you to turn on the garbage disposal.”*

Sweat beaded atop my brow as I tried to fight the urge to comply. My eyes widened in horror as I watched my hand twitch and my fingers flex as I tried and failed to stop myself. Slowly, it lifted and then wavered only a moment before flicking on the garbage disposal switch.

The blades roared to life, their metallic teeth gnashing together in hopes that something might drop within its grasp. More bile began to climb up my throat as I shook my head and hoped that the voice would stop.

“I want you to put your hand inside the garbage disposal.”

A small sob broke from my lips as I watched my hand once again betray me. Slowly, it dipped towards the sink, closer and closer until…

“Oh, hey Ryan! Didn’t know you had come back yet!”

The sound of one of my coworkers successfully broke the trance, and once again, my hand was mine.

“Steph… Could you - Could you turn off the radio?” My voice was shaky and uneven as I fought the urge to vomit again.

“What do you mean?” She asked, as she grabbed something from the fridge. “It is turned off.”

A nervous laugh bubbled up from my throat as I cleaned myself up and turned to face her, my hand reaching  up to scratch the back of my neck awkwardly. “Right. Yeah, sorry,” I managed to stutter out.

A sympathetic smile tugged at her lips as she unwrapped her own lunch. “Are you okay?”

*“NO!”* I wanted to scream. *“I’m so freaking far from okay that I’m hearing voices!”* But instead, my hand came up to fidget with the sleeves of my button down before I rolled them up and said, “I guess I’m still a little out of it.” I locked eyes with her and tried to play it off. “Just a little brain fog still.”

With a mouth full of salad, she simply nodded in understanding as she chewed. Based on her expression, I’m not sure if I convinced her, but that was the last thing on my mind. Throwing up a hand, I waved to her as I strolled out of the break room and back over to my cubicle.

As I took a seat in my chair, my leg bounced anxiously. I wish that envelope hadn’t ever shown up in my mailbox. I wish whatever this was would quit happening. I wish I’d never even read any of that letter. But another much more worried part of me wishes I’d have at least read it all the way through. Maybe it might have provided an explanation about why I’m experiencing all this, and how to make it stop. There’s no way that I could constantly live my life on edge, worrying about my own body betraying me at any given moment.

A glimpse at my clock didn’t make me feel any better. The meeting with my boss was in ten minutes and whatever confidence I’d worn that morning had now melted into a thick sludge in the bottom of my stomach. With clammy hands, I pushed myself up from my chair and made my way across the room.

The second I stepped in, he smiled up at me and pointed towards one of the chairs in front of his desk.

“Take a seat, Ryan.”

Nodding, I sat down in one of the leather chairs and tried not to fidget.

“Now,” he began, his voice gruff and gravelly. “Let me pull up those spreadsheets real quick so we can go over them. I was really impressed with your work, and I think-”

The shrill scream of his office phone interrupted the conversation and he was quick to pick it up, holding one of his calloused hands up in a silent apology.

“Yes…Yes, Farah.” He paused before peering up at me. “Yes, he’s in here. Would you like me to give him the phone?”

Pulling the phone away from his ear, he offered it to me before going back to looking at his computer.

The second I held it up to my ear, all of the blood drained out of my face when I heard the voice on the other end of the line.

*“Ryan…”* It rasped. “Do you see that pen in front of you?”

My voice wavered, and my breaths were uneven as I replied. “No.” The slim, silver pen gleamed up at me from the desk, but I refused to play into this game any further.

*“You’re lying to me…”* The voice hissed.

A glance at the phone screen made me feel like I was losing my mind. The phone number read: \*666. Whatever this thing was, it impersonated Farah and it was able to contact me through a number of ways.

*“I want you to grab that pen and stab it through the palm of his hand.”*

I broke out into a cold sweat as my other hand drifted towards the pen, my boss still typing away.

“NO,” I repeated, a little more firmly this time. “There has to be a way-” I sputtered out before settling on, “what did the rest of the letter say?”

The silence on the other side of the receiver was loud as I waited for a reply, my hand halting for a moment.

*“If you want this to stop, there’s one simple thing I need you to do.”* The voice said, its tone strangely excited.

“Anything,” I begged, desperate to be free of the curse.

*“Pass it on.”*

The next couple of seconds, I listened to this thing tell me the most vile, sinister things I have ever heard in my life. I can’t even repeat it, but please know, that by the time you’ve finished reading this anyways, it’s really too late. You’re already interested. You won’t be able to help yourself. All I can say is that I warned you. Whatever you do… Don’t read this… [*Alone*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Justhegirlnextdoor)
