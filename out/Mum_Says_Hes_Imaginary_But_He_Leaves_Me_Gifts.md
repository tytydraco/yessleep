The tall man came and took away my sister again. He said he wasn’t taking me because he wasn’t my dad — why does she get one and I get nothing. I cried and mum said to be quiet, and I thought that was unfair so I ran into my room and put my face in my pillow and I cried so much that I thought I was going to be sick. Then she found me and she said sorry and that she wishes that I did have a dad still around but that he was watching over me and that one day we would all be together again. Then she looked up and I looked up at her and I could see that her eyes were wet from crying too and she scooped me up and we laughed because we both looked so silly, or at least she said I looked silly and then I told her if I did than so did she. Then she went quiet and I fell asleep on her and she must have tucked me into bed at some point because I woke up in the middle of the night and I was all wrapped up, which was nice, but the other man was in the corner of the room again with his long arms and white eyes and I don’t like it very much when he’s there while I’m trying to sleep because he just stands there in the corner staring and no one believes me when I tell them.

Mum thinks I’m lying about it, and when I tell her that I don’t lie because I know that lies are wrong, even white ones are wrong that what she says, she tells me that I just have an overactive imagination but I know I don’t have an overactive imagination because I can’t really imagine anything. This kid Henry at school he told me that if you have a good imagination you can see an apple in your mind, but I can’t really see anything, all I see is this blurry kind of object and sometimes if I really focus I can see the shiny skin and some of those holes in the skin, but Henry says he can see one and its bright red and he can spin it around, and when he takes a bite out of it he can even taste it.

Anyway, I know its not my imagination because this one time the man with the long arms came really close to my bed, and I think he had been crying too because his white eyes were shiny like glass and he was breathing hard like I do when I cry, and I told him to go away and that my mum said he was imaginary. I don’t think he liked that I said that because he made a funny noise kind of like the unhappy cats I can hear fighting out in the street sometimes. Then he reached his arm out and dropped this thing on the end of my bed before going back to the corner, I don’t really know how to describe it I guess it’s kind of like a rock, it’s always really cold and I keep it in my pocket all the time now I don’t really know why but I feel like he was actually trying to be friendly or something, not that I’d want to be friends with him he’s so weird.
