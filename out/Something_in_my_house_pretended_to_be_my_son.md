I don’t even know how to begin this story.
Maybe by saying that my third child had always been… a little strange.

He was born with a condition — no hair grew on his body. No eyebrows, no eyelashes, nothing. And his eyes… they were yellow. Almost like he had some kind of rare albino syndrome.

People would have mocked him for it — you know how folks can be when they see something unusual. So, unfortunately, we decided to keep him homeschooled. It just seemed safer that way. Kids can be cruel.
Our other two children were perfectly normal. Izzy was fourteen, the oldest. Tom was nine, the middle one. And the youngest — eight years old — was Robert. Yes… Robert, that was his name.

So we lived like any small, happy family: me, my wife Lucy, and our three children. A perfect little picture of domestic life.

At least, until that morning when Izzy started talking about strange things.


Lucy got up early and made breakfast for everyone. She was a housewife — over the past few years I’d started earning well enough as a director that there was no need for her to work anymore.
And since Robert was homeschooled, she could keep an eye on him full time.

That morning, I just got myself ready quickly and was about to take Izzy and Tom to school. The two kids were already outside by the car, waiting excitedly to leave.
I said goodbye to Lucy and patted Robert on his bald head. He didn’t even flinch — just sat there at the kitchen table, staring blankly ahead.


“Dad, that kid isn’t our brother,” Izzy announced as soon as I got into the car.


“Izzy, how can you say that?” I snapped. “Just because Robert’s a little different doesn’t mean you can talk like that.”


“But it’s true—” Izzy started, but I cut her off.


“Quiet!” I barked. “How would you feel if Robert said something like that about you?”


“Robert doesn’t say anything,” Izzy muttered under her breath.


I didn’t answer. I just shot her a sharp look in the rearview mirror.


“Dad,” Tom spoke up then, “Marshmallow’s barking again.”


That’s when I heard it too — the dog barking outside.
Marshmallow was our golden retriever, but lately, she’d been impossible to deal with, so we started keeping her outside. She’d been barking nonstop ever since. Maybe it was her age… or maybe she was just in one of her moods.


“I hear her,” I grumbled. “When we get back, Tom, we’ll check what’s bothering her this time.”


Then I started the car and drove off from the house.


I was a little relieved to drop the kids off at school quickly.
Tom waved at me, while Izzy didn’t say a single word the whole ride — probably because of our little argument that morning. She always did that when something upset her: she just stopped talking.

But I loved that little stretch of time alone in the car. Creeping through morning traffic, listening to old country songs, daydreaming that I was some kind of Western hero.
It’s not that I don’t love my job or my family — I do. It’s just… nice to drift away from reality for a bit.

There’s not much to say about my job — it’s boring. My days were always the same: meetings, reviewing contracts, small talk. By the afternoon, I couldn’t wait to get home, ask everyone how their day went, and just be a dad again.

But when I got home that day, I was greeted by an empty house. Lucy had left a note saying she’d taken the kids to practice. What bothered me, though, was that Robert wasn’t there either. He never left the house — that was one of his little oddities. He never went anywhere.


“Robert, where are you?” I called out, gently at first as I looked around.


I don’t even know what I expected. Robert didn’t speak. But part of me still hoped he’d respond somehow.
No sound came.

Then I noticed the back door was open. I walked through the kitchen and out onto the porch.
Robert was standing in the middle of the yard, staring toward the woods behind the garden.
We were lucky, really — the house we bought a few years ago sat on a large piece of land right by the forest. It was beautiful. Peaceful. Quiet.


“Robert, what are you doing out here?” I asked, walking up to him kindly.


But the sight that greeted me made me freeze.
Robert’s pale white face was smeared with mud — like he’d buried it in the ground. Beside him was a small hole, and his hands were completely covered in dirt.


“Robert!” I snapped. “What did you do? Why are you eating dirt?!”


I grabbed him and took him inside, straight to the bathroom. I washed his bald little head, his hands, and scrubbed his toothless mouth clean.
Robert had never grown any teeth. His gums looked like a baby’s — except for a few tiny black specks embedded deep inside.
I rinsed the mud off him thoroughly, dried him up, and led him back to the kitchen.

The others still weren’t home, and by my count, I had at least another hour before they would be.


“So, Robert,” I said, trying to sound firm, “what were you doing out there? Why were you eating dirt?”


Robert said nothing — like always. He just stared ahead with those yellowish eyes, gazing into nothing.


“Never mind,” I sighed, giving up. “Let’s make some real dinner instead.”


I rummaged through the fridge and found some sandwich fixings and a bag of frozen nuggets.


“Which one?” I asked him, holding them up with a smile.


Robert pointed at the nuggets. He didn’t usually respond to much, but food always got his attention. I made him about fifteen pieces, and he devoured them — swallowing each one whole, barely chewing, like he couldn’t get enough.
I just smiled, like a proud dad.
Robert loved to eat — he always had — and it was nice to see him enjoy it so much.
After that, we just sat in front of the TV, waiting for the rest of the family to come home.


The late afternoon passed like any other.
Tom told us that he’d been praised in math class for solving a problem on the board.
Izzy was still sulking — she barely touched her dinner, so we sent her upstairs early.
Robert, on the other hand, ate everything we put in front of him.
He shoveled food into his mouth so fast that he swallowed the potatoes and the roasted meat almost whole.
Lucy even praised him, saying it was impressive how he could even swallow the chicken bones. Strange kid… but honestly, kind of amazing.

By the end of dinner, we had to send Tom to his room too, after he asked, “Does Robert always eat like that?” I hated when the kids picked on each other — and from siblings, I found it downright unacceptable.

Outside in the yard, Marshmallow had been barking all afternoon again, so I went out to check what the hell was wrong this time — but there was nothing.
Maybe she just didn’t like being tied up outside. I couldn’t help it, though. She’d started growling at the kids and couldn’t be trusted indoors anymore.

At the end of the day, after Lucy tucked everyone in, we stayed up talking for a bit.
She was in the kitchen washing dishes, and I sat at the counter, picking at some grapes and watching her graceful hands move as she put the plates away.


“Lucy, what’s that on your arm?” I asked when I noticed a large red spot on the back of her left arm.


“Where?” she asked immediately, turning to try and see what I was talking about.


I stepped behind her for a closer look. It looked like a bite — like something big had stung or bitten her. There was even some dried blood in the middle of the mark.


“It looks like something bit you,” I said, and instinctively pressed on the spot with my thumb.


“Ow, Ed!” Lucy yelped. “That hurts — don’t poke it!”


“Sorry,” I pulled my hand back. “I’ll pick up some ointment for it tomorrow.”


I kissed her on the cheek and headed upstairs. Before going to bed, I peeked down into the basement to check on Robert. I told him goodnight, then went up for a shower.

Robert had always slept in the basement. That’s where he felt most comfortable.
Poor kid.


The morning started out like any other — shower, brushing teeth, getting ready. When I came downstairs, Lucy was already cooking — eggs and bacon, the usual. I gave her a quick kiss and sat down next to Robert, who was already at the table, waiting for breakfast.

That’s when I really looked at him — really saw him — and for just a split second, I think I understood what the kids were so afraid of.
Robert was naked, and he looked about seventeen, maybe eighteen. Completely hairless.
His eyes were yellow, filmed over with a grayish haze. He just stared ahead, unblinking.

But then something seemed to switch back on in me — the panic melted away, replaced by a warm rush of fatherly affection.


“So, how’d you sleep, Robert?” I asked gently, placing my hand on his cold, damp shoulder.


He didn’t respond. He just sat there, waiting.

Breakfast was nice — just me, Lucy, and Robert.
Izzy and Tom said they weren’t hungry, but I figured they were probably up to some mischief. They didn’t even come downstairs until I shouted that it was time for school.
I kissed Lucy goodbye — she smiled and kissed me back — then handed Robert the leftovers: the shells of the twenty-eight eggs he’d eaten for breakfast.
He’d grow up to be a strong young man, I thought proudly.

We walked to the car together, like a happy little family.


“Dad…” Tom started quietly. “What’s wrong with Robert?”


“What do you mean, what’s wrong?” I frowned. “He’s just growing up. Happens to everyone.”


Izzy didn’t say a word. She just stared down at the ground, head low. Still sulking, I thought — probably about yesterday’s nonsense.


“But Dad,” Tom continued, “he was smaller than me yesterday. What’s happening to him?”


“That’s enough!” I barked. “There’s nothing wrong with him! He’s fine! You need to accept him for who he is! How would you feel if someone made fun of you?”


Tom lowered his head, quiet as a mouse, and kept walking toward the car.


“Ed! Hey, neighbor, wait up!”


I turned at the sound of a familiar voice — Clay, the guy who lived next door. We’d known each other for years, though lately we hadn’t talked much.


“Morning, Clay. What’s up?” I asked, walking over after strapping the kids into the car.


“Morning, Ed. There are a few things I wanted to talk about,” he started, and before I could say a word, he launched straight into it. “First off, that damn dog of yours never stops barking. It’s driving us insane.”


“Oh, sorry, Clay,” I cut in quickly. “I’ll take her to the vet this afternoon. I’m not sure what’s gotten into her.”


“Yeah, well…” he waved his hand. “The barking’s not even the worst part. What really bothers me is… who the hell is that over at your place? A relative or something?”


I stared at him, confused. Who was he talking about? He’d known us for over ten years — he knew everyone in this house.


“That young guy,” Clay stammered when he saw my face. “The weird one. There’s this kid standing out in your yard for hours, and then later that night, I see that same guy throwing out what looks like a child’s costume or clothes. What’s going on, Ed? Who the hell is that?”


A hot wave of anger shot through me. How dare he talk about my son like that?


“That ‘weird guy’ is my kid, you old bastard!” I shouted. “How dare you say something like that about him?!”


“Calm down, Ed,” Clay said, stepping back. “He can’t be your kid — you’ve only got two. I’ve known you for over a decade!”


“Screw you, Clay!” I roared. “You’re such an asshole! Just because my boy’s a little different, he doesn’t even exist to you? You think we should just look right through him, is that it?!”


“What are you talking about, Ed?” Clay asked, backing away another step, his face pale. “What’s going on with you and Lucy? She was yelling for help yesterday, and when I came over, she just smiled and said everything was fine. What the hell is happening?”


“You!” I growled. “You’re the one who hurt her, weren’t you? You’re the reason for the mark on her arm? I swear, Clay, if I find out you laid a hand on my wife, I’ll— get the hell off my property!”


He didn’t wait for me to finish. Clay turned and practically ran back to his house.

So much for a good morning. 
By the time I slammed my car door shut, I was seething. Izzy and Tom didn’t say a single word the entire ride. At school, they only waved goodbye instead of speaking.
Even my western playlist didn’t sound right that morning.
Goddamn Clay.


The whole day was shit.
That argument with Clay in the morning had thrown everything off. So I decided to head home early. I could do that — I was the principal, after all.
By early afternoon, I was already home, hoping to rest a little. But even there, a surprise was waiting for me.

Lucy greeted me weakly, then sank down onto the couch. She said she wasn’t feeling well — dizzy and exhausted. I sat down beside her, gently stroking her hair, hoping she’d feel better. That’s when I noticed it again — another large, red bite mark, this time on her neck.


“Clay was here, wasn’t he?” I asked sharply.


Lucy just shook her head, murmuring that no, nobody had come by. Then, just like that, she fell asleep on the couch.

I took off my jacket and laid it over her, then went to the kitchen to make her some tea.
But another surprise was waiting for me there.

Robert was crouched in front of the fridge, the contents scattered all over the floor, shoving everything he could into his mouth.
Everything that had been in the fridge — milk, carton and all, meat still in its packaging, cheese, eggs in their boxes.
His jaw was stretched wide, working unnaturally as he tried to suck in everything from the floor just as it was. He was still naked, filthy, and covered in food, crouched there on the cold marble tiles.


“Oh, Robert,” I sighed, rubbing my temples. “I told you — if you’re hungry, just say something! We’ll make you something to eat!”


Robert didn’t even look at me — he just kept shoving more and more into his mouth.


“Wait — let me help you,” I said softly, kneeling beside him and starting to hand-feed him, just to keep him from choking.


When he finally finished, I took him to wash up. His bare body was smeared with leftovers; the whole kitchen looked like a war zone.
He still just stared blankly ahead as I bathed him, eyes glazed over. Then I found some of my own clothes for him — they were way too big, but they’d do for now.
With Lucy out cold, everything else was left to me: cleaning up, picking up the kids, and even doing the grocery run, because Robert had emptied the entire fridge.


First, I went to pick up the kids from school — but I kind of wish I hadn’t.

Izzy’s dumb teacher wanted to talk to me, and managed to catch me right there in the parking lot. Same old nonsense, she said Izzy was scared of something.
Izzy just had a vivid imagination, I thought. But I still talked to her about it in the car. At almost fifteen, she shouldn’t be afraid of silly things anymore.

I brushed the teacher off as quickly as I could. Izzy didn’t say a word afterward. She understood I was right — there was nothing to be afraid of.

We finished the shopping fast. I tossed everything familiar into the cart; Tom got a few chocolates and a little action figure. Izzy didn’t want anything — said her stomach hurt.
But I knew something was off. She was hiding something from me.
When we got home, Lucy was already in the kitchen. She looked pale and weak but was still preparing dinner.
Izzy went straight to her room and locked the door. Tom stayed in the living room, playing, and later I helped him with his homework.
That’s when I remembered Robert.

I found him out in the yard again — standing in the exact same spot as yesterday, staring into the forest.
Completely still, watching the sun go down behind the trees.


“Robert, everything okay?” I asked gently.


As usual, Robert didn’t respond.
I placed my hand on his shoulder and steered him back toward the house. His yellow eyes stared off into the distance, a cloudy film over them — like he was blind.

“Uh, Robert…” I looked him over. “Did you play with Marshmallow?”

He was covered in dog hair.
That’s when it hit me — I couldn’t hear Marshmallow barking. I hadn’t even noticed in all the afternoon chaos.


“Oh no, Robert… please tell me you didn’t let Marshmallow loose,” I said, half-joking, half-worried.


Robert just walked into the kitchen without saying a word.
I ran a quick check around the yard, calling Marshmallow’s name, but there was no sign of her. The leash she’d been tied with was gone too.
No dog, no trace.

Stupid mutt. We’d put up posters tomorrow — maybe someone around the neighborhood had seen her.

Dinner that night was roast and mashed potatoes. 
Izzy didn’t feel well, so she stayed upstairs. Tom barely ate — I think he just wanted to go play with his new toy. He didn’t even sit close to Robert, probably afraid he’d have to share the table with him.

Robert, though, ate happily as always. Lucy even cooked him his own portion of meat, which he finished all by himself. The kid had a great appetite.
Dinner passed quietly.
Lucy wasn’t feeling great either but managed a few bites. Tom just mumbled whenever I tried to talk to him. And Robert — well, poor kid — didn’t speak at all.
Everything felt calm again that evening.

Robert went down to the basement early — must’ve been tired. Izzy spent the whole afternoon locked in her room. Lucy went to bed early too; she looked completely drained.
Tom played for a while longer, then headed off to sleep.

I spent a bit more time outside, calling for Marshmallow — but still nothing.

Maybe tomorrow.


Morning brought another surprise.

Robert was a grown man now — around twenty-five, I’d say — and there he was, standing naked in the living room.

I was a little startled, sure, but honestly… with how much the boy ate, was it really that shocking he grew up fast?
He stood there in the morning sunlight, his neck and limbs unnaturally long, his body lean but muscular. His face, though — that hadn’t changed one bit.
Those yellow eyes, that toothless mouth, staring blankly just like always.

Lucy was already cooking breakfast. She looked a little better than yesterday. She’d made enough food for a whole army again, but I knew Robert would handle it.
Izzy didn’t come down — said she wasn’t hungry. Tom sat at the table with us.
It was shaping up to be a quiet morning… until Robert started choking.

The sound froze me. He was coughing, gagging — gasping like he couldn’t breathe. Lucy and I both panicked.
Robert always swallowed things whole, but I never thought the twenty-five pancakes he was working on would cause any trouble.
Yet there he was, choking to death.

I rushed to him, sweeping everything off the table in the process. Lucy hurried over, trying to look into his mouth, searching for whatever had gotten stuck.
I hit his back, again and again, trying to help him clear his throat — and then something brown and rope-like slid out between his lips. It looked like a leather strap — slick, bloody, covered in pale yellowish fur.


“Lucy, get back!” I yelled. “I’ll pull it out!”


I stepped behind Robert and grabbed the thing hanging from his mouth, pulling as hard as I could. He clung to the table’s edge, still gagging, gasping.
Then, with a wet, tearing pop, I yanked it free.

For one frozen second, I wanted to scream — to run — but I didn’t.
Because dangling from the end of that leash was Marshmallow’s half-digested head. The half-bone, half-meat, half-skin mess dripped saliva, blood, and what looked like a gelatinous mix of vomit and breakfast scraps.
Something inside my head twitched again — and just like that, I couldn’t see what I was looking at anymore. All I noticed was little Tom, covering his face in disgust, tears streaming down his cheeks.


“Stop it, Tom!” I shouted. “Don’t act like you’ve never thrown up before! Robert’s just like the rest of us — he can get sick too!”


Tom cried harder. Lucy tried to calm him down while wiping the sticky, vomit-covered slime from Robert’s chest and chin.
I just stood there, holding what was left of Marshmallow’s head, mumbling under my breath that none of my kids — except Robert — ever really understood me.

I figured it was best if I just went to work.
Marshmallow’s head went in the trash.


All day, I couldn’t stop being angry.
Lucy called me around noon. She said she’d taken Tom to school, but Izzy refused to go — said she felt too sick to even open the door. Robert was better. Ate again. Same amount as always.  Lucy asked if I could pick Tom up in the afternoon since she still wasn’t feeling well. He had extra classes, so we’d probably finish around the same time anyway.

So, when work finally ended, I drove over to get Tom. He still wasn’t in a good mood — didn’t even want to come home. But after a little insisting, he gave in, and we headed back.

When I opened the front door, Tom — just like the other day — bolted upstairs and locked himself in his room.
I threw my briefcase into the living room chair, irritated.
That’s when I saw Lucy lying on the couch — Izzy kneeling beside her.


“What happened?” I asked, trying to keep calm.


“What do you think?!” Izzy screamed — louder than I’d ever heard her before. “That thing hurt Mom! What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you see what it is?!”


“Watch your mouth!” I shouted back. “How dare you talk like that about your brother?!”


“That thing isn’t my brother!” Izzy shrieked. “And it’s not your kid either!”

I stepped forward and slapped her. Hard. She hit the rug beside the couch and started to cry.


“How could you be so cruel?!” I roared. “Talking like that about your own brother! What the hell is wrong with you?!”


Then I finally looked at Lucy. She was ghostly pale. Another huge red mark on her shoulder — dried blood crusted in the center, like a bite… or a sting.
She trembled. She looked drained, like there wasn’t a drop of life left in her.


“Oh, God, Lucy…” My voice shook. “What’s wrong with you?”


She didn’t answer — just barely shook her head, as if she didn’t know.


“Come on, I’m taking you to the hospital,” I said, carefully lifting her off the couch. “Izzy, you stay here, and think about what you’ve done. Watch your brothers.”


And I carried Lucy out to the car. Gently placed her in the seat, then drove off — never even thinking about the fact that I’d just left my three children home alone.


I drove home alone.
Lucy stayed at the hospital — they said she’d lost a dangerous amount of blood. The doctor told me it looked like something had sucked it out of her. He kept asking when she was last near a swamp, or standing water. We lived close enough to places like that, sure, but I still didn’t understand what he meant.

He said it looked as if a giant leech had drained the life right out of her. I didn’t know what to say. I just muttered that my daughter had been acting strange lately — could she have done something?
The doctors laughed it off. Said it was probably some kind of bug. A parasite. Maybe a leech.

I only stayed a few hours. Lucy got blood transfusions, IVs — the works. Before I left, one of the doctors told me I should go home, get some rest. “Check the house in the morning,” he said. “Maybe there’s something in there — a bug, or a nest.”


I was exhausted. But the second I got home, my eyes snapped open wide.

The front door was standing wide open. Darkness everywhere. The curtains drawn. The house felt empty — dead. I didn’t even bother parking properly; I just ran inside.


“Robert!” I shouted the moment I stepped in. “Robert! Kids! Where are you?!”


The back door was open too.The curtains fluttered in the night wind.


“Hello?!” I yelled again, flipping on every light I could reach.


Nothing. Just the soft whisper of air moving through the house.
I headed for the basement — but the door was open there too. Robert wasn’t inside. A sour, rotten smell rolled up from below.
Then — a noise upstairs. A thump. Like someone falling out of bed.


“Tom! You up there?” I called out, racing up the stairs.


Tom’s door stopped me cold. I hit it hard — like I’d run into a wall. I pushed again, harder this time. It gave only a few inches, wedged tight from the inside.


“Tom, it’s Dad — open the door, please,” I gasped, pressing my shoulder against it.


No answer. No sound.
Then I thought of Izzy. Where was she? Still locked in her room? I ran down the hall and grabbed her doorknob — it turned easily.
And what I saw inside…was madness.

Robert was crouched at the foot of the bed, on all fours. Tom lay on the mattress, eyes wide, glassy, staring at the ceiling. And Robert — oh God — Robert’s jaw was unhinged, his mouth stretched open like a snake’s.
Half of Tom was already inside.


“Oh, finally,” I said calmly — almost relieved. “Finally Tom’s making friends with Robert. They’re playing.”


Then a scream — high and sharp. Izzy’s voice.
She hit me from behind, hard enough to send me crashing into the little dresser.  My head slammed against the wood. Everything spun, blurred.
But in that dizzy moment, through the pain and confusion… something inside my head moved.
The thing that had been blocking the truth — the fog, the lie — it slipped away. The thing that had poisoned my mind is gone.
And for the first time… I knew who my children really were.



Morning.

I sat in the living room.
My hands were bloody. I pressed them to my face and stared through my fingers at the broken window. The stench rising from the basement was unbearable.
I didn’t have the strength to go down there.
Somewhere under my torn shirt, blood kept seeping out. My left leg was probably broken — I could barely feel it, just the dull ache. But none of that mattered.

What mattered was upstairs.
Izzy was watching over Tom. He still hadn’t woken up. I’d already called the police, the ambulance… but what was I supposed to say? That I raised a monster who made me believe it was my son? Some kind of twisted cuckoo hatchling?
Straight to the asylum.


So I kept the truth to myself. Robert — that strange thing, that leech that lived through our family. And that night — the fight with the tentacled thing that used to be him.
I told no one. Better that way.

We said someone broke in. That the kids were home alone. That someone must’ve been watching.
At the hospital they treated me too. And Tom. My boy had some kind of poison in him — he didn’t move all day. But he got better. Eventually.

Lucy came home too.  Strangely, she barely remembered Robert. As if she’d been somewhere else the whole time.

We fixed the house. I installed new locks, alarms, cameras — made sure no one could ever get in again. Bought a few guns, too.

Time passed quietly. Everything went back to normal. Almost.
But I still watched the forest. Always. I never told my family, but I knew: Robert wasn’t dead.
Just hurt. Like me.
He broke the window that night and fled into the woods.
And I knew he’d come back someday. When he does, I’ll be ready. I won’t let him do this to my family again.

That’s why I was awake that night. Six months since the incident, and I still couldn’t sleep.
I watched the forest through the window. Then I saw the neighbor’s yard.
I think his name was Otto — the man who lived next door. But it wasn’t Otto standing there.

It was someone else.
A familiar shape.
A small, bald boy — maybe eight years old — standing naked in the yard.
Staring toward the woods.
His yellow eyes glimmered in the dark.
