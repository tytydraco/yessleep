No matter how many times I try to remember, I forget what I’ve forgotten.

There’s a gnawing in the back of my head, this urge that I’ve lost something.  
  
I’ve been inside my apartment for six months now. I haven’t left my front door, felt someone bump into me, or seen a real person in that long either. I keep my windows closed. I keep my door locked, I keep my lights on. I know there’s something I’m trying to remember, I know there’s something I’ve forgotten in a fog I think I’ve caused.  
  
I can’t find my way out. I can’t find where the exit to it all is, where the answer is, where the key is, what the lock might be.  
  
My name is Sarah, and there is no way out where I live.

My home is a simple studio apartment on the fourth floor of an eight floor building. It is in the west wing of the complex. The complex is completely closed and separated into three equidistant buildings connected by a central hallway that bisects each wing on each floor. There is a lobby at the ground floor. There is a gym, laundry, internet, and air conditioning. I have no pets. My apartment is 150 square feet. I have a bed, computer, shower, sink, pantry, fridge, floor, ceiling, blankets, fan, window, clothes, water, food, toilet, posters, chair, desk, hair ties, hail clippers, blender, glasses, plates, forks, spoons, towels, curtains, umbrella, debit card, shoes, eggbeater, toaster oven, overhead lights, and four walls.  
  
I know you’re wondering a lot of things right now.  
  
“How do I get food? Am I dead? Am I crazy? How do I do laundry? Why did I write this? Can I call people?”  
  
Well that’s something I’ve been wondering too. I know time passes. I know I eat, I know I sleep, I know I have a phone, and the internet, and places I can reach out to. I also know there is nobody out there to reach. Every day I wake up, I have new food in my apartment. Each day all my clothes are washed. Each night every little thing in my house seems to come back to me, from wherever it went. For a long time I thought there was nothing happening. Literally nothing. I though that I was in this pocket of absence. A place where nothing would come to me, and nothing would leave me. But then I left food on my counter, and watched it. I watched it first turn stale, then mold, then rot and stink and die. I learned time was passing.  
  
I know I’ve forgotten something. I just don’t know what it is.  
  
I stopped leaving my apartment, but for a while I used to. I explored this place, and I think you’re wondering what it’s like. Let me explain what I know.  
  
Every exit in this building is gone. The walls are sheer, evenly placed studs covered by drywall, covered by eggshell-white paint, covered by neutral paintings, covered by stale air. There are windows, but there is no outside. There is a fine black wall outside each plane of glass. The Windows are locked, and do not break. The carpets are clean, there is no dust, it is 70 degrees, there is mild humidity, there is no noise, the lights are warm, the rooms are empty, and there are no people.

I used to knock on doors. I looked for people, I looked for answer, I shouted, and called, and spent time asking if anyone could hear me or help. The doors to each unit are locked, there are no keys I can find. I hope they’re out there somewhere. I opened a door once, just once, and decided to never do it again. The room was empty. Blank walls, dead air, dead hope. I think I am the only person hear. I know I am not alone.

Obviously I’m not alone, isn’t that the way things should be? A grand monster in the dark. A thing waiting for me to lower my guard? I don’t know if something like that is here or not. I know I have seen one thing. One thing which wasn’t supposed to be there, because nothing is supposed to be here. I know I must have done something, I have forgotten what I have done, or forgotten to remember what I had to remember not to forget.

Two days ago, I watched the walls. I wrote things down. I hate writing. I hate passing time with little keyboard clicks. But this is important. I have to keep writing, it keeps me present. Writing keeps me focused. It keeps my mind. It keeps things real. Three days ago I was scared of this place. I had not left my apartment in six months. I stay here, I feel safe here. I keep myself away from the emptiness out there. Inside with my lights, the world is small, but it has a single person living in it. Out there, is something that is not living. Four days ago I went to sleep, I closed my eyes and rested. Each moment is counted by my sleep.  


I had a dream, I often do. These dreams are freedom from this place. Meeting people who aren’t real, and going places which never existed. Drinking imaginary coffee with hallucinated family. I had a pretend dinner, and I was told I was loved.

When I woke up, my door was open.

I closed it, slammed the door. Locked it, moved everything up to the door, shut out the world. I forgot that I opened it. I had to. I did. I forgot. I do not remember opening it. I spent hours looking at the door, looking to it like a child looks at God. Something known to be powerful, and everything, but not knowing how or why. My body trembled, Spasms of little aching fear. I wanted to run, but I knew I couldn’t. I felt as if I left the spot, the door would open. Eventually I fell asleep.

Three days ago I woke up, and my door was closed. Everything in my apartment was clamored up to the wall. Nothing was where it should be. I took what I needed to sit and watch. To wait for the door, to wait to move things back to where they needed to be. I stayed waiting for something in the world to change. Nothing did. I have listed many of the things I have in my home, but nothing I have tells time. Nothing here has a clock. Things which should tell me the time aren’t there, even when they should be. Things are still, and do not change. But my door opened. I slept again. I did not dream.

Two days ago I moved everything back to where it needed to be. I fixed it. All of my belongings were returned to their spot. I was safe, they were safe, everything was safe; nothing was safe. My door was locked. It stayed locked while I read, and wrote, and shit, and showered, and cried, and laughed. The door did not move, but I did. I walked my room over and over. I drank, and cooked and ate. I never stopped watching the door.

On my floor, three apartment units to the right hand side, there is a fire escape. I have walked up and down it before. I had seen it six months ago. The door to it was closed as well. But my door opened. I began to wonder if things had changed outside. If something was different. I spoke out loud to myself. I said my name.  
  
“Sarah”  
  
It was the first time I had heard my name out loud in months. I do not speak, because there is nobody to speak to. There is nothing. The nothing and me. Absence and presence. I spent the day reading, and went to bed.  
  
Yesterday, I was brave. I opened my door, and looked out into the world. I went into the hallway. I should have killed myself instead. I should have slit my throat, I should have drowned myself, I should have died in my sleep. I saw something. A non-absence, where there should have been absence. Another change. I took a picture.

I don’t know what it is. I think I might. I think I forgot what it was, or knew it was there. It’s the only thing that makes sense. It has to be the truth. I have to remember. Because if I forgot, if it wasn’t there before. That means something changed.

Today I’m writing this. I have not left my home. I haven’t opened my door. I have sat, and waiting, and wanted, and wondered. But I have not opened my door. I pass the time by clicking keys, I keep myself working, and keep eating, and keep waiting, and keep wanting. I keep doing what I can do keep myself together. Soon I have to open my door again. I have to go out into the world, and see if there is something I can find. I have to see if I have forgotten that things were the way they were, or if things have changed. If something is different, maybe somewhere I can finally find a way out.
