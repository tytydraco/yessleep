Just a note, Part 3 is removed right now, for formatting issues and such, but they should be back up soon. Markus says it because I'm not good with writing, but it's hard to write memories like these down.

When Markus and I turned fifteen we promised we would find our first job together and work the same shifts, a few months later we found this sad convenience store out on the outskirts of town, they were desperate for employees so Markus and we didn't even need an interview before we started working. The pay was really good for a convenience store. Around 13.50 an hour, I think it was, which is sad I can't remember since it was only like 2 - 3 years ago  I think, anyway It was probably the most fun I had while in school, it was our last year of high school, and we were both relieved to get the fuck out.

 We worked the night shift, which made for some weird customers, but we got to hang out all day and night long so it was a win. I had also started having sleeping problems, and I was still getting photos of myself, but it was becoming less and less often. It had been a few weeks since the last time I got one. I was hoping that they got bored, that they were sick of me, or they were over the lack of attention I was giving it.

 I had started putting signs on my window such as “FUCK YOU.” or “ SUCK MY DICK.” as well as just holding my middle finger to the window anytime I was up. They started bringing flowers to my door, which was a pain, I would just stomp on them and tossed them to my lawn, but I’m pretty sure I pissed them off because the notes with each picture started getting more annoyed with each delivery. It stopped soon after. One night we were just doing our own thing, we had finally finished our basic chores and were reading a magazine behind the counter. 

We saw a car pull up, one of those fancy ones with the LED high beams that blind you, and then you realize it's just their regular headlights. We put the magazine away and threw on our fake smiles. A young man, with blond curly hair and one of the ugliest T-shirts I’ve ever seen, walked in. It was Tyler, a friend of mine, we didn’t really hang out outside of art class, so after I dropped out I didn’t really speak to him anymore. He walked in smiling widely.

 “Oh, hey Billie, I didn’t know you worked here.”

 “Yeah.” I smiled.

“You are?” Markus asked. 

“Oh sorry, I'm Tyler.” He stuck his hand out to shake hands. 

Markus smiled weakly and took his hand. “I’m Markus.” 

We made some small talk for a bit. Tyler leaned himself on the counter, as a girl walked up to him. He shot up smiling in her presence. “This is my girlfriend Vanessa.” He leaned his head on her shoulder. 

“It’s nice to meet you.” She nodded.

“Nice to meet you too,” Markus said happily. 

Tyler looked at his watch “Sorry, we have to get going, where do you guys keep the drinks?”

 “In the back,” I said. 

Tyler smiled and walked away. 

Vanessa looked at me. “Your hair is so beautiful, what do you do?”

 “Oh, it’s just the off-brand shampoo and conditioner at Giant.” 

“Oh well it’s working,” she said before smiling and walking away to join Tyler. 

After they left Markus went to the back to do...something, so I was left at the register alone. I decided to go on my phone when a young man walked in with a younger girl close behind, his face red with streaks of tears on his cheeks, he walked to the makeup aisle and stared at it for a while, like a little boy in his mother's room. He turned to me and walked up to the counter leaning on it. 

“You look like you know a lot about makeup, anything you recommend?” He asked.

“Well, what are you looking for?”. 

He looked at me blankly. “All of it, I don’t have a budget, it’s all for my little sister.” He smirked a little, referring to the small girl next to him. She smiled at me, with a toothy smile. She had to be around 10- 11 years old.

I walked around the counter and walked to the aisle with him. I picked out all my favorite makeup. The little girl smiled with approval at each choice. We walked back to the counter. I was checking out her items when He looked above me.

“employees of the month.” He read. I looked above me to see our prison headshot-style employee photos. I smiled a little embarrassed.

“Yeah,” I said red-faced. He smiled, saying nothing. I finished scanning the items and told him the total. “ $87. 98” He looked at me for a moment, as if he forgot to pay. I squinted my eyes slightly.

“Sorry.” He said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a hundred dollars.

 I asked him if he was alright, he said it was nothing I needed to worry about, and thanked me again for the help with a weak smile. I gave him, his change, and they left. I watched them walk out the door, get in her bright pink 1978 Chevy Impala, and back out to the road. 

Markus walked out. “Hey, what I miss.” 

“Not much, I gave this guy makeup recommendations,” I said.

“You don’t really wear makeup anymore though.”

 “I know.” I shrugged.

“Well, I’m gonna go stock up the freezer.” He said throwing on a puffy coat.

 I wished him good luck and went back on my phone.  Since then he had come in almost every week. He told me his name was Gabriel, but to just call him Gabe, and that he just liked having someone to talk to at the end of the day. He told me the reason he was so upset was that he just lost his older sister a few days before. He didn’t even always buy something, just came in to talk. It was nice having someone else to talk to, I mean I love Markus,  but sometimes I can’t stand him talking about another horror story he heard online, or his new favorite movie, from the 80s.

Gabe and I started to talk more and more, He started giving me rides to and from work, and he even came in almost every shift to bring me lunch or something. I enjoyed Gabe's company, he was kind and smart, and he understood me. I wanted to be around him as much as I could, and eventually, he asked me if we could go out to dinner, I obviously agreed, but we never got to do that. As the last few weeks he came in he just seemed really nervous, I asked him what was wrong, but all he really said was that his pets were going haywire almost every night and it was messing with his sleep.

 I reassured him it was fine, but he persisted and he felt as if he was being watched, that someone was going to his room at night, and one day, he just stopped. I called and texted him, but he never answered, so I was just left with my imagination of why he stopped coming. I hoped he just moved away or something, but deep down I knew that wasn’t the case, and that feeling was eventually solidified. A few weeks later I was driving home. It was around 2:00 in the morning and I had just gotten off work.

 I was driving through the dark winding roads, just listening to the engine run, and the wind hit against the car. I was driving past a big old oak tree when I saw something reflecting against my headlights in the far distance. I wanted to pay no mind to it, but curiosity got the best of me. I turned around and pulled to the side of the road. I  grabbed my coat, and a flashlight, and headed up the small hill. I slowly walked through the bushes until I saw something silver shining in the light. I rushed up to it, the ground grew wet, and my shoes started to sink into the mud. I stepped back, it was like a sinkhole or something. I flipped on my flashlight and moved it to see what was around 20 feet ahead of me, I looked to see a bright pink 1978 Chevy Impala.

 I walked around the rim of the mud, as far as I could before my shoe started to get stuck. I leaned over. I showed my flashlight to the front seats, the white fabric was stained with blood, and I could see something red, and fleshy. The wind grew stronger and the stench of death washed over me, I stepped back absent-mindedly, sinking half my foot in the wet ground below me, struggling to get my foot out, knocking myself over. I stood up quickly grabbing at my flashlight. I ran to my car dialing 911. They arrived in ten minutes. Four officers walked up to me. 

They asked me to take them to the car. I stayed behind once the car came into sight, the smell was so strong I could barely take another step without gagging. When they walked back they all had a pale look on their faces. They confirmed it was Gabe’s car by the plate. I asked if it was Gabe I saw in the car. They glanced at each other before looking at me with sympathy. They said that there was something there, but they said until they ran some tests, they couldn’t tell if it was him or if it was even human. I covered my eyes with my hands and began to sob violently. I was taken to the station and didn’t get home until 5:00.

When my parents woke up I confessed what happened to my dad. He comforted me saying I did the best I could. I cried convinced it was my fault. He reassured me it wasn’t, but he was wrong. A few years passed,  and I got another delivery in the mail, Photo after photo of Gabe and me, outside the convenience store, in his car, at the counter. My heart shattered, and I melted down on the floor. If only he never came in, if only I knew, Gabe would still be here.

 I think about it almost every day. I’ve come to his gravestone every other month since his funeral. There wasn't much to bury at the time, but nonetheless, I brought a bouquet of flowers to Gabe and his sister. I kept all the photos of us, even if they reminded me it was my fault.

 I just couldn’t bear forgetting his face.
