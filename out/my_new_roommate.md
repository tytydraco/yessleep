(TW!)  

i was always scared of living alone, so when it was time for me to move out i only looked into offers saying that theyre looking for a roommate. the first few places were either in a junkie neighborhood or too far from work. i couldnt find a good place for months, until i recieved a call from a man saying hes been thinking about having a roommate and his friend mentioned that i was looking for one. it was a bit weird that a friend mentioned my name and apparently gave him my number, but i was desperate, so i went. the place was in perfect distance from work, the neighborhood was nice, the appartment was really clean, i couldnt even notice any dust on the furniture, the man was sweet - so i agreed, becuase i had no other choice. 

the first couple of weeks were going really smooth, we talked and got to know eachother, he cooked dinner when i came home late from work. he loved to talk and appreciated that i listened to him. it felt like we really bonded, i was happy with the way things were turning out. however, with time he stopped talking so much, got angry very easily, either came home late or didnt even come out of his room. i tried talking to him, ask if everything is alright, but it was no use. i didnt really know what to think, so i just let it go, thinking he needed space. 

when i was a kid i used to get strong nosebleeds when i was stressed, and recently they came back due to stress at work. whenever some blood dripped on the floor, he got really mad and asked me to clean it right away and use bleach afterwards, because he cannot stand it. i didnt understand why, but i didnt really want to know. however, one night he got so mad because the blood stained a pillow, that he throw a plate on the ground, screaming that he cant look at the blood and handed me bleach saying i have to clean it up right away. i was so shook, that the next day i decided to go leave and stay at my parents for a while. i didnt hear anything from him, since that night. 

a couple days later i drove back to the appartment. to my surprise the door wasnt locked. i walked inside and heard the water running in the bathroom. i figured he was just taking a bath. when i was walking to my room, i saw a few drops of blood on the floor. i checked my nose but it wasnt me. 

it was strange, it couldnt be him, he wouldnt leave blood on the floor, without cleaning it. i went to my room and waited for him to leave the bathroom. the water wouldnt stop running, and almost and hour passed by. i got worried and knocked on the door asking if hes alright. no response. i started banging on the door and screamimg but still, nothing. i didnt know what to do, the drops of blood were leading to the bathroom and the water wouldnt stop running. my head was spinning. i decided to break down the door. after a few kicks it finally broke. the light was off, i didnt see much, i walked in and steppped on water. it icked me and i switched the light on. it wasnt water, it was blood. my socks were drenched in blood. i didnt know what was happened.

 the bathtub curtain was completely closed and i was terrified to open it. my shaky hands finally opened the curtain. it was what i i was afraid of. my roommate, in the bathtub, filled with water and blood, his hands were cut that i could see his veins. i slowly backed up and stood in place for what felt like hours. then i rushed to the kitchen to call the ambulance but i couldnt find the phone. the only thing left on the counter was a note. 

“its already too late. i left a few bottles of bleach in the cabinet. please clean the floors, you know i cant stand it.”
