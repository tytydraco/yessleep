Sleeping has always been tough for me, even as a child. I would continually rummage through my room, smashing together my favorite action figures or testing how quickly my hot wheels could travel over the walls, much to my parents' dismay.



 I'm not sure if it was because I was a hyperactive child or because I thought the dingy house we used to live in was unsettling.



I'm ashamed to admit that this behavior followed me into my early teens and is still with me in my late adulthood.





Despite my efforts to overcome this tendency, I bring it up because I recently had to relocate back to my parents' old home. After losing my minimum-wage work due to the recent quarantine and all, I had no other options but to return to their home. It was in worse shape than I remembered; to paint the picture, it looked like a hand-me-down of hand-me-downs.



so I started making plans to make that old hellhole "livable".



although it was a pain,  I was able to shimmy all of my belongings into my old room after making a cursory check for any crackheads, squatters, or your neighborhood racoons. It almost felt weird, as if all of these memories were sealed in place, like in a time capsule.



That night, I had trouble sleeping; I kept tossing and turning, finding the old musty air stifling, but I was also too tired to force my body up to open the window.



It took some time for me to slide into sweet nirvana, only to be jolted awake by the want to piss badly. I haphazardly opened my eyes, only to realize that I was unable to move.



I darted around, my eyes moving tauntingly slowly as if I were attempting to run through shallow water. My room was only dimly illuminated by the moonlight, but as my eyes adjusted, I could see everything relatively clearly 



As what appeared to be faceless figures shifted into haphazardly placed clothes and luggage, I tried to rationalize with myself, proving that everything I was seeing was a figment of my imagination, until something snapped me out of my reverie, a sound so familiar, the sound of my doorknob rattling, followed by the squeak of wood.



And shortly after, I noticed the source of the noise, which I might best characterize as a big emaciated body with "skin" clinging to its bones like a scarecrow. 



A loud wet thump shook off the grogginess, bringing to my attention how large it was; it could have easily been taller than me. It returned to its knees, slumping as it did so it wouldn't bang its head against the ceiling.





The way it walked was odd; it was like watching a baby attempt to walk for the first time.



It managed to make its way over to my bed, emitting a waft of musty air as if it had its own musk. It leaned closer to me, the smell intoxicating as it got closer, allowing me to see all of its details. If I could gag, I would, but if I wouldn't be I'd be hesitant in case it noticed and did something 



Now that it was closer, I could see more details: it was smooth like porcelain, yet it still had that skin texture, and its limbs were long and gangly, like marionettes. The closer I came, the more I realized it had no defining traits.





If I hadn't passed out from the odor, I believe I would have noticed more intricacies on this homunculus of flesh.



Only to be woken up in the morning by a slight draft coming through my bedroom door, which was jarred open.



Im writing this story from a motel, finding it hard to sleep.
