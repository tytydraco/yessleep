Feeling exhausted after coming back, I barely cleaned up the garage before crashing into the bed. That was when I saw my brother in the corner of my eye. It was not an unusual place for him to lie on, but he felt a bit off. But it was getting too tough for me to keep my eyes open so I offered no more resistance.

The next day went on as usual but whenever we caught each other’s eyes, it felt a bit off. But it was nothing too discomforting for me to confront him about. I was quite sure that the answer to my feelings weren’t something unknown. That day, I finally cleaned up my garage. It was weird to see my brother in my car when I was driving back home (he was awfully quiet) but he has played pranks like that on me before. The clean-up shouldn’t have required that many hours but I did get a bit lazy at times, which meant that it was night-time by the time I was finished and I went off to my bed without cleaning myself. My brother lay there today too.

On the third day, things got weirder. I got a call from his work-place inquiring me about why he hasn’t gone to work. I informed them that I don’t know about his reasons but I’ll ask him when I see him in the house. Although I knew he was always in the house (well at least his shoes were always in place), I rarely ever saw him. And the times I did catch a glance were quite, alarming.

I saw him near me when I was drinking coffee from his cup during breakfast. Then I saw his back when I was inspecting a weird scar on the back of my neck. But the most chilling of them all was when I caught him staring at me while I was in the shower. He seemed just as terrified as I was when I caught his glance and he only looked away from me when I did the same.

The things were getting weirder and the calls from his workplace piled up. I didn’t pick them up because I had no answers for them. Every time I saw his face my mind went black and started day-dreaming about a night. I knew things were odd yet I felt like I shouldn’t call for any outside help. I stopped going to my shop too since he started following me there. The customers that did come seemed a bit perplexed and got off without making much conversation.

Tonight, I finally decided to confront him. I knew exactly where to find him, and I opened my mouth while I sat on my bed. His mouth also moved; it was odd. I felt odd. The world felt off. Words didn’t come out of my mouth, he didn’t say anything either. I wanted to touch his face so I prodded a finger on his cheek. He felt like glass.

The closer inspection revealed that he wasn’t really my brother.

The days after that have passed by swimmingly. I have no contact with the outside world and I’ve secluded him & myself to a place only my brother and I knew about. Things are peaceful, times aren’t turbulent. We two have merged our lives together perfectly.

He isn’t malevolent, I can sense that. But he isn’t my brother. It couldn’t have been my brother, I knew that much. Things aren’t confusing now.

He isn’t my brother. He isn’t malevolent. I know he won’t do any harm to me.

His eyes also show the same sense of pity that I thought I deserved on that night. His eyes show more kindness that his eyes ever did. I don’t hate him. This “brother” of mine has been far better to me than anyone else ever was.

I still need to patch him up sometimes. I always make sure that he’s suited perfectly. After-all, this suit’s the only gift my brother has ever given to me, so I need to take care of that.

I’m glad that whatever happened has happened. I’m glad that I have him now. I’m glad that I’ve got a friend now (he is, right?), even though he isn’t a conventional one.

I think I’ve become friends with a skin-walker.
