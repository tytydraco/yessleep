Before I tell you why I’m writing this, I first need to tell you two things. Firstly, I am still in college (studying education for those curious), and secondly my girlfriend and I only meet on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This is not due to any dislike or limited tolerance of one another, it is simply because of the first thing I had to tell. Travelling up and down to Dublin on the daily leaves very little time for us to see one another, that’s why on Wednesday, when I have a half day, and Saturday when she has a day off, we spend, or spent every moment we could together.  Over the years these two days have metamorphosized into from ordinary days into days of loving sanctuary. Days where I could just be me, away from pressure and demand. I loved her. But I’m not here to reminiscence, nor am I here to tell you that sort of story. No. This story starts in May. Shortly before a concert that Mary was dying to go to would appear. I remember her telling me that Wednesday, her auburn hair fell so luxuriously about her neck, and her smile, benevolently mischievous, supported two azure eyes that shown some minor sorrow.

“What’s up buttercup?” I asked in a mocking masculine voice.                                 

“Shut up” she retorted with a laugh “The only thing that is wrong is the fortune you cost me a fortune in Panadol."

We laughed. Oh God we laughed.

“Nah c’mon what’s irritating you?” I playfully pressured “I know something is”           

She paused; her eyes widened but her smile remained steadfast. “Guns ‘n’ Roses are playing this Saturday and Katelyn said she has two tickets”      

Quickly doing the math, I realized my partner of two years still lived in fear of disappointing what had become our regime. I laughed and replied: “Then make sure you get me a t-shirt!"

Her eyes avoided mine for a second “So you’re not mad?"

“Mary” I scooted closer to her on the coach “Why on earth would I be mad?”

She looked back up at me, each freckle a part of a holy constellation that spread across her pale cheeks. “Because you’re going to miss me like oxygen, right?” she hit me full force on the arm. I’ll admit this here because I’m somewhat anonymous, but I did squeal slightly under the impact. “I’ll miss you like a blind man misses the bowl”                          

Her face contorted as she giggled. When she stopped, she spoke “I don’t like having to wait the full week to see you?”

The familiar dread rose in my stomach, this conversation had been the basis for so many arguments in the past. Mary was a brilliant partner, one I can wholeheartedly say I adored, but patience was not her strong point. Opting to avoid college entirely, she took to working in retail, and with Dolly Parton’s working hours she also had spare time in the evenings, unaware of the assignments, lesson plans, and reading materials that murdered mine.

“It’ll only be like this for another two years” I said softly as I brushed one serpentine lock of hair that hung in the middle of her face. With the partition moved, I continued “Then I get to irritate you all the time. Day in, Day out.”

She looked at me, her lips closing to a smirk “If we can ever afford to live together.”

“We will.”

“Hope so.”

The room became silent, the standby hum of the television seemed louder as the moments dragged on.

That evening was glorious. We eventually went for a walk along the country roads, the primroses and young nettle flower erupting into new life. We got back, I cooked, she spoke about the girls at work, I nodded only half listening. After dinner we watched a horror movie over a glass of wine, before we retired to my bedroom. If there is one thing I can tell you readers, one thing that you can learn from my story it’s this: There’s beauty in simplicity, and for anything to be beautiful, you must simply enjoy it.

The next day was a college day. Sorry, I should explain what I mean by that. In my college degree, I have to attend college three days a week, whilst teaching in a school the other two. As you will doubt pick up on throughout my ramblings, I much prefer Monday and Wednesdays, these are the days I teach. The school I complete my practice at is a country school, not far from where I live, the time I save commuting allows me to neglect my college studies on the Wednesday, where I must repay my neglect on Thursday. However, this would not be the case today. I woke up with a headache, one that reminded me “Just one more glass” is never a good idea. I turned with a grunt and observed Mary, who had her back to me. As I exhaled and listened in dreadful silence waiting for the screeching of her alarm clock, I simply watched her. The gentle risings of her peaceful sleep brought a harmonious tranquility to the headache. Just like that, as if I had willed the damn thing into existence, the soothing, welcoming coos of AC/DC’S *Highway to Hell* slowly awoke my peacefully slumbering girlfriend.

“Mornin’” she croaked without turning around.

“Hey” I ribbited back, throwing my arm around her and bringing her closer.

“Five more minutes and I’ll get up for work.”

“Ten more minutes and I’ll be on your side of the bed, dreaming of Margot Robbie” I laughed.

She turned her head, her voice removed of all lethargy she replied “Dick.”

I hugged her tighter and told her not to worry, Margot Robbie hadn’t answered my texts in a half hour so she’s probably busy.

She chuckled and asked “So, you’re hiding from college today?”

Sensing the lingering mists of an oncoming lecture I waited in a sullen anticipation. To my surprise, she adopted a mimicking voice, mocking mine “Ugh Mary, College is so tough, I can’t meet up today, I’m so busy and stressed, and busy and stressed and stressed and busy."

I replied in a mocking voice “Dick.”

We lay longer for five minutes that morning, ignoring the quickly passing moments and the reluctant dread that forced Mary to eventually drag herself away from me. She got up, got dressed, brushed her hair and did her make-up, I watched her as she busied herself metamorphosing into the professional, she was between her Dolly Parton-allocated nine to five. As she disappeared across the landing, towards the bathroom, I closed my eyes and began to drift off into a sturdy hungover sleep. I didn’t hear her come back in, didn’t hear her pick up her keys, lock the door, didn’t even hear her car drive off. I hate myself now for not hearing it.

I woke up when Hairy text me. For those of you wondering if I misspelled ‘Harry’, I didn’t. Ryan was my best friend from secondary school, and although we study different subjects, we attend the same college. We met when we were in Mr. Murphy’s class, and as he was explaining gothic literature, Ryan snickered loudly when the teacher lost his train of though just as he was explaining what Dracula did to his victims.

“So class, Dracula, a creature created by our very own Bram Stoker, would suck…” his bushy eyebrows raised at this point of the conversation, as the thoughts floated gently upward, away into the ether. Beside me, Ryan snickered “He’d suck the cock right off of ya, the dirty dog” I laughed out loud. Uncontrollably so. This resulted in Ryan matching my noise, and an eventual detention after class. Mary, who had been sitting in front of Mr. Murphy’s desk, like the astute learner she was, has often told me she had the two us condemned as ‘full-time assholes’ from there on out.

Around our final year, Ryan’s hair began to grow thin, and by the end of the year, he decided to cut his hair entirely. This sudden change in style was followed by a barrage of nicknames that were workshopped almost daily. “Bruce” after Bruce Willis, “Conehead” after the cinematic masterpiece of the same name, we even tried “Ubh” (The Irish for egg). None seemed to stick until Mary, in her infinite ability to throw shade at friends, ironically christened my follicly challenged friend “Hairy”. The name stuck much to Ryan’s protests.

The phone beeped chirpily, and I groggily felt around for where it might be. When blindly slapping my tired open palm onto the bedside dresser failed, I searched under my pillow. What I found remains forever etched into my memory. I found my phone, the screensaver of Mary and I’s first trip to Galway shone brightly in the dim morning light, but as I dragged my device from under my pillow, a crumpled receipt came along with it. It looked old, the barcode had faded into barely legible hieroglyph, and the company’s name was basically non-existent, with the exception of the first letter of the name, a large ‘M’. Apart from that the company’s logo could be read, a small beady-eyed man, holding tightly onto a closed bag of some kind. And holding the light of the phone screen up to the paper, one could almost make out the purchase of a new Wi-Fi-router.

“How the fuck did that get there?” I spoke, sleep entirely removed from my voice. I was raking my mind looking for a possible solution to this conundrum, before my phone vibrated once again. ‘Snapchat from "Hairy’’ appeared on my phone screen. I crumbled the receipt up and launched it in the general direction of my wastebin across the room.

“You are hungover, aren’t you?” the message was bright and caused me to squint a little.

“No, your mam just kept me up.”

A laughing face and a middle finger emoji replied almost instantly.

“Yeah, I had a few drinks with Mary last night, I’ll not be on bus this morning dude.”

A few seconds passed, before the phone vibrated.

“Fuck you dude, now I’ll have to sit beside Larry and listen to his made-up girlfriends again.”

“My deepest, dishonest sympathies” I replied.

“Well, seeing as though you’re not bothered coming in, you think you could send me a snap of your student card? I still haven’t found mine and I want to go to the library today. Make it look like I’m a devoted engineering student.”

I turned the phone screen off, looked at the ceiling, contemplated ignoring his request before eventually exhaling and getting out of bed.

My wallet is always in the small safe I keep in my wardrobe, what started as a childish want to be a grown up when I was a kid, became a pattern I carried into adulthood. I’ve had the safe since my eleventh Christmas.

I took the key off my desk, opened my wardrobe and withdrew the small safe from the top shelf. It was encased in faded stickers of Batman, football players, and the large ‘weed is for everyone’ I picked up during ‘that’ phase. Opening it, my wallet, the first Valentine’s card I got from Mary, an old joker figurine, and a spare bedroom key all stared back at me. I wrestled the student card out of the wallet got a photo of it, replaced it the safe back into the wardrobe and replied to Hairy.

“Here you go dude”.

The message didn’t send.

I swiped the settings menu down on my phone screen. The Wi-Fi was struggling to connect to my phone. I rolled my eyes, and turned on my mobile data, sure it was going to momentarily hike my already expensive phone bill upward, but I didn’t want to let my best friend down. “Damned Wi-Fi” I sighed, realizing that online gaming would be off the menu today. Ensuring that the message had sent, I quickly went to Mary’s chat and typed “Hey babe, the Wi-Fi is busted. I’ll text you every so often using my data. Love you have a good day, don’t forget to let me know when you get the bus for the concert after work."

My parents were on their anniversary get-away to Portugal at the time and knowing that the internet connection wouldn’t be fixed on my student budget, I quickly decided to nurse what was left of the hangover and curl under the blanket.

After tossing and turning, counting sheep, and watching the hungover swaying of the room, I deduced, in my infinite wisdom that sleep would escape me for the time being. Throwing the small reversable stuffed- octopus that Mary got me, across the room in frustration, I swung my legs out of bed and stood onto the floor with a creak. Standing upright, my fingers negotiating a particularly intense itch on my left ass cheek, I decided a shower would be in order, and if that was a success, perhaps a celebratory americano.

I gathered the comfortable hoodie, its chest adorned with WWE’s Mankind on the front, next a pair of linen shorts, a towel and a bathrobe. Today was to be a relaxing day. As I made my way to the shower downstairs, I tried reconnecting to the WIFI, the idea of having to use my data while I listened to music in the shower made me cringe ever so slightly. Going into the settings, scanning for available networks and furiously tapping on my home’s router name proved fruitless. I stifled an agitated cuss, thinking my parents were home. I might be college age, but the silent treatment is top artillery in the psychological warzone of parenting. Remembering they were gone, I rolled my eyes, looked at my phone and turned my data on. No messages from either Hairy or Mary. I remember thinking how odd that was. If not at the same time, one of them would usually respond fairly quickly.

I went into the bathroom, placed my clothes on the closed toilet lid and turned the shower on. As it began to heat up, I returned to kitchen, watered mum’s pepper plant and re-read the note they left for me:

“Hi son, we left money on the hallway stand, get yourself some beers and maybe order some food. Don’t forget to clean up after yourself, water the plants, and do the recycling. Love Mum and Dad.”

I smiled at the note before reading the small, quickly jotted down addition at the bottom “P.S Don’t drink too many beers and water the plant, exclusively from Mum”.

I hoped they had a good time. They deserved it. Two brilliant people who raised me in a home where the only loud noise was laughter, two brilliant people who nurtured me and taught me there’s beauty in simplicity. Two. Brilliant. People.

I went back into the bathroom, quickly went to my Spotify and chose a song at random from my “Ye Olde Tunes” playlist.  I have always been a fan of the music from the 70’s and the 80’s, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, that kinda jazz. These music tastes did not go unnoticed by Hairy, who mimics an old man, crouched over, one hand on his hip and the other on an imaginary cane every time I chose a song. That day, I hit shuffle and as The Eagles were taking it easy, I enveloped myself in the rising steam and cascading waters, nursing my aching head in a cleansing flight of unnoticed time.

I remember vividly, after I got dressed and began to unlock the door, that Led Zeppelin was playing. If this was made up I suppose Stairway to Heaven would have been an appropriate song, but unfortunately, I don’t remember the exact song. I left the bathroom, I felt quite refreshed. Walking straight through the utility room, throwing my towel on the pile of washing that I would not doubt ‘forget’ to wash before my parents came home, I made my way into the kitchen. I turned on the coffee machine and bent over to open the cupboard where we keep the mugs. I remember feeling my skin shudder as if cold, and my face grow pale as I looked at the note in the green mug. I brought it out slowly and unfolding it, I sighed a short burst of relief, almost scoffing at my stupidity. It was from Mary: “Get better soon you drunk” her signature smiley face informed me it was in good humor. I put the note on the table and made myself a coffee, while it brewed, I sent a photo of the note to Mary with the caption “Get better soon you love-sick puppy”. Smiling at my accomplishments thus far in the day, I turned off my data, grabbed what was left of my coffee and returned to my room upstairs.

The smell in my room was atrocious, absolutely revolting stench of wine and sweat, and as a simple man of simple pleasures, I basked in the darkness triumphantly. The bed was mess from my tossing and turning from the morning, the floor was covered in clothes and miscellaneous items. I was about to sit at my desk and finish my coffee when I remembered my parent’s note. I tried to drown the thoughts of guilt with the remnants of my drink, when that proved a failure, I reluctantly stood up and began to tidy the room. I lifted my clothes and placed them in the washing basket, I binned all the miscellaneous items, and I even opened the window to allow some fresh air in, although I did keep the curtains closed as I intended to fall back to sleep at some point throughout the day. Completing my Herculean task as quickly as I did, I decided I would make my bed too before jumping beneath the covers. Fixing and fluffing the pillows, on Mary’s side of the bed as well as my own, I then went to shake the blanket in the air so that it would flatten over the bed nicely. I never forgot when the blanket fell onto the bed. Hell, I couldn’t have missed it. Floating downward, as if it materialized in the air, was a receipt. I hadn’t read it yet obviously, but its flimsy paper and narrow shape was unmistakable. It cradled its way through the air and landed gently on the flattened blanket. I remember cursing Mary, Mam, Dad. I remember blaming them for the receipts and bills that I had come across that day, I suppose I never really stopped to think about how odd it all was. I reached out and picked up the paper. A receipt for an unpaid phone bill. I scoffed and threw it onto my desk.

Mam must have left it on my bed before she left, that would explain why the Wi-Fi router receipt was there too. Mixed up mail or something. I continued to clean my room, lifting the debris of a drunken night off of the floor and binning it, I even brushed the floor. I walked toward my door, turning around, I stood to examine how the room looked. My desk was untidy, and the bin needed emptying, but other than that it looked pristine. I remember now that the room felt quiet, that sounds stupid, but it is the only way I can describe it, quiet and strange. I exhaled slowly, just to hear something and felt a gentle coldness stampede up my back, a gentle unease lingered about me. I remember making one of those ‘there’s not a monster behind me, but just in case’ beelines for my bed. Bravely reaching the bed, I swung my legs up and grabbed a random book off of the bookshelf that stood by my side of the bed. Anything to distract me from this increasing feeling of isolation and foreboding that now seemed to drown the room.

I was on page six before I wondered what I was reading. *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* by Hunter S. Thompson. It was on my favorite books, and as such it was rewarded a spot by my bedside, alongside *The Metamorphosis* by Franz Kafka, *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov and *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelly. I read those books when times got tough, they were my comfort books. When Mary and I broke up for a brief period of time, I devoured *Frankenstein* multiple times, when my dog died Kafka got the same treatment. Although the situation I found myself in seemed like it paled in comparison, I was all to happy to throw myself in to one of my favorites, at least it would keep my mind off of things. But it didn’t work. I kept glancing up above my book, at the closed bedroom door, if not that I found my eyes following the lines on the page, not actually reading them, other times I was simply stuck in my own imagination. Shit, I remember thinking about hands, countless hands all knocking on my door, tumbling over one another trying to get my attention. I just couldn’t focus.

That’s when it happened. Page forty-three, a small crumpled looking piece of paper slipped out. It fell onto my lap. My temples pulsated with fear, I dropped the book. I couldn’t believe it, there was simply no explaining this one. Mary, Mam and Dad never touched my books, I don’t even think they noticed them. At the risk of sounding like I’m beating a dead horse, I need you to understand, there was no way for that receipt to have ever gotten into that book. I felt myself shutter as I picked up the flimsy piece of paper, it shook mockingly with my tremors. “New Installation of an interior door lock” it read “total forty-three euros."

I felt my chest rise and fall, “What the fuck is this?”

The receipt was from a company I didn’t’ recognize, and Dad never mentioned the need for a new lock. My brain raced for a logical explanation; a sort of anxiety brewed within me in the meantime. The logo at the top of the document was of the same small, beady-eyed man from the first receipt. He was crouching and holding the small bag open, his frown was crowned by a large nose and his two eyes, his stare seemed entirely vacant. I remember knowing, not thinking, knowing that the logo had changed, and whether it was curiosity or disregard for the obviously strange situation I found myself in, I got up and went straight for the wastebin. I pulled out the empty wine bottle, the bar wrappers, the batteries, everything. It wasn’t there. I began to freak out, the room around me seemed to grow smaller. I don’t remember walking to my desk, nor do I remember sitting down in my chair. All I remember is clearing the entire surface with a frustrated swing of my arm. I couldn’t find them, they weren’t there. I remember putting them there, I remember it. It made no damn sense. As I sat there in a confused and frightened state of agitation, the room’s temperature seemed to decline around me.
