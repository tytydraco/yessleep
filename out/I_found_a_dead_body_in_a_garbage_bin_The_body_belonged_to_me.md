That's how it started. Late one night, I was smoking a blunt and watching a movie in my apartment on campus. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Once I extinguished the last of my blunt, my roommate Nicole asked if I could take out the trash. I would've preferred to wait until morning but she insisted. The dumpster was down the hall to the left of the exit and would take me less than five minutes, so I rose from my chair and did as she asked.

The air outside was freezing, but it felt good against my skin. I walked with bag in tow, careful not to step on any rocks in my slippers, and approached the dumpster. A car drove by, blasting pop music, blinding me with its brights. I paused for a moment with the lid open, blinking rapidly so the spots in my vision would clear. When they did, my eyes focused on the dark lump that lay in the bin. At first, I thought it was more garbage, but then I made out five crooked fingers sprawled out from an arched palm. Immediately I screamed, followed by a slew of slurs, dropping the trash bag I'd been holding on the pavement. I grabbed my phone and shone the flashlight on the body, hoping whoever it was was just sleeping. Or that my mind was playing tricks on me.

Instead what I found was a horribly mutilated body of a young woman, limbs bent in unnatural angles, bone peaking out of skin where they would've snapped in two. And then, as I stared wordlessly, trying to wrap my head around the gruesome sight, the night that had gone sour grew ten times worse.

At first, I didn't believe it, but after some close examination (as close as I could muster), I knew without a doubt that the body was irrefutably me. I mean, it had the exact same clothes I had on, down to the slippers I lazily put on as an afterthought. I shivered with fear, recoiled in disgust, and felt my body sway with the onset of hysteria. Had I lost my mind? I kept looking at the body, blinking, closing and re-opening the lid as if any of that would make it vanish like an illusion. I even poked it with a fucking stick. But it was still there. It was a real, corporeal, very much dead corpse of myself. Despite the fact that I was standing here, alive. Despite that fact there shouldn't have been two of me anyway.

What I did next was, in hindsight, not the smartest, but you have to remember I just stumbled across a mind-shattering revelation in a very not-sober state. What I did next was walk right back into the apartment, not caring to pick up the bag I dropped, just beelining for my apartment door down the hall. I fumbled for the keys, unlocked it, and ran into my room with door shut and locked. The slam was loud, and a minute later Nicole shot me a text.

"Everything ok?" She asked, and I stared at the text, unable to craft a reply. Should I go grab her, get her to come with me to confirm what I saw wasn't in my head? If I brought her along and it wasn't there, then I would feel relieved. I could pass it off as a weird side effect of the weed I smoked, or some underlying condition I'd need to get checked later. And what would I do if it was there? If there really was my dead body in the dumpster?

That's when another unsettling thought struck me. Was I even sure I was alive??

I've heard of out-of-body experiences. Perhaps I was living one. Perhaps my slipper caught on a rock and I fell and cracked my skull open on the sidewalk. Maybe that car was actually a drive-by. Or maybe what I smoked stopped my heart, etc etc. I spiraled into these paranoia-fueled hypotheticals until Nicole's knocking at my door snapped me out of it.

"Hey, Lupe? You doing alright?" She asked, sounding concerned. "Are you having a bad trip?"

I decided to go with my plan to show her the body. I needed some kind of answer, despite how scared I was of the ramifications. I unlocked the door and began to open it.

"Sorry, but I need to show you-"

A butcher-sized knife was plunged into my chest, forcing me to stumble backward into my desk. Nicole looked at me with pure apathy, a dead-cold stare in her once warm, friendly eyes.

"What the fuck-" I said, as blood sputtered out of my mouth. 

"I'm getting really tired of this, Guadalupe." She said with bitter distaste. "You're like a damn cockroach."

I tried to ask questions, but the more I spoke, the more blood I spat onto my carpet. I was losing consciousness, fast, and tried to come up with some kind of plan that could delay the inevitable. As I tried to reach for my phone across the floor, Nicole stepped forward and stepped on my hand firmly. I felt the bones in my fingers snap, and my body recoiled in a scream, though only a pained groan left my lips. 

"Why..." I rasped, and Nicole gave me a smug, pitying look. "Why what? Kill you?" She mocked. "I'm afraid you won't live long enough for a proper explanation. I'm just hoping this is the last time I have to deal with you."

I was confused by what she meant, but it seemed clear she didn't want to elaborate. Instead, I opted to use the last of my strength and grab her ankle, making her fall to the ground as she turned to leave. Digging my nails into her skin, I used her body to try to pull myself towards the knife, as she kicked my jaw with her foot. 

"What's with all the noise..." Spoke a tired Nicole that appeared at my doorway. Yes, a different Nicole, one that hadn't tried to murder me. Her tired eyes widened at the sight of what she saw, no doubt in disbelief. "Run!" I yelled at her, hoping she'd stop oggling and flee. Maybe she could get help. I'm not sure I'd make it long enough for paramedics, but at least the non-evil Nicole could get a chance to escape. Unless she was in on this too. At this point, I hadn't the slightest clue what was what anymore. To our surprise, before good Nicole could run, the other Nicole grabbed the knife and slit her own throat with it. She died within a few agonizing seconds on my floor, blood spurting out the cut like a broken pipe, until the Nicole standing in the doorway switched face like she had been possessed. Her once wide-eyed, thousand-yard stare of terror was now the same lifeless and calculated expression of the one that tried to kill me. It was just long enough for her to say "See you tomorrow, then," before old Nicole came back and threw up on herself in fright. She tried to come to my aid, but my body was now losing the fight, and my vision began to fade to nothingness.

I write this now, a day later. After I had died, I was still there. All the motor functions in my body remained, but there was a time skip from the moment my vision blurred to when it returned, one where I found myself strung up in a tree. My body hung like a marionette whose limbs were tangled in the branches. After processing what I was seeing, and how I no longer had control of my body, I recognized where I was. Our campus was massive, and one of the many things that surrounded it was a public cemetery mostly unpopulated. I remember seeing a large sycamore tree there once, with a large trunk and sweeping leaves. It appears that that very tree was where my body was. 

As for what happened after that, I tried to move best I could to no avail. The sun eventually rose, and I was still not found. My body was wrapped around a branch so well the leaves covered most of it, save for my right hand. I saw students pass from afar on the other side of the gate, going about their day on their way to class. In my head, I was screaming at them to notice me, knowing it wouldn't work yet trying it anyway.

Around dinner time, roughly ten or so hours into this nightmare, I recognized myself carrying a textbook in hand. The sun was setting once more, and I made eye contact with myself, watching as I looked for a quiet place to study. It's not routine for me to study in graveyards, but this may have been an alternate timeline, so really anything goes. 

I watched as my other self settled for a spot directly under me, still not noticing me there. Now I was doing everything in my power to try and get her (me?) to notice me, to just look up for one fucking second. 

A half-hour in, I saw myself rise, looking ready to leave. I grew desperate, and by some stroke of luck, my body's weight shifted down the branch just a tad, causing the leaves around me to rustle. My double looked up and stared into the leaves, not yet seeing me there. After a minute, though, as her eyes fell directly on my hand, I could tell she finally noticed. 

She put a hand to her mouth, concealing a scream.

I wanted to warn her about Nicole. Instead, I lay there motionless, as I had been until I noticed the branch start to give way to my weight. It snapped suddenly and my body toppled to the floor with a gnarly thud. That's when my other me screamed aloud, jumping back in shock. 

She grabbed her phone and began to dial 911. Yes, that's smart, a hell of a lot smarter than what I did. This version of me was thankfully sober, meaning she could make better decisions. 

At some point, Nicole joined up with me as I heard sirens in the distance.

*"No!"* I screamed soundlessly. *"Get her away from you!"*

But Nicole only acted rationally - scared and confused - not at all like she planned to murder the other me. 

A policeman exited the car and walked up to the both of them, eyeing the grisly sight.

"I just...found her like this." The other me said, trembling. 

The officer approached me, took a good look at my face.

Then, he leaned into me, and suddenly his once professional face morphed into a sinister smirk. "Watch this," He whispered to me, and with horror I watched him stand back up, slipping the mask of normality back on once more.

"What's going on?" Nicole asked, looking to the cop for answers. 

"Ever heard of the ouroboros?" He asked, which confused both of them. "Snake that eats its own tail?" 

"Sir," The other me began. "I don't know what this has to do with-"

The cop retrieved his side pistol and emptied the chamber on the other me. Nicole screamed bloody murder, but the cop lost interest and turned back to me. The real me, the one he (or it, maybe) knew was listening. 

"You were supposed to die." It began with annoyance. "I was supposed to kill you. But somehow we both fucked up and now we're stuck in this loop.  You play the victim, I play the executioner, typically whoever is around that makes it easy to mimic."

It glanced over to the car, where a slumped body sat in the passenger. A body I could only assume was the actual cop. Maybe unconscious, maybe dead.

"Every time is the same shit." It huffs. "You keep finding the body from the last loop. People in your life keep pushing you in the direction of finding it, no matter how well I try to hide you. Your roommate leading you to the dumpster, your professor mentioning this secluded spot to study, it's never fucking ending!"

I wanted to reply but was obviously unable. By now Nicole had fled, maybe to get help, or maybe to remain uninvolved. At this point, if she did choose to escape, I couldn't blame her. I, however, was surprised I was still here for this conversation. That must have meant the other me was still alive, just barely hanging on. 

But the time I had was fleeting, and fast. I had to find some way to remember this mimic who keeps trying to kill me. Find some way to, if the next cycle wipes my memories, retain what is happening in hopes of having a chance. 

"One of these days, I'll be free of your filth," The mimic spat. "So I can finally go back to my old life. Picking up drunk girls outside of parties and slaughtering them."

That final sentence chilled me, and the mimic grinned. "That's how it all began, by the way," It chuckled. "I found you all alone after leaving some frat and decided to have fun. Only now it seems God is punishing me for not doing a good enough job. 

Nicole returned with some teachers, who froze in horror at the bodies. Some on-campus guards accompanied them, ready to fire. But the mimic simply gave me a knowing look, followed by a coy wave, and aimed the gun at his head. With one single pull, he fired, falling to the ground. Nicole rushed to my side as the guards called in for backup. The other me lay in her arms, staring at me as I watched the life fade from her eyes as it had mine. Except she was flicking them down to her hand, so I followed and found the phone in her hands.

Before I could make sense of her message, I woke up to my alarm in my bed. At this point, the cycle had continued just as I had feared before, and this version of me was blissfully unaware. I checked my notifications, seeing some Snaps, a few emails, and a notif alerting me to my limited storage space. I checked my album and found what was eating up the remaining space I had - a 2GB large video recording that spanned eight minutes.

Holy shit. Holy *fucking* shit.

The me from that last cycle recorded the entire thing. Somehow, someway, in all the universe-breaking, law-defying ways, there was a video on my phone where I could hear the mimic retell the entirety of what was happening to me, and it all came flooding back. Every single death flooded back to my mind, every vicious cycle relived. I always took turns as both the oblivious victim and the body afterward, forced to endure the suffering of knowing what was to come and unable to change it. There had been a total of 19 cycles, this being the 20th. The days progressed chronologically, each time the prior death being undone by the morning. I was so thankful the video idea even worked.

Now, as I write this, I have secluded myself entirely. I'm staying in my room, not risking any contact with anyone. I uploaded the video to a flash drive. If I survive tonight, I'll give it to the police, maybe try to see if there's a way out of this.

I just want this to finally end.
