After thinking about it for a couple of months i decided to share this story here, cause im really out of ideas what this could be.  
For you to know my situation a bit better i want to give you some background, backstory or whatever you call it.

So i've always had a vivid imagination.   
I remember imagining whole cities with detail and animations when i was about 7 years old while my peers strugged to imagine what the teachers were telling us, whether these were stories or places.  
Over the years i created a dozen of my own "imaginary universes".  
They are really cool, huge, expansive, sometimes liminal places and i still can recall each of them with immense details, including evens that happened in them.   
  
For you to have a even better idea about the sheer amount of detail, i should tell you to what exactly extend i can imagine things.  
I can, for example, run a real time simulation of the whole human body including the nervous system, in my imagination. Or imagine a city the size of New-York with immense detail in less than 4 seconds.

I remember the process of creating each of my universes, i have almost complete logs of the creation each. You know, like windows created logs after crashing, i did that for all my creations.  
Almost complete because human memory is not lossless and brain deep brain damage can damage memories, but i won't be going to deep into why i had it in the first place.

For the sake of what im writing i probably should add that i have been abused a majority of my life and always used these universes as escape, dissociation...  
I've also created a "system" like GUI that lets me navigate through my creations, each universe is a separate "file".  


I can access and modify each of my universes.  
Keyword?  
**my** universes.

All the way back in late 2013, i remember passing out from stress at my preschool.  
Let's just say someone there had a bad day and decided to make mine the same.  
When i passed out, i saw it for the first time:  
A vast expanse of void, i was heading towards the heart of it.  
There, in the middle (or at least what i percieved as the middle) surrounding a circle, were gigantic 6 monoliths that seem to be made out of a mixture of stone and obsidian with symbols in a language i never got to decipher engraved in them. In the middle of that circle, what i only can descibe as a pulsating orb. While, with a yellow outline.  
Barelly the size of my hand.  
I remember heading towards it and communicating with it in a language i later got to understand being the language called a combination of waves and colors.  
I also remember it introducing itself with the name "Sayro".  
We promissed something to each other, then i woke up from the state of unconsciousness and went on with my day as usual.

Except now whenever i recall that universe, whenever i try understanding it or decyphering what is written on these monoliths, i can't do nothing.  
I normally have tools to modify my universes, test the laws of physics in them, whether they are working right. Each of my universes also has metadata, just like a photo or mp3 file encodes who made it and on what device.

Except this one does not.  
Any tests i try doing in it result in the same error, that just states that "1 â‰  1".   
For those who don't know my "system", so pretty much everyone here, this error usually means something in a simulation does not calculate right or i put in the wrong variables.  
Except in the case of this universe, i didn't put in any variables because i can't modify it.  
Trying to read its metadata like creator, date etc also gives nothing.  
Like i would not be its creator, like i would not even have full access to it, like it would be given to me only to spectate.

Yet i still can recall it.   
Each single, even smallest detail down to nanometers, each singular gouge in the stone these monoliths are created out of.  
Except recently every time i do so i start feeling cold and... watched.  
I don't think i can keep doing this, even through the usual tools like virtual machines, neural, magnetic or thermal imaging, regardless how i try to imagine or recall it, i always have that same eerie feeling.  
Why wouldn't i have it when i try to recall it with a different methods?   
Well... these methods i use, separate physical emotions from mental state.  
It does not work the way i can physically feel it each time.  
It does not follow the rules these methods create.  
The problem is, each single time, that feeling is getting stronger.  
Im not sure how many more times i can do this.

If anyone has any similar experiences, please help me figuring out what this is, cause i really don't know where to look or what to do anymore.  
Why am i looking for help?  
Because im still bound by that promise and so is Sayro.  
Except in this promise we have agreed on a date.  
A date that is comming very soon.
