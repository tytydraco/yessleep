My brain feels fogged and empty as I blink my eyes open. I stare at the decorated ceiling with mental numbness trying to remember *anything.* Finally deciding to move, I shove the silk sheets over and step barefoot onto the wood floors, cuffs of my flowy pajama pants falling around my ankles. I shuffled my feet over to what looked like a wardrobe. It was only when I got closer that I noticed a note attached to the door,

***Adeliade, dress accordingly and meet Theo in the foyer 30 after 7. Cosmetics and jewels have been provided at the vanity.***

“Who’s Theo?” my tired voice croaked.

 I put the note in my pocket and tug the wardrobe doors open. Inside are several gowns of all colors. I pull out a red velvet dress with puffed sleeves and a square neckline. It fits like a glove. The cushioned chair squished as I sat at the vanity. I picked up a gold ring with a flower etched into it and slid it onto my finger. My blonde curls swung over my shoulder as I turned my head to see the time, the mystery ‘Theo’ will be waiting for me in a few minutes. Heels clicked on the floor as I walked over to the huge oak doors and admired the craftsmanship before pulling them open and peering down the large hall ahead of me. The red carpet along the floor was accompanied by paintings lining the walls and candelabras lighting the space. A crystal chandelier hung above my head as I descended the dual staircase down into the foyer.

“Adeliade?” a tall man turns his head to look at me, his dark hair falling into his eyes as he does,

“Yes, are you Theo?” I shoot him a questioning glance,

Just then, a sharp ring sounded., catching our attention. We both turned our heads as doors open to our left, a note appearing in my pocket,

***Take his arm and find a seat.***

I looked up to see Theo stashing something into his pocket, I guess he got one too. He glanced over at me and offered his arm. I took it and we moved cautiously into the room. People looked at us as we walked in, looking equally stressed. Everyone dressed in the same elegant attire, arm in arm with a partner. Nervous chatter went about the room as people sat around the grand table in the center. The tablecloths were embroidered with roses made of black thread that complimented the red spider lilies, mums and carnations that sat in delicate glass vases.

“They match your dress,” my attention was drawn back by the sound of Theo’s voice,

“I’m sorry?” I stuttered,

“The lilies, the color matches your dress,” he plucks one from its place in the bouquet and hands it to me, “maybe that should be your nickname, hmm Adelaide?”

“I suppose it would work.” It was strange, but he seemed friendly enough. Maybe that was exactly what I needed right now, a friend. A second bell rang through the air that stole everyone’s attention. Following everyone else, I reached into my pocket and produced a note that wasn’t there before,

***Buon’ appetite.***

I looked up from reading to see a meal displayed on my plate with a drink poured in a tall glass on my right. The bubbles danced through the pale liquid in a manner that was entrancing. I raised the fork to my lips and took a bite, it was the best thing I’ve tasted in my life. The drink tasted sweet yet sour and left a buzz humming through my body. The woman sitting next to me wore a black dress that had sleeves draping over her shoulders, while her partner conversed with the man across from him, she was left ignored. She must’ve been as confused as I was. I decided to be friendly and talk to her,

“I’m Adeliade, what’s your name?” I offered a smile. Short brunette hair swayed as she turned her head to look at me, red lips moving as she spoke,

“Julia. My name is Julia.” She spoke in a meek voice.

“Nice to meet you, your dress is beautiful,” I can’t think of anything else to say.

“Oh, thank you.”  She tugged at the back of her gold earring and stared at her plate before speaking again, “this is all so strange. Do you know what any of this is? I mean, the notes…and what about the eyes?”

“What?” My stomach drops as she begins to speak again,

“Well, this morning, I- “she was cut off by the loud young man next to her slamming his fist on the table and throwing his head back in laughter. His face was red with intoxication.

“Thomas please, I think you’ve had enough.” she sheepishly lectured, putting a hand on his arm. He slapped it away and glared at her.

“Who are you to stop me? We’ve only just met, get your hands off of me.” he said quite loudly, turning heads of those around the table. His quick snap of anger seemed alarming. Julia put her hands back in her lap and stared down. I tried to ask more about what she was saying before, but she just brushed it off. Plates had emptied by the time another bell went off. The doors to the foyer opened and we all funneled out. Arm in arm with Theo, I noticed the absence of body heat between us.

“Are you cold?” I asked him,

“Not really, are you?”

It had just occurred to me that I didn’t know. I couldn’t feel if I was cold or not. I brushed my arm with my free hand but felt no difference. Strange. All so strange.

“I don’t want to be here anymore.” I told him with mild fear in my voice,

“Me too. I don’t like this. Let’s try the door.” He had confidence about his voice that made me trust him.

Thomas reached the door before us, still red and tipsy.

“I want to get the hell out of here.” Thomas yanks at the brass door handle only for it to not budge. He yanks harder, nearly dislodging his shoulder but still the door doesn’t move.

“Is it locked?” someone asks from the small crowd,

“It doesn’t even have a lock!” he shouts back. Murmurs in the crowd started to get louder.

“Everyone calm down, I’m sure there’s an explanation for this.” Theo speaks up and grabs attention, “does anyone remember how you got here?”

The murmurs got louder again but stopped at once when a crack of thunder spread through the sky outside the windows, rain starting to beat on the roof and windowpanes. The voices of those around me started feeling distant as I slipped my hand into my pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. My hand shook slightly as I opened it,

***You need not know how you got here, Adelaide. Does one care where it was before the womb? Yet you live on life without trying to leave. Although, who knows what awaits one who does leave. Perhaps a blessing? Maybe a curse.***

I look up to see a chair flying across the room and smash against the window. Wood pieces fly in all directions, yet the glass remains intact. I tug at Theo’s sleeve and lean up to whisper in his ear,

“Can we talk for a moment?”

He looks at me then back at the chaos of the crowd. He adjusts his warm gaze back on me and nods. We sneak away from everything and under the dual staircase until we find a little door. We didn’t have to say anything before coming to the agreement that that’s where we’re going. I crack open the door and slip in, him following me. The room is small with books lining the walls and a red velvet sofa in the center. It would’ve been dark if it weren’t for candles everywhere.

“So what’s bothering you?” his soft voice from behind me sends a shiver up my spine. I turned around to face him and open the note again, handing it to him. He read it with a furrowed brow.

“What does that even mean?” he hands it back to me,

“I’m not sure, I just want out of this accursed mansion.”

“This note seems so… personal. I didn’t get one.”

The drum of rain on the single window became deafening for a moment. A tree branch outside clicked against the glass. I studied the shelves of books while Theo read the note over again. My eyes brushed over the book titles until one caught my eye. *The counting of crows.* One of my favorite poems. People have told me I’m superstitious, but I don’t think so. A single crow lands on the tree outside and caws. Theo sits on the couch. my eyes begin to wander again.

“No, NO WAIT!” He shouts in urgency causing me to turn to see what’s wrong. Gold dust floats in the air where the note once was. “It just vanished!” he tells me,

“What do you mean it just vanished?”

“I mean, it just,” he flares his hands out for dramatic effect, “vanished.”

The song of a grandfather clock chimed from outside the door. We look at each other with an alarmed expression. I feel a clump of paper in my enclosed hand.

***Bedtime.***

Theo rips up his note in frustration while blankly staring at the ground. “We’ll try again tomorrow, maybe there is another door to get out. Some hallway we haven’t been down before.” He looks up at me from his place on the couch before standing. I have to lift my chin to look him in the eyes. His voice softens, “Meet me back in here tomorrow, okay?”

I stare into my vanity mirror back in my room hours later, feeling dazed. I look down and twist the gold ring on my finger anxiously. I stand and walk over to the large wardrobe and tug open the doors. I carefully slip out of my dress and place it on its hanger before deciding on a night gown to wear. I wander over to the large windows in my room. They reached the ceiling and meet the floor, like a wall made of glass. The landscape outside was pitch-black, except for a tree that was made visible in flashes of lighting. Six crows sat waiting on the baren branches. I struggled to pull the drapes closed before shuffling my feet over to the large bed in the center of my room. The wood under my feet was uneven in places. My foot failed to glide over a loose floorboard, sending me crashing to the floor. Now on my hands and knees I crawled to the floorboard that had caused my fall. A slight gap showed a twinkle of light underneath. My fingers curled around the board and tore it away, revealing a small space. Now I know where the light was coming from as a small golden key sat waiting in dust. The head of the key had intricate carvings of flowers and other details that made it hard to look away. The pearls on my necklace went flying as I ripped it off my neck and slid the key onto the now empty chain. I put it on and finally cozied into bed, giddy to show Theo my discovery.

Gray sunlight peaked through the blinds that morning. I woke up in the earliest hours I could to see Theo. I didn’t bother changing out of my night-gown and just draped a robe over my shoulders. I gazed into the vanity one last time before leaving my room, the gold of the key matched the shine on my ring. The carpet was surprisingly soft through my stockings. I walked down the hall not taking my time, I was too busy thinking about what this key might lead to. My shoulder rammed into something that wasn’t there a second ago. I stumble and turn as Thomas glares at me.

“Why don’t you watch where you’re going?” he spit under his breath.

I huffed the blonde strands out of my face and stared back at him. He had a frightening demeanor to him the I couldn’t quite place. I noticed a peculiar bump sticking out from under his coat at his side. He followed my gaze and quickly turned away, walking further down the hall and turning out of sight. I walked down the stairs and found the little door. I opened the door slowly and stepped in. The room looked empty as I closed the door behind me,

“Good morning, Lillie,” a tired voice uttered my new nickname from the corner of the room,

“Good morning Theo!” I said with hushed excitement, “You’ll never guess what I found.” I held the key around my neck waiting for him to answer.

“Oh? What’s that?” he walked closer. I let the chain slip out of my closed hand to reveal the key.

“Where did you find this?” he said with a laugh of excitement, scooping me up in a hug. I was somewhat startled by the sudden embrace, but it was nice nevertheless. “We have to find what it goes to; it could be a way out!” he took my hand, and we ran out the room, racing down the first hall we saw.

So that’s what we did. For hours and hours we went down hallways that never seemed to end, doors that led to nowhere, windows with nothing but bricks behind them. It was all beginning to feel hopeless. After a while we had the sense to check our pockets. We never knew how the notes were there, we just… knew. I pulled out the crumpled parchment and read it,

***Time to go to your rooms and get ready for supper.***

I look up at Theo and find that we were no longer standing in the never-ending hall but standing back in the foyer.

“Be quick and meet back here, okay?” Theo breathed into my ear. Back in my room I grabbed the first dress I found, which happened to be white and flowy with lacey straps. I slipped on a pair of what looked like doll shoes. I ran back to the foyer as fast as I could to find that it wasn’t only Theo waiting down there. A small group of people stood around a yelling man, of course I already knew who it was.

“I have searched these halls left and right and there is NO ESCAPE!! But whatever curse that put us all here must’ve had pity on me, for THIS is what I found in my room last night!” The screaming Thomas held up a small revolver and put the tip to his temple.

“THOMAS DON’T!” Julia screeched as Theo lunged forward, pushing the gun away. But it wasn’t enough. A crack shot through the air, and it felt as though time itself froze. Thomas started yelling at Theo for interfering, but through all the commotion it was only until she started screaming that people noticed Julia staring at the blood on her hand. The hole it her side leaked crimson liquid onto the tiles. She slammed to the floor, dead. Notes started falling from the ceiling and walls along with the wallpaper itself.

***YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT.***  

Dust fell from the cracks rapidly forming in the ceiling. The chandelier swayed and with a snap fell, smashing to the floor. The cry of thirteen crows came from outside. The whole mansion was falling apart around us.

“Run!!” Theo grabbed my arm, and we started running as fast as we could. The walls crumbled all around us, revealing nothing but black emptiness. There were bodies that had fallen into the blackness to never be seen again, and people who fell victim to the rubble. Theo stops out of nowhere and directs my attention when I question. Infront of us was a dark wood door framed with gold. The gold had the same designs as the head of the key. We looked at each other and decided without a word. The key fits perfectly into the lock. I swung open the door and took a step inside. That was when I felt Theo’s hand slip from mine. I turn my head just in time to watch in horror as my best friend sink into oblivion as the floor caved out from under him. With his last breath he shoves me into the room and slam the door shut. The room is cold and silent, dulling the chaos outside. There’s a small table with a single candle and match. The flame illuminated the room brighter than expected. Walking in deeper I see that the room is filled with mirrors, only it’s the reflection that makes dread seep through my chest. The ghostly paleness of my skin and the gaping hole in my side peaked at my ribs. The blood dripping from my mouth had long dried. I stare into my milky eyes in pure horror before murky tears started pouring down my dry skin. A wrinkled note appeared in my hand,

***You finally found out; you have always been dead. There was never any escape. Welcome to forever.***

Screams filled the room. I didn’t realize they were mine until my throat started burning. Mirrors around crackle and shatter before things go black.

The buzz of fluorescents hummed through the air. I blink my eyes as the doctors try to explain. They say I was dead, that the surgery went wrong, and I had died for a few minutes. That nothing I had just went through wasn’t real. Even so, the gold ring on my finger remained.
