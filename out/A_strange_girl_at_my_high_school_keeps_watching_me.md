I will tell this story, but I am not the main character

Suzie is.

There were about three or four weeks left until my senior year of high school ended when I experienced the most terrifying night of my life.

My name is Carter. I was a senior at an ordinary high school in Ohio. I wasn’t very social, but I wasn’t completely withdrawn either. I was a member of the school’s art club. I had a few friends there, and overall, I was normal. My life moved in a repetitive cycle.

One school day, I stayed in the art classroom longer than usual. I was trying to finish a painting that mattered to me. When I focus while drawing, I barely notice anything around me. After class ended, I realized I had stayed about twenty extra minutes. I stood up, gathered my things, and got ready to leave.

That was the first moment I noticed her.

Suzie was sitting in the back row. I will never forget her stare. Her posture was always rigid, her hands hidden under the desk, sitting the same way every time. Her eyes were wide open, fixed on me from behind her large glasses. She always looked… different. Until that day, I hadn’t really paid attention to her.

She was barely around 5 feet tall. She dressed in bright, mismatched colors that made her look younger than her age, as if her mother still picked her clothes. Her hair was frizzy, unkempt, and always tied back. Her face constantly carried an expression of disgust—probably because of how her lips sat awkwardly over her large, protruding teeth.

I don’t want to judge her by her appearance. I’m just saying she looked strange.

We made eye contact. She didn’t look away. She kept staring until I grabbed my things and left the classroom. Even then, I could feel her eyes on me.

The next day, I was putting things into my locker. When I closed the door, she was there again, standing at the corner of the hallway. Watching me. It wasn’t frightening—just deeply unsettling. I forced myself to focus on something else and went to class.

I walked to the history room. Plenty of students were there, including Elena—the girl I liked. I greeted her. Elena was into art too, and she was genuinely sweet. We were friends, but I felt more than that. And I think she did too. We just hadn’t admitted it to each other.

I sat in an empty seat behind her. Less than a minute before class started, Suzie walked in. The first person she looked at was me. Then she started walking toward me.

She moved stiffly, like a robot, without swinging her arms. I thought she was about to say something, but she passed me and sat directly behind me. I didn’t turn around, but I could hear her take the seat.

The entire class, I couldn’t focus. I could feel her gaze burning into the back of my neck. When the bell rang, I practically fled the room.

It was lunchtime. I grabbed my food and sat down. A few minutes later, Elena joined me. While we were talking, she mentioned that the school wanted to create an awareness poster about environmental protection. She had volunteered for the project and asked if I wanted to join.

Of course I did.

We spent the rest of lunch discussing ideas. When we had to go to different classes, we said goodbye. As I walked to my classroom, I turned around to look at Elena one more time.

Guess who was there?

Suzie was walking right behind me. There was about twenty meters between us, but her pink shirt made her easy to spot. My head was full, so I brushed it off and went to class.

After school, I rode my bike home. When I arrived, I put it in the storage shed behind the house. As I was about to go inside, I saw Suzie walking past our house.

She was on foot. Breathing heavily. Sweat was pouring off her.

She looked at me. Then she kept walking.

A disturbing thought crossed my mind.

Had she run all the way behind me while I was riding my bike?

That was the moment she truly started to scare me.

The days at school continued normally—except for Suzie.

Elena and I kept meeting at lunch to talk about the project. But the encounters with Suzie that I had brushed off as “coincidences” started happening more frequently. Wherever I looked, she was there. Watching me.

Once, when I closed my locker, she was standing right next to me. The locker she was facing wasn’t even hers. She wasn’t doing anything—just staring at it. Then she turned to look at me.

When I walked away—more accurately, when I escaped—she didn’t follow. She just kept watching.

It was starting to seriously bother me.

We needed to come up with something creative for the environmental poster. Elena and I brainstormed during lunch and sometimes during art class, but school wasn’t the best place to focus. And Suzie’s icy stare behind those glasses didn’t help either.

So I invited Elena to my house to work.

One evening, Elena came over for dinner. She was polite and sweet, and my parents liked her immediately. After dinner, we went up to my room. We worked on the project and came up with what I’d say was a pretty solid idea. We even sketched it out.

We were also having fun. Laughing, joking. At one point, Elena cut out eyes and a nose from scrap paper, held it to her face, and shouted, “Boo!”

I lifted my head from the drawing—and my eyes widened in shock.

Suzie was staring at me through the second-floor window.

I stumbled backward in surprise. How was that even possible? Our house was detached, and beneath my window there should have been the roof of the front porch.

Had she climbed onto the roof?

Elena lowered the paper mask, laughing.  
“I didn’t think you’d get scared that badly.”

But I didn’t respond. I was frozen, staring at the window.

“Carter? Are you okay?”

Suzie was gone.

Then we heard a loud thud.

We both flinched. I looked outside, but there was no one there. She must have jumped and run. I heard my mom’s voice from downstairs asking my dad what the noise was. He said he’d check it out.

Elena and I went downstairs too. My mom was looking out the living room window while my dad scanned the yard with a flashlight.

I felt completely drained, like all the blood had left my body.

My dad came back inside and said he hadn’t found anything—probably a raccoon or something.

But I knew what it was.

Who it was.

Elena left before it got too late. I locked my window and went to bed. I barely slept.

This had gone beyond uncomfortable. It was harassment.

The next morning, when I saw Suzie at school—of course, staring at me again—I didn’t look away this time. I walked up to her. When I stood in front of her, her expression didn’t change. She just tilted her head up to look at me.

“Can I ask what you were doing outside my window last night?”

She didn’t answer. I assumed she was pretending not to understand, and I snapped.

“Look, I’ve caught you watching me for days. I saw you at my window last night. What is your problem with me?”

The only change in her posture was that she started biting her lip. When she finally spoke, her voice was much older than I expected.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

I laughed—but it was pure anger.

“So what, I’m crazy? If you keep this up, I’ll report you to the principal. Or the police. Stop before you get yourself into serious trouble.”

She didn’t respond. I didn’t give her the chance. I turned and walked away.

Surprisingly, it worked.

I didn’t see her for the next few days.

During that time, Elena and I spent a lot more time together. We even went out after school. Our closeness grew quickly. We finished the project and were proud of it. All that was left was to submit it.

We finished on Friday, so we planned to turn it in on Monday. We’d worked hard and deserved a reward.

My dad was into camping, and I had experience from going with him as a kid. I suggested a one-night camping trip. Elena liked nature, but the idea of staying overnight made her nervous. I told her we could camp close to the highway.

Just one night. Two friends having fun.

She agreed.

On Saturday, we packed our gear and went out. Like I said, we set the tent up near the road. As it got dark, I started a fire.

“You’re good at this,” she said when I lit it quickly.

“My dad taught me when I was little.”

There was a moment of silence.

“Have you camped before?” I asked.

“No. I usually like staying home at night. But this is nice. It’s fun with friends.”

Friends. She said the word a little strangely.

“Yeah,” I said. “Especially with people you really get along with.”

The fire crackled. That night, I finally felt ready to do something I’d been too afraid to do before.

“Elena… I think you’re the sweetest, most genuine person I’ve ever met. Sometimes it feels like you’re more than just a friend.”

She smiled. I leaned forward to kiss her.

She leaned in too.

Then a noise came from the bushes behind us.

“What was that?” she asked.

“I don’t know.”

It was too dark to see. I assumed it was a fox, but Elena was clearly scared. I grabbed the flashlight.

“I’ll check it out. Will that help?”

She nodded. I told her to stay put and walked away from the fire.

The darkness didn’t scare me—I’d walked around at night while camping with my dad before—but I felt cold. I kept glancing back at Elena. She was watching me too.

The firelight faded until it disappeared behind a tree.

I was about to turn back when I heard rustling behind me.

My heart nearly stopped.

I spun around.

“Elena, I told you—it’s just a fox—”

The fox ran off at the sound of a scream.

Elena’s scream.

I sprinted back. She was gone. The fire was out. The forest was lit only by my flashlight.

I shouted her name. No response.

Something hit my back.

I turned. A rock lay on the ground.

Another one hit my chest.

I lifted the flashlight. Nothing but trees.

The next rock hit my head. Pain exploded, and my ear started bleeding. I got dizzy.

This wasn’t a prank.

And I knew who it was.

I ran.

The road was less than a hundred meters away.

Then I collapsed, screaming in pain.

My flashlight flew from my hand. I tried crawling toward it, but I couldn’t move my right leg.

When my eyes adjusted, I saw it.

A bear trap.

A bear trap—this close to a highway?

Unless it wasn’t meant for a bear.

Footsteps approached. 

Suzie stepped into the faint light. I couldn’t run. I could barely think. I felt the syringe pierce my skin.

Then everything went dark.

I woke up inside a wooden cabin.

I looked down at my leg. The wound was closed—stitched, even. I was sitting on the floor, leaning against a wall. When I tried to move, it felt like every limb weighed a ton. The wooden floor creaked as someone walked nearby.

Suzie stepped into view.

She spread something like a plastic sheet on the floor, then grabbed my arms and dragged me onto it. I couldn’t resist. Whatever she had injected me with left me partially paralyzed. She pulled me across the floor toward what looked like a basement entrance with steep stairs.

As she dragged me down, I tried to protect my head, but with every step, the back of my skull slammed into the ground. My already blurry vision worsened. She dropped me onto something like a gurney, as if I were a sack of grain.

Then I blacked out again. She must have given me another dose.

When I woke up, my mind was clearer.

My hands and feet were strapped down, tied to the sides of the gurney. I pulled and strained, but it barely helped. I forced myself upright into a sitting position.

What I saw around me was beyond horrifying.

You know how people mount deer or bear heads on walls?

Imagine the human version of that.

Some were on the walls. Others were on the floor. Entire bodies—or parts of them. Limbs. Torsos.

God… even describing it is awful.

Children. Teenagers. Elderly. Women. Men.

So many bodies.

Their faces were unbearable. Sunken, yellowed eye sockets. Dry lips. Skin tinted somewhere between yellow and brown. Some of them even had expressions—smiling, frowning, looking shocked.

When I turned my head, it got worse.

That must have been where the “work” happened.

The heavy chemical smell filling the room suddenly made sense. Large white containers stood around the room, labeled with words like borax, formaldehyde, and other chemicals I couldn’t even pronounce. There were boxes filled with stuffing—fiberglass or cotton-like material. Surgical tools everywhere, stained with dried blood.

Human parts.

I leaned as far as the restraints allowed and vomited onto the floor.

Suzie was a psychopath.

The girl I passed in the school hallways every day—the one whose worst trait I’d noticed was her stare.

As panic tightened my chest, my breathing became rapid. My eyes watered. The chemicals burned my lungs. I pulled harder against the straps.

That was when the basement door opened.

Fresh air. Coolness. Sunlight.

And Suzie.

She descended slowly. She wasn’t looking at me. She walked behind me, and from the metallic sounds, I could tell she was handling surgical tools.

It was stupid, but I tried talking to her.

“Suzie?”

No answer.

“Suzie, what are you doing?”

She ignored every question—until I asked one.

“Who are they?”

“They’re my friends. My family.”

Her voice sounded just as old and thin as before.

“Friends? Did you kill them?”

“I didn’t kill them. I made them immortal.”

“What are you talking about?”

I was shaking uncontrollably.

“They’ll stay with me forever. Here. With me.”

She rolled over a metal tray filled with surgical instruments.

I screamed at her. I cursed her. It wasn’t smart, but the faces, the bodies—I couldn’t stop myself.

She said she did it because she loved them.

“I love them, Carter. I never want them to leave me. In Egypt, people mummified their loved ones. In India, they kept their ashes. This is the same.”

“No, it’s not! They did that to honor the dead. You’re killing people!”

“I can’t wait for them to grow old. I need them young—how I knew them. How I loved them.”

“This is slaughter.”

“This is love.”

She stood in front of me, smiling softly.

“You believe this?” I asked.

“I believe it.”

“Are you going to do the same thing to me?”

“I love you too, Carter. You remind me of Dennis—the boy I liked in high school.”

“Your… high school?”

“I was your age back then.”

Something clicked.

Behind me, I heard liquids being mixed. The chemical smell intensified.

“You’re not eighteen, are you?”

She laughed.

“I stopped counting. But it’s been over fifteen years since then.”

That explained her voice. Her clothes.

“I never even got to date him. He moved away before graduation. I missed him so much.”

She looked at me with something disturbingly close to affection.

“Now we’re together again.”

Before I could react, she grabbed my hair and kissed me.

Her mouth was foul. I wiped my lips on my shoulder.

She forced me back down and strapped another belt across my shoulders.

“Suzie, stop. I’m not him. None of this is love. You need help.”

“I’m not Suzie.”

I looked at her more closely.

The wrinkles on her hands. Beneath her eyes. The glasses hid them well.

“Suzie was Dennis’s girlfriend,” she said, pointing to the corner of the room. “That girl in the skirt over there.”

I saw it.

A mannequin-like body. Standing upright. Angry expression. Bulging yellow eyes.

My stomach turned.

“I’ll put you near her,” she said. “But not too close.”

She laughed—an ugly, broken sound.

This room wasn’t what scared me most.

Her mind was.

She turned away and turned on music—old-school hip hop from the 80s.

“Dennis loved this song. Do you?”

I focused on my right hand.

The strap was loosening.

My body was shaking too badly to stay calm. When she turned back holding a scalpel, fear completely took over. I screamed, begged, thrashed.

The strap snapped.

I punched her.

She fell back into the tray. While she was stunned, I freed the other restraints. When I tried to stand, my injured leg buckled and I collapsed.

She was already getting back up.

I grabbed a severed arm and threw it at her face.

It hit harder than I expected. Her glasses shattered. She screamed as a container labeled formaldehyde tipped over. The liquid spilled beneath her feet. She slipped and fell into it.

I watched her hands begin to crack. The liquid was hardening her skin. She struggled but couldn’t get up. I crawled toward the stairs.

Behind me, I heard movement.

I turned.

She was standing.

She picked up the scalpel.

If she reached me, she would kill me.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out my lighter—the one I carried for camping.

I lit it.

And threw it at her.

I didn’t wait to see what happened.

I dragged myself up the stairs and out of the cabin, half-crawling, half-running.

I knew the forest well. The cabin wasn’t far from civilization—maybe a few kilometers. Still, with a ruined leg, it was torture.

I cried through the last hundred meters.

There were police officers at our campsite. When they saw me, they looked like they’d seen a ghost. 

I was taken to the hospital. My family arrived. My leg was treated.

When I was moved to my room, I saw a face I was unbelievably relieved to see.

Elena.

I thought the woman had killed her. She hadn’t. Just knocked her unconscious.

Elena woke up near the campsite around dawn, walked to the road, and got help. She told the police about the attack and said I was missing. They had started searching about an hour before I escaped.

They would have found me eventually.

But by then, I would probably have been another stuffed addition to Suzie’s collection.

They found the house.

It hadn’t burned completely. Inside, they discovered numerous bodies—people reported missing or murdered over the years. At least the ones that hadn’t burned.

But they never found Suzie’s body.

I told them I’d thrown a lighter at her. She should have burned to ash.

They said the search would continue.

When they investigated her further, her past was even worse than what she’d told me.

The name Suzie Sorman belonged to a high school student who disappeared in Texas in 1998. Her real name was Marta Grimwald.

She was thirty-eight years old.

Suzie, Marta, Dennis—they’d all been in the same class. Dennis moved away after his girlfriend’s death. His family left Texas shortly after the murder. Marta’s school closed soon after.

They found dozens of fake IDs in the unburned part of the house. Some of the names matched people connected to missing persons cases.

Marta had traveled across the United States, committing murders. She stored the bodies in hotel rooms, rented cold storage units, anywhere she could.

She came to Ohio in 2013. Bought the cabin with cash—far above market value. The police never figured out where her money came from, but they suspected theft.

She stayed here.

In this town.

The school was investigated too. Marta had enrolled in five other high schools in Ohio before ours, always leaving before the year ended.

Six schools were investigated.

The fact that a serial killer had infiltrated high schools so easily caused nationwide outrage. Security protocols were tightened across the country. I’m not entirely sure, but I think my school shut down after I graduated.

This all happened a long time ago. I finished college. I got married two months ago.

Guess to whom.

Elena.

What we went through bonded us in a way nothing else could. We never went camping again—but we stayed together. Same university. Graduation. Marriage.

We’re happy.

There’s just one thing that still bothers me.

Marta.

They never found her body.

If she didn’t die, she never came back for me.

Maybe she retired.

I just hope she never decides to return—for revenge.

Especially after I burned her entire collection.
