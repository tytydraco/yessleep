(Please read the first part so you're all caught up! Thank you for reading BTW!!) 

First of all, thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. I also asked a few friends of mine for advice and started looking into the local history of the suburb, the school and the woods behind my school. I didn’t find much, just old accounts of the area being used for hunting and some vague references to strange disappearances years ago. Nothing that could explain what the kids have been talking about, which was no surprise to me. However, that didn’t stop the stories from getting worse.

 Yesterday, after hearing the whistling story from a particularly disturbed child, Evan (the one who mentioned the man in my last post), I decided to stay late at the school. The kid was still upset, and I felt responsible. I figured I could talk to him again, calm him down, reassure him. Maybe I could figure out what was going on.

As I walked to my car that evening, just as I passed the edge of the playground, I heard it again. The whistling.
I froze. The sound wasn’t distant this time. It was close. Too close. It wasn’t just some random wind. The rhythm was familiar—almost like a lullaby. The tune was soft, like someone trying to stay hidden.

I turned around, but the playground was empty, again. The air felt thick, suffocating almost. My heart began to race, but I tried to shake it off. I told myself I was being ridiculous. I was just hearing things. Maybe the wind was playing tricks on me, though I couldn't help but have a hand by my side as I had recently been taking a firearm with me after my last whistling experience. There was nothing at all, but I still took out the gun.

I could have sworn it was coming from behind the trees. I didn’t want to, but I found myself walking toward the edge of the woods. I stopped myself before I could go too far. That’s when I realized that I’d been walking toward the sound without even thinking about it. Like I was being pulled. I rested my weapon in my pocket again and left in my car, eyes glued to the mirror.

Yesterday, one of the teachers came to me, worried about a new development. She said one of her students had gone missing for nearly an hour during recess. They eventually found her sitting in the woods near the back of the property, behind the gates in the parking lot, where the woods met the concrete. 

When the girl was questioned, she said she’d heard the whistling. She described it just like the other kids had—faint but persistent, pulling her toward the trees. The thing is, she had never been in those woods before, or interested in them at all. We don’t allow the students near the fence or the wooded area for safeguarding reasons.

 Somehow, she had climbed the fence triple her size and gotten to the other side without a single bruise or sign of hurting herself or damage to the fence. 
I tried to brush it off, but when I spoke to her, I could see the fear in her eyes. She looked like she had seen something that had changed her. Something that was beyond a simple imagination or nightmare.

Their parents were understandably upset, and I had to assure them that there was nothing to worry about. But I could see the doubt in their eyes. 

 Last night, I couldn’t sleep. The whistling wouldn’t stop. It seemed to be coming from everywhere—outside my window, behind the walls, swirling around in my thoughts. It was maddening. I tried to ignore it. Told myself I was imagining things. But when I opened the curtains and looked out into the yard, I saw someone standing in the dark.

A figure. Tall. Still.

I couldn’t see their face—just a silhouette against the dim light of the streetlamp. And they were whistling. Softly, like the wind had carried it all the way to my house.
I didn’t know what to do. I stayed there frozen, staring out the window, feeling like something was watching me. I should have called the police. I should’ve done something. But I didn’t.

After what felt like an eternity, the figure simply disappeared. That is the only way I can say it. I blinked and it was like nothing was happening, but I could still hear the damn whistling… 

That damn whistling. 

 I don’t know what’s happening to me. I feel like I’m unraveling. At the school, it’s only getting worse. More and more kids have started talking about the man. There are whispers in the halls, rumors circulating between classrooms. Some of the parents have even called in to complain that their kids are afraid to leave the house because of the man in the woods. I heard one child talking about nightmares they have been experiencing, of them being shot by the man, they describe the pain in detail they shouldn't be able to articulate. 

I haven’t told a lot of people about what’s been happening. I don’t want to seem like I’m overreacting, or mentally ill from seeing a man disappear that night. But every time I see one of the kids, I feel like I’m being watched. Not just by them but by something else. Something I can’t explain.

There’s something I’m starting to notice, too. It’s hard to say for sure, but I feel like the man is getting closer. The whistling isn’t just outside anymore—it’s in my mind, echoing through my thoughts when I close my eyes. It’s like the man is speaking to me directly, whispering in my ear, calling me closer.

And it’s the most unsettling thing. I can’t help it. I have this impulse to follow the sound, to go into the woods, to see who this man is.

 I can’t stop thinking about the woods now. I’ve decided I have to go out there. I’m not sure why, but I know I need to. I need to figure out who or what is causing all of this. I’ll let you all know what happens. I might not be able to update for a while, but I’ll come back and tell you everything.

I don’t know why I feel so drawn to it. But the closer I get to the woods, the more I feel like I’m on the edge of understanding something terrible.
I’ll check in soon.
