As I flip through the pages, a strange realization dawns—these aren’t just random journal entries. They’re conversations. The handwriting shifts subtly, switching between questions and answers, like a ghostly dialogue frozen in time. A chill runs down my spine as I read their words—cold, distant, almost haunting.  

It seems to be between two people, probably a husband and wife. One asks simple questions—“Can you do the dishes?” or “We have a mole problem in the backyard”—and the other responds, their handwriting noticeably different. Some entries are just casual: “How are you today?” or “Did you sleep well?”  

My skin prickles. What is going on here? Why aren’t they talking directly? Could they have some kind of disability? Or is there something else beneath these mundane words?  

The strange mechanisms under the stairs flicker in my mind again. I close the diary firmly and rush downstairs to grab another.

“Are all of them like this?” I ask myself. I crack open the other diary and flip to the very first page. Maybe I’ll find an answer there. Here’s what I read:

*“We can’t talk anymore.”*

*“Why?”*

*“Because it’s learning our voice. The more we talk, the more it listens, the more it sounds like me and you.”*

*“What do we do now? Samson is already gone. Did it get him?”*

*“I don’t know. I heard barking last night, but it sounded… off. We need to keep quiet and make sure it doesn’t get in.”*

*“What if it does again? It’s silent when it walks.”*

*“I’ll figure something out so we can hear it coming.”*

Suddenly, the front door swings open with a creak. I jump, yelping and tumbling off the couch in a panic. Heart pounding, I gasp for breath.  

It’s Tommy, grinning as he steps inside, waving casually. “Hey, I’m home,” he calls, then shuts the door behind him.  

I stare at the clock—9:34 PM. My hands tremble as I try to process what just happened, the adrenaline still coursing through me.

“You’re late,” I mutter, my heart pounding in my chest.  

Tommy, grinning ear to ear. “We stayed late for the fireworks! You should’ve been there, it was awesome!”  

I glance up the stairs, hoping to see Mom come down—maybe she’d greet him—but the house remains silent. No sign of her.

“Yeah, I wish I was there, buddy,” I say softly, rubbing his back as he heads upstairs.  

I lock the door behind him, the click echoing unnaturally loud. I sink onto my bed, trembling. What did I just read? Is this some sick trick the previous owners played?  I clutch my pillow, heart racing. Maybe the previous owners really did have to leave this house and left nothing behind, or something worse happened to them. 

It all makes sense now. I heard that voice the first time when I found Tommy’s pin—distorted, almost like a broken recording. Then Tommy said he heard me call him to the barn. Was that voice distorted too? Or had it been listening—long enough to imitate me?  

My stomach knots. If it can mimic us, what else is it capable of?

Then it hits me—Samson. The name scrawled on the old dog house and the dog mentioned in the diary. The voice we heard calling during catch—it was calling for Samson. The previous owner's dog… that wasn’t just a story. The thing was mimicking them. It was pretending to be someone from the past, someone who knew this house—and us.

How do I tell Mom? She’ll think I’ve lost it—think I’m crazy. No, I’ll have to show her the evidence tomorrow. But tonight, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not alone in this house. Something is still watching.



The moment I wake, my first instinct is to sprint to Mom’s room. But it’s empty. My stomach clenches. I check Tommy’s room next—he’s there, absorbed in Roblox on my phone, oblivious to the world. 

“Where’s Mom?!” I shout, voice trembling.  

Tommy barely looks up, still focused on the screen. “She left about an hour ago,” he says casually.  

My eyes darted to the clock on the wall—1:02 PM. I blink, feeling disoriented. Had I really slept that long? From all the fear last night?  

I rub my eyes, voice cracking. “When is she coming back?”  

Tommy shrugs. “Dunno. Out with a friend,” he mumbles. 

A strange feeling creeps in—something about that “friend” doesn’t sit right. I shouldn’t jump to conclusions, but it’s hard not to.  

I open his window, trying to air out the stale, damp smell. “It smells in here,” I mutter, wrinkling my nose.  

After dressing, I shuffle downstairs, eyes fixed on the diary sitting untouched on the table. My stomach twists—part curiosity, part dread—before I reach out and pick it up. Reluctantly, I flip open to where I left off.  

The new entries are eerily the same as before—disjointed questions, scattered like snippets of a broken conversation. I guess they just grabbed whatever diary was closest.

Near the end, the writing just stops—no last words, no instructions, no explanation. Just blank pages where the words once were, like whatever was writing had simply vanished.  

I shake my head, trying to dismiss the unease. “In every horror movie, there’s always a secret diary with instructions on how to kill this thing,” I mumble, voice laced with irony and fear.

I rummage through the basement, searching desperately for anything the previous owners might have left behind—anything that could tell me how to stop this thing. But the shelves are empty, the boxes hold only dust and old junk. This isn’t the movies. There’s no secret manual, no hidden trap. Just silence.

I try to breathe, to tell myself I’m overreacting—that it’s just my mind playing tricks. But doubt gnaws at me. What if it’s real? What if that thing is out there, copying my voice, waiting for the right moment? My hands tremble as I look around, trying to find a plan, any plan. 

Mom’s on her date, oblivious, lost in her own world—still hung up on that affair from nine years ago, as if none of this is happening. She’s planning to leave us here, out in the open—me, Tommy, and the possible monster that copies my voice, waiting in the shadows. The thought gnaws at me, a terrible certainty.  

Dad always kept a shotgun hidden under the couch—an old, rusty thing, but better than nothing. Mom, on the other hand, has no weapons, no defenses. Just us, trembling in this house, waiting for whatever comes next.

“The barn!” I shout, desperation rising in my voice.  

I dash outside, heart pounding, and circle the house. Passing the old dog house, I stop for a moment, reading the faded name again—Samson. Sorry, boy. You were the best of dogs, protecting your mom and dad.  

I continue and see the leaning tower of barn. I rush inside and head straight to the tool shelf. I sift through all the dust and straw, looking for a tool that isn’t rusted through.  

I glance at the wall and see a pitchfork hanging there. I grab it, testing how sturdy it is.  

Then I hear a rustling in the first horse stall.  

“Tommy, we’ve already done this,” I mutter, stepping cautiously toward the stall door.  

No answer. Just silence—like before. I force myself to stay calm, reminding myself not to jump this time. 

I peek through the cracks and freeze. An eye stares right back at me—pale, unblinking, unsettling. 

I sigh in relief and lean back. “Tommy, dude, this is pro—”  

My words die in my throat as I hear the sound of Roblox coming from his room. I had opened his window earlier.  

My blood turns to ice. The hair on my arms stands up. Someone—or something—is here with me.

I freeze, my muscles locking as I slowly back away. The wet straw beneath my shoes squelches with every step, sticky and cold. Clutching the rusted pitchfork in front of me, I inch toward the barn door, each movement trembling with dread. 

The voice whispers, “What… a dump,” mimicking Dad. A cold numbness spreads through my legs, and fear tightens around my chest.

Suddenly, a bark erupts—sharp, frantic, like a dog—like Samson. But then, the bark shifts—becoming a growl, guttural and feral. I hear a faint whimper, the desperate, pained sound he made as he was being attacked. My stomach churns as the sounds bleed together, a nightmare echoing inside my head.

Suddenly, the stall door bursts open with a loud crack, sending a cloud of dust into the air. My eyes widen in horror as the creature steps into the dim light, its limbs jerking unnaturally. I try to run, but the wet straw flies beneath me, knocking me to my feet.  

I roll onto my back and see the creature in the stall—slowly making his way towards me. The creature crouched on all fours, its elongated limbs bending in unsettling angles. Its skin was a sickly pallid tone, nearly translucent, veins visible beneath like tangled cords pulsing faintly in the dim light. The limbs twisted and bent at grotesque angles, joints clicking with unnerving precision—each movement jerky and unnatural. It moved with a disturbing, almost insectile gait, limbs folding and unfolding in ways that made my stomach churn and my skin crawl. Every step was a grotesque dance—an abomination that defied nature, a nightmare made flesh. It moved with a disturbing silence, as if it was waiting for me to make the wrong move. 

My breath comes ragged, cold sweat slicking my brow. Fear grips me—what’s going to happen now? I can’t let this thing get the better of me, not here. I look beside me and grab the aging pitchfork.  

The creature lunges with jerky, unnatural movements, its pale skin shimmering in the dim light. My heart pounds as I thrust the rusted pitchfork forward, the prongs sinking into its squirming flesh. The creature’s roar erupted like a twisted symphony—one voice, yet a chorus of countless others, all coming from its gaping jaw. The sound was a maddening blend of screams, whispers, and cries, overlapping that sent a shiver down my spine. It was as if the voices of everyone it had ever taken—muffled and distorted—were speaking through one terrible mouth. Their screams reverberated inside me, a chorus of lost souls crying out in unison, begging for release. The sound was deafening, a haunting reminder that this beast was a vessel of the dead, a living grave echoing with the voices it had claimed.

The prongs snap, and the creature reels back, collapsing into the shadows. Heart pounding, I scramble to my feet and bolt out of the barn.  

Through the open window, I catch sight of Tommy—he’s looking out, confusion and concern etched across his face, wondering what that scream was.

I rush to the back door, but it’s locked tight. Glancing around, I see the limping creature hobble toward the woods. Its run isn’t like a horse’s gallop or a dog’s sprint—it's more like a spider, impossibly fast, skittering across the ground with unnatural speed. It’s about 5'5" tall when upright, but as it moves, it drops low—closer to 2'5"—crawling on all fours, almost like it’s skimming across the ground.

A cold sweat broke out on my forehead as terror clenched my chest. My knees shook, and I felt like the house itself was closing in around me. Tommy’s wide eyes mirrored my panic, his small face pale with fear. We were both trapped in a nightmare we couldn't wake up from. I run to the front of the house and lock the front door. Now I understand why the back door has three locks.



I rush inside and slam the door shut behind me, quickly locking it. Without hesitation, I toss the recliner in front of the door as a makeshift barrier, my hands trembling. My mind races—what should I do? Did I kill the mimic? It’s badly hurt, I think.  

Mom took the only car to go out on her date, leaving Tommy and me here with this monstrosity lurking somewhere outside.  

“Johnathan?” Tommy’s voice trembles through the door. I ignore him, panic clawing at my chest. I double-check the back door, ensuring all three locks are secure. I press my ear against the wood, trying to hear anything—silence. Deafening silence.  

“Johnathan?!” Tommy calls again, voice shaky.  

“Yeah, Tommy!?” I shout back, trying to keep my voice steady.  

“What was that thing? Where’s Mom?” His words are thick with tears. I want to yell at him, to scream that everything’s going to be okay, but I remember he’s only eight. I can’t scare him more.  

I dash upstairs.  

*Pop-chink! Pop-chink! Pop-chink!*  

“Stay up here, buddy. Everything’s okay. All the doors are locked,” I say, voice strained. I pull the curtains, blocking his view outside.  

“Mom’s on her way. She should be back soon,” I add, though doubt gnaws at me. I glance at the clock—it’s only 2:43 PM. I cling to the hope that she’s coming home any minute now.

We stay in Tommy’s room together for hours, the darkness creeping in outside. Suddenly, we hear the door trying to be forced open.  

“What is this?! Johnathan! Come here and open this door!” Mom’s voice yells, frantic and loud.  

I leap downstairs, quickly moving the recliner aside. I pull Mom inside the room and slam the door shut behind her, locking it tightly.  

“What are you doing?!” she demands, eyes wide with confusion.  

“Something’s out there!” I shout, voice trembling. “It almost killed me in the barn! Tommy saw it too!”  

We both look up to see Tommy at the top of the stairs, his face streaked with tears, trembling.  

For half an hour, I show Mom the trip wire trap under the stairs, the diary, and recount everything—what almost got me, what we saw.  

Finally, she comes to a conclusion.  

“A bear,” she says dismissively.  

We frantically beg her, telling her it’s not a natural animal—that it sounded like Dad, a dog, and the voices of its victims.  

She brushes us off, her tone condescending. “You’re scared. Fear makes you see and hear things that aren’t there.”  

I feel my stomach twist. “I’m sorry I left for so long,” she adds, in a tone that feels patronizing. “You guys were probably terrified.”  

Tommy and I sit in silence, exhausted and hopeless. What’s the point of arguing? She doesn’t believe us anyway.

“Tommy, dude—” a voice says from outside, in an annoyingly familiar tone.  

Everyone falls silent. No words, no movement—what feels like an eternity passes. Then another voice echoes from somewhere else around the house.  

“C’mon, boys! Let’s see your new rooms!” It sounds exactly like Mom—no scratchy tone, no distortion. That was the first thing she said when we got out of the car. It’s been listening, watching, from the very beginning.  

I stare into Mom’s eyes. They sink, hollow, as if her mind is slipping away. Her breathing becomes frantic, ragged, and Tommy starts to cry.  

“Mommy, I don’t wanna die!” Tommy shouts, clinging to her. I hush him, trying to quiet his trembling voice.  

Tommy hugs her tightly, but I see it—her face is not filled with reassurance. It’s fear. Pure, raw terror.  

“Can we leave?” I ask, voice trembling.  

She hesitates, then says, “No, I think we’re safe here. The doors are locked.”  

I breathe heavily, pacing in circles, trying to stay calm. I pull back the curtains, desperate to see if I can catch a glimpse of the mimic.  

It’s too dark to see much. I glance toward the barn—the place where I first encountered it. The memory makes me cringe, stomach twisting at the roar I heard, the sight of that monstrous form. The thought of it still makes me sick.

Just as I was about to pull back the curtains, I saw it—there, in the shadows. It was walking slowly on its four spindly legs, eerily deliberate. I follow as it stands tall, taking its time, playing with its food. The mimic drifts toward the edge of the woods, but suddenly, the sound of a car door slamming shut interrupts it. Instantly, it skitters across the ground with unnatural speed, heading straight toward the front of the house. I gasp, turning around sharply.  

“Dad!” I shout, voice trembling.  

“So, Mommy went to see an old friend, did she?” Dad’s muffled voice booms from outside.  

Mom immediately leaps to her feet and yells, “John, please! Get in your car and leave now!”  

“Fucking cheating bitch!” he rages, voice thick with fury. “I knew you fucked Devon nine years ago! You lying cunt!”  

His scream echoes through the woods, and I can almost hear the spit flying as he yells from outside. He tries to open the door, but it’s locked.  

“What are you hiding from?!” he roars. “You fucking cunt, I’m gonna kill you!”  

I grab Tommy and cover his ears, desperate to shield him from his dad’s rage.  

“John, please!” Mom pleads, voice trembling.  

“Tommy told me all about this ‘friend’ nine years ago,” Dad yells, pounding his body against the front door.  

I sprint to my bedroom, peering out the front window. I scan the yard—no sign of the mimic. It’s too dark to see much.  

Dad suddenly halts, turns back toward his car, and I breathe a small relief—he’s leaving. But then I see him reach into the back seat of his battered Chevy and pull out a Model 1911 shotgun—the one he’d hidden under the couch.  

“Dad! Please, stop!” I shout, voice cracking.  

He doesn’t listen. His eyes meet mine with a cold, unfamiliar stare. He cocks the gun.  

BAM! The gunshot rings louder than I expected, and I fall back, stunned.  

Downstairs, I hear frantic movement and the faint chirping of crickets through the hole in the door.  

“Bitch!” Dad yells as he pushes the door open with brute force.  

“You took my son! The one I loved was taken from me because you’re a fucking whore!” His voice echoes through the house.  

*Pop-chink!*  

“I don’t care anymore!”  

*Pop-chink!*  

“You took everything from me!”  

*Pop-chink!*  

“I will take everything from you, you cunt!”  

He pauses at the top of the stairs, deciding which door to go through.  

I leap out of my room into the long hallway, heart pounding.  

“Please, Dad, don’t!” I beg, voice trembling.  

“What room, Johnathan?! Do something good for once. What. Room.” he roars, fury blazing in his eyes.

*Pop-chink!* The furious rage suddenly halts in an instant. Dad’s eyes snap from murder to pure fear.  

*Pop-chink!* He looks down, then slowly begins to turn around.  

*Pop-chink!* He screams—a guttural, agonized scream—and raises the shotgun, aiming it down the stairs. I can’t see past his massive body blocking the hallway.  

BAM! The blast rings deafening in my ears. I drop to my knees, hands over my head, overwhelmed by the sound. When I look up, I see a translucent leg swipe Dad off his feet, sending him tumbling onto the ground. His shotgun skitters away and lands near Mom’s bedroom door.  

He screams in pain—probably pierced by the mimic’s grotesque limb—as it drags him downstairs. *Pop-chink! Pop-chink! Pop-chink!* The monster lets out a roar—an unholy chorus of countless screams, all blending into a maddening song from its gaping jaw. It’s like earlier, a terrifying, unending scream that makes me nauseous.  

I stumble to the end of the hall and peer down the stairs. The mimic stands over Dad—blood streaks down the staircase, pooling onto the floorboards. It’s motionless, drool dripping onto him, pooling onto the wood beneath.  

Dad whimpers, facing death. The creature leans closer, and in Dad’s own voice, it whispers, "You bitch."  

Then, it attaches onto his face, tearing flesh and devouring him—an unthinkable nightmare come to life.  

I gag and silently slip into Tommy’s room, where I see Mom holding him close, both covering his ears. My chest tightens—fear and helplessness threaten to crush me. I force myself to stop and back out into the hallway. I reach for the shotgun—Dad never let me shoot it before, I’ve never even touched it. My hands tremble as I slowly close the door, trying not to make a sound. I turn around, feeling like I might collapse from the sheer terror pounding through me. But that won’t save us now.

What should I do? I have a sinking feeling that the previous owners of this house had a similar fate. Giving up isn’t an option. Mom and Tommy are still with me, and I can’t let them down.

We sit in silence, the muffled sounds of the mimic devouring Dad echoing through the house. Mom’s eyes drift downward, and a single tear slips down her cheek. She kisses Tommy on the head, then stands up—determined.

I softly call out, “Mom, don’t,” but she doesn’t listen. She’s resolute in leaving.  

“We need to stay here until it leaves in the morning,” I plead.  

“No,” she replies quietly, “I’ll let it chase me.”  

“Mom!” I whisper urgently. “Don’t. Dad’s car is still running. If we throw something out the window, maybe it’ll go outside after it—chase the noise.”  

She hesitates, torn between her fear of dying and protecting us. But she nods, slowly.  

I carefully open the window and grab the closest thing—my phone, and toss it out into the yard. It clunks against the wooden barn, loud enough to catch the mimic’s attention.  

Suddenly, it stops devouring Dad and rustles out of the house, onto the front porch, then into the grass, drawn by the noise.

“We need to go now!” I whisper urgently. We all stand up, moving quietly. Carefully, we crack open the door to check if the coast is clear. I peek out, and a foul stench hits me—something rotten, unlike anything I’ve smelled before.

I tiptoe to the edge of the stairs, and my stomach tightens. There, sprawled across the floor, is the desecrated corpse of my father. The sight makes my stomach churn. I realize the stairs will be too loud; the creaking could alert the mimic.

“My room!” I whisper sharply. We scurry to my door, shutting and locking it behind us.

“Mom, we need to get onto the roof of the porch and hop down to the car,” I say. “The steps are too loud, and we don’t have time.”  

She looks lost, trembling with fear, but nods in agreement.

“Mom, my pin!” Tommy protests, tugging her sleeve.  

“We can’t get it,” I whisper desperately. “We have to go now.”  

I open the window. Mom pushes Tommy toward it. He climbs onto the roof of the porch, and Mom and I follow close behind.  

At that moment, the once-running Chevy with its bright headlights abruptly turns off.  

“What happened?” I ask, voice shaking.  

“I think the battery died,” Mom says, eyes wide with fear.  

“It might start if we try to turn it on again,” she adds in a desperate whisper.  

“Mommy, my pin!” Tommy tugs at her shirt, eyes wide with panic.  

“Shh,” she motions urgently.  

I scan the yard for any sign of the mimic, then quickly hand Mom the shotgun. With a deep breath, I prepare myself—then jump.  

It’s not the jump that’s terrifying, but the thought of facing that thing again, so close. I hit the ground hard, knees buckling beneath me. I collapse, hurt but alive. Mom drops the shotgun beside me and lands more gracefully.

They hesitate, but I motion for them to go. Tommy has multiple false starts—he’s scared stiff—but finally, he closes his eyes and jumps.  

Mom and I brace ourselves, arms outstretched, catching him with ease.  

That’s the one thing in tonight’s chaos that went right.  

Tommy tugs on my shirt, leaning in close. I see the worry in his eyes. He wants to say something, but I know—he’s about to ask for his pin, which is far gone now.  

“Run!” I whisper to Mom and Tommy. “Get to the car!”  

We make our way to the car, slowly opening the doors. Mom slides into the driver’s seat. Without hesitation, she turns the key and—immediately—tries to start the engine.

The once silent night erupts into the roar of the Chevy struggling to start. The headlights flicker on and off, briefly illuminating the porch. Mom cranks the key one last time—fingers trembling—until the lights flicker one last time, casting an eerie glow. But then, I see it. The mimic, watching us, its form lurking in the shadows.

Mom freezes, eyes wide with terror. She slowly turns toward the back seat—and her face drains of color. Tommy isn't there.  

*Pop-chink! Pop-chink!* The mimic drops low, then lunges into the house, following the noise. Mom screams—a bloodcurdling scream.  

I throw myself out of the car, cock the gun, and chase after it. I don’t even know how many shells I have left, or if I even know how to shoot properly. I pursue the creature as it crawls up the stairs, chasing Tommy.  

I stop at the bottom of the stairs, aiming my gun, but it turns the corner—causing me to fire blindly into the wall. I keep going, hearing Tommy’s agonized scream echo from his room.  

“Mommy! Help!” Tommy’s voice pierces the chaos.  

I race around the corner and see the mimic on top of him—its mouth tearing into his flesh, stealing his soul. I scream in terror and fury. The creature turns to look at me—its face, pale and bloodstained, devoid of eyes but with a flat, horrifying expression. It roars—a deafening, maddening sound. I stumble back, overwhelmed.  

Tommy is silent now.  

I bolt downstairs, tears blurring my vision, and leap into the car.  

“Start the car!” I shout at Mom.  

“Tommy?!” she sobs, trembling.  

I stare at her, tears streaming down my face, unable to speak. She frantically turns the key, trying to start it again and again, pounding the steering wheel in desperation. Her face turns pale—she curses God, breaking down in tears.  

Then, through the moonlight, we see it—the monster. Its bloody face, once pale, now stained red, staring at us with hatred. We lock eyes—no fear now, only rage.  

It raises its head to the moon and screams—a piercing, soul-crushing cry. But what makes me sick isn’t the scream. It’s Tommy’s voice—“Mommy! Help!”—repeating over and over.  

Mom’s nose scrunches, her grip on the steering wheel white-knuckled, her face drained of color. She suddenly opens the door, stepping out into the night.  

The mimic stops, watching her.  

“Fuck. YOU!” Mom screams, voice raw with fury.  

The creature screams back—an unearthly, multi-voiced roar that shreds the silence. It lunges toward her.  

I raise the shotgun through the windshield, close my eyes, and fire. The ringing in my ears is deafening. When I open my eyes, debris and broken glass fill the scene. I see neither Mom nor the mimic—only chaos.  

I dash around the car, lungs burning, and find the monster on top of her—her hands pushing it away. Its head and arm are blown off, blood spraying everywhere.  

Mom stands, spits on what’s left of it, and breathes heavily. We stand there in silence, then embrace, crying like never before.  

I drop the gun, my hands shaking, and slowly walk upstairs. I turn away to block out the sight of Dad’s corpse, sobbing uncontrollably. I force myself to look into Tommy’s room.  

Mom passes by, unable to look to grab her car keys. I see the half-eaten body of my nearly nine-year-old brother. My stomach lurches—I puke, falling to my knees. I scream, punching the floor in helpless rage.  

Why did Tommy run upstairs?  Why, Tommy? Why?!

I stand, trembling, and glance once more. Then I notice it—the pin in his tiny hand. I want to cry, but nothing comes. I cover my eyes, unwilling to see his face, and carefully take the pin from his grip, slipping it into my pocket.  

Mom has already gone downstairs, unable to bear the sight of her boy.  

I step onto the porch, see the engine of my moms car running, and climb into the passenger seat. I breathe deeply, trying to steady myself.  

Mom looks at me, then leans over to kiss my head. Without a word, we drive away.  

In silence, we leave that nightmare behind. Who knew that the sight of streetlights—so ordinary—could feel so strangely comforting?

I used to hate baseball because my dad never took me. Now, I attend every Cleveland Baseball game I can. I know all the players and coaches by name. No matter the season, there’s always Cleveland baseball at my house now. And something that never leaves me—something I carry everywhere—is that pin.
