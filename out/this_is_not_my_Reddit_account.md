Okay, so this isn't my account, you should know that by now. I don't know if my theory is correct, but every time I sleep, I wake up as a whole new person whom I never met.  I wish I could become someone like a celebrity, but no, it's usually just regular people. I don't know how this happened, it just did randomly one day. I don't know when it happened either.

I sigh for a moment, remembering my true self. "Okay, my name is Rika...uhm, my last name is, shit I forgot.  I'm 16 this year, and I live in XXXXX XX XXX St. 47XXX. I believe this is day 76." I look around to make sure I'm still alone. My eyes start to tear up as I keep going, "I don't know who's in my body, or if I'm dead right now in my actual body. But for all I know is that I want to find a way to get back."

Today, I'm in a room that has drawings around the walls. I assume they're an artist, so I walk up to their desk and find multiple messy sketches. I quickly get out of the room, searching for anyone. I rush downstairs and look around, no one's there. I groan and went back up to figure out something that can help me.

"Alright, so what I know is that when I sleep, I change people. I gain their memories, yet keep my past ones at the same time. I never tried staying up for a whole night, and I do not have the capacity to do so. My diet also changes to how the person likes it." I sigh and close the person's phone. I have no idea how to get away from this curse.

I scream into the pillow beside me, I cry and cry until someone knocks on my door. I sniffle a bit before saying anything

"Com-hic, come in," I cried slowly, I didn't have a sense of time anymore.

"What happened with you Angela? You're usually so cheerful!" the lady says.

"L-look, I am not Angela. I don't know how I got here, but every single time I sleep..I just," I was caught off mid-way by the lady.

"turn into someone else, I know." She finished my sentence for me, I stared at her, shocked.

"How did you know that?" I ask softly. She looks at me, with a sinister smile.

"Oh well maybe, because I was the one who cursed you? I've been following you every single time you changed, I'm surprised you haven't gone insane yet, most people already do at this rate." She chuckles and I glare at her. *Most people?! Does this mean she has cursed more than one person like myself?*

"Why would you do that?!"

"For *entertainment,* sweetheart" She snaps her fingers and I feel a tingling sensation, my body pops out like popcorn and I gaze at myself.

**I'm someone else now.**

I walk in circles, trying to comprehend what just happened, until another knock comes in. This time, a  man comes in.

"So you see, I change myself just as you do, however, I do provide weapons. Because, you know, some people can't handle it anymore.  Let me just say, I chose you because of a particular reason, you wanna guess?" I guess he or she shrugs and I thought to myself for a moment before replying.

"What is it? Is it because you think I can figure out how to get out huh?!"

"Not exactly, you hurt one of us. There's more than just me. We call ourselves *Insanity Mac-9.* I'm part of Group D, one of the best groups out there. I'm the leader, and you hurt *Insanity Mac-9 D14."*

I run to the humanoid creature and try to attack it, but it disappears before I get a chance.

***Good luck...Rika*** I hear a machinic voice echo through my head. I sit down before looking around the new room. I see a computer in front of me.

*What if I show this message to the world?* I get up and walk to the machine. I type in the password before accessing the internet. I click on google chrome and search "Most used social website" and press search.  I see this app that I have never seen before called *Reddit*, the owner of this body has an account and now I'm making this story in hopes of reaching someone. Right before I enter "post" the machine lady turns up again.

"I don't recommend doing that, just saying." I frown at it and ask why, but before I even open my mouth, she answers. "Well, because if you do, we kind of do know, and we can do something to you, that you don't want to happen."

"You can't delete it though?"

"Nope, have no power, and ugh I cannot stand the human's smell." the lady or man snaps their fingers once more and returns to her original form, I believe. It has wings of chains and robotic eyes, it also has a tail with a syringe, and she has long hair that curves at the end. I watch in awe of her transformation.  But I quickly slap myself back into reality. I already have written all I needed to get the attention of everyone just in case it happens.

"I don't care if you're going to do something to me, people shouldn't suffer like this! What did I ever do to your little minion, huh?!"

She scowls at me as her wings rise above her head. "You really have some nerve," after she says this she speaks in some gibberish language, and then the next moment, another machine bursts through the roof. I scream and run all the way to the other side of the room. "Relax, this is the machine you hurt. Now do you know why?"

I shake a bit before answering, "Why?"

"Because you fucking insulted us through a book that some guy made! 'Oh my god, this book is so fake because none of these creatures exist.' For the record, we do, and the guy is dead because we drove him insane. You want that to happen to you?" She snarls at me and walks closer as *Insanity Mac-9 D14* walks behind her.

Her hands goes inside of her and out comes a chainsaw arm, I look at it, scared for my life. I dash across her but the machine blocks me. "Why are you scared huh?" She looks down at me, she wasn't smiling but if she could, she would.

"Maybe because you're about to kill me and the person's body I'm in?!" I yell out.

"Oh? No no, I'm not going to kill you," she raises her arm in an up-and-down motion as if pretending to kill me. I roll my eyes and look at the computer, which is still on. What will happen if I press the post button? People will know to avoid saying stupid things and may just be able to stop this from happening to them. I'm lucky that I didn't go insane, but it's only a matter of time before I do.

"I'm going to do it, do whatever you want." and I press the post button, please be safe against this.

`Uhm okay, so like this is Insanity Mac-9 D1. You may be wondering what I'm doing editing this, but if you want to know what we did to Rika. Well, let's just say we transformed her into one of us, yeah. All of us machines were people before. I'm not going to explain much, but yeah we've all done something stupid. She's turning into Z10 since she's one of the last people to join us, but I'm sure she'll get up to us soon. Good luck I guess, and don't insult us. We know everything.`
