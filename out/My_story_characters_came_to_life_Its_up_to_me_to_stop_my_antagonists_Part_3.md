“What are we going to do?” Jake whispered. 

“What are we going to do about what?”

He pointed to Sidney and Annie, cuddled up on my bed. They snoozed soundly, faces placid and worry-free.

“That.”

“She has to have a family, right? I mean, you don’t really think… She couldn’t be…”

“Mr. Pip’s daughter?” 

Jake frowned as the words slipped from his mouth.  

“She can’t be,” he said, “you saw that thing. There’s no way it’d be capable of making something so. So.”

“Adorable?”

“Exactly.” 

We glanced at the little girl whose blonde curls bounced ever so slightly with each shallow breath. My heart swelled. Those two looked like they’d be content to spend the rest of their lives curled up together napping on my mattress. Jake stuck out his bottom lip.

“Stop that. This is exactly why we need to figure out what to do with her. We need to find her parents. We can’t let ourselves get too attached.”

“You’re right, man. They’re just so stinkin’ cute together.”

“Yeah, well, pull out your phone and start looking through missing persons articles. We can’t put her in any more danger by letting her stick around.”

Jake nodded and dejectedly retrieved his phone from my desk. I began scouring the internet, searching for any trace of the girl. 

“Found it. Annie Rodgers. She went missing two years ago. It’s got a home address listed for her parents. We can drop her off at her house later tonight. No hassle, and no questions from the cops,” I said, spinning my monitor so Jake could see.

“Sounds like a plan. How are we going to break the news to them?”

Sidney yawned, stretching her arms above her head. 

“What news?”

Jake and I shot each other a glance.

“You wanna tell her?” he implored.

“So, um, we found Annie’s parents. We’re taking her home tonight.”

“That’s awesome! When were you planning on telling me?” 

It took all my effort to hide my shock at how well she took it.

“We just figured it out. We’re leaving soon.”

“That went better than expected,” Jake murmured.

“Yeah, you’re telling me.”

Sidney lightly shook Annie’s arm until she groggily opened her eyes. She rubbed away the sleep with tiny little fists. 

“We’re going to be taking you home now, sweetie. Would you like that?”

Annie shook her head up and down vigorously. 

“I miss my mommy.”

“Good! You’re going to get to see her real soon. Are you ready?”

“Yes!” she screamed, jumping to her feet and racing to put her shoes on.

“What are you two waiting for? An invitation? Let’s go.”

I punched the address into Google Maps and off we went. I slowly pulled my car to the curb on the opposite side of the street a few houses down and killed the lights. 

“Annie, do you see that house right there?” I asked, pointing to a dimly lit home, illuminated by the faint glow of a streetlamp.

She nodded.

“That’s your house. Ring the doorbell and your parents will be there.”

She smiled feverishly and reached for the door handle.

“Sweetheart, before you go, I need you to make me a promise,” Sidney requested sternly.

Annie looked at her. She cocked her head to the side and furrowed her brow, bright blue eyes full of confusion. 

“They’re going to ask you a lot of questions. Whatever you do, promise me that you won’t tell *anyone* about us, okay? Not even your parents.”

“Why?” 

“Because bad people will hurt us if you do. Do you promise?”

She paused for a moment, deep in thought.

“Yes, I promise.”

“Good, now hurry along. Your parents are waiting.”

She hopped out of the car and began to trot toward her house. She turned back a few feet from us.

“Thank you for saving me.”

All we could do was smile. We watched as Annie ran to her doorstep and rang the bell. Just as I was wondering if anyone would answer, a man hesitantly pulled open the door. His face lit up and he scooped his daughter into his arms, tears streaming down his face. A woman soon joined the pair and wept with joy, embracing the little girl. I glanced in the rearview mirror. A single tear rolled down Sidney’s cheek. 

“Drive.”

Exhausted and emotionally drained, we decided to call it a night. We made it back to my house without incident and we were off in dreamland in no time. I let Sidney sleep in my bed, while I took the couch. 

Sunlight beamed into my eyelids, forcing me out of a fitful slumber. I groggily rolled over and tapped my phone screen to check the time. 7:32 A.M. 

“Good freaking morning, I guess.”

I rose and slunk to the kitchen, preparing a bowl of Frosted Flakes, and lazily trudged back to the living room. I began researching the next victim of my writing. Charlene Adkins. She’d died in a car accident but returned home after her husband had wished her back with a cursed monkey paw. I found her obituary relatively effortlessly. It listed a home address to send gifts and condolences to her husband. All that was left to do was wait for the others to wake up.

Jake emerged from his room about an hour later. He yawned, wearily rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. 

“How’d you sleep lil bro? I bet that was comfortable.”

“Yeah, you got that right. My back is killing me. We have got to invest in a new couch. This thing is stiffer than a wood plank.” 

“I think the neighbors just threw one out last week. I hear the junk yard has a pretty good selection these days.”

“Ha. Ha. Very funny. By the way, I found Charlene and Martin’s address. We can head out whenever Sidney gets up.”

“Who’s address?” Sidney asked, catching me off guard. 

She was already fully dressed and prepared to tackle the day. Her hair was done and she’d even put on some eyeliner.

“Don’t do that! You scared the shit out of me.” 

“What was I supposed to do? Announce my presence like the Queen of England? Here ye, here ye! The amazing Sidney White will now enter the living room!”

Jake and I chuckled. 

“Fair point. Give us a few minutes to get ready. We’ll fill you in on the way.”

We piled into my car as I plugged the address from the obituary into my phone. I drove, while Jake explained the situation to Sidney. After a short five minute drive, we arrived at our destination. We again found ourselves in a middle-class suburban neighborhood. 

“So… we’re just going to knock on their door out of the blue and introduce ourselves?” Sidney asked.

“Yeah. Do you have a better idea? There wasn’t a phone number or any other contact info listed,” Jake retorted. 

“Well, no.”

“Alright then, let’s do this.”

We hopped out of the car and approached the door. I rang the bell and we waited. And waited. I was preparing to leave, when the door creaked open slightly. An eyeball appeared in the crack. 

“Whatever you’re selling, I don’t want any,” a fatigued sleep-deprived voice declared. 

“Wait, Mr. Adkins! We’re not here to sell you anything. We know about your wife, and we want to help,” I said, realizing how strange the three of us probably appeared to him, just showing up randomly like we had.

“My wife’s dead. Now if you’ll excuse me-”

“We know she’s not. You used a monkey paw to wish her back. Please, Martin, we just want to help you. Both of you.”

Mr. Adkins flung the door open. He’d obviously been through the wringer. His hair was disheveled and dirty. It looked like it hadn’t been washed in days, maybe even weeks. Dark purple bags drooped under his bloodshot eyes. He reeked of body odor and cheap whiskey. 

“H-how do you know that? I’ve never told a soul about Charlene.”

“We’ll explain everything. Can we come inside?” 

“Yeah. Come on in.”

The house was as much of a wreck as Mr. Adkins was. Papers and books were strewn about the living room. Empty liquor bottles had been discarded haphazardly on the floor. Half-eaten take-out boxes and water bottles littered the coffee table. We stepped inside and introduced ourselves.

“I’m Matt. This is my brother, Jake. And this is Sidney.”

Jake nodded and Sidney waved awkwardly.

“Nice to meet you all. Let’s take a seat. You all owe me an explanation.”

We all squished onto a filthy liquor-stained couch. It made my skin crawl just sitting on it. We told Mr. Adkins the entire story. He listened in amazement without interrupting once. 

“Well, unfortunately that’s not the craziest thing I’ve experienced in the past couple of months. I wish I could say it was.”

“Again, I’m sorry. I had no idea that all of this would happen, and I’m still not sure what triggered the whole thing. But in order to get your wife back to normal, we need you to tell us everything that the story left missed. Any details that stick out.”

He sighed.

“Okay. It all started two months ago when Charlene got into a car wreck. She was on her way back from the grocery store when a drunk driver hit her head-on. She died instantly on impact, while that son-of-a-bitch only sustained minor injuries. He’s rotting in a jail cell for what he did to her.”

I could feel the anger radiating from him upon mentioning the drunk. 

“Other than that, it seems like you hit the nail on the head. Charlene came back unexpectedly one night, I unknowingly made some stupid wishes on the monkey paw, and here we are. I’ve been hiding Charlene away ever since. I work remotely, so I’m able to look after her all day. The world’s leading doctors and scientists wouldn’t be able to help her in her current state. They’d just poke her and prod her and put her in more pain than she’s already in.”

Tears welled in his eyes. 

“I want to fix this so badly, but I don’t know how. I feel like I’ve failed her.”

“Mr. Adkins, you definitely haven’t failed her. You did the only thing you knew to do. Do you by chance have the monkey paw lying around anywhere?” Jake asked.

“Yeah. Let me go get it.”

He slipped into his bedroom and returned, holding a shriveled mummified monkey paw. 

“You can have this thing. It disgusts me just looking at it.”

He dropped it into Jake’s outstretched palm. The second he did so, three of its gnarled digits curled outward. We stared at it slack-jawed. 

“It’s your lucky day, Jake. Three wishes for you,” I grinned. 

“Cool! I’m gonna wish for a-”

“No, you idiot. You’re not going to wish for anything yet. They come with a price, remember?” Sidney berated him. 

“Oh, yeah.”

“Before we make any decisions, can we… see her?” I requested sternly.

Mr. Adkins pursed his lips. 

“I guess it wouldn’t hurt. She’s in here, but just be prepared for what you’re about to see. It isn’t pretty.”

He led us to their bedroom door and gradually pushed it open. We all stepped inside. The foul stench of decay immediately assaulted my nostrils. Jake gagged. Sidney darted back into the living room and vomited in a trash can. My eyes watered as the putrid odor enveloped us. Through my teary vision I saw her.

Charlene sat in an armchair on the opposite end of the room. She was in bad shape. She was nothing more than skin and bones, flesh sloughing off her tiny, emaciated frame in thick patches. Most of her hair had fallen out, and what little remained clung to her head in thin wispy strands. She opened her mouth to speak, and through dry cracked lips, I could only see a handful of brown jagged teeth protruding from her gums.  

“H-help me. Please.”

Her deep blue eyes pleaded with me to do something. My heart shattered for her. I could sense immense pain and anguish behind her gaze. 

“Please,” she croaked, extending a bony hand that was missing several extremities. 

“We’ll be back in a minute, baby. We’re going to figure out how to help you.”

Mr. Adkins turned to me as he motioned to close the door.

“The worst part,” he said through tears, “is that I know the woman I love is still in there. She’s still her, even though her body is failing. We need to come up with-”

“I wish Charlene was never in that car accident,” Jake blurted out before I had a chance to stop him. 

We stared at the monkey paw as one mangled finger slowly closed.

I slugged Jake in the arm.

“You moron! We needed to talk through how to fix this before just making wishes at random.”

“I’m sorry. I just couldn’t bear to see her suffering like that,” he muttered, rubbing his arm.

“Guys. Look,” Sidney whispered, pointing directly at Charlene. 

Charlene was beautiful. She looked nothing like the monstrosity we’d been gawking at moments prior. She was absolutely glowing. Her skin was youthful and radiant. Long blonde hair cascaded down her back in waves. All her digits had returned, and the rancid smell of rot had disappeared. She glanced up at us with shimmering blue eyes. Her expression suddenly twisted to one of dread.

“W-who are you people, and why are you in my house?”

“We were here with your husband. Right, Mr. Adkins?”

I turned to him to bail us out. He was gone. Where he’d been standing just seconds earlier, now sat a dark black puddle of liquid. My heart sank into my stomach.

Jake fumbled with the monkey paw.

“I wish to undo my last wish!”

Nothing.

“I wish Mr. Adkins was still here.”

We were met with tense silence. 

“Come on, you stupid thing! Work! I wish Martin Adkins was still alive!”

The monkey paw remained motionless. 

“I don’t know if this is some kind of sick joke or what, but you need to leave. Martin passed away two months ago.”

“We… I... it…” Jake stuttered as Charlene ushered us out the door. 

“Look, Charlene, we’re sorry. We know-”

*Slam.*

We were left alone in the brisk morning air as Charlene abruptly shut the door in my face. 

“What do we do now?” Sidney whimpered.

“I don’t think there’s anything else we can do. The monkey paw isn’t co-operating, and Charlene won’t believe a word we say. Let’s go home I guess.”

Sidney solemnly nodded as we headed for the car. Jake stared off into space, unmoving. 

“Jake. Jake! Earth to Jake! Hello?!” 

I waved a hand in front of his face. He eventually snapped out of it. 

“Are you okay? I thought we lost you for a second.”

“Yeah,” he mumbled despondently, as he shuffled toward the car.

The drive home was a somber one. Nobody said a word until we made it back to my house. 

Jake broke down the moment we crossed the threshold. Fat sloppy tears streamed down his face. 

“Matt, I don’t know if I can do this anymore. Mr. Adkins died in that car crash instead of his wife because *I* made a stupid decision.” 

“It’s not your fault, Jake. He would’ve wanted his wife to be happy. You ended her suffering,” I reassured him, resting a hand on his shoulder. 

“I know. I just. I need some time to myself.” 

“I understand. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do. I love you big bro.”

“I will. I love you too,” he sniffled as he meandered to his room. 

His languished wails were still audible through the door. I tried my best to tune it out. I turned to Sidney. 

“Looks like it’s just you and me now. I hope you’re in the mood for a road trip. We’ve got a rat to exterminate.”
