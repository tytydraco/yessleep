I have an update.

If you didn’t read my last post, please do. Or don’t. I don’t belive that post is needed to understand this one.

I’ll start this post the day after I had finished posting the last one, I was full of anxiety. I’d be stepping outside for the first time in months, not knowing if David would be watching me. But I had to do this. This whole ordeal had postponed the whole moving in with Jane, my girlfriend. I’ll be honest, I am surprised she put up with me for all those months. I was Spending a lot of time in my room with everything closed. I only left to use the bathroom and to spend time with Jane in the living room.

The first thing I did was get my hair cut. I had (or rather I went to) a stylist, needless to say, when I suddenly emerged out of my tomb to ask for a different style it was a welcome surprise for him (his words). I had a new style I wanted to try out, I won't get into details as I am one of those people who just think hair is hair. I paid him once he finished my hair and I was on my way.

I did not ask if he had seen David, maybe I should have. It doesn’t matter now.

Over these last few days, with the help of my Mom, as my dad was much more busy, I would ask my family about David. Well, I wouldn’t directly mention him. I’ll Just ask if they have seen strange people who seemed impossible. Like a seven-foot man who held his body in a strange way. Nobody In my family had seemed to seen David.

I was about to give up my search when my grandfather (Mom’s side) would call me over to his house to have a drink. He must have caught wind of what I was going around doing. He was the grandfather who came down to look for David that winter all those years ago. He knew something.

It was an unexpected conversation with my grandfather. I am sure he noticed the stressed expression I had when I went over to his house. He is a war vet and retired some time ago. Raised both my mother and uncle here in Sheridan. These next few paragraphs are his story. I didn’t take notes, but I will try to make this as accurate as possible.

To cut straight to the bone, my Grandpa (Ed or Eddie), had also encountered David. When I told him my name for the creature, he could not help from laughing. He and a few others call him Johnson due to his resemblance to ‘liver-eating Johnson,’ a white guy who ate the livers of Natives. I asked him about it and just told me to listen.

Papa Ed had moved to Sheridan with Grandma sometime after the Vietnam War almost 50 some years ago now. Grandpa had no problems re-joining society with the help of Grandma. He was working for the US Postal Service before retirement, saving up for wood, nails, and any new gadgets that would help keep the house from disrepair. But that is beside the point, in his first few years back he began making friends with many people who were moving into town looking for a small quiet place to live just like my Grandpa. Those friends loved trying to scare him as he was just a big guy who wasn’t easily scared. There were some people who lived in Sheridan all their lives, they would tell him about local urban legends, and Papa Ed, being the hard man he is, wasn’t phased by any of the stories. He did not believe in the paranormal, he was a god-fearing man. How were you going to make someone afraid when they don’t believe a word out of your mouth? 

This whole game of attempting to scare Grandpa would go on for a year or so, and by then he and Grandma would have their youngest kid (my mom). They were a happy family, the picture-perfect family, the family everyone wanted for themselves.

Everything changed, there was one night that ‘Johnson’ was brought up, and this was the first time Papa Ed would hear about him.

He was at a bar when the person brought it up. The man was a drunk, skipping town not long after this night, but he was once a well-respected businessman before some sort of bear attack killed his wife or son or something along those lines. Well, this drunk heard about this game that everyone played, telling the scariest stories they know and he wanted in on the action. But, unlike the many times before, where the crowd would erupt in laughter as someone told a silly tale about the boogie man, the bar would go silent. Nobody spoke a word, except of course the one man who brought him up. He began telling the story of Johnson, a man who took revenge on the Crow for killing his wife, eating the livers of many of his victims, and striking fear in the native Crow. But in this story, his death was just a cover-up for what happened. After eating the livers of many Crow Indians, he started to change, at some point, he couldn’t die to age, disease, or any normal means. Whether it be the fear that the Crow nation had, or that livers did actually give supernatural powers when eaten, it turned Jonson into a creature. This creature was David to me, this creature was Johnson to the town of Sheridan.

Once the man was done, nobody spoke. The pressure in the room was similar to the pressure felt when you make a terrible joke about a tragedy right after it happened.

‘Forget he said anything,’ one of the men sitting next to Papa would comment. ‘He don’t know what he’s talking about.’

For the first time papa was unnerved, not by the story, but by the reaction to the story. Papa Ed had heard several stories similar to this one, so why had this one moved everyone to silence? He did not believe in the Johnson whose story was told, or at least he didn’t think he believed it. But for a split second he thought that maybe, just maybe, this was a real thing, where instead of some sort of unnatural creature coming out of the woods, a real man was terrorizing this town.

This drunk man won the game.

‘About time I’d get my tab and head home,’ Grandpa responded. The bar didn’t speak as he left. He would pay his tab, then pausing, he also paid the tab of the drunk man. He won after all, and winners deserve something.

He would make it home without incident. He was greeted by grandma, seated by the front door waiting for his return, she already had put the kids to bed. The two of them would go to bed peacefully, exchanging small talk as they drifted off into sleep.

But he woke up later in the night. The moon had lit up the outside well enough to see without straining the eyes. Grandma was asleep next to him, he admired her for a bit, she was aging but even now he could tell that this woman would be beautiful until death came to claim her.

But there was more important business, distracting him from the beauty of his wife. He needed to use the bathroom, so that is what he did. Cleaning up, he decided that he also needed a glass of water before going back to sleep.

He made his way downstairs, careful not to wake any children and careful not to wake up grandma. The faucet made minimum noise, the floor didn’t creek, and the house was well-kept. The water was refreshing, the night was the quietest it had been, and the sky was beautiful. There was no sound of crickets, no flies swarming any leftover food, nothing. But he had turned to head back upstairs when he noticed something, a detail that strikes fear into everyone who experiences it.

The front door was open.

He rushed back upstairs to grab one of his rifles, searching the house on his way back up, double-checking every inch on his way back down, thoroughly checking the downstairs. My mom was ok, and so was my uncle. Almost everything seemed to be in place. Nothing appeared to be stolen or damaged. But there was one last thing that he needed to check

My Grandfather would pause, just for a moment. He was getting emotional. Until now, I don’t believe I had ever seen him get this emotional over a story.

He asked if I knew about my second Uncle.

My blood ran cold. I didn’t know I had one. You, the reader, can probably guess some of what my grandfather told me next. I knew what he was going to say.

My grandfather would run into the room of that second uncle, and he was horrified. Turning on the light he would see this thing painted red with the blood of his son, the uncle who I never had the chance of meeting, that uncle who had his life cut short. David or Johnson, whatever his name was, turned around with this impossible smile.

My grandfather would raise his gun, aiming at him, a mix of rage and fear taking control of his body. He wanted to pull the trigger, to kill the dam thing, he wanted to avenge his son, he wanted so much in that exact moment, he put his finger to the trigger. But he was shaking, he couldn’t see straight. David would walk right next to Ed, slowly. Every step taken by David felt like an hour. Grandpa can now see his boy behind David, the body a bloody mangled mess. David wouldn’t touch my grandfather or anyone else that night, just his oldest boy. Grandpa failed to pull the trigger.

Every step David took killed my grandfather, killing him again, 
and again,
Again,
And again,
And again.
But Grandpa, despite how much he wished to trade places with his boy, lived. Seeing the disparity in my Grandfather’s face, David allegedly made a noise. There were no words to describe it, but it almost read as David laughing at my grandfather.

Once David left his sight, he began to cry out uncontrollably into the night. He made so much noise that not only did Grandma come down and see the remains of her once beautiful boy, but the neighbors called 911 not knowing the horrors of what was happening next to them.

Papa Ed began sobbing, I comforted him. I didn’t know what to do, why this thing had chosen to kill my uncle? Why was that thing haunting me? Why was he allowing me to live? Why why why? I had so many questions that I did not have answers for, and It was terrifying. I wanted to go home. I wanted to go home and cry. I wanted to crawl up in my bed and rot and die. Because what if David finally decides to kill me? What then? What would David do to me?

After some time my grandpa would calm down, and resume the story. After David left, he immediately called for help, attempting to revive the son that he lost. The police would come through the still-open door, answering the call from the neighbors. The Officers saw the scene before them, they knew what happened. They took his statement, they already knew what happened but couldn’t do anything about David, they couldn’t even find David consistently. For the report that they let out, the police labeled the incident as a ‘bear attack.’

Bear Attack.

Now, there was a detail in my last post I omitted as I did not think it was related to my post about David. In my last post, I mentioned that Justin had to move out to his grandfather's. I didn’t think it was related to the story at the time but now I am not too sure.

Justin’s mom said it was for safety reasons, that the family upstairs got attacked by a grizzly bear. I thought It was odd (I mean it is odd), after all, it isn’t all too common for a grizzly bear to show up in the middle of town and make its way upstairs to attack a family. Was this some sort of hidden message? That whenever there is some sort of ‘bear attack’ in town, that it was David? How violent is this thing? How long has he been around?

How old is David?

‘Did you tell anyone what happened that night?’ I asked Grandpa.

‘I told your mom and grandmother what the police said, your mother thinks it was just a bear, your grandmother knows as much as the two of us,’ he paused for a breath, ‘You know, your mother named you after him.’

‘Kit?’ I asked.

‘Christopher.’

We would continue to talk about unrelated subjects, to calm each other. I felt terrible about having my grandfather re-live that night. As the sun began to set, I started making my way out the door. But before I could go, my grandfather gave me a present. A wooden box, it was heavy, inside of that box was a gun. I’m not an expert, if I were to describe it as someone who doesn’t know anything, it is like one of those from an old Western movie. We exchanged glances.

‘Just in case.’ 

‘Thank you, love you, Papa.’

This post isn’t as long as my last one, I apologize for that. But I just don’t know anything about this thin

As I write this down I see David in my fucking window.

-

I am not sure how to tac this on as I was pretty much done with my post until last night. I suppose I’ll start right after I wrote that sentence.

When I saw him in the window, my heart sank, it sank so deep into me that I could swear I felt it hit the floor. I wrote that sentence, looking down for only a moment to make sure I didn’t misspell anything, But David didn’t move, not yet. There was a long silence between us. Looking at him, I can tell my mom’s gun did not leave any significant damage. After another eternity, I began screaming at David, asking him why he was following me, asking why he did what he did. He smiled, full of glee and what seemed to be whimsy. I backed into my desk, careful not to shove my grandpa's gift off the counter. Fumbling, I managed to get the gun out of the box, grabbing a few bullets. I loaded the gun, careful not to release my gaze. I aimed the gun at David, he did not falter. In fact, he was bolder than ever tonight, opening the fucking window separating us, tearing through the screen, and climbing into the room with me. Slowly, he got close enough that the gun I held was right up to where his gut was. I fired one shot, and David recoiled a bit, I don't think he expected me to pull the trigger, his face was shocked, just as shocked as I was.

David stumbled back, holding himself where he was shot. He did not bleed, he was mostly unharmed, a bruise forming where he had been shot. He reached down, picking the bullet up off the ground. Mom ran in hearing the gunshot with my dad right behind her, I had never seen David move so fast, he threw one of his hands wildly, thwacking my mother and sending her into the door.  He smashed the desk under the window that he came through and even broke that window’s glass. I raised the gun again, I missed the second shot. David grabbed the gun and threw it. He approached me, his face began to grin again.

In my last post, I started by saying I wasn’t easily scared. At this moment, facing David, I can say that I have never felt this genuine fear in my life.

I stared into his eyes, the pupil fully engulfed them. Now in retrospect, I don’t think they are the same eyes as those of an animal or person. They were just imitating the eyes that we have. Those fake eyes, I saw something deep inside of them. My focus broke from the eyes only to be brought down to David’s mouth. This was the first time I had seen inside of it. 

I don’t know how to describe it accurately. The first word that comes to mind is ‘abyss’ or ‘Lovecraftian’ as there was a second row of ever-changing teeth, and just a little further was… he was always changing, morphing. I was awe-struck but horrified beyond my understanding. Staring down into David’s mouth it seemed to be impossibly larger inside than outside. It was hard to describe.

A third shot rang out, and my older sister was standing in the doorway with my mother’s gun my father holding our mom, David retreated. My sister managed to shoot him in his mouth. To my surprise, he seemed to begin bleeding from his mouth. David would quickly disappear, crashing through my window to escape.

I lay where I was, I did not know what to make of that encounter. Why was tonight different? Why did he attack? Why did he kill, or eat, my uncle? I had so many more questions and no answers to any of them.

My older sister ran over to our mother, tending to her alongside our father. Right now, mom is in the hospital. David broke several bones when he hit her, mostly those in her rib cage area. 

I called Grandpa, I’m staying with them tonight, probably for the next few nights as well. Grandpa is one of the only people I know who has an understanding of what I am currently going through right now, and if David is now ready to attack me then I need someone who sees David the way I do. With my mom in the hospital, Grandpa is the only one who understands this situation.

I called my girlfriend to explain the situation, and a guy answered. ‘She’s busy little bro.’

Fuck me.

I won't make this a personal diary so I’ll keep my thoughts short. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t blame her for looking for other guys to comfort her, but it still hurts.

I want things to go back to the way things were before I found those stupid photos. I want my girlfriend back, I want my mom to be healthy again, and I want to completely forget about David.

I was planning on calling Justin as well, but I just need to cry right now.

-

It is the morning after I wrote all of what is above, I didn’t post yet in case I saw David one more time between that last sentence and the call with Justin. On that note, I called Justin. I started the conversation by asking how he was doing and he told me last week his grandfather passed away, while sad, Justin and Justin's mom was the only family his grandfather had and Justin managed to get a massive inheritance because of it. That includes the house that is out of town where we shot BB’s.

I’ll skip the pleasantries for the sake of this story, I told Justin about my attack. There was a long silence on Justin’s end before he spoke again.

‘Are… you alright?’

It was a dumb question, but what else was he supposed to ask? Did I find out how to kill David?  Did you find out who or what David was? Some other third question that I have no answer to?

I only have a few theories.

Justin is going to be spending the night with me and my grandfather for a while, just in case he sees David as well. Safety in numbers? Who knows with David. David could just be like a Nuke, where your numbers don’t matter as the foe will evaporate in an instant.

Some less important details. Me and Justin are both sleeping in the guest room, re-arranged so that the two beds we have are facing the window. If David is out there we want as much information as fast as possible.

That is the current situation. Again, if anyone knows anything let us know.
