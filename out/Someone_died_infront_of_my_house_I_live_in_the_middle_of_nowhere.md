I saw him for when I had woken up in the middle of the night. My dogs were barking at something, but it wasn’t normal barking—it was more like the sounds dogs make when they’re scared, whimpering and yelping.

When I got up, I could hear the dogs backing away from something. I could hear their paws rustling through the dirt, growing more and more desperate. At that moment, I was worried that some kind of animal had gotten inside the fence.

I should’ve known it wasn’t an animal. The only "dangerous" animals out here in the countryside are foxes.

But I didn’t care. I went outside with a machete.

The first thing I see is a man, wearing a cloak, a wide-brimmed hat, a short cape, and carrying a staff. He was dirty, with mud stains all over the lower half of his body.

I froze—not from fear, but from surprise.

I live in the middle of nowhere, out in the countryside where the road to my house is just a dirt path that goes on for kilometers and leads nowhere.

It looked like he wanted to pet my dogs. He had his hand stretched out and was walking strangely, using one hand to grab and drag his leg forward while holding on to his staff. All the while, my dogs barked louder and louder.

I approached him, gripping the machete tighter with every step. I raised my hand to touch his shoulder. I felt every movement—my finger getting closer, my muscles tensing, my body leaning in.

I touched his shoulder. He began to stand up with the help of his staff, digging it into the ground, using his strength to straighten up. And he began to turn around. The second he turned, the dogs bolted back into my house. He was still looking down, and suddenly he laughed. It was a deep laugh, like Santa Claus if he’d smoked a pack a day since birth.

He stopped laughing slowly, then said,

“Forgive me. I saw the dogs from afar and had to see them.” He said it in a kind tone.

I got a little angry. He was speaking to me like he was strolling through the suburbs and just saw a dog in front of a house? He was in the middle of nowhere. And besides, there’s only one way to get here—you have to go off the road completely.

So I asked him directly:

“Okay? But why are you in this area??”

I sounded a bit annoyed.

The man sighed and spoke seriously.

“I’m on a journey to a place, and I stopped here to see one of God’s creatures. Again, I apologize. It wasn’t my intention to wake you or scare your dogs.”

I stared at him, confused.

And he said:

“I’ll go now. I can’t stop for long. I have a long road ahead.” He chuckled softly.

He was an old man, and morally I couldn’t just let him walk alone in the night, especially out in the countryside where he clearly must’ve gotten lost if he ended up near my house.

“I’m not going to let you go alone. Let me grab my things and I’ll take you where you want to go in my car.”

The man, still not revealing his face, looking down and completely still, said:

“Accipio.”

I didn’t understand, but he stayed still, so I went inside to grab my things. When I came in, I saw the paw prints had stained the wooden floor and I could hear the dogs whimpering, howling from my room. I turned on the lights to find and grab my car keys and jacket. I went to my room and saw the dogs hiding under my bed. It felt exaggerated—like when Scooby-Doo sees a monster. The point is, I had never seen them like that. I kept ignoring the signs and grabbed my jacket from the wardrobe. Picked up the keys from my nightstand and went back outside, closing the door behind me.

It was starting to get light, like a breath of relief from the tension and unease of the night. The man was still there, waiting for me where I had left him. In the daylight, I could see him more clearly—his hands gripping the staff were gray, wrinkled, looking like the skin could fall off any moment.

He was still looking down, but I could make out more of his face.

From afar, I saw his mouth hanging open, drooling.

I figured, because of his age, it might be normal—maybe he didn’t have the strength to keep his mouth closed.

I started walking toward him.

With every step, he seemed to lose the strength to hold himself up—his body looked like it was falling apart.

I began to hurry, feeling the sunlight blinding me.

When I finally got close, I was standing in front of him, and he had collapsed. When I tried to lift him, he wouldn’t let me—until I grabbed him by the arms and his hood fell back.

It was a rotting corpse, like he had died years ago. I dropped him.

Thump—his clothes shifted, revealing more of his body. I could see his chest. There was a huge hole exposing his ribs, and on each rib was written:

“Qui per terras ignotas iter facit.”

"He who travels through unknown lands."

The phrase comes from the old pilgrims, who journeyed through foreign lands out of devotion to God.

The only thing I can imagine is that his pilgrimage wasn’t finished—and if something above is watching, it decided not to let him die until his journey was complete.

But why did his journey end at the door of my house?

What does this land—what do I—have to do with God?
