I kept this to myself for a very long time and I feel ashamed of what had happened in that dream.

I was 16 years old (now 22y/o). My family have always encountered with dark magic (sihr) from bad people who have grudges towards us for generations and somehow it made me and my brother can sense this things and talk to them and it also makes us so sensitive in a way it will ruined your senses.

One night, I felt uneasy and I couldn’t sleep so I just stared at the wall and try to let the time take me into slumber. When I did, I dreamt that I was standing in a complete dark empty space. It was so spacious but nothing was there. It feels weird. It feels like you know you’re not alone and you’re aware that this is not real. I know I was dreaming at that time. I can feel the full control of my mind and body at the time but I couldn’t wake up. 

Then there this raspy pitching voice call out by my name from behind me. When I turned around, I see a woman standing in front of me but it looks so fuxked up. We have the same height, the same slouch of our body, the same shape of face and identical mole at our right chin. But she looks sooo fucked up. 

She was very thin and I can see her ribs, with dishevel long hair that touch the ground, wear a dirty white rag. She also wears a chain on both of her wrist. Like she was bound to something. Compares to me, I have a short hair. I always keep my hair very short with a boy cut and I’m chubby too. We don’t look the same but I had a strong feeling that the woman in front of me is me. Idk why I feel that.

Suddenly she started to scream and shout with ramblings that I couldn’t catch up. She looks mad and always try to get close to me, trying to communicate with me and then she started to wail.

The way she cry is heartbreaking and full with agony. 

“THIS IS YOUR DOINGS”

“THIS IS YOUR FAULT”

“YOU DONT HAVE ANY MUCH TIME ANYMORE”

“STOP. STOP. STOP THE SINS YOU HAVE DONE”

“SAVE ME. SAVE US”

I was confused. In my mind at that time, why is she screaming. Why is this woman being so loud.

“Who are you to scream at me like that. Who are you?”

“I AM YOU ( my full name). I AM YOU AND YOU’RE NEGLECTING ME. YOU DO THIS TO US EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE FULL AWARE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WE WILL GO THROUGH!”

“What did I do?” I asked. Not gonna lie, I can feel my body sweating and my heart is racing. I know I was dreaming but this is real. This feel so real to me.

“You didn’t pray”
“You didn’t read the Quran”
“You lied”
“You do the sins and you never ask for forgiveness”
“YOU DID THIS TO ME!” She screamed so hard until I heard buzzing sounds and the deafening silence after that. She crouching on the floor. Crying.

I walked towards her and, crouching beside her.

“I don’t know you. I don’t know what I do can affect you.” I said. “I am fully aware of my sins. I know that I don’t pray but I still do struggling to keep the scores. I pray when I feel like I want to. I read the Quran when I feel need to. God never hear my prayers. He doesn’t take my pain away. Does it fair?”

“You will die”. She whispered with her raspy voice. Listen to it makes feel the chill in my bones. The fact that you listen this warning coming from yourself. 
“If you continue this you will suffer. Promise me you’ll change? “

“This is a warning?”

“Promise me you’ll change? God is listening. God knows your pain. He just want you to ask for him” 

“Promise me, (my name)”

“Yes”

“Then wake up”

I woke up and I was soaked with sweat. My hands was trembling. I never had a dream that feels as real as that. And I still confused until now who the fuck is she or what the fuck was happening in those dream. Whatever it is, I still remember her face and her identical voice screaming at me.

I told my mom about that dream like after 2  years because I was scared and I feel ashamed.

She said maybe that woman is my Qarin trying to warn me for some reasons. In Muslim culture, every human have their own Doppelgänger which is a Jinn.They imitates the human and if the human is good, then the Qarin is good. If the human is bad, then the Qarin is malice.

But the fact that my Qarin try to warn me and telling me that I’m gonna die? Is kind of scary.

Because I have a terminal illness after all.
