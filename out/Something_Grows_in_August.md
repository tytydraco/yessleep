There’s mold growing in my house.



I only noticed it a few days ago. I had just gotten off my shift, so it was maybe 1am or so when I got into the shower and discovered the dark spot peeking out from the ceramic bath. It was no bigger than a quarter; in fact, it was so minuscule that I almost overlooked it. Thinking back on it now, I probably had missed it before. I have no idea how long it’s been there. 



At the time, I wasn’t very concerned. Mold grew in damp, decaying apartments like this all the time, almost like a guaranteed houseguest. I was considerably more comfortable with mold being my uninvited roommate far more than the silverfish that crawled across my foot the other night. I still can picture its little legs brushing up against my skin. It’s lone, waving antenna still twitching despite the rest of it’s body being crushed. 



I thought about grabbing a wet wipe and getting rid of the spot when I was done with my shower, but I was exhausted. I had just worked a double shift and didn’t get any sleep the night before. A little splotch of bacteria was not enough to keep me from stumbling out of the shower and knocking out. 



I’m not sure whether it was the mold, the lack of sleep, or the bills stacking up on my dresser… but I had some weird dreams that night. 



I was a tree. Not anything grand like a redwood or an oak, but a birch. You know, those trees that look like they have eyes popping out of the bark. I was in a forest surrounded by similar makes and models as far as the eye could see. The sun felt like angel kisses. It was honestly kinda peaceful for a bit, swaying with the wind without a care in the world. Trees don’t have to do taxes or buy groceries or remember to water the plants. I was the plant! The water came to me! I could feel the cool breeze wash over me, my leaves shimmering like sea glass in the ocean. Little claws rooted around my trunk, scavenging for the worms and rodents hiding at my base. My legs expanded for miles, separating and merging with others in the dirt. It was the most stretched stretch I have ever felt before. 



There was a pinch. A small needle prick in my side. Then another, and another. More and more to the point that my entire side felt as though it were being gnawed off. The sensation swarmed me, moving downwards towards my thighs and upwards to my neck. I couldn’t breathe. 



“Stop!” I cried out, but my mouth wouldn’t move. It was stretched across me, pulled so tightly and with such thickness it was impossible even to grunt. Bark replaced eyes, leaves; fingers. “Leave me alone!” I tried again, screaming in my head. Nothing came of it. Nothing changed. All I could do was listen and feel as tiny fires made a feast of my flesh. An insatiable, all-consuming mass that was determined to tear and consume every bit of me. 



The sun’s rays grew distant. She was leaving me here. 



Thoughts of darkness drew sharp, dangerous images in my head. I saw myself as the birchwood tree alone amongst a dying forest. They were in my eyes, beneath my skin, in my mouth, wriggling. The sound they made was that of a clicking cacophony. 



The last thing I remember was a thousand squirming things entering my throat. 



Then I woke up. 



I made myself some shitty coffee with two creamers and went to work.



I had forgotten entirely about the mold in my bathroom. 



Work that day was… well-

I should back up a bit before talking about my job. See, I live in August, Texas. It’s a real small town near Longview, easily missed. We’ve got one main grocery store that everyone shops at, two gas stations (one is along the highway and the other is more situated in town), a lake not big enough to boat in but too big for a casual swim, and a Dairy Queen. That’s at least all the main places. 



I work at the local diner, “Dave’s Big Bad Breakfast.” Don’t know why it’s called that since the owner’s name is Jeff and we also sell lunch and dinner, maybe it all sounds extra southern to try and lure in any Californian bozos lookin’ to spend less and gawk at the crosses and boots. This place is a shit hole either way. Coffee tastes like dirt, no one knows how to mop, and the frier never works. But we can promise you a good ‘ol fashioned plate of half burnt bacon and soggy eggs!  



I must have looked about as fresh as our microwaved pastries given how quick my coworker was to belittle me. 



“Sorry ma’am we don’t give handouts. You could try the local Dollar Tree?” This- *charming* piece of horse manure went by Marsha. “Or the Goodwill…” 



“You mockin’ me for making affordable decisions and not whatever it is you’re doing? Honestly, how much did you pay for that jacket? 80 bucks? Looks like your ass is headed to the slaughterhouse for an all expenses paid vacation. Cow print ain’t in season nor will it *ever* be in season, Marsha.” 



“Jesus, you really did wake up on the wrong side today…” 



I brushed her off and headed to the back. Marsha was front and center, half to welcome in any unfortunate soul that thought this place was worth spending money on and half to be at the center of attention. We split tips and I don’t like being in the front so it's not too bad of a deal, I could zone out to a podcast and cook food all day long. The only issue is the atmosphere. Our vents don’t work, not sure if they ever did, but when I turn on the grill or the frier all the smoke and oil goes up into the air and sticks to the walls. I’m sure the walls used to be white, maybe even that gross off yellow that everyone used to be into back in the day, but now the entire ceiling has become this… black, spotty display. If some kid came in and spray painted the ceiling I don’t think anyone would ever know. You could still make out parts of the old colors underneath, faded and choked out. All of it kinda drifts into the back of your subconscious if you work here long enough. Your skin starts to get used to the feeling of being in a box. But that day I just… It was more apparent. More- pressing? I had ignored it so long and suddenly I was hyper aware of the shit floating above me. 



I flipped over a pancake. Could people taste it? Would they know? My stomach churned. Would I know? Would I be able to taste it? Smell it? Perhaps an experiment for later. I thought about all these things for the next two hours of my shift, whatever voice I was listening to drowned out by the almost repetitive focus on the ceiling. I flipped another pancake. Bits of hardened oil stuck to the dough as it turned and splat back onto the grill. My head was swimming. Maybe I should file a report? Not that I would expect Jeff to fix it… he was such a tight pocket. He’d just get someone to paint over it. Eventually my mind drifted from the ceiling, swerving back to the little spot in my bathroom that I had seen the previous night. It was a passing thought, really, but suddenly that was all I could think about. That...damned spot. Was it growing? Would I get sick from that? Hell knows I was definitely feeling queasy right then. 



An hour went by without another order. On any other day I would have appreciated the break, but the silence was almost as suffocating as being busy. I took off my apron and decided to hang out in the front. Marsha wasn’t good company, but she was company nonetheless. She was leaning against the counter, typing away something on her phone with a frown etched into her otherwise meticulously sculpted features. She jumped when the doors swung close behind me, eyes wide. The frown dissipated almost instantly and was replaced by that notable smirk of condescension. “Antsy?” 



I shrugged, glancing out at the diner. “What time is it?” 



“Uh… 9:21?” 



“Huh…” Every table was completely empty. 



“I know, right? Slow day I guess.” She glanced my way and then went back to her phone. “It’s supposed to rain soon.”



“Like we need more rain.” There’s a leak in my apartment, right above my couch. I’ve been trying to get the damn thing to dry for days (I did move the couch if you were wondering), but the leak combined with the rolling blackouts- the whole mess of it has basically been impossible to get to. “My lights are still buggin’ from the last storm.” 



“Mine too, but hey give it a few weeks and we’re gonna be praying for half an inch. Triple digits will be upon us in no time!” She laughed. My arms felt like sloughing off at the thought. 



“You are way too happy about that.” 



“Well duh, triple digits means it's summertime. Summertime means margaritas, sun-tans, and spending all day by the lake. My boyfriend is going to be in town and we’re gonna throw a big party.” 



“That's great.” I sighed, still staring out at the empty diner. The mold spot crept back into my thoughts. 



“Hey, do you know how to get rid of-” The building suddenly shook as a crack of thunder roared above us. “I guess that’s the rain.” It sounded like bullets on the tin roof, I wondered if it was gonna hail. The lights flickered for a second, swaying slightly from the force. Outside, it suddenly began to pour. “Shit- Marsh help me with the towels.” I jumped to the kitchen, rummaging through a bag of towels and grabbing the longest ones we had. 



Flash floods are common where I live. Storm appears out of nowhere and suddenly everything you own is soaked. The towel method is just standard procedure. 



“Here if we can put them down beforehand then-” The storm crashed once more, shaking the building’s foundations. 



Almost in sync with the rolling waves of thunder, the door flung open to a hunched over, hacking figure.



He barreled into the store, rain pouring in behind him like a horrific welcome committee. The closest thing I could use to describe him was a drunken bear in a china store, stumbling over himself and into the tables as he half fell into the building. I was quick to slam the door closed behind him, but not quick enough to cover my nose. The stench hit me like a bag of bricks. What the hell? Did he just crawl out of the sewers? Nausea I had been avoiding all shift curled over me violently, it took everything in me to swallow it. I could be rude, sure, whatever, I’m not great with people who cares, but throwing up due to the sheer viscosity of a customer’s aura is another level and I really couldn’t afford to be fired anytime soon.



“Sir?!” Marsha yelped somewhere behind me, towels bunched up in her arms. “Are you alright?” 



I braced myself against the door and shoved a towel over my nose. Marsha knelt by the man’s side, either unaffected by the smell or far better at hiding her disgust than I thought possible. I watched the wind outside break a tree in two. 



“Tatum?” Marsha’s voice shook. I whipped around to see that her face had grown exponentially pale. Her hands were trembling. 



“He’s not breathing.”
