I’ve never been the kind of person to post on here, especially not about paranormal stuff, but after what just happened to me tonight, I don’t think I’ll sleep without telling someone.

To give you some context, I work in HR for a company located on the third floor of a 75-year-old building. It’s got history and  a lot of it. Originally built by a man as a home for his wife, the place has a weird, lingering sadness to it. Outside the building, there’s a sculpture of them on a bench together. Romantic, in a way, but haunting, in hindsight. They lived on the third floor… which is where I work now. My usual office is under construction, so I’ve been stationed at the front reception desk temporarily.

Now here’s the thing, this isn’t just some old building with creaky floors and bad lighting. The bottom level is underground and houses a federal agency. Because of that, we’ve had all kinds of sketchy activity outside. Local gang members, criminal elements, three people have actually been shot outside the building since it went up. That’s always made me nervous, especially late at night when I’m the last one in the office. Like tonight.

It was 9:25 PM. I was working late to finish onboarding paperwork for a new hire. Just me, alone in the dimly lit lobby, with a podcast in one ear. Everything was quiet until I heard what I can only describe as skittering. Not footsteps. Not creaks. Something light and fast brushing against the floor directly behind my desk. It was so out of place I immediately paused what I was doing, took my AirPod out, and listened.

Nothing. Silence.

I figured maybe one of my coworkers had popped in to grab something, even though it was insanely late. Still, I didn’t see or hear anyone else, so I shrugged it off and got back to typing, but I left the AirPod out this time. And then it happened again.

The skittering. But this time, from down the hallway, the long, unlit hallway that leads to our big industrial printer. Unfortunately, I needed that printer for the new hire’s documents. The lights were all off except in my temporary office and the lobby. That hallway? Pitch black. Like staring into a void.

I grabbed the paperwork and cautiously stepped out. The moment I entered the hallway, I reached for the light switch. The second the light flicked on, my heart stopped.

There, about 15 feet away on the floor, was the most disturbing thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

It was an old woman.

She was wearing a baby pink cardigan, white curly hair, and she was on all fours, belly down, but with her elbows and knees bent upward, almost like a spider. Her back arched unnaturally, limbs bent the wrong way, contorted in a way no human body should be able to manage. Her head twisted toward me, eyes locked on mine, smiling.

But it wasn’t a kind smile. It was knowing. Hungry.

I was frozen. Completely paralyzed. I didn’t even breathe.

Then, and I swear to you, I blinked. Just once. And she was still there… just farther down the hallway. Still looking at me. Still smiling.

I felt something then. Something deep in my gut. Like whatever I was seeing wasn’t just a ghost. It was something wearing a ghost. Something pretending to be her. Mocking her.

And then I snapped. I bolted back to my desk, turned around once I was safely inside, and she was gone. Completely. Like she had never been there.

But I know she was.

And I know I’ve seen her before.

Months ago, I was grabbing a snack from the break room and saw an old woman walk in ahead of me. I didn’t recognize her and was about to ask who she was, but when I walked in, no one was there. Just a lingering, sweet scent. Calvin Klein Eternity. My grandma used to wear it. The smell was thick in the air, like she’d just walked through. I remember thinking it was odd, but I didn’t feel scared. Just… confused.

That scent. It was so strong. Comforting, even.

After that first encounter, I got curious and looked into the building’s history. That’s when I learned about the original owner and his wife, how she’d lived the rest of her life here, growing more and more isolated after her husband died. She eventually passed away on the third floor, alone. They say she had dementia and choked while eating, too far gone to call for help. The story broke my heart. I figured her spirit was just stuck. A loving woman tied to the place she spent her life in.

But what I saw tonight?

That wasn’t her.

It looked like her. Same pink cardigan. Same white curls. But the way it moved, the malice in its eyes, this wasn’t the confused, wandering spirit of a lonely woman.

It was something else.

Something that’s been watching.

And I don’t think it wants to be seen.

I’m still shaking as I type this. My hands are cold. I don’t know if I should come in tomorrow. I don’t know if I can.

But I had to tell someone.

If anyone has any idea what this could be, if you’ve ever seen something like this, please, please let me know. Because I’m afraid whatever I saw tonight… it saw me too.
