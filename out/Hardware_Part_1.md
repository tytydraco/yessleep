If you asked me what I’d be doing with my life when I was in high school, probably dead last on the list would be working at a hardware store in an overgrown Texas town that decided to vainly call itself a city a few decades back. 

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‘ Chuck’ Rogers. The name fits the man, he’s never told me his exact age but he’s well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he’s built like a boxer. 

Me, I’m half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can’t really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he’s been the best boss I’ve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn’t have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

“Derek, where in the hell is your white wash?” Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

“Eamon, I have it on good authority that it’s been in the same place since before I was born. “ I reply, “How’s the kids?” 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

“Trying their best, Steve’s working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she’s taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. “ Eamon complains. 

“Dirty boots clean money. That’ll be $5.80.” I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

“Highway god-damned robbery. “ Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

“I see that truck of yours, you can afford it.” I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I’m originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven’t ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

“ Looks like you didn’t manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. “ He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

“Thought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?” I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

“Bueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?” Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

“The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. “ is my answer. 

I’ll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

“Feel like downing a few at Norm’s? “ chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 “Might-could.” I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, “ As long as my boss doesn’t call me in tomorrow.”

“Son, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we’re sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. “ Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm’s is an odd kind of place. In reality it’s your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it’s trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

“Thanks Ken!” I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it’s an early pass-out or a late night. 

“I forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo’s kid?”  I question. 

“No, he okay?” Chuck asks. 

I’m no where near drunk, but I swear I’ve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He’s spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

“He’s alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It’s a shame, kid was only 18. “  I don’t know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn’t tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

“Which hand?” he asks, deadpan. 

“Right. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn’t. “ I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

“You didn’t say anything wrong. “ Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I’ve learned about Chuck , it’s that when he wants to stop a conversation, it’s best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I’d forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn’t show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn’t handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

“Hey boss, need you to…” I start, trying to get Chuck’s attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It’s early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

“What the hell? You’re day drinking?” I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it’s chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

“Big Tim got in a car wreck last night. “ Chuck says, not turning my way. 

“Yeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He’s going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he’s back home already. “ I explain. 

“I know, went to go see him.” Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I’m guessing is a cup of ¼ coffee and ¾ booze. 

“At what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. “  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

“Lock the door kid, we need to talk.” Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn’t slept, and there’s a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

“You ever experienced something you can’t explain? “ He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

“Wouldn’t say I’ve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I’m sure there is some weird shit out there. “ is my answer. 

“I’m not talking about something ,off. 

I’m talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. “ Chuck’s tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

“Can’t say that I have, you?” I lead. 

“If you’ve got a reefer in your coat, it’d probably help my cause for you to smoke it. “ Chuck begins, with a chuckle, “ What I’ve got to say isn’t very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ’72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that’s going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you’ve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil’s luck. 

By ’70 or so, he’d beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm’s, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we’re talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it’s a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman’s charm and soon enough, he’s made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I’ve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can’t hear the conversation, but I can see what’s going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I’m out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man’s face. 

I’ve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he’s about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn’t going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren’t looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn’t been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don’t remember much in specific, but that knife found it’s way into it’s owner’s chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn’t. I wasn’t going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. “

“So you killed a guy?” I say, shocked.

“Thought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. “ Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I’m believing him or not, “ After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. “ Chuck pauses, he’s actually shaking, “ You think I’m full of shit don’t you?”

“ Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?”

“Every town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they’ve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he’s been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn’t believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.” Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‘coffee’.

“Slow down with that. 

What did you guys do?” I say, whether I believe him or not, I’m interested.

“Nathan, the sheriff’s deputy figured he’d go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what’s the word?”  Chuck asks. 

“Esoteric?” I guess. 

“Seems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn’t have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn’t started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn’t find anything, esoteric, we’d do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic’s shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn’t even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we’re plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy’s hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I’m not so sure. “ Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

“Yeah, I’m definitely not high enough for this. “ I say.

“So you think I’m full of shit?” Chuck accuses. 

“Let’s say I don’t, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?” I ask. 

“Tim was ran off the road. “ Chuck says, “ The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he’ll be seeing us soon.”

“Chuck, I don’t know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I’ve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can’t afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it’s developed legends. “ My tone is a mix of shame and anger, “ And besides, you know me, I’m not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. “

“That’s the problem kid, I’ve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can’t understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don’t need any more of that in your life.

If you’re fixing to leave, I’ve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. “ Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn’t take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I’ve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm’s , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He’s taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I’ve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I’ve seen the inside of a jail cell, I’m not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn’t the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I’m going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I’m on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It’s quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it’s last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it’s owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I’m hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I’m being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don’t see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine’s roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don’t think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can’t see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I’m seeing.

She’s  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker’s leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

“You Chuck’s friend?” she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn’t be asking if she didn’t already know. 

“Yeah, I am. “ I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

“ Good” The woman says, walking toward me, “My name’s River, but you can call me, sir. “ 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

“What do you want?” I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she’s tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

“You fucking deaf, or stupid?” she demands, “ Try that again.”

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

“What did you want, sir?” I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

“There you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. “  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn’t even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

“I wouldn’t. “ She says, bluntly, “ See, I’m a real forgiving type. Being nice, it’s just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn’t really, let things go. “ 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It’s barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can’t see eyes, I’m not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can’t do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I’m alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn’t for the fact I’ve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn’t a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck’s house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

“ We’ve got a week.” I say grimly. 

“We drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?” Chuck asks. 

“You’re the boss. “ I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.
