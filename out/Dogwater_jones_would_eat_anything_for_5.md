I had been friends with Dogwater Jones since we were kids. Sometimes I almost forget his real name was Chris.

Dogwater got his name from a dare: to drink out of his family pet's water dish. Nobody thought he was going to do it, the bowl belonged to a 200 pound St. Bernard that was more drool than fur. Every time that thing would take a drink, it would leave a snail trail of slobber behind it all throughout the house.

Chris said he would do it for five bucks, so me and a couple friends put our money together and sure enough, Chris got down on all fours and stuffed his face into the dish like he was bobbing for apples. From that moment forth there was no more Chris. Just Dogwater.

Dogwaters stunts began to give him a reputation at school, a bunch of boys would approach him with things like a golf ball sized wad of gum they collected from under the school cafeteria tables, or a green French fry that had been hiding under a cupboard for god knows how long. Five bucks, down the hatch.

After graduating high school, Dogwater and I got jobs stocking shelves and sorting produce at a grocery store. That job opened up a whole new world for his eating antics.

One day at work, after demolishing his fill of edible oddities, we were sorting through fruits to put out on display when Dogwater found something awful.

"Check *this* fuckin thing out!"

I turned away from my stack of oranges to see Dogwater holding up what looked like a cross between a leech and a grub.

"Five bucks" he said. The leech-grub writhed between his thumb and index finger. It was fucking vile. It somehow looked wet and dry at the same time, like a freshly polished tile floor. The thing was jet black with an "O" shaped mouth with a rings of razer sharp teeth that seemed to stretch endlessly down this things maw.

I got closer to take a look at it and I could hear it taking short, moist-sounding breaths.

"Don't do it man, that things got to be a parasite" I said.

"C'mon! I've never eaten anything like this before!"

Then our boss walked in.

"The fuck is that? You gonna eat that Dogwater?" He grinned.

"Five bucks"

"Five?! Forget it, for that thing I'll do fifty, but you have to let me get a video".

I saw Dogwaters eyes bulge out of his head, he'd never been offered that sort of money for one of his eating stunts. Before I could stop him, he put the tail of the leech-grub in his mouth and slurped the thing down like a big thick udon noodle, leaving a slimy film over his lips.

Dogwater licked the slime off of his mouth scooby-doo style, and proudly stuck out a hand out to our boss to accept the money. I felt sick to my stomach but our boss was laughing and Dogwater was happy, so that's all that mattered at the time.

Over the next few days, Dogwater began to change. He was eating a lot more than usual and when he wasn't, he looked pale and clammy.

"You ok?"

"Yeah, fine" Dogwater said, shoveling handfuls of cashews into his mouth.

Then our boss strolled in again, but this time with his wife.

"Here he is honey, the man, the myth, the legend, *DOGWATER!*"

His wife scrunched her face up in disgust.

"She was a big fan of your video Dogwater, weren't you honey?" My boss elbowed his wife playfully.

"Nice to meet you" she said flatly, her eyes scanning Dogwater up and down like he might engulf her if she got any closer.

"Lisa here is pregnant!" My boss proudly exclaimed. "It's going to be a few more months until delivery, but the doting husband I am, you'll probably see her around here a lot more so I can wait on her every beck and whim".

As my boss and his wife left, Dogwater turned to me, wide eyed and sweating profusely.

"Do you think they'll let me eat the after-birth after the delivery?"

He sounded almost hopeful and I knew something wasn't right.

The next day, Dogwater reluctantly let me drive him to the hospital to get checked out. He said they looked at him and even took an x-ray but couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. On our way out of the hospital, an employee tripped and knocked over a cart they were pushing full of containers labeled "biohazard" on them. One of them opened up, revealing what appeared to be excess fat from a liposuction surgery or something.

I looked over at Dogwater who seemed hypnotized by the mess, his mouth salivating in a way I had only seen his old pet ST. Bernard do.

A few weeks after our hospital visit and Dogwater began packing on the pounds. He went from around 180 to probably 250 in about a month. He was as pale as the moon and almost never stopped eating or sweating and his stench was unbearable. He had this haunting hollow look in his eyes at all times. 

I had gotten a promotion to be the closing manager, so I didn't see Dogwater as often anymore and I was grateful for that. It was hard to even look at the guy anymore, much less be around him.

I would hang out in my bosses office filing out paperwork and keeping his wife company while she watched soap operas on her phone. Every now and then I would look up and catch a glimpse of Dogwater just standing in the hall, staring in at us.

One night I was getting ready to close up when the fire alarm went off. The store was pretty empty and I quickly rallied up the few customers and employees outside to the front of the store. As I was doing a head count though, I noticed my boss, his wife, and Dogwater were absent.

The fire department was on the other side of town and I was scared by the time they got here it would be too late, so I ran back inside to look for them. Then it dawned on me that I didn't even smell the faintest trace of smoke.

I ran to the back of the store and froze. My boss was on the floor, his throat was cut from ear to ear like a big toothless grin. I ran past him to his office and screamed. Through the window, I could see Dogwater slicing open my bosses wife with an box cutter.

I tried the door but it was locked. I looked through the window again to see my bosses set of keys on the ground next to Dogwater, who was riffling through Lisa's stomach. I could do nothing but look on in horror as he began to pull an unborn fetus out, tilted his head back and began to cram it down his throat like a python would it's prey.

I ran out of the store and called the police. They arrived at the same time as the fire department did and immediately went searching for Dogwater. They never found him though. To this day I cringe when I think about the things he did, and *why* he did them. I think it all goes back to that leech-grub thing. For the life of me I can't remember what fruit it was he found it in either.

I've never seen another since, but I guess that doesn't mean there aren't more of them out there...
