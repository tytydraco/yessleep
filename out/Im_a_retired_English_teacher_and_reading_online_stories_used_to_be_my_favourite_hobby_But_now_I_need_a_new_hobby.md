Bringing my evening stroll to an end due to a haze of early summer rain, I turned the corner into my street.

She was waiting for me, right outside my front yard. I thought it was a new neighbour dropping round to complain about something. Something about her tense stance made me realise that she was not good news.

Her eyes widened when she saw me. “*You’re* Adder\_at\_Night999?”

I frowned. “How do you know my reddit username?”

She shook her head. “It doesn’t matter- listen- I’m not here to hurt you-“

*What?* I looked around- my street set in a greater London borough that still had a quaint village feel was quiet in the early wet evening lull.

She was still talking “-I just want to know why. I just came to talk to you- Why do you always downvote my stories? Everyone loves my stories- everyone- you know that – *you know that*! but you always downvote them- you’re always the first downvote, sometimes the only one - I just had to know why-“ she was babbling at me in a strong accent I can only describe as “typical American”.

“please- let’s go to a coffee shop and talk- I came a long way to visit you, just to know why-, to understand- “ she reached out and gripped my sleeve.

I stood stock still. None of the few people I knew real life knew my reddit account, or my fondness for the scary stories that people post on Reddit. I stared at the middle-aged woman confronting me. She was wearing a glossy new-looking cream-colored mac and lipstick.

Her other hand moved in her pocket. In an instant, the fright that had been gathering since she said my Reddit username broke over me like a splash of cold water from a bucket. I ripped my hand loose, turned and ran to my front door, frantically scrabbling for my keys.

She followed me, reached out, opened the door that was unlocked, and somehow pushed me in. I am not a large strong woman, simply a retired Eng Lit teacher with a weakness for Reddit, and no match for this agitated American Redditor.  

We both stood in the dark hallway, her back to the front door. Hands slippery from sweat, I tried to pull out my mobile.

She repeated “I only want to talk to you. Please. I know you have time- you spend all your time on Reddit!” her voice rose slightly, now audibly tinged with madness.

She must have heard it too. She gulped hard, and then said calmly “Aren’t you going to offer me a cup of tea? That’s what you British folk do, right? I travelled a long way to see you! Where’s those famous British manners?” she aimed for a jokey tone.

 “Let me put the kettle on” I said mechanically.

Her hand moved in her pocket again.  “Okay”.

I went to the kitchen, filled the kettle and turned it on. She stood in the doorway, watching me get out two mugs.

“I’m not here to hurt you” she repeated. I nodded, staring at the kettle. “It’s just, I had to find out who you were, why you downvote my stories. You don’t look anything like I imagined- I thought you were some neckbeard basement troll and you were downvoting me because most my stories are about women’s issues. But then I did some digging, and found out- you’re just an old woman, just a few years older than me- that kinda makes it worse - don’t you have any female solidarity? I just had to come and speak to you, see what the problem was-”

The kettle was still cold and silent.

“It doesn’t work like that, you know” I said cautiously, willing the kettle to boil.

“And you have this nice place”, she said, looking around appreciatively “Looks like a house right from Midsomer Murders!” The jokey tone again. The kettle began making very tiny noises.

“What’s your Reddit name?” I asked, hoping I sounded friendly.

“Oh come on hun, you must know me. I’m WitchSea1994!” She said it quite proudly. 

I remembered her stories. It was beyond me how anyone could upvote her cliché jumble of gory fantasy. But there was no doubt she was very popular. I nodded. “I quite like your stories” I said. The noises from the kettle were becoming a tiny bit louder.

She frowned. “Then why do you always downvote them?” she snapped, and took a step towards me. *"Always!"*

I took a step back. The kettle was now boiling. “I don’t always downvote them” I muttered.

Her eyes sparked. “Every one! Every single one, you downvote. And you’re often the first. I monitor all my stories- I chart the upvotes and downvotes in excel- and you’re always dragging me down! I even know you make fake accounts just to downvote stories!!” she was howling now, and she lunged towards me.

I grabbed the kettle and splashed the boiling water right into her distorted face. She screamed in agony, and I was able to push past, run through the open door into the street, dialling 999. I have never felt so comforted by hearing the sirens and then seeing the blue flashing lights only moments later.  

I haven’t been on Reddit since. But I know I need a new hobby, one that doesn't involve cyberspace and scary stories as much.
