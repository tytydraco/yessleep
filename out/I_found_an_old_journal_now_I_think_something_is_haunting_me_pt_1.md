Finding that stupid journal was my first mistake. My second mistake was opening it. My third? Reading it. Now Something is following me but when I look back it's not there and I feel like I'm going crazy.

Right, let me start at the beginning so this all makes sense. When I started my new job at the library in the town I live about thirty minutes from I was excited. Books were my passion. Getting to read books all day in between stocking them onto shelves seemed so exciting. At first, everything was fine, I reread some of my favorite series from when I was a kid. Harry Potter, Warrior Cats, Wings of Fire, and Shadow Falls. When I finished all that I went looking for new books. Instead, I found this old leather-bound journal. The handwriting was oddly familiar but besides that, I started to read it right away. This is the first few pages.

*August 4th, 1834*  
*Today while walking home I saw something... odd. A creature, in my peripheral vision that stayed just out of sight. It started to follow me after I had touched some stone in the market. Oh well, I don't have time to focus on that I need to figure out why my cows keep dropping. If they keep doing that I won't be able to survive through the winter. Oh Well, I need to get to harvesting and drying what I can from the few that are left alive.*

*December 2nd, 1834*  
*The creature is getting bigger and bigger but also shrinking whenever I can slightly see any features. Surviving the winter has been harder than I expected. My guard dog died a few days ago and the horse is looking weak. Perhaps I should have a bishop come out to look over my property. I've been getting horrible headaches in the mornings as well.*

After reading those two entries I immediately put it down, this was someone's diary! Seeing a small black creature in my peripheral vision I shook my head, I must have been hallucinating. Since then I've noticed I've been getting the headaches the author mentioned in their second entry, I even get the same creature.

It's started to invade my house. My cat died suddenly a few months ago. But really makes this the nail in the coffin? My cat was nine months old. So immediately I went to my local bishop. I couldn't enter the church for some reason. So I went home and called him instead.

"Bishop George, thank you for picking up."

"Of course of course!" His jovial voice rang out over the phone. "What seems to be the issue, Cynthia?"

"I found this old journal a few months ago, I read it and now I'm seeing something out of the corner of my eye, my cat died, I keep these pounding headaches and I'm so full of nausea all the time." I rambled slightly as I rubbed my temples.

"Right, I'll come by this Friday and see what I can do to help okay? Or could you come to the church?"

"I can't, I already tried, I can't enter it for whatever reason."

"Well that is concerning, I will see you Friday Cynthia I promise."

"Thank you, Bishop George. I appreciate it so much."

Once Friday had rolled around I was surprised to wake up frozen. I also wasn't in my bed, I was staring at the open journal on my desk. I had written in it, but it was an unknown language to me. When I googled the words it was Croatian. This is the translation.

*4/21/2022*  
*Today I saw the creature once more. It keeps returning and I can't seem to figure out why. Hopefully, the sacrifice will help it disappear.*

Obviously, I couldn't have Bishop George over then but by the time I was able to move he had already arrived, but it was like something was keeping him outside of my house. We both tried for an hour to make it to where he could enter but he just couldn't.

Sighing out a small huff I crossed my arms. "This, I don't understand why this isn't working. You should be able to enter just fine. But it's probably for the best that you can't."

"And what do you mean by that Cynthia? I've been your bishop since you moved to this town six years ago and you've always welcomed me happily."

"Well... I woke up to a new journal entry, in my handwriting. Apparently, you're supposed to be a sacrifice?"

"Well, that is disturbing." He placed a hand on his chin as he hummed in thought. "I'm going to go to the church and make a call, I will be right back."

Making my way onto my porch I sighed as I sat in one of my chairs.

"-Yes, yes thank you, I'll let her know, any idea how many days it could be?... Got it, a week at a minimum." With that, he came to sit beside me. "Good news, they'll be sending a bishop with holy water in a week at the least, bad news; you're most certainly haunted and if it isn't resolved with what you sound you found it could end terribly."

"Yeah, I figured that much honestly. Thank you for trying George."

"Of course, anytime you need help you give me a ring."

My question to you guys is, do you have any idea what this could be? The other bishop has yet to show up. My symptoms are getting worse and I can't seem to get in contact with George. I can barely leave my house on a good day as is anymore. On bad days when the headaches just make it hard to think without wanting to eat its impossible. And don’t ask me what I want to eat, I have absolutely no idea what I know I’m just ravenous and nothing can calm the hunger anymore. Any help is appreciated.
