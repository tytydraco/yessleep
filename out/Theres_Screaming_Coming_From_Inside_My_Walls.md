Hey so this is my first ever creepy/nosleep post so I'd like to apologize ahead of time if things are jumbled or I ramble over details. I feel now is a good time to share my experience with people as I believe I have healed. So with that out of the way, let's get into it.

At the time, I (23M), had finally moved out of my dad's house and into my own, kinda spacious, two bedroom apartment. The place I got into was a really nice neighborhood, very little crime, close to stores, restaurants, main roads, gas stations, everything I needed. The people living there were really friendly and I made a few friends during the time I lived there. 

The first person I met and became my best friend was this taller girl that was about my height. Now I'm no green giant. I stand at around 5'11 and have been 180 pounds since high school and she was around that range as well. 

So anyways, Kiwi, the nickname she told me her parents had given her growing up, was about 4 months younger than me, had black-and-white dyed hair, split down the middle that sat just at her shoulders, darker hazel-brown big eyes, a small cute face, and wore dark grunge-like clothing. 

For me, I'm just the average guy you don't normally notice or pay much attention to, black hair, dark brown eyes, and I always wore black or dark colors, grunge as well, but more tech wear. 

So let's back up a bit. I'm driving from my dad's house to my new apartment. The feeling of independence washed over me the closer we got to my new home and the drive blurred by while I imagined how I'd decorate the place. Finally arriving, pulling into the gated community, I'm greeted by the landlord. 

Looking like he hadn't slept in a good week, he was extremely pale and visibly sweating as he handed me my apartment keys. Granna, as I called her from about 2 years old til present day, and my dad suggested getting food before they arrived. Perfect! I'm starving since it was about midday and I hadn't eaten yet. 

At my new place, I started unpacking things I could manage by myself: computer tower, broken-down L desk, microwave, etc. After about 15 minutes of unpacking, I started to get the eerie feeling I'm being watched. Dismissing the feeling I thought, 

'Well duh, you just got here in a big U-Haul moving into a new neighborhood. Of course people are watching you.' 

Standing in the back of the U-Haul, I hear a cheery voice behind me. 

"Excuse me." 

Startled, as I didn't recognize the voice, I turned to see Kiwi— as I mentioned from before, she was looking up at me from around the edge of the U-Haul with big hazel-brown eyes and a sweet smile. I said howdy— as it's something I normally say, and no I'm not country— and made my way out of the truck to be eye level with her. 

"You're my next door neighbor at apartment 1000L, right?" she asked.

"Yeah that's me. I should've moved in a few days ago, but since it's been raining a lot, I wanted to wait 'til it stopped," I followed with a question, 

"How long you been livin' here?"

Kiwi looks in the back of the U-Haul at my remaining furniture, huffed with a pout, and propped her head up in her hand leaning on the edge of the U-Haul.

"Mmm...I wanna say it's close to six months. I moved out—or well, was kicked out of my mom's place by my stepdad," She replied. We looked at the remaining heavy things. Washer, dryer, mattress and stuff like that. Not wanting to press the matter anymore I muttered a, 'Ahh, gotcha, gotcha.'

"What made you choose this place?" 

She asked, turning to look me dead in my eyes as her smile drops. I noticed her eyebrows furrow as if she was studying me or confronting me for something I did. 

"W-What? What d- what do you mean?" 

I stammered out. To be honest, I didn't realize how pretty she was, so the direct eye contact made me nervous. She repeated her question and I told her the normal, 'it was cheap and close to work' so she nodded, her smile returning and we talked for a good few minutes while I waited for my dad and Granna to arrive. 

I looked up hearing a car pull up next to the U-Haul minutes later. With multiple food bags in hand, they get out the car and I introduce them to Kiwi before my dad and I finish unloading the remaining furniture from the U-Haul.

We finish unloading and my dad offered to take the U-Haul back for me, since it was getting dark and he wanted me to get settled in my new place. I agreed, gave him the keys, hugged him and Granna, said our goodbyes—then they left. 

Kiwi and I watched them drive off before we turned to walk to my apartment. We went inside and I invited Kiwi inside and we went to my room to set up my PC. I didn't mind Kiwi being around and in my apartment. 

Even though I just met her—I felt safe and comfortable with her around me. It was like I had known her all my life and we clicked instantly and hung out every day. We shared the same interest, tastes in music, food, and work schedules. We talked about PC's and how I plan to set up everything in my home and she offered to help me decorate. I agreed because, why not? 

Over the next week or so, Kiwi would bring decor and random items she bought to my apartment to decorate. Kiwi complimented me on the coffee smell of my apartment and instinctively I just said thank you before thinking I didn't own anything coffee scented, nor did I drink coffee. 

After the second week, I kept getting this feeling of complete and utter dread as I set up the furniture. I also couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Like someone was right against my back with wide eyes staring at the back of my head. 

A little context, I have always been able to sense if someone was trying to sneak up on me, standing by or just out of my sight, or was trying to be quiet around me since I was a kid, and that feeling was going absolutely haywire. I heard what I thought was my front door open—since Kiwi left for Best Buy to get LED strip lights and surround speakers for my TV and I gave her a copy of the key to my apartment so she could let herself in since she was over everyday. I left the second bedroom to greet her—but the door was still closed. 

'What..?' 

I thought, looking around the apartment and attempted to fight the unease. I walked to the front door to check— the doorknob and top lock were still engaged. Confused, I returned to the second bedroom, then that's when I noticed—one wall stood out. There was a fresh wall of white paint compared to the other slightly dingy walls around the apartment. Turning to look at other walls around the place, I returned my attention back to the wall.

'Why didn't I notice this..?' 

I stared at the wall. Feeling dizzy and a sense of dread, I was snapped from the trance when I heard keys in my door and Kiwi call out 'Hey it's me!' as my front door swung open. Kiwi walked in with a big box and some plastic bags. 

I turned to walk out of the bedroom to help Kiwi with everything—glancing back briefly to look at the wall. 

"You...okay?"

she asked, tilting her head and raising an eyebrow at me. I returned my attention to her, grabbing the box and said, 

"Yeah I'm all good," before continuing, "Did you start to walk in then leave earlier or like, forget your key?" She made this confused sound and raised her eyebrow higher. 

"No I just got back." 

She raised her freehand showing her car keys and the house key on her keyring. Embarrassed, I forced a smile and changed the subject. 

"Oh, nevermind. Damn, a little overboard, huh?"

I asked, a bit surprised by all the equipment.

"I want to help you feel at home, so I figured I should at least get some good speakers and lights," 

she beamed brightly, proud of everything she was holding. We sorted speakers, cords, and LED lights. We carefully put the speaker mounts on the wall and hung the LED lights around the ceiling edge of all the rooms in the apartment. 

I put on some music to set the atmosphere and to test the speaker since they had bluetooth connection. I love 'Shoegaze' so, I immediately put on a mix of my favorite artists Sai Nara, Novulent, and whatsaheart. I found out Kiwi liked the same type of music so we talked, exchanged music for a while mixed with light flirting.

The feeling of dread hit me again and I decided to ask questions. 

"Hey, Kiwi?" 

I asked, unease settling in the gut. 

"What's up?" 

she looked up at me from the box with her big hazel-brown eyes with a smile. 

"What's with the landlord?"

I asked, a pretty open-ended question thinking about it now. 

"What do you mean?" 

she asked pursing her lips as she folded the empty box. 

"Well like...what...two weeks ago, I think, he was really pale and sweaty—like he'd seen a ghost or something. He handed me the keys without a word and practically ran back to the office."

 She stood up and set the folded box against the breakfast bar with a worried expression. 

"Well...the last tenants that lived here were a bit...strange..."

 she started. "Strange how?" I asked, noticing she seemed more timid and uneasy. 

"The family that was here, they were all just...I don't know—weird. It was a husband, his wife, I assume, and a little boy no older than 14-15 years old."

She grabbed my hand and led me to sit on the couch, I sat down next to her, and turned the music way down. 

"I never heard the guy talk but he always had coffee with him and smelled like it when I passed him. The woman was really sweet and would bring me pies she baked every so often." 

"The son was a bit of a nutcase as well. He would always come to my apartment and ask if he could stay with me or if he could hang out with me. I always told him no because, ya know, that's just plain weird. But when I closed my door, he would just stand at my door for almost 10 minutes before his mom would come grab his hand."

she explained seeming to flip between being upset, bothered, and worried. My interest was peaked, with a raised brow and an intrigued expression.

"What else?" 

I asked, curiosity getting the best of me. 

"Only at night did I hear the man talk, but it wasn't talking, it was...shouting. Followed by banging, things crashing, and I guess breaking. Last time I saw the woman, she brought me a cherry and peach mixed pie and didn't say a word this time."

"I noticed she had bags under her eyes, looked miserable, scared, missing her left middle finger and her index on her right hand. It looked like it was crudely cut off. I considered myself a very observant girl and I remember thinking it was strange because I was more than certain she had all her digits the last time we talked." 

Drained of color, Kiwi took a deep breath and cleared her throat before continuing to talking. 

"After about a month or so of nightly screaming, police visiting the apartment, and more concerning noises, she stopped bringing pies, I never saw her or the little boy, and the screaming stopped. It was like they disappeared." 

I noticed Kiwi was shaken so I went into my kitchen and grabbed her a can of Sprite. I sat down a little closer offering a little comfort as she continued. 

"I took a day off work because I wasn't feeling well and I heard banging followed by sounds of scraping or cutting and something very dense breaking. Like if you fell and broke your arm. About a week after, police were everywhere because apparently they broke their lease and vanished without a trace."

"I passed by one day on my way to work and the door was open with police tape blocking the entrance. I saw smashed furniture, broken toys, and blood everywhere—on the carpets, walls, and the ceiling." 

Kiwi scooted over and leaned on me and I noticed she was shivering really bad. I hugged her and gently tried to console her. I also didn't realize I was holding my breath and let out a long sigh. 

"Jesus...What do you think happened to the family?" 

All Kiwi did was shake her head. Not wanting to push her to a panic attack or anything, I turned on the TV and went to make dinner to try and calm her down. I made a meal we both really liked, Chicken Alfredo and garlic bread. It seemed to work calming her down and she was back to her normal cheery self.

After maybe an hour, it was nearing 10 p.m. I asked Kiwi if she had work tomorrow, and she told me no—so I suggested hanging out then since I was off as well. Kiwi agreed but I noticed something was bothering her. Since we spent almost every waking hour together besides when we worked or slept, I could tell something was off. Drying the washed dishes I ask, 

"What's wrong, Kiwi? You have the look on your face again." 

"Can...I stay here tonight? I don't want to be alone if that's okay.." 

I figured she was spooked from what she told me and feeling bad and a little excited at the thought of it, I agreed. I offered her my room, so she could have privacy, and I'd take the couch but she insisted we share the bed. My heart skip a beat at her words and I agreed—maybe a little too quick.

Around 11:30 p.m., I was on my PC playing Star Wars Battlefront 2—fire game—and I was stuck on one of the stupid flight combat missions where you have to defend the Y-Wing, when Kiwi walked into my room ready for bed. 

Turning to look at her, I saw she was wearing a grey oversized Spider-Man T-shirt and loose black track shorts. Shutting down my PC, turning the LEDs to a dim purple, I then crawled into bed next to her. We talked for a good hour, sharing memes, and watching Tiktok before we dozed off. 

I randomly woke up in a panic, drenched in sweat, breathing heavy, with the unmistakable feeling of dread—and being watched. I felt around for my phone, which was by my hip, playing some Bonelabs video over and over since I fell asleep watching TikTok, I closed the app and looked at the time.

2:58 a.m. 

'Did I have a nightmare?'

I thought as I tried to sit up, but felt like something was weighing me down. When I looked down, I saw a head of black-and-white hair on my chest. Adjusting my eyes under the dim purple light, I could see it was Kiwi, curled against me making my heart skipped a beat, we were cuddling.

'Oh that's right... She wanted to spend the night...'

Carefully slipping out of her bear hug and heading for the kitchen for a glass of water, I glanced over as I passed the second bedroom, and froze. Under the dim purple light, I saw two people standing in the middle of the room. Doubling back, I peeked around the corner—nothing. Blinking a few times in utter disbelief, I thought to myself,

'Um...okay...I guess...,' 

Not knowing what to think of what I knew I saw, I stepped inside the room. Under the dim purple light, I saw unpacked boxes labeled "Kitchen" or "Dining Room," a bit of furniture, and then...that wall. That brand new coat of paint still stood out like a sore thumb. 

Stepping into the room I noticed the temperature dropped—then came the smell. It was like something was on the verge of rotting. But, I noticed another smell. Was it...Coffee...? I winced in disgust staring at the wall.

Beep Beep. 

A digital watch. 'Oh, it's 3 A.M.,' I thought instinctively and abnormally calm. Then I froze, felt my blood run cold, and my eyes widen. 

I don't own a watch. 

Starting to back up in horror, I sensed someone watching me and saw a figure out the corner of my eye, peeking at me from the doorway. Just as I turned, they disappeared. I carefully stepped just outside the room and look around only to be greeted by the door to the laundry room on my right and the living room and dining room on my left.

'That's weird...was that a chi-' 

then I heard the blood curdling scream of a woman from the room I left. I snapped around, and the purple LEDs were different—like a blacklight. I scanned the room, white splatter stains on the walls, floors, windows, and ceiling, except for one. 

That wall was spotless. 

I swallowed hard as I walked up to the wall. I don't know what made me do it, but very slowly, I put my hand to the wall— 

Thump-thump. 
Thump-thump. 

A heartbeat.

Thump-thump. 
Thump-thump. 

Two heartbeats. 

It was like there were people living in the wall. The smell of rot got more pungent as I got close to the wall— overpowering the subtle smell of coffee. I heard a muffled low groan that started getting louder and louder until it became a loud ear ringing scream. I yanked my hand back to cover my ringing ears, then suddenly, the LEDs flicked off and I was swallowed in total darkness. I blinked a few times to adjust to the sudden darkness, then flinched as the bright ceiling light clicked on. 

"Are you okay?" 

I turned to see Kiwi standing in the doorway, rubbing sleep from her eyes. Her hair was messy and the black track shorts she wore hung loosely around her small waist and the oversized Spider-Man T-shirt she wore drooped off one shoulder. I composed myself.  

"Uh—yeah. I-I was just...looking for something in this box." 

I stammered, grabbing a nearby box marked "Toaster" and holding it up. She raised an eyebrow, confused, yawned, then turned to walk to the kitchen. I followed as Kiwi grabbed the Brown Sugar Pop-Tarts I had in the pantry. 

Walking into the kitchen and placing the box on the counter, I carefully opened the box. Kiwi stepped next to me and gently placed her hands on mine with a concerned expression.

"What happened? Why are you shaking?"

Looking down—Kiwi's hands on mine—I noticed how badly I was shaking. Blinking a few times, I took a deep breaths to calm myself. 

"Uh-Sorry..." chuckling weakly, "I guess I freaked myself out over nothing."

Internally, I beat myself up for saying that as I managed to calm myself. Kiwi grabbed me and turned me to face her. She was maybe a foot from my face, she had sleep lines from my shirt, had a concerned look, and had her small hands on my arms.

"What happened? Tell me everything."

I swallowed hard, nervous if I should actually tell her everything that just happened. Reluctantly, I tell Kiwi everything. I sat at the breakfast bar and explained everything in complete detail. I mentioned the figure, scream, coffee and rot smell— everything. She seems to believe me as we talk over toasted Pop-Tarts when suddenly her eyes dart to the second bedroom and her face goes pale. 

Feeling the creeping dread, I asked her what is it. She didn't say a word, just stared. I felt multiple eyes on my back and slowly turn around. Peeking from the now completely blacked doorway, were two pair of eyes. My blood ran cold as I noticed one pair was much higher than the other. Resembling what could be a mother and her child.

"It's them..."

Kiwi whimpered out just above a whisper. Only moving my eyes to glance at her then look back, I realized she was talking about the Mother and her child. Standing up and moving to protect Kiwi in case something happened, the moment I turned my back and blocked her view by accident the room returned to normal. 

The familiar dim purple glow of LEDs was back and the apartment was silent. I swallowed, hard, then slowly walked to the second bedroom. It. REEKED. The smell of rot, decay, and coffee filled the room. 

"No...no no no nonononono..." 

Kiwi began sobbing and grabbed my arm tightly. I flicked the bright room light on and a trembling gasp escaped my lips and my arm dropped loosely at my side. The wall, was bowed and a deep red. 

"Ca- Call the po- Call the police!"

Managing to get the words out my trembling mouth, Kiwi rushed to the safety of my room to get her phone. I don't know why, but I slowly walked towards the protrusion. Merely a foot away, I reached my hand out. Without even touching it the wall broke with a sickening sound and everything inside came tumbling out and I fell, scrambling backwards. 

Crudely severed body parts tumbled out, hitting my boxes and furniture. I saw legs, arms, and fingers belonging to what looked like a woman and smaller child. My breath came in ragged gasps trying to process everything when I noticed.

Spilling from the wall, a mix of blood, body parts and clothes—were coffee grounds. Like, BUCKETS full of coffee grounds. I sat there for what felt like hours when Kiwi's scream snapped me back. Without thinking I jumped up and hugged her, gently rubbing the back of her hair trying to console her heavy sobs as we stepped out of the apartment and waited for the police. 

After what felt like hours, the police arrived, and basically sprinted up the stairs to the second floor landing where Kiwi and I were sitting. Without a word, I stood and opened the door as several officers rushed in.

I heard a 'Jesus Christ' and a someone gag as a few officers escorted Kiwi and I to their cruisers for questioning as more police, ambulance, and curious residents lined the streets. 

It was mostly a blur of red and blue lights, medical exams, and questions as the police quarantined the area. My dad was called since he was an emergency contact and picked up Kiwi and I. The drive to his house was long and quiet with the occasional hand squeeze from Kiwi or my dad asking if she and I were alright. 

About an hour later, we get to my dad's house. He showed us to the first floor guest room and left us to go upstairs to his and his fiancées room. I walked into the bathroom and flicked on the light.

My face was splattered with blood and coffee grounds. I washed my face vigorously, maybe 3-4 times before Kiwi came to check on me. Few hours later, it was nearing 7 a.m. My dad and his fiancée had left for work and it was just Kiwi and I.

Stressed, tired, and craving sleep we decided, well we're all adults here, to be intimate before finally passed out from exhaustion. I was woken by my phone ringing.

It was the Sheriff. He asked me a few more questions, which I answered truthfully and told him the same thing I told the officers and after about 45 minutes we got off the phone. A manhunt was put out for the husband and he was later arrested at an airport 4 states over trying to flee the country. 

The sheriff, even thought he didn't have to, explained the husband confessed to killing his family. The wife caught him cheating and threatened to divorce him, taking the kid and all the man's belongings. The sheriff mentioned the husband's search history contained aspects of hiding a body, how to dismember, and how to conceal corpse smell.

The husband had been planning this for months. dating back to almost a year possibly two. Searched his truck and found several industrial buckets with coffee grounds and tools covered in blood.

Months later, I've turned 25 and it's almost New Year's Eve, Kiwi and I are together and since the landlord actually knew about the situation, I was given a lot of money for emotional compensation and for the loss of some of my personal belongings. Since they were contaminated and soaked in blood. I now live comfortably.

The nightmares stopped around this time and I was finally feeling good to move on with my life and put all of this behind me. It is now 2025 and Kiwi and I have our first baby on the way. We're anxious and excited, ready for our new chapter in life.

If you made it this far, I want to say thank you for taking the time to read about my experience and I really do hope you enjoyed it and/or learned something from it. Be careful out there.
