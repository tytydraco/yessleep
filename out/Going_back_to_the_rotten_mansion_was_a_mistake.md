You ever tell a story that you think is light hearted and funny only to have people look at you horrified and concerned? That’s what happened when I told some friends about my childhood memory and The Can Man.

James had just finished retelling the hog farm story when one of the two cute girls we were trying to impress looked at me for confirmation. I simply nodded along, of course half his story was wildly embellished, as all good stories are. But I wouldn’t be the one to rat him out.

The blonde, I had already forgotten her name, had an amused look on her face as she took another sip of whatever filled the red solo cup in her hand. 

“And what about you?” She asked me over the loud background music, “Are you also fearless in the face of certain death?” 

Attractive girls had a way of bringing out the talkative yet unintelligent side of me. “Uh yeah nah not really, I never had the opportunity to find out”. 

I don’t know why but an old memory surfaced and rode the fireball whiskey right out of my mouth, “well there was the Can Man but like I don’t think I was fully in danger”. 

James shot me an inquisitive look, I realized I hadn’t told him that story despite being roommates for a year now. 

“The Can Man?” asked the brunette. She looked genuinely curious, or maybe just a lot less drunk than the rest of us. 

The story started to bubble out, I think I just wanted to keep them interested in us. Or maybe I was a little jealous of James and his hog story, but either way I found myself dragging up a childhood memory piece by piece. 

“I was like ten, maybe a little younger. My dad and I were going to see my Grandpa’s house. Not like the one he lived in, he lived in a trailer on the property but the original house. A big ole mansion that he let fall into disrepair”. 

They looked confused and I’m sure my lack of sobriety made it hard to comprehend everything but the story kept gushing out. 

“Grandpa abandoned the place after  Grandma died, I don’t know why. We didn’t really see much of him. Anyways Dad and I went up to the place. It was huge, three stories, big windows and a set of double doors. The whole place looked like crap”.

I took a drink of the cinnamon concoction in my cup. “We had to kick the front door open, Grandpa swore he left it unlocked but clearly he hadn’t and we weren’t going to walk all the way back to his single wide to search for the key”. 

“So we get inside and it’s pretty bad, kudzu up the walls and across the floor. Massive water stains covering the ceilings and all that.” 

“What really threw us off though was this large nest like thing in the living room. There was a ring of old clothes and trash, in the center was a pile of empty bean cans. Like pinto beans and kidney beans. Just a massive pile of them all moldy and shit”. 

James elbowed me, the girls look of slight interest had turned into disgust. 

“So uh, yeah. We put the stuff outside, cleaned up and locked the place up tight. The next day we unlock everything and all the junk was right back in the living room. Dad decided the place was a loss and we left. He would get weirdly quiet if I ever brought it up so I stopped. The place is just empty now”.

My voice trailed off, I knew I had brought the mood down and butchered the story. 

An awkward pause hung in the air, the blonde looked around the room as if hoping an acceptable excuse to leave would appear. 

To my surprise the brunette didn’t seem put off, “kudzu huh? So you’re a local boy?” She knew her fauna.

“Yeah I actually grew up just a couple hours from here, my Grandpa’s land is literally just one town over”. 

Her eyes lit up, “could we see it? The haunted house?” 

I was way too drunk to be driving anywhere, and my grandpa was senile to the point of being borderline dangerous. So of course I told the pretty girl yes. 

Luckily Samantha, the brunette, was fairly sober. When she offered to drive her friend Jenn suddenly took an interest in coming along. Before common sense could kick in James, myself and Jenn were crammed into the back of Samantha’s Dodge Neon. Why no one sat in the front I’m not sure. 

I was painfully aware of how low Jenn’s halter top was each time I had to lean over her to tell Samantha which corner to take. Her and James were having an overly loud conversation about Samantha’s borderline obsession with haunted locations.

I didn’t think the place was haunted, just creepy. But I didn’t say anything, it was going to be fun either way. 

We hadn’t printed up a MapQuest so I was navigating the dark roads by memory. Either my decade old memory or the alcohol led me wrong because what should have been an hour drive took three. 

Samantha was swerving pretty bad and I was starting to think we were lost when finally, I saw the familiar gate. It was rustier and smaller than I remembered but there was no doubt it was the right one. 

“Pull over here, that’s the entrance”. Samantha did as she was told, the grass growing up from the driveway stood tall enough to block her headlights. 

“Dude this is sick, is your family like royalty or something?” James admired the stone pillars holding up the gate. 

I walked up to the familiar iron construct, it opened with a gentle push. Despite its appearance the hinges were silent. 

“We should probably walk in, Grandpa can be a little jumpy. He might notice a car pulling up”. 

Jenn looked doubtful, “are you sure this is it? The place looks abandoned”. 

I nodded in affirmation, “this is the back, there’s another entrance that leads to the mobile home. No one comes in this way since the main house sits empty”. 

Samantha had a tiny keychain light. I tried using the screen on my flip phone but it was too dim. We basically walked the abandoned driveway by braille. 

Samantha and I led the way, she trudged steadily through the brush while Jenn hid behind James allowing him to clear the way. 

A bottle of something vodka-based appeared, after a few shared swigs we were back in high spirits. I couldn’t be bothered to care about the amount of noise we were making as we stumbled into each other and the girls giggled over incomprehensible jokes. 

The euphoria didn’t last, as soon as my eyes found the old house I felt sober. The alcohol in my stomach transformed from a warm comforting liquid into a hard lump of slick bile. 

The others clearly did not share my misgivings as they rushed up the steps. The wood complained loudly but did not fail in its duty to uphold them. 

I swallowed down the nights various drinks as they tried to escape me. A flash of a memory, or maybe a memory of a dream crashed into my head. 

A pale face at the top of a rotten staircase, peering down at a child. At me. 

I nearly screamed as Samantha grabbed my arm, “come on! Let’s check it out, give us the tour!” 

The excitement in her pretty green eyes washed away any all traces of fear. She had a warm infectious smile. Sometimes I wonder if she still does. 

Reservations pushed aside I followed the waiting trio inside. It was horribly dark. Samantha’s little light illuminated at best a three foot section of the floor. The house had decayed quite a bit since my last visit a decade prior. 

Going through the main entrance led is into the foyer, hallways led to the left and right while the house funneled attention deeper into its bowls. 

The windows whose size had once been the pride of the county now stood covered entirely. The invasive vegetation planted a generation before even my parents were born had taken over. 

“I swear if a feel a spider on me I’m gonna freak out” commented Jenn as she ducked through the doorway to my left.

The tiny slivers of moonlight that filtered between the vines did little to chase away the shadows and abyss like corners. 

The previously loud group had fallen into a reverent silence. Seeing the ornate banister that spiraled up into the unknown sent a painful spasm through me. 

Why though? This place should be as foreign to me as it is to the others. One visit a decade ago shouldn’t be enough to imprint a memory so electric. 

I couldn’t bring myself to look up, I knew nothing was up there. The stairs didn’t even match the weird dream like memory. Still. I kept my gaze low as we passed. 

The kitchen was the darkest room yet, Samantha held my arm with one hand while keeping the feeble light outstretched with the other. 

Her hand was warm and slightly sweaty. I didn’t mind at all. James and Jenn lagged behind us, we didn’t have to guess as to where they were. Both were naturally loud people whose personalities had been magnified by their consumption of various drinks. 

Samantha and I chuckled as either Jenn or James crashed into some form of furniture. They laughed loudly before Jenn let out a gleeful squeal. 

The smile on my face froze, my stomach twisted once again. Jenn’s squeal lifted above us as her and James ran up the stairs. 

Samantha pulled in my hand, “come one we better make sure those two don’t get into trouble”. 

Reluctantly I followed her down the dank hall. My legs felt heavy as I took the steps two at a time. Samantha practically flew up the stairs, her light going with her. 

 My legs felt unwilling to trespass onto the hardwood. My fear of being seen as a coward outweighed my fear of the unknown abyss.

Much like the lower level the second floor was darkened with mold and dirt. We passed bedrooms, bathrooms and even the collapsed shelves of a modest library. 

James called out from down the hallway, “yo I think there’s a third level!” 

The girls and I rushed over. James stood at the base of a narrow dark staircase. 

It felt like the room temperature dropped,  my getting became fuzzy.

A young boy too far from his father, a pale face in the dark. 

I squeezed my eyes shut. My fists clenched so hard blood began to seep from between my fingers. 

The tall figure descended the steps, the boy didn’t scream, why didn’t he scream? Why hadn’t I ran when I had the chance? 

There was screaming though, it wasn’t in my memory. It was Samantha. 

James swore and bumped into me. I opened my eyes, I found myself looking up. At the top of the staircase was the outline of a man. 

Than he came down. 

We ran. Like frightened sheep before a rabid wolf we ran. Had there been room I would have charged past Samantha and Jenn and left them behind. 

As it was we reached the stairs in a bundle of terrified limbs and unsteady legs, one tumbled and all the rest followed. 

Ignoring the pain I managed to get to my feet first. James yelled my name, I didn’t stop. 

It was only when something caught my foot and I found myself sprawled across the carpet that I began to think more clearly. Where was the door? I should have been out by now. 

The carpet stunk and was rippled into large lumps. I cut my arm on something as I got to my hands and knees. Cursing I flung my arm no doubt throwing blood across the room. 

The clattering of tin under my feet froze me, no. It couldn’t be. 

I felt in the dark with my foot. Round empty food cans littered the floor. I stood in a nest of dirty clothes and tin cans. 

I turned knowing exactly what I would I find. The living room was almost imperceptible in the dark but my memory of it was vivid. 

The dust smelled the same, the moist carpet and dirty cans were back. The warm breath on my neck, the hands on my shoulders. 

Tears streamed down my face yet I didn’t move, I didn’t cry out. 

The spell was shattered as James let out a war cry and crashed into the devil that haunted my dreams. 

They slammed into the wall, broken from my paralysis I kicked at the man as he attempted to stand. 

James got to his feet, he didn’t tell me to run. He didn’t need to. He took one glance at the clumps of rotting clothes and knew we needed to go. 

Just like that we were running, through the dark house, out the door, onto the ground. Headlights exploded from ahead. The poor Neon rode on the rev limiter as Jenn swung the back door open. Samantha executed a hand brake turn rotating the car to face away from us.

James was faster, he managed to jump entirely into the car. My leap was poorly timed and my legs bashed painfully across the rocky ground as Samantha sped away from that house of horrors. 

I never saw those girls again. Not that I tried to contact them. They dumped us at our dorm and left as the sun began to rise. James and I are still good friends to this day. We don’t talk about that night even though I’m sure he thinks about it often as do I. 

The house is gone now, the burned remains were bulldozed and my uncle plans on building something new there someday. I don’t think I’ll ever visit, some memories outlive structures.
