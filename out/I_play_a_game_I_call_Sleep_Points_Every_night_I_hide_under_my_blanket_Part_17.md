“Watch and learn, bitch”, said Ezra with his signature half-smirk, just before jumping out of window.  Again.  Because apparently, it was already open.  I did not open it.  Somehow, Ezra the Edgelord had managed to break into my house through my very locked second story window.  And had also jumped out of it.  For the second time this week.

Now, since my options were either “Straight up freeze my balls off out there in the blistering Alaskan cold in nothing but my underwear and MAYBE live” or “Just lie there and fucking die”, I figured I’d follow Ezra’s lead.  Needless to say, I was now REALLY regretting going to bed in nothing but boxer briefs.  Even if they probably wouldn’t’ve helped THAT much, some pajamas woulda been nice.

Immediately, even before landing I was ALREADY in agony.   Just standing next to the open window chilled me to my core.  But the glass was already broken.  The Sandman was already making his way toward me.  I had no choice but to jump.  I could feel my body launching itself from my bedroom window before I had ever even realized I had made the fateful decision.  The landing wasn’t pretty.  Even though there was about a foot of snow to break my fall, I still heard a bit of a snap.  At first, I was worried that I had broken both my legs.  But then I figured maybe I hadn’t since it certainly didn’t FEEL like my legs were in excruciating pain.  They hurt.  They hurt like a bitch.  But maybe I could still use them.

Even then, maybe it was only the same snap you hear when you crack your knuckles.  After all, your knuckles can make a snapping sound without you having to break them.  It‘s just a bunch of air bubbles popping or something like that, I think.  I dunno.  I’m too lazy to google it.

I tried getting up, but immediately my legs collapsed underneath me.  I could hardly even drag myself back inside, let ALONE run away from The Sandman.  But maybe I didn’t have to.  Maybe, by jumping out from my two-story bedroom window, I had shaken him off entirely.  Surely The Sandman would dare to do the same.

But then again, maybe he wouldn’t even have to.  I was essentially paralyzed.  I could still move the rest of my body aside from my legs, but I couldn’t actually go anywhere without subjecting myself to the torturous process of dragging myself face-first through the snow.  I was basically stuck where I was, rooted to the spot.  I couldn’t move, even if I tried.  All The Sandman would have to do now was break down my bedroom door, head downstairs, and bust out through my front door, and I’d be toast.  No amount of a head start was EVER gonna be enough in my position.

And then I saw, to my horror, that I didn’t have NEARLY the amount of time that I was hoping I would.  Instead of having to break out of my bedroom, go down the hall, down the stairs, and burst out the front door, The Sandman followed me right out the window.

My only saving grace was the fact that, instead of jumping out and immediately hitting the ground as I had done, he was taking his time slithering and sliming his way out of my window and down the side of my house.  But when he was in a position to use his legs and run, he could be INSANELY fast.  The only reason I ever had the balls to follow Ezra’s lead and jump out the window was because if I had waited even a split-second longer, it would’ve been all over for me, given how ridiculously fast The Sandman could get once he was on his feet.  So once he finally snaked his way to the ground, I was basically gonna be dead meat.

It felt like an eternity with the blistering cold bearing in on my practically naked body from all directions and with the excruciating pain in my legs, but it had probably only been about 5 or 10 seconds after I had first noticed The Sandman climbing out my window and down the wall when Ezra said “Listen, I get the whole 'running' thing is probably a foreign concept to a fucking lardass like yourself, but maybe, oh I dunno, try DOING it.”  He had the same smug shit-eating grin as always.  Y’know.  As if we weren’t BOTH in potentially life-ending peril.

I turned back and saw that he had almost made his way to the ground.  I had the same instinctual impulse to just move, no matter how much I was gonna end up hurting myself in the process, that I had had when jumping through the window.  It didn’t matter how weak my legs felt, I had no other option than to muster all my strength and hope beyond hope that they could carry me quickly enough through all the snow.  I didn't even remember gathering together the will power to get up and go.  It felt like I was in complete survival mode and my legs had a mind of their own.

“THAT’s a good goy,” said Ezra speeding away from me.  He seemed to be faring much better than me in the cold.  Granted, unlike me, he had clothes on.  But even then, it was only the same short-sleeved t-shirt and gym shorts that I had seen him in during my walk a few weeks prior.  I was almost worried I was gonna lose sight of him from how much faster he was than me.  He was so tall and thin with such abnormally long legs.  He was pretty much built like an Olympic sprinter.  There was no way I was ever gonna catch up with him if I lost him.

But then I figured there was probably know point in following him anyway.  I had nowhere to go but away, and so did he.  Maybe it would even be BETTER for us to run in totally different directions.  After all, then The Sandman would have to choose since he wouldn’t be able to go after us both.  But given how much faster Ezra was than me, it’d probably be no use.  He’d pick me to chase after in a heartbeat since I was so much of an easier target.

Since I had now changed my mind and figured there was no point in splitting up, I set off as fast as I could following Ezra the moment The Sandman finally reached the ground, capitalizing on the distance I had already covered from the running I had already done up to that point.  In the dark it would’ve been pretty tough to pick out where exactly he was, but luckily because of how often he’d skip class to go out back to the basketball court just behind school grounds to go smoke, he always kept a lighter on hand.  The idea was, since he wasn't technically on any College High Property, they couldn't get him on smoking on school grounds.  All they could write him up for was truancy.  Which they were already gonna do since, whether he smoked on school grounds or not, he was still skipping class to do it.

He had already turned it on and was holding it up high so I could see him better.  So fortunately, I only needed to keep my eye on the lighter and not him directly.  Obviously, running with an active lighter isn’t exactly the most High IQ play, but this was the guy who just climbed into my house through my window, jumped out of it, and was now willingly running through a snowstorm in nothing more than a t-shirt and gym shorts.  Though of course, I was even more poorly dressed for the weather than even that.  But in my defense, if I had been as prepared as he was, seeing as how this was all clearly HIS idea, I would’ve put on a few more layers.  But, needless to say, HE wasn’t worried about dressing warmly in accordance with the weather, and so naturally he wasn’t too concerned about any of the obvious dangers associated with running with a lighter that was already lit.

I had honestly never even THOUGHT of running away from The Sandman.  I had always figured it wouldn’t do me any good no matter how fast I ran.  But here I was, speeding away from him, and I wasn’t instantly killed off, like I had thought I would be.  Granted he was totally riding my ass the entire time.  I was only ever the slightest bit out of his grasp.  But nevertheless, I had evaded him so far.  Though I could feel my energy draining by the second.

There was only so much of this I could keep up with.  I almost felt like just giving it up since I had nowhere to go.  I was gonna have to spend the rest of my life running.  The moment I stopped, I was gonna be a goner.  There was no point.  Just stopping was really starting to look like the better option.  At least if I was dead or captured, I wouldn’t have to do anymore of this damn running.  I looked up to the sky and saw it had gone red with smoke again.  By then I was over a hundred yards from my house, but it was still in view.  And when I took a look at it, I could see that the red smoke was now coming out of MY chimney.  What did that mean?

I didn’t have time to think about any of that anymore once Ezra chimed in once again.

“Better hurry up there, goy.  Wanna get to The Sanctuary doncha?”

Well, now I pretty much HAD to keep following him.  Apparently, there was this sanctuary he was leading me to where I would finally be safe.  Since I had no clue where this sanctuary was, I had to run quickly enough to not only keep The Sandman off my back, but also fast enough to keep Ezra firmly in view.

Though of course, knowing him, this could’ve absolutely been a trap.  Maybe he was only leading me to a fate even WORSE than whatever The Sandman had in store.  But I didn’t feel like I had any other option.  Either I had to take a chance on whatever it was that Ezra was up to, or I had to give up.  And I just couldn't.  I had already come way too far, and I had already put far too much effort into this game for me to give up on life just yet.

"You wouldn't want your fuckin' worthless life to end before spending a single one o' them hard-earned points down in The Sacred Space, would ya?" He asked, mockingly.

I had no idea what this so-called Sacred Space was, or The Sanctuary, for that matter.  I didn't even know if these were two different locations, or just different names for the same one.  I just kept running.  And running.  And running even more.  It felt like it had been hours.  But it couldn’t have been.  This had all started at 6 AM.  If it had really been hours since then, it would’ve been morning and the sky wouldn’t’ve been dark anymore.  Maybe it was just the red smoke in the sky blocking out the sun, but if it were morning, I had thought for sure that there’d still be sunlight shining through.  But instead, it was as dark as ever.  It was like I was trapped in time at 6 o’clock.

We had been running for what felt like a few hours more, when I started to see we were running towards an enormous building.  This must’ve been the sanctuary he had been talking about.  As we got closer, it came more and more strongly into view.  Soon enough, I could recognize the building for what it was: It was College High.  For some reason, my very own high school had been my sanctuary from The Sandman the whole time.  But why hadn’t Anastasia told me about that?

As we got closer to the school I started getting worried that we wouldn’t be able to make our way inside.  It was still just as dark as ever and the school looked pretty closed.  There weren’t even any cars in the parking lot from teachers or custodians or something.  This basically confirmed that these past few forevers I had spent running nearly buck naked through the snow really HAD all been spent at 6 o’clock.  Even if it were 6:30, the janitor or someone like that would already be inside starting his morning shift.

By the time we made it to the front door of College High, I was starting to think we’d just have to run past it since there was just no way we’d be able to break in.  But then Ezra pulled out what looked like a little makeshift lockpick that I guess he just always kept on hand, and started fiddling around with the lock.  The only problem with that though, was the fact that we had no time for ANY of this.  The Sandman was right on top of me, so I had to keep running around the outside of the school in order to keep him off my tail.

And it was at this point that I was REALLY starting to think something was up.  Sure, Ezra could easily outrun me.  But, at least for now, he was staying put, right outside the College High front door.  Maybe The Sandman just figured there’d be no use in going after Ezra since he’d respond too quickly and run away too fast for him to catch up with him.  But it still seemed weird.  Ezra was making way more of a target out of himself than I was, and yet here The Sandman was, still going after ME.

And that wasn’t even the ONLY thing weird about this whole situation.  Wasn’t it so weird that I was in such critical condition going over to Anastasia's Sunday morning without the truck even though I put on all the layers I could, and yet I had been running for what felt like hours in my underwear through a snowstorm in much colder weather?  Sure, it had only been 7 degrees Fahrenheit on that night, but honestly, for a February night in Fairbanks, that's still downright warm.  It had to have been at least 20 or 30 degrees below out there, so if I was having to weather such an obscenely low temperature for so much longer and in so much less clothing, I should've been literally DEAD by that point.

And wasn't it also very, very curious indeed that, while The Sandman was always usually so fast, now he was conveniently moving just slowly enough for me to escape his grasp?  Something must’ve been going on here.  Somehow, Ezra seemed to be not only preventing The Sandman from attacking HIM but also managing to keep him at bay just enough to make him too slow to catch me.  Maybe I didn’t even have to run at all.  Maybe if I stopped, Ezra would have his ways of stopping The Sandman in his tracks.

Nope.  Nope nope nope.  BAAAADDD idea.  I stop running for a half a second and next thing I knew, my spine is getting damn near ripped out by The Sandman's ruthless claws Mortal Kombat style.  I could just feel the blood gushing down my back while the scars were stinging like hell out in the freezing cold.

Finally, I had made a full circuit of the College High campus and made it back to the front door just in time for Ezra to have finally picked the lock and opened the door.  Or at least, I had THOUGHT he spent that whole time picking the lock.

“Whelp, melted the lock,” he said, showing off his lighter.  “Coulda just done it straight from the get-go y’know,” he said smugly as ever.

“So why didn’t you?” I questioned.

“Oh y’know.  Figured ya coulda used the exercise,” he said.

Great.  This was just great.  Now my back was bleeding out all because this guy just wanted any excuse to waste my time.  And that’s probably what this whole business with The Sanctuary and The Sacred Space was all about anyway.  The walls of College High probably weren’t gonna block out The Sandman AT ALL.  Now that Ezra had melted the locks off the front doors to the school, they wouldn’t even CLOSE anymore, let alone lock.  The Sandman wouldn’t even have to BOTHER breaking them down.

And sure enough, there he was.  Surprise, surprise, College High was no sanctuary or sacred space at all.  And then Ezra took off running again.  Where was he off to now?  Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe The Sanctuary WAS real after all, and it was just somewhere INSIDE the school.  That had to have been it.

My suspicions were confirmed when Ezra stopped just outside a door, fairly close to the school's front entrance, very shortly after taking off.  At first, I had thought this must’ve been the door to a classroom, but once I stepped inside, I took a look around the room I was standing in, and realized I wasn’t actually standing in a room at all.  After a second or two, I had seen what looked like stairs.  We were in the stairwell.  The same stairwell Anastasia had led me to during 6th period.

THIS must've been the sanctuary.  THIS was why Anastasia had always insisted on meeting up with me here during class.  And why she had been so comfortable with saying The Sandman’s name over and over during our last meeting in there.  Even though he would still pop into view for a split second, she knew it wouldn’t matter since we would be completely safe while we were in the stairwell.  He must’ve had no power in there.

“Aight now you gotta step back for this shit,” Ezra chuckled.  I did.  I didn’t wanna get close, whatever it was.  It was getting a bit hard to gage what was going on at that point, though.  My vision was starting to get a bit blurry and shaky as The Sandman approached.  I saw the door behind me fall to the floor as The Sandman busted in.  I was wrong again.  This was no sanctuary at all.  Next thing I knew, Ezra was running headfirst into the wall.  But I didn’t see him make contact.  I had been shaken awake by my dad before I had the chance.  I had overslept.  If only I had remembered to reset that damn alarm clock.  I was late for school.  It was already 10:30.
