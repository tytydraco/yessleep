[Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11eunal/entry_one_tuesday_was_a_weird_day/)\- This is my entry from yesterday.

\~Wednesday\~

This morning I woke up feeling groggy and disoriented. I stumbled to the bathroom to brush my teeth, but as I looked in the mirror I noticed something strange. My skin looked paler than usual, and my eyes seemed to be sunken in.

I shook my head, thinking it was just my imagination. I showered and washed the wound on my arm, which had almost healed, aside from being a bit red and crusty. I dressed quickly in a cute pink tracksuit and headed to school. Despite feeling tired, I thought to myself how normal I felt through the first half of the school day.

But as I walked into the school cafeteria for lunch, something strange happened. I caught a whiff of the cafeteria's meatloaf, and my mouth started watering. It wasn't just a normal hunger pang, though. I felt like I could almost taste the meatloaf in my mouth, like it was the most delicious thing I had ever smelled. *But I’m vegan* I thought, disgusted. Then I did something very abnormal and got the meatloaf for lunch.

As I sat down with my friends, I couldn't help but stare at the meatloaf on my tray. It looked so...appetizing. I picked up the entire gray slab with my fork and took a bite, relishing the taste of the savory, juicy meat. My friends looked at me in shock. "Maggie, are you feeling okay?" My BFF Sarah asked.

I blinked, coming back to reality. "Huh? Oh, sorry. I guess I'm just really hungry today."

But deep down, I knew it was something more than that. I had never felt such an intense craving for meat before, especially not something as bland as school cafeteria meatloaf. As the day wore on, my strange side effects only got worse. I couldn't stop thinking about the taste of human flesh because the scent lingered everywhere, even though I knew it was disgusting and wrong. I tried to push the thoughts out of my head, but they kept creeping back in.

By the end of the school day I was a nervous wreck. I knew I had to talk to Uncle Jerry about what was happening to me, but I was afraid of what he would say. As I walked home from school, I felt like I was being followed. I looked over my shoulder, but there was no one there. I quickened my pace, feeling a sense of unease wash over me.

Just as I was about to turn the corner, a hand reached out and grabbed my shoulder. I screamed, spinning around to face my attacker. It was just my friend, Sarah.

"Oh my god, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to scare you like that."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm down. "It's okay, Sarah. You just caught me off guard. What's up?"

Sarah looked at me with concern. "I don't know, Maggie. You've been acting really weird lately. Are you feeling okay?"

I shook my head. "No, I'm not. I think something's wrong with me. I need to talk to my Uncle Jerry."

Sarah nodded, putting a comforting arm around my shoulder. "Okay, let's go. We'll figure this out together."

As we walked towards Uncle Jerry's lab, a run-down building hidden away from the road, a building that looked almost paranormally bigger on the inside than it did on the outside, I was feeling worse by the second, and I knew that I needed to get help from my uncle as soon as possible. But as we walked deeper into the woods, my hunger intensified. I could smell something delicious, and it wasn't the meatloaf from lunch.

Sniffing the air, I followed the scent to Sarah's neck. She gave me a worried look as my stomach growled, and I felt a sudden urge to pounce on my friend. Without warning, I grabbed Sarah by the arm and dragged us off the road and into the trees. Sarah protested, but I was too hungry to listen.

"What are you doing, Maggie? Why did you pull me out here?" Sarah asked, her voice shaking. My eyes glazed over as I leaned in and sniffed Sarah's neck.

"You smell so good, Sarah. Like...like a juicy steak." Sarah recoiled in horror.

"Maggie, what the hell? You're scaring me." My hunger overtook me, and I lunged at Sarah, biting down hard on her neck. I felt the flesh give way, the blood filling my mouth. I was so hungry that I kept biting, my teeth sinking deeper and deeper into her neck.

Suddenly, Sarah's head popped off her body, and blood spurted out. I was so startled that I stumbled back, still clutching the severed head in my hands. But then, something strange happened. Sarah's head began to twitch and squirm, and I realized that I had turned my friend too.

"Sarah, oh my god, I'm so sorry!" I exclaimed, trying to connect the head back onto the body.

But it was too late. Sarah's head had already reanimated, and she was looking up at me with reddening, hungry eyes.

"Don't worry about it, Maggie. It's not like I was using my body anyways," Sarah's head quipped.

I stared at Sarah's decapitated head in shock.

"Sarah, how are you...talking? And... why do you sound so calm about this?"

Sarah shrugged my shoulders, or at least, the mangled stump where my shoulders used to be.

"I don't know, man. I guess turning into a zombie kind of changes your perspective on things."

I shook my head, still reeling from what had just happened.

"Okay, we need to get rid of your body. But how do we do that?"

Sarah's head grinned wickedly. "I have an idea. You just have to trust me."

With Sarah's head in my backpack, we made our way to a secluded lake on the outskirts of town. My heart was racing, and Sarah's body was hidden in a large trash bag. As we approached the water's edge, I felt a sense of dread. This was it. We were really going to dispose of Sarah's body.

"Are you ready for this, Sarah?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"As ready as a disembodied head can be," Sarah's head replied, her tone light but with a hint of sadness.

I took a deep breath and heaved the bag over my shoulder, wading into the water until it was up to my chest.

"Here goes nothing," I muttered, and tossed the bag as far as I could into the water.

For a moment, the bag floated on the surface before slowly sinking beneath the waves. Sarah's head and I watched in silence as the bag disappeared from sight. I couldn't shake the feeling that we had just crossed a line we could never go back from.

"You know, Maggie," Sarah's head said suddenly. "I don't think I ever told you this, but I always admired your bravery. Even before all of this happened, you were always the one to stand up to bullies and speak your mind."

I was surprised by the sudden compliment.

"Thanks, Sarah. I never really thought about it like that.”

"Well, you're the bravest person I know," I said to Sarah's head, feeling a hint of emotion in my voice.

"And I'm proud to have you as my friend."

A lump formed in my throat as Sarah's head responded, "I'm proud to have you as my friend too, Maggie."

We stood in silence for a few more moments, watching the water ripple. Finally, I spoke up.

"Come on, Sarah. Let's go back to Uncle Jerry's house. I need to get home and wash my uniform for cheer practice tomorrow."

Sarah's head chuckled. "I don't think they make cheerleading uniforms for decapitated heads."

Despite the horror that had taken over my life, I couldn't help but laugh at Sarah's joke. It provided a moment of relief.

We arrived at Uncle Jerry's house still reeling from what had happened. We knew we had to tell Uncle Jerry the truth about how Sarah died.

Uncle Jerry looked up from his workbench as I came through the door. "Is everything okay?"

I took a deep breath and sat down my backpack, unzipping it to reveal Sarah's head.

"We need your help, Uncle Jerry. Something terrible happened. I accidentally killed Sarah."

Uncle Jerry's eyes widened in shock. "What? How?"

I explained what had happened, tears streaming down my face. The guilt was almost too much to bear. Uncle Jerry put a hand on my shoulder, trying to comfort me.

"I'm so sorry, Maggie. That's a terrible thing to have to go through."

I nodded, feeling a little bit better knowing that Uncle Jerry understood how I was feeling. Uncle Jerry pulled out a vial of liquid.

"I've got an idea. If one dose worked for almost 24 hours, we can just try more. It should last longer, maybe even several days at a time. I'm still working out the dosage."

I looked at the vial, feeling hopeful. "Will it work?"

Uncle Jerry shrugged. "It's not a guarantee, but it should give you enough time to participate in the competition before the transformation sets in."

Sarah's head and I both let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Uncle Jerry," I said, feeling grateful for his help.

Uncle Jerry gave me and Sarah the injections, although he had to give Sarah’s dosing a momentary thought since she no longer had a body. This time, I thankfully didn't become unconscious. Uncle Jerry warned me about possible side-effects again.

"I can handle it," I said, determined to make it through the competition.

Sarah's head nodded in agreement.

"We've got this, Uncle Jerry," I said.

Uncle Jerry smiled at us. "I believe you do. But you need to be careful. The medication won't last forever. Although you could be helping millions of people by allowing me to experiment... I mean, by testing out this drug for me."

Sarah's head and I exchanged a worried glance, realizing the enormity of what we were facing.

"We will, Uncle Jerry," I said, trying to sound confident. "We have a competition to win."

Uncle Jerry nodded, looking at us with pride. "I have faith in you, Maggie. Now go out there and kick some butt."

As I stepped out the door to go home, Uncle Jerry gifted me a small machete. "Try to stay out of the dark this time, kiddo," Uncle Jerry said.

On the walk my eyes began to water and burn because the light seemed so bright. I took Sarah's head home in my backpack. I said hello to my dad, told him I’d eaten dinner already at Uncle Jerry’s and went straight to my room, exhausted from just surviving the day. I turned on a cheerleading podcast and sat in the dark, propping Sarah's head up on a pillow. The tips of my fingers and toes are tingling which is starting to worry me. I'm going to stay here until the morning. I can't risk being around too many people.

I don’t know how I’m going to explain Sarah's absence tomorrow, and I hope nobody saw us walking together.
