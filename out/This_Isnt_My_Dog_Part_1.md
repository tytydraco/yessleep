Hello.  I’m not sure whether this is the place to put this story, but reading through some of the other posts here, I think you all could help me.

As the title suggests, I don’t think the dog in my house is mine.  This isn’t a case of mistaking my pet for another, Lucy looks exactly like how she left.  However, that’s the problem.  I’ll do my best to relay the story to you with as much detail as I can.

My name is Ellice and I’m married to my husband, Mahesh.  We have one son, Lucius and we have our dog, Lucy.  Rather, we had Lucy.  Honestly, I don’t know what it is at this point.

I still remember the day we got her.  She was a present for Lucius’ fifth birthday.  A few months old, soft, labrador retriever with golden fur, the brightest hazel eyes, and the cutest squeaky bark.  “A puppy!” I remember him exclaiming.  “You got me a puppy!”  He jumped up and down, his green eyes locked on her.

“Yes we did, Lu,” Mahesh said, petting her fur.  “Me and your mom decided we wanted a new addition to the family.”  I’m not even sure if Lucius heard his father, as he ran to her and started petting her.  She immediately warmed up to him, licking him all over his face.

“What do you want to name her?” I asked him while going to hug Mahesh.  “I can name her?” he said, grinning from ear to ear.  “Of course,” I responded.  “She’s your present.”

He stayed there petting her for a while before speaking up.  “Lucius!  I want to name her me!”  Mahesh and I laughed.  “Lu, your name is for boys.  She’s a girl.”  He looked defeated and pouted.  “What about…” Mahesh began.  “Lucy?”  

He looked up at us.  “Is that the girl version?”  “Yep.” I answered, actually unsure.  “She’s Lucy then!” he exclaimed, embracing her.

We loved her.  She was such a sweet puppy, always playing with us and laying on the couch whenever we would watch movies.  Lucius took the most charge by feeding her, taking her on walks with us, even helping to potty train her.  She was a major part of our family.

Unfortunately, I also remember the day that would start this whole mess.  It was two months after we got her.  I was sitting on the couch reading a book as Lucius just went outside to play with Lucy.  “Momma!” Lucius screamed.  I jolted up as he ran to the door.

He was sobbing uncontrollably and fell into my arms.  “What’s going on, baby?” I asked, brushing his black hair from his tear stained face.  He barely managed to get any words out.  “Lu-Lu-Lucy… she’s not o-outside!”

I wiped tears from his now dull green eyes.  “It’s okay, Lu,” I began, looking at him.  “Let’s go look for her together.”  He nodded, still crying.

We searched the back and front yards inside and out.  There wasn’t even a single strand of fur we could find.  Eventually, we went to ask neighbors.  Sadly, they hadn’t seen her but told us they’d spread the word and keep an eye out.  With every house that had no clue as to her whereabouts, Lucius’ face grew more pale and I could tell he was giving up hope.

I walked back, hand in hand with Lucius.  He sniffled here and there, his face covered in tears.  “Why did she run away, Momma?” he asked, staring at the ground while avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk with his tiny feet.  I stayed silent for a bit before answering, “I’m not sure, baby.”

I heard him whimper and I kneeled down.  Gently grasping his shoulders, I looked him in his eyes and wiped some tears away.  “My sweet baby boy,” I began, brushing his hair with my fingers.  “It’ll be alright.  Some puppies like Lucy will find their way home.”

“What about the puppies who don’t?” he questioned with pleading eyes.  I smiled and said the first thing that came to mind, “Then there’s a big park full of warm grass, bones, and other dogs.”  He wiped his nose and asked, “Is there plenty of salty tuna for Lucy?”  “Of course there is.”  He displayed a slight smile and I brought him in for an embrace.

“Are you tired, Lu?” I asked when I pulled away.  “A little,” he responded, his voice barely audible.  “Come here,” I said with a smile, opening my arms again.  “I’ll carry you back home.”



Mahesh came home soon after and I told him what happened.  “Aw damn,” he said, scratching the back of his neck.  “I can go talk to him and try to explain it.”  “Maybe not,” I began, staring at the ground while gnawing at my lip.  “I told him that if Lucy doesn’t come back, she’ll go to a magical dog park.”

We chuckled together, also in an attempt to cheer ourselves up.  “Anything to cheer him up, I suppose,” he stated, still laughing.  “Alright then, I’ll explain it when he’s older.”  He kissed me before wrapping his arms around my waist.  I hugged him back, burying my face in his chest.  For a long while we stood there in silence, mourning our loss.

	

That month was hard.  I can’t remember seeing Lucius smile a single time.  He often cried for Lucy at night, a light sound that would wake me up.  I remember one night in particular when I went to check up on him.

“Hey, Lu,” I began in the sweetest voice I could muster.  “Do you want to sleep with Dada and I tonight?”

He didn’t respond and continued to cry.  I sat on his bed and combed his soft hair gently with my hand.  Through muffled sobs, I heard him say, “Lucy’s in pain, Momma.  She’s hurt.”  I pulled my hand back, confused.

“What do you mean, Lucius?” I asked.  He seemed to not hear me and stayed crying.  I stayed in his room until his cries became soft snores.  I asked him about it the following morning, but he seemed to have no recollection of it happening.

	

Later, he also started excluding himself from activities at school.  After a couple of months, it got so bad to the point I got a call from his teacher, so I had a meeting with her.  

“This is a bit strange for children his age,” she began, her expression filled with worry.  “His behavior is odd, as most kids calm down their worries by this point.”  “I’m aware,” I replied, looking down at the table, the sinking feeling of failure building in my stomach.  “My husband and I are doing everything we can, but he was just so attached to Lucy.”

She smiled, “I know how hard it can be.  I raised four little rascals of my own, and it was always difficult when we lost pets.”  I gave her a small smile in response and straightened my posture, the parental pressure easing.

“I’ll help him out in class more and see if I can offer some extra support,” she continued with a bright grin.  “Just focus on helping him get through it at home.”

“Thank you so much, Mrs. Janson.” I remarked, feeling as if a weight was lifted off of my chest.  “We will continue to do so.”  My eyes unconsciously traveled to look at the table as I debated speaking about the night of Lucius’ strange comment from a while ago.

“Mrs. Iyer?” she spoke up, catching my attention.  “Is everything alright?”  “Y-yeah,” I stuttered, gaining my composure.  I fidgeted with the hem of my sleeve before asking, “Has Lucius ever said anything strange about Lucy?”

She looked at me confused, “Like her behavior before you lost her?”  I shook my head.  “No, like if he can tell she feels things.  He mentioned a while ago that she was in pain, but he doesn’t remember telling me that.”

She displayed a look of surprise.  “That is very weird.  He’s never said anything even remotely like that here.”  I slouched in my seat in defeat, thinking I must’ve sounded insane.

“I’ll keep an open ear.” she responded, a slight smile appearing on her face.  “You’ll be the first to know if he mentions something along those lines.”  “Th-thank you,” I managed to say, feeling worried that I came across as a lunatic.

I left her classroom shortly after, feeling as if I accomplished nothing.  I wanted so badly to help my son, but not a thing seemed to help.  A large part of me wished Lucy would just hurry and come back.  I had no idea just what the wish would bring.



It took a while, but Lucius adjusted back to life without Lucy.  He began to smile more and stopped crying at night.  It was such a huge relief to have our son back again.  Lucius still held onto the hope that maybe she would return home one day, but we figured once he grows up, he’ll be mature enough to understand the concept of death.

But that day didn’t have to come because of four weeks ago.

That day was so strange.  It was a little after a year from when Lucy went missing.  We were eating mashed potatoes and tacos while watching a movie.  In the middle of it, we heard scratching at the door.

I glanced at my husband, unsure of what to do.  Lucius looked at me with scared eyes.  “What is it, momma?” he asked, tightening his grip on the fork.

“I’ll go check,” Mahesh said, standing up from the table.  “Stay here.”  He placed a hand on my shoulder as he passed behind me.  “It’s probably just a racoon, but you never know,” he told me under his breath.

I turned to face Lucius.  “It’s all right, baby,” I assured him, squeezing his hand.  “Your Dada will figure it out.”  He nodded slightly.

I looked back to Mahesh.  He opened the door and froze.  “What…” he began, looking near the ground.  “Honey?” I asked, about to get out of my seat.  “Who is it-”

A squeaky bark resonated into the house.  So familiar, yet so foreign.

“Lucy?” Lucius exclaimed, jumping out of his seat.  He started running to the door and I tried to chase after him.  “Wait, Lucius!” I called out, following him.  He was already past Mahesh and out the door.

By the time I reached him, he was already being slobbered by the dog.  It was undeniably the very dog we lost.  The golden fur, the hazel eyes, even the bark was all her.

“Momma!” Lucius cried, hugging her tightly.  “It’s Lucy!  She came back!”  I looked at Mahesh with a surprised look still on his face.  “That’s really her,” he said in disbelief.  He turned to me with a smile.  Mirroring him, I gave him one in return, still shocked.

Mahesh was the first to go to his knees and embrace them both.  I followed soon after, almost brought to the point of tears seeing Lucius so happy.  We were a family again.  The warmth from all of us felt so familiar.

Except for what was touching my arm.  I opened my eyes slightly.  Lucy’s body was against it, but it was a lot colder than I remembered.  Pulling my head back a little, I noticed she was the same size as well.  It had been a year, why does she still look like a two month old puppy?

After we all got back inside, Lucius couldn’t be pried off of her.  Lucy was running around the living room, sniffing everything and licking Lucius’ face.  My husband and I watched them from the couch.

“I can’t believe she really came back,” Mahesh said, a big smile plastered on his face as he observed the two.  He turned to me.  “Maybe the dog park lie wasn’t a lie at all.”

I returned a slight smile, trying to hide my discomfort.  “Yeah, maybe.”  He looked at me confused.  “Is everything okay?” he asked, leaning in closer to me.

“I could just be in shock,” I responded, looking at the rowdy pair.  “But Lucy is colder than she should be.”  “Ellice, she’s been gone for a year.” he replied, placing his hand on mine.  “She was probably a street dog for a while which affected her health.  Of course she’s cold.”

“But that’s what’s weird, Mahesh,” I continued, turning my head toward him.  “She looks well fed and groomed, not like a street dog.”  “Someone could’ve taken her in,” he responded.  “She probably just found her way home after a while.”

“But that doesn’t explain why she still looks like a puppy,” I said in desperation, my eyes widening for emphasis.  “Hey,” Mahesh began, his grip tightening on my hand.  “It’s okay Ellice.  We’ll get everything explained soon.”

I looked up at him, confused.  “I’m going to make a vet appointment tomorrow,” he told me.  “You’re not the only one who noticed how young she looks.”  He gave me a wink and kissed my hand.  He began to get up saying, “You take Lucius to bed and I’ll put Lucy in her doghouse outside.”

Taking a deep breath, I nodded and said, “Thank you, honey.  I guess I’m just still in disbelief.”  Mahesh kissed my forehead and told me, “That makes sense, don’t worry about it.”  He then made his way to the living room.  “Come here girl,” he called to Lucy.  She trotted after him, sniffing his shoes.

I got up and walked to Lucius.  “Ready for bed?” I asked, reaching out to him for his hand.  “But momma!” he cried, taking my hand anyway.  “I want to play with Lucy!”  “I know, Lu,” I told him, rubbing the back of his hand with my thumb.  “But you can play with her all you want tomorrow after school.”  He gave me a pout but followed me to his room.

He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, bringing a smile to my face.  I kissed his forehead and left him to rest.



I woke up the next day feeling more tired than when I went to bed.  It was hard for me to fall asleep, I just kept trying to piece together how Lucy ended up back here and looking like she did.  The more I thought, the more questions I had.

My eyes shot open, a loud sound waking me up.  I shook my head as I looked up.  “Did you manage to sleep at all?” Mahesh asked, his hand on the coffee mug he placed on the counter rather hard.  He smiled, “You look really tired, honey.”

I rubbed my eyes a bit, causing them to water.  “I got a few hours,” I responded, blinking back my watery eyes.  “I think.”  He gave me a toothy grin and chuckled while walking over.  “You still look beautiful,” he assured me, wrapping his arms around my torso and kissing my forehead.  “Even with your emo-looking eye bags.”  I rolled my eyes and kissed his nose.  He laughed and let me go.

“I’ll take Lucius to school today,” he began, grabbing his keys off the counter.  “I don’t want you driving while you’re so tired.”  “Are you sure, love?” I questioned, picking up the hot coffee mug.  “Of course,” he replied, making his way to the staircase.  “You always take him.”

“Lucius!” he called out at the bottom of the stairs.  “Are you ready, buddy?”  “Yes dada!”  my son’s cheery voice called from above.  I couldn’t help but smile.

He jumped off the last step while making a small *tup* sound.  “I’m taking you to school today,” Mahesh told him while ruffling his hair.  “So say bye to Mamma.” Looking over to where I was standing, Lucius ran while exclaiming, “Bye Momma!”  He gave me a quick hug around my legs and moved his head to face me.

“You said I can play with Lucy all I want when I get back, right?” he asked, wide eyed.  “We’ll see, baby,” I responded, squatting down to his level.  I swallowed down the lump of nerves.  “I want all of your homework finished first.”  He replied with a pouty face before nodding.

“Give me a hug,” I said, outstretching my arms.  He fell into them, wrapping his arms around my neck.  “Oh,” I groaned playfully.  “You’re getting so big, I can barely keep myself from falling over!”  He giggled, squeezing tighter as I swayed from side to side as if losing my balance.

“Let’s go now, buddy,” Mahesh said with a smile, gently tapping Lucius’ shoulder.  He turned and grabbed his hand with a small jump.  “Bye, momma!” he called, walking to the door.  “I’ll see you later, Ellice,” Mahesh said while giving me a quick kiss on the lips.  He blew me another one, and I responded with the same.

The door closed and the house fell silent.  The lack of sound was nothing new, it’s all I heard when I came back from dropping off Lucius.  However, this time it felt different, more ominous.  Then I remembered.

Lucy’s here.

The concept of dread in that moment was almost laughable to me.  Before she was lost, she was my working buddy.  She always accompanied me on grocery runs and stayed with me while I finished work assignments.  The fact that I was so anxious to spend time with her was so foreign to me.  I decided to use this day to see if there was a chance she was the same Lucy from a year prior.  “*Just treat her like you aren’t suspicious.*” I thought to myself as I headed to the back door.

When I stepped out, Lucy was there.  Staring at me.  Her hazel eyes peered deep into mine, appearing more dark as time went on.  “*Easier said than done.*” I thought.  “*Why did Mahesh have to let her out before he left?*”

“Hey, Lucy,” I called, kneeling to the ground a safe distance away.  Lucy stared at me for a minute, her eyes unwavering from mine before slowly trotting over to me.  She sniffed my hands and my face before sitting down.  This was significantly different from how she always acted, even different from last night when she came back.  “*Does she know I’m wary?*”

She continued her staring contest with me, the eyes once so full of love and excitement now trapped behind a wall deprived of emotion.  I raised a hand and brought it to her fur.  “*Still cold,*” I thought, moving it along the silky strands, praying she couldn’t feel the slight tremble.  Lucy stayed still, unaware of the possible friend or foe.  “*What on Earth happened to you?*” I asked her in my head.  “L-let’s get you some food, girl.” I said, standing up.

I led her to the door, opening it with haste.  She followed slowly, sniffing the ground as she crossed the threshold.  As soon as she was in, I reached to close the door.  A cold chill ran down my spine.  My vision became blurry as every hair on my body stood up.  My body shook in fright as I sensed the threat behind me.  I whipped my head around to see.

The only thing there was Lucy, staring at me just as she had outside.  I let out a nervous chuckle as I placed my hand over my heart in an attempt to slow it down.  I prayed that she would do something to remind me that I was spooked by a dog, but she didn’t give me even a head tilt.  She only watched me.  Clearing my throat, I stepped past her, embarrassed and unsettled.

 I walked into the kitchen, the slow tapping of nails on the hardwood floor following close behind.  Swallowing a lump in my throat I didn’t know I had, I opened up the fridge door and pulled out leftover chicken from last night’s tacos.  

“*I didn’t think we’d ever use this again.*” I thought to myself, walking over to the pantry.  I pulled out a red dog bowl with “Bensen’s Hardy Tardy Food” plastered on the side.  Lucius had begged us to keep it in the pantry, just in case she did come back.  It ended up coming in handy after all.

I placed the chicken inside and bent down to place it in front of Lucy.  There was a slight *dink* as the bowl touched the tile.  As soon as I heard that, Lucy lunged at my hand.  Her eyes grew wider as she bared her teeth before opening her jaw.  She bit down, the sound echoing throughout the whole house.  Bits of chicken flew out of the bowl.

Screaming, I yanked my hand away and took a few steps back.  With my heart racing, I looked back at her, preparing to defend myself.  However, I didn’t have to do anything like that.  Lucy was just eating out of her bowl as if she had been starved for days.

I steddied my breathing, my hand still shaking.  “You’re okay,” I whispered to myself.  “Your hand is still attached.”  This was just another thing I’d have to talk to Mahesh about.  He’s the one who fed her last night, but he didn’t say anything about her almost biting him or lunging at the food.

After I could stand normally on my own two feet,  I approached Lucy cautiously.  She seemed like an average, hungry dog.  The chicken was almost all gone.  I swallowed as I made my way past her.  I usually would put off work for a little longer, but I had to get to another room as soon as possible.

As I walked away, I noticed something on the ground.  It was small and white, almost like a clump of dried rice on the floor.  I picked it up and studied it.  It was rough and had a slight yellow tint.  I looked up at the ceiling, thinking some drywall might’ve fallen off.  “*Great.*” I thought with a sigh.  “*Now the house is falling apart.*”

I took it with me upstairs to my office, grabbing my coffee on the way.  Placing it next to my mouse, I took a seat.  The familiar tone played from my computer speakers as the logo displayed.  I got to work checking emails and setting up my presentation.  It was a proposition for a new social media software, a task that took a lot of time and energy.  In other words, a great distraction.

About fifteen minutes passed before I heard the stairs creaking with the tapping of nails on the wood.  A year ago, this wouldn’t have bothered me.  However, due to the events of that day, it was obviously different.

I took a deep breath in anticipation for Lucy’s arrival.  As if on cue, she walked in as silent as ever.  I turned to look at her.  She held no excitement to be in my office as she used to, she didn’t lick my feet or try to jump on my lap.  Lucy simply walked across the floor and sat a few feet away from me.  Just like outside and the kitchen, she just sat there.  I could’ve mistaken her for a house decoration if I didn’t see her walk in a few moments prior.  Moments that felt like hours.

“Hey, girl,” I called out, looking into her beady eyes that appeared more black than hazel.  It felt wrong so I changed my gaze to her nose.  “Do you want to come here?” I asked, patting the side of my chair as an invitation.  It didn’t deter her decision and she kept watching me.  I cleared my throat and brought my attention back to my work.

I tried to work, I really did, but I just kept feeling her eyes on me.  Her stares burned into my face like a sunburn.  It was like I was doing a test back in grade school with my teacher watching over my shoulder, making sure I wasn’t cheating.  Nothing brought me any comfort.  Even the warm streams of light from the window near my desk felt cold.

I looked out the opening, lifting my head to get a clear view of the backyard.  I drew in a big breath, gathering my courage.  I stood up and headed toward the door.  “Come here, Lucy,” I called, motioning.

She followed soon after, even moving past me to walk in front.  “*Does she know where we’re going?*” I thought, worried about what she might do.  We walked to the door and I opened it immediately.  She made her way out, giving me a quick glance as she passed the threshold.  I practically slammed the door as soon as her tail was out.

I breathed a sigh of relief, already feeling more comfortable.  Then came the guilt.  Maybe it was just because Lucy still looked like the dog we knew, but I didn’t like just leaving her out there.  My fear triumphed and I decided to just leave her a bowl of water.

I quickly washed her food bowl and filled it with tap water.  I slowly walked over to the door, hoping she was far from it before I gave her the bowl.  She sat at the far end of the lawn, facing the door.  It was as if she was waiting for me to peek at her.

Feeling as if I was intruding, I quickly opened the door back up and kneeled to place the water bowl in front of it.  She then rose up and slowly took one step towards me.  I sprung back up and shut the door.

I walked to the stairs, wiping my sweaty palms on my clothes.  My heart was still racing as I made my way up and back to my office.  My shaky legs made it hard to get there as fast as I had wanted, so I braced myself with the rail.  I half expected to hear Lucy’s nails walking behind me.  I pushed it from my mind as I quickened my pace.

I finally got back to my office, instantly feeling much more comfortable.  Rubbing my temples, I sat back down in my chair and unlocked my computer once more.

Work continued as normal with only minor hiccups in the presentation.  Boring stuff, but I’d rather have that than a dog intensely watching me work.  However, despite my desperation to ignore it, there was still the sinking feeling of abnormality creeping up on me.  The only feeling I’ve ever had since Lucy’s return.

I did what my gut was screaming at me not to do.  I turned toward the window.  I lifted my head up and gazed outside, not knowing what to expect yet knowing full well.

The two black, beady eyes stared back up at me.  It wasn’t as if she looked up at the last moment, she always had always been looking into the window.  I had never felt so violated in my own home before that moment, and the dog wasn’t even inside.

I quickly ducted my head down, a part of me hoping she didn’t see.  However, I knew she had.  “*What in the world?*” I thought to myself, feeling as if she would hear if I said it aloud.  I took a shaky deep breath.  “*She’s just an animal.  I don’t have to be this scared.*”

My body didn’t reflect that sentiment.  My hands had a slight tremble and every breath came out unsteady.  The lump in my throat was hard to swallow and the hair on my neck and arms stood up.  It was as though I was intruding on Lucy.  I wasn’t supposed to be here.

I slowly raised my hands and slapped both sides of my face.  My thoughts slowed and the fear died down a bit.  “You’re fine,” I lied, breaking the silence around me.

I turned my attention back to my work, trying my best to ignore Lucy.  The temptation to look out the window was hard to fight.  I’ll admit, a few times I took a quick glance, even using my phone camera to see without actually looking.

Lucy was there every.  Single.  Time.  She was out the window, in the same spot, staring up at the window.  And every single time, I had to calm myself back down and resist the urge to run out of the house.  I don’t even know how I would explain that to Mahesh.  “*Sorry honey,*” the imaginary me said to my husband.  “*Our dog scared me so much, I ran out of the house.*”

I glanced at the corner of my computer, a usual habit today.  4:32 p.m.  “*Mahesh should be on his way home with Lucius soon.*” I thought, as my breath escaped with relief.  Then, I recalled what Lucius asked.

It had been a full year since he had seen her.  My heart fell heavy with guilt as I grit my teeth.  I’d talk about it with Mahesh, but my stance would be firm due to when I fed her.  The entire time both of them would be in the house, neither would leave my sight.
