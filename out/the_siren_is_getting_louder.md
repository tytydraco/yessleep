I apologise for the brevity of this post and the many spelling and grammer mistakes you might see throught it but I dont think I have much time left, I created this account just to post on here becouse I feel like I have nothing else I can do , I might try to go back in and add in more details if I am still somehow unharmed when I finish typing this out.  
  
I was walkign home from work around 3 hours ago when I heard a siren most likey from an ambulance or a police car which isn't anything out of the ordinary since I live in new york the siren was getting louder as if it was approaching me, I was close to a crossing so I did a 360 to see if I had to wait for it to pass me but I didnt see anything I waited a few more seconds before I started to cross the road, the siren continued to get louder I took a right turn and started walkign down a block which had single homes instead of the usua the siren continued getting louder after another 360 I still did not see the source of the siren 5 minutes later I could still hear the sirens as if they were right behind and getting closer but still after another observation of my suroundings no ambulance vans or police cars were in sight, I started running I didnt know to where, I could not run home I don't want to bring it to my house I cant risk whaterver the fuck that thing is hurting my wife I cant text her either becouse she'll come looking for me, I told her that I I had to stay at work for a few extra hours.  
  
after 10 minutes of running I arrived at my current hideout where I am writng this from right now the hioghest floor of an old abandoned apartament bulding clearly prepped for a renovation.  
  
the siren followed me inside the building still slowly increasing in volume I feel like my head might explode at any moment formhow fukcing loud it is I can bearly think the text I've written so far has taken me at least 40 minutes I have to force myself to move, my body does not follow my brains commands automatically, I have to force my fingers to move with all the strenght I h i can hear it not jus tthe fucking siren the thing that's mkaing the sounds I can hear it walking arouund it's a light poulsating sound that sounds almost organic unlike the the loud electrical sound of the siren it's harsh and violent angry and soothing at the same time and even though it sounds quieter it somehow overpowers the brainsplitting volume of the siren which still hasnt stopped getting louder even thoug the siren seems like it's closer. I heard a door open I tink its coming up the stairs
