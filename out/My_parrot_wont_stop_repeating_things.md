Hi Reddit, between dealing with the police and concerned family members, I've been really needing to get this off my chest. No one around me believes anything about what I’ve gone through, maybe someone here will.

For context, I’m blind. Specifically, I have Cortical Visual Impairment. It means that my eyes work fine, but somewhere between them and my brain the information gets muddled up. It's part of why no one believes me, they hear blind and they think I’m walking around in total darkness. They’re shocked when I can track them with my perfectly fine eyes.

My visual impairment just makes them think i’m stupid, or less think and more unconsciously assume. It doesn’t matter that I’ve been living perfectly fine on my own for years now, have a degree and have a regular job as an audio engineer. I’m sorry for the rant, I’ve just dealt with so much ignorance over the last few days.

I’ll try to explain how I see things, but be aware I have no frame of reference to how everyone else sees, I was born with my condition. Basically, my brain gets all the colours, but depth and detail is where it struggles. I can see objects, but where one object ends and another begins is the problem. Its easier when I’m closed, but everything fades into one mishmash of colour and a distance. It’s like someone wiped their fingers over everything, messed it all together.

I explained this once and one of my work friends compared it to an abstract painting. I don’t actually know if it's a good metaphor, paintings are already hard enough to make out let alone an abstract one, but it’s easiest for unimpaired people to think of it that way. 

And before some smart-ass comments asking how I'm typing this, it's called a braille keyboard, along with the hundred other tools that exist for people like me, it's 2026. Sorry, but the last thing I need is more ignorance when I’m just trying to get my experiences out of my mind. 

I’ll start telling the story now.

I’ve always liked parrots as pets, over dogs and cats or anything else. It’s the bright colours, I can easily recognise them, instead of getting jumped on by a blob I thought was the carpet. They are low maintenance and obedient too, they like their cages and come to you easily. But most of all I loved how smart they were, and Sunny was the smartest I had ever seen. She was a sulfur-crested cockatoo and had been with me since I was a teenager, the species lives almost as long as humans so I was never worried about having to say goodbye. 

Now, cockatoos are mostly white but they have this big yellow crest that unfurls on top of their heads. I think somewhere in Sunny’s smart little bird brain she’d figured out it was easier for me to find her when it was up. She was like a yellow beacon in my vision. 

All cockatoos are cheeky birds, but she wasn’t destructive like others can be. She’d tap her beak on metal or glass to annoy me, bobbing in a little dance that I could just make out with my blurred vision.

She was a talkative bird too, always making the odd chirps and honks that Cockatoos make, maybe she also knew I needed those, like little sonar pings. She wasn’t ever loud, trust me, cockatoos can be. Look up a video, they squawk and screech something fierce, about as loud as a person screaming in your ear. Sounds like a malfunctioning piece of machinery, pitched up. 

She repeated things instead, she copied amazingly quick. She could’ve easily been an internet personality if I’d bothered to share it. Though, Call me a hippie but I always thought she deserved the peaceful, quiet life. She was my animal companion, it felt weird to do all that funny animal video crap. 

She’d copy things I said to her, but also bits from podcasts, anything on the TV, lyrics from songs too, especially if I played them often. 

When a cockatoo mimics something, it sounds like it’s being repeated by a lifelong smoker through a garbled radio, but they’re freakishly good at copying the particular inflections. Like the melody of lyrics or the person’s accent. 

The weirdness only started about a week ago. 

Now she usually only starts mimicking when she's excited, mostly before I feed her. Over the first couple of days I just thought she was in a very excitable mood. She started mimicking at random points: listening to an audio play and mimicking random pieces of dialogue, same with parts of an audio book, the quips of a newscaster and the lines of a song. She just blurted them out once and then would go silent for another thirty minutes or so, then she’d blurt another. 

I wasn’t concerned at that point, I did ask her aloud. “What’s up? Why are you doing that?” 

But just in the strange way people talk to their pets knowing there won’t be a response. 

“Up? Up? Why are you doing that?” She responded. I was able to hear my inflections in her screechy garble. “New discovery. New discovery.” She quoted the news report serving as my white noise. 

Thinking maybe it was something that would pass, I ignored it. But it only got worse. Sunny went from repeating something every thirty minutes, to twenty, then ten over a few days. 

It continued even when I turned everything off and stayed silent. She just squawked random lines she’d heard in the past. It only stopped when I went right up to her. I can imagine Sunny cocking her eye sideways and looking me up and down.

“Just follow your eyes. Just follow your eyes.”

Great, mocking me with The Cure, I had thought. 

Even when I was trying to sleep, I could hear the muffled sounds of her mimicry from her perch in the living room. 

The next day I asked some cockatoo-keeping Facebook groups about it. The answers ranged from “Weird but it’ll probably pass” to “might be hormonal” to “Yeah they do that sometimes” so I decided it would be better just to blast music and wait for Sunny to get over this phase. 

One of the songs that played that morning was Before Too Long, by Paul Kelly & The Messengers. It seemed to catch on with Sunny. “Before too long… before too long…” she grated. 

I left her to go to work, and prayed it’d be over when I go home. 

The company I work for had been hired to do some nature recording work, I rode along, my coworkers always say I can hear out a good soundscape like I’m some sort of human radar. 

As the team set up the recording equipment, I fiddled with a directional mic. I knew my way around it by touch and I was tweaking it to best record in the setting when…

“… too long…” 

It was distant, soft. I almost thought it was my mind playing tricks, I’d heard that garbled voice so often that now I was hearing it at work. I looked up, and a few metres away from me, before the forest blurred into a single indistinguishable mess, a yellow crest unfurled. 

The bird’s white body must’ve been blending into the grey bark of the gum trees, because I could only see those bright yellow feathers. 

When I stood up fully from the crouch I was in, the yellow feathers folded away, and it was gone into the colour mess. 

“Hey Jesse?” I asked one of my coworkers.

“Yeah?” 

“You see that cockatoo over there?” I pointed.

There were a few seconds of silence. 

“No man. You ready with that mic?” 

I didn’t think much of it till days later.

The first thing that greeted me when I got home that day was the melodic voice of Paul Kelly played through a bird’s vocal chords.

“Before too long…”  

It was just getting insane, I was going mad. I had my music turned up but it only slightly muffled the powerful voice of a cockatoo. Sunny’s repetitions were now like an echo, coming a second after every lyric so I was hearing the entire song twice on delay. I don’t really use headphones because blocking myself off from any sound feels like blocking off my alertness, any number of things could happen and I’d be none the wiser. But it got so bad I dug up an old pair of earphones, shut my door tight, and turned my music up loud. 

I’d decided I was going to take her to an animal hospital about an hour’s drive from my place, now obviously I can’t drive, I also had work and my friend wouldn’t be able to take me for another day. Colour me surprised later that evening, when I went out into the kitchen to make dinner, finding the house was completely quiet. It was an incredibly strange feeling after days of endless noise. 

There was one sound, a gentle tap, the sound Sunny made knocking her beak on metal. It was coming from the kitchen. I saw the yellow beacon of her feathers by a corner, where I knew the toaster was. I was scared that Sunny was now erratically trying to bite it, she might get herself electrocuted. I ran over, but when I was at arms length her yellow feathers furled inwards and disappeared into the white of the kitchen walls. I felt around the toaster, but… nothing. I searched with my arms wider, I couldn’t hear her waddling away.

“Midnight!” Sunny squawked from the living room, sounded like it was from her perch.

How? I hadn’t heard her move, much less the loud flutter of her wings. Sure enough when I rounded into the living room the yellow beacon was at its usual spot, the perch. I hadn’t glanced at it when I came in, I had rushed to the kitchen hearing her tapping. How had Sunny done that?

“Sale, going once!” Was her only answer. She went right back to her constant mimicry. 

I woke the next morning to the sound of Sunny’s car insurance advertisement. Tomorrow I was taking her to the vet, that was some peace of mind. When I was eating my reheated breakfast (forgive for not wanting to stick around my house long) the mimicking stopped. There was a second of silence, then Sunny screeched. I’ve been around cockatoos long enough to know it was an angry screech, and I heard the furiously flapping of wings. She was a blur over my head, a streak of white and yellow that was flashing around in the air. I ducked and moved away, but Sunny seemed to follow. Her blur dashing away to perch before swooping back. She wasn’t touching me, mind you, but from what I could make out she was attacking the air around me, taking care to avoid me. 

I should’ve taken that as a sign of something wrong, Sunny was smart, but I guess I also fell into the trap of underestimating her. All I thought was that the erratic behaviour had reached its peak, and my stomach twisted with worry that my beloved pet was now suffering something far worse than I’d predicted. My mind flicked to Dementia or Alzheimer's, though Sunny was only middle-aged for a cockatoo. Like all pet owners when something goes wrong, I had the sinking shame that it was my fault somehow. 

When I finally got my hands around her, holding her like a football. She screeched and wriggled as I put her in her cage and locked it. I didn’t usually have to do this, since she was well-behaved. As soon as I let go and slammed the wire door, she began to attack the bars of the cage. Flapping around, slamming into the walls. In my view it looked like a trembling white blob trying to push itself through thin streaks of pen ink. I made sure the feeder and water bottle was full and finally relented to the missed calls of my carpool. I shouldn’t have left her, but I did.

I spent the whole day with the deep sick worry of a pet owner, I kept failing simple tasks, my mind wandering. 

When I got home that afternoon and ran through the door, the silence wasn’t relieving but deeply worrying. I didn’t take off my shoes or drop my work bag, I went straight to the cage. My heart beat quickly when I didn’t see Sunny’s yellow feathers. I felt for the cage’s door. It wasn’t just open, it was gone… ripped off its tiny hinges.

I could only think she’d gotten out somehow, but I couldn't see a hint of her in the ocean of white, brown, cream and gray splotches of my apartment. 

Where the hell was she?

Then it hit me suddenly, all around, like a jackhammer to the skull. The awful screeching of a cockatoo. Far, far louder than anything I’d ever heard from Sunny. 

I knew instinctively it was the desperate pained noise of a cockatoo dying. Worse, being viciously hurt. It reverberated in my head, but I couldn’t see a bird anywhere. My worry soared for Sunny, somewhere she was dying and I couldn’t help her, I couldn’t see her. Had she gotten stuck behind the fridge? Had something fallen and broken her wings? I stumbled around, the mess of colour whipping around me. The screeching continued. I was feeling my hand under the fridge when I realised something.

Sunny’s pained screaming repeated. 

I strained my ears to listen and my heart sank into my stomach. It was a slight build up, but the same rising tone repeated to a fever pitch of absolute animalistic fear. I couldn’t hear it any other way after that. I was even more afraid, but now not for Sunny, but for myself. I hadn’t realised, but the screeching had that same garbled quality of a cockatoo’s mimicking voice. Cockatoo calls weren’t like that. 

I swept my hand out from under that fridge and felt the shiver of a feather on my hand. I had missed it with my blindness. I scrambled for it, feeling on the floor. It was a single discarded feather. 

I brought it close to my eye, out of the murky distance of my vision. It was still blurred, but I could see the bright red rubbing off the spine and onto the tips of my fingers. 

You know when your eyes are closed but you just know someone is close to you? Just instinct and that subtle change in pressure? 

At that moment, it felt like something was standing in the room with me. When that feeling rocketed through me, the screeching stopped as suddenly as it had started. 

I rose slowly from the floor.

Hanging in the air, above the open floor where I knew there was nothing to perch on, was a lick of yellow like Sunny’s crest. It hung there, completely, overpoweringly silent. 

“Cockatoo,” It was a garbled mimic voice. The yellow seemed to grow a little, unfurling some more.

“You see that cockatoo over there?” I shuddered hearing my own inflections echoed, I barely had time to process it before the yellow sprouted.

It unfurled more, upwards, growing like a speed-up plant until it seemingly couldn’t support the weight. Then it twisted downwards, a yellow carpet unrolling down the slope of gravity. Then finally, reaching close to the floor, the end of this yellow smear curled into what my confused eyes suggested was a spiral. 

It hung in the air, still in complete silence. It was undulating. I couldn’t tell if it was moving slightly or if it was growing and shrinking in a pulsing throb. The yellow had a sickly brightness to it that made it stand out clearly in the gestural chaos of my vision. 

Then it screeched.

I backed away from the sound, the colour moved without moving like an optical illusion, rolling across the jumbled splotches.

The cockatoo screech was like a train coming into a station, it slowed until it was a continuous low-pitched wail. 

My body took over, I closed my eyes and let the expert muscle memory of a blind man guide my feet to the door. The slow-mo wail followed right to the doorstep. I ran clear away from the apartment building, until it was just a single red block in my vision. That's when I called a friend and told them something bad had happened. 

That’s my story, that's what I needed to tell someone. 

I hope you can believe me, even though no one else does. I might have blindness but I know what I saw and I can hear better than anyone. I can see how the police, pink blobs in blue streaks of uniforms, shift around when they don’t believe my story. 

They told me they won’t be investigating me for animal cruelty, like I should be a suspect! They think someone was hiding in my apartment, like I wouldn’t have been able to see that. I don’t know what was in there, what killed Sunny, but it sure as hell wasn’t a somebody. 

I’m staying with family now, and they’re going to help me move out. They don’t believe me either, I can hear the suspicion.

I don’t like parrots anymore.

I keep seeing cockatoos. Flicks of yellow outside or by the window. If I point them out, suddenly they’re gone, or I lose them in the colours. 

I feel like the universe is mocking me. I’m blind, but no one else can see the bright yellow streaks.
