The chalky medicine coats my mouth and throat as I swallow. For a beat, nothing happens. The blood keeps flowing from my nose, my head splitting, my body aching.

Then—everything stops.

The pain in my head, my chest, my arms, all gone. Even my nose, which Marie is now wiping clean, has stopped bleeding.

I look up at her in disbelief. She’s staring down, tears welling in her eyes.

“Please don’t let that happen again,” she whispers. “I—I can’t lose you!” She throws her arms around me, clinging tight.

“What… why did that happen?” I ask. My head still feels like cotton—numb and slow.

“That’s our ailment, dear. It’s why we need the medicine. You called it Morivell syndrome—a degenerative disease that attacks the body’s cells.”

“Is… is that why I forget? Or is it the medicine?”

Marie hesitates.

“I—I’m not sure, to be honest. I used to worry it was one of those… that I’d lose my memories too. But that day never came. You always told me it was because of your work. You knew the reason, but you said not to worry. You used to say, ‘As many times as I forget, I’ll find my way back to us.’”

I look into Marie’s hazel eyes, wet with tears. I see how much love she has for her husband. For me.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper, my voice barely audible.
She buries her face in my chest, gripping me tighter.

“It’s okay,” she murmurs, her voice muffled against my shirt. “Don’t be sorry. I know you’re scared. I know you’re confused. I’m here to help you.”

“Then I need you to be honest with me.” 

Marie lifts her head, scared.

“I—I can’t. Not yet.” Her voice trembles. “Please. Trust me. Trust yourself. You’re not ready to know everything.”

“Then when?” 

Marie stares at me, desperation painted across her face.

“When you learn to make the medicine,” she says. “When you make Vivacen.”

“That’s all?”

“Make it, and I’ll tell you whatever you want. I’ll help you do whatever you want. Kill that beast. Escape this place. Get the medicine to the outside world. But I can’t help you until you know how to make it. You only have to do it once. Just prove that you can.”

My thoughts spiral. That’s all she wants? Just one dose?

I mean—I’m no chemist now, but surely I left instructions, notes. It can’t be that hard… right?

But something gnaws at me.

“Why?” I ask. “Why is that the condition? Why just once?”

Marie lets out a breath through her nose. Her voice is quiet, almost reverent.

“Because once you do… you’ll understand.” She meets my eyes. “Then you’ll know why you went so far to keep it secret.”

I stare at Marie while my mind processes. She stares back, waiting, desperate. A concerned wife. My wife.

I nod slowly, the most I can manage.

She exhales with visible relief and brushes a hand over my cheek. “I’ll go prepare your study. It’s still as you left it. Just... rest until I return.”
She kisses my forehead and steps out, the door clicking shut behind her.

I stare at the floor, still propped up against the bed. Waiting for Marie.

Maybe this won’t be so bad after all. I’ll make the medicine, she’ll help me escape, and I’ll be free. I’ll possibly even be lauded as a hero when I release Vivacen to the world. Marie and I could even still live together, maybe I will find my way ‘back to us’ as I had told her. 

Would that really be so bad?

But then why do I have this awful sinking feeling? Aside from the obvious, I feel like I’m forgetting something important.

I lazily scan the room, searching for a clue—anything to jog my mind. Then I spot the envelope, the one I had grabbed from the courtyard. I must’ve held onto it while the beast carried me back.

I grab it, and read the front. 

“To Alan McCarthy Sharp.” 

My full name.

I flip it over, and see that it has a red wax seal. The initials “A.S.” are surrounded by branches and leaves.

I break the seal, and find a letter inside. The first sentence hits like a punch to the gut.

“Dear Alan,

Your amnesia is self-inflicted.”
