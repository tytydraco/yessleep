**As I drive down the road**, I'm already thinking about getting home. I’m beat after a long day of work. I'm brought back down to reality with a thud as I run through a whole flock of god damned pigeons, hearing their poor little bodies thump against my windshield. Pulling over, I survey the damage caused by my truck and those stupid birds, and get out to take a look.

I can see some of them have been completely pulverised by the impact. But as I approach one of the corpses, something about it catches my eye. Picking up the little fucker, I notice it's not a real bird at all.

It's a fucking robot, made of wires, gears and all kinds of shit. *What the fuck is going on here?* Before I can ponder it further, a bunch of those robot birds appear above me, flying in formation.

Jesus, I feel like I'm in a goddamn b-movie. But it’s all too real. I hop in my truck and head towards the centre of the city. I swerve through the streets, avoiding the damned traffic, all the while scouting out those robot birds. Something strange is afoot and I've gotta figure it out.

I pull up onto the street corner with my trusty old pick up, my ramshackle home away from home. I take a look at her and can't help but chuckle, nothing that good ever comes to me but her. But right now I'm more focused on my mission than its aesthetic attributes, I've got a robotic pigeon in one hand and a clenched fist itching to clobber those fuckers.

Steeling myself, I stride toward the center of The City, knowing I have little chance of success but still driven forward by my sense of determination and my desire for the truth. My goal? To discover why in the name of god there are robotic birds in my city instead of real ones.

I grab my trusty handgun, for safety more than for anything. I don't plan on using it - at least not on living flesh and bone - but then again you never know. Everywhere I looked, I saw them. Not a single real, feathered coo in sight and I knew the outrageous farce my first observations had been playing out for real. The robotic chickens and the robot pigeons.

They gave me the creeps. Chirpin', whirlin' around, flockin' all together like programmed puppets sent to replace our beautiful God-given critters. Not one, two, three or even four of the robotic birds, but herds of the fuckers. It felt like a slap in the face and I poured my rage into every punch of my fist and into every flap of my robotic avian tool.

But then, as if God himself had decided to give me a gift, a ray of light shone and illuminated a snazzy display on the underside of the partially charred robotic pigeon I was holding. There it was, branded in miniature lettering, clear as day "Property of the Government" it said. I was stunned, my stomach churned, my heart raced faster than a racing horse and my head felt like some invisible force was squeezing it.

Ya see, I knew it was fishy as soon as I had heard about sudden lack of birds in the sky, but never would I have expected something as morally wrong and just downright friggin' disrespectful as this. To think that some shit-lappers had infiltrated my life, my city and our freedom to have a natural bird's life, simply to get what they wanted, to march in and take control, completely unobserved and with no notice. And by doing that, also strip us of our privacy, our ecology, our wildlife, but also our basic right to choose.

So right there, at that moment, my mission became more than just an outrage, what was once a mere physical mission had taken on an emotion dimension, and I was determined to get justice even if it meant going head to head with the very people who were authorised to take it away from us. I was bursting with rage and passion. The only thing I can think of to do to calm me down is to point my trusty pistol in the sky and pull the trigger, BANG. 6 times I make that sucker shoot, until it’s smoking and empty. I toss it in the trash like the used up whore that raised me.

I get back behind the whee of my beat up bucket of bolts and crank up it so it grinds to life. There's no denying I'm a man on a mission. Everywhere I'm headed is aiming for one purpose - to spread the word about them robotic goddamn pigeons. And there's no lack of injustice in my bones as I start this journey.

**I see these little robotic corpses jostling around in the back of truck,** almost like they're pleading with me to do something; to take a stand against such government skullduggery. No one needs to be told that they are walking all over us with high-tech bird-brains snooping around and infringing on our God-given liberties.

What kind of future kinda lies in store for us if they can just do as they please and get away with it?

I can feel the tension in the run-down streets of The City like a rush of electricity surging through my veins as I drive my battered pick-up. Every corner I turn, every alley I cruise through, I can feel the eyes of the robotic pigeons on me, watching me, tracking me. And yet when I look around, no one else seems to care.

I think of the pigs that approached me earlier and warned me to stop destroying the robotic pigeons. "You can't keep doing this. It's illegal! They’re just birds!” they had bellowed at me. Like any power-hungry, little snot-nosed cop, they thought they could intimidate me, but they were wrong. With one haymaker, I had sent the beefcake of a cop reeling to the ground with a sickening thud like a sack of wet cement.

That's when I heard it – the terrified whimpering of the other cop, like a whimpering rat begging for his life. It was a delightful sight, one that brought a cruel laugh to my lips. I knew I wasn't done yet.

There was still a horde of officials that wanted to shut me down, who wanted to keep the truth about the robotic pigeons hidden in the shadows. But I had to keep going. I still needed to collect evidence and continue testifying before the public, even if that meant confronting the authorities directly. I called them out on not shaking in their damned shoes, forcing them to accept my findings and the facts about the robotic pigeons, and the government's hand in creating them no matter how hard they denied it.

No matter how hard they fought and how much dirt they threw at me, I knew I had to keep pursuing the mission. Every night, as I closed my eyes, I could see the robotic pigeons following and tracking me, as if ready for battle. But I wasn't scared. I had prepared for this. Their sinister tactics weren't going to work on me. I was ready to stand my ground and to keep fighting until I had justice. And I knew that my mission was too important to be silenced or ignored. No matter what it took, I vowed to keep going until the world knew the truth.

The sun beat down mercilessly on the street, the buildings towering over the city like sentries watching over a prison. The day seemed endless, eternal and hot, the sweat and blood of the people who walked those streets combining to create a thick, cloying fog, an atmosphere in which the meagre hope they held seemed to exist only in the imaginations of the inhabitants.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so I'm uploading photos and videos in every corner of the internet I can find. The responses have been a mix - from disbelieving to downright furious, even appalled in some cases. Some joke around, but I won't deny they sweep all sympathy away. I will use whatever means I can to prove to the world that what I'm saying is true - we not only have right to be safe, but we have a right to justice. No one should have to face the consequences of unchecked power.

They may not believe it yet, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, or die trying. I'm the only one here fighting this fight, and I'm ready to battle it out whatever it takes. No one rocks this boat on my watch. I'll fight 'til my dying breath against these wicked beasts no matter the cost. I'm ready to take the bull by the horns - and I won't rest 'til every last robot pigeon pays for its sins.

I'm trundling down the street in my old pick-up truck, knackered and worn-out, loaded with evidence of the government's insidious activities. My asshole clenched tight in fear and anger, my heart pounding a chaotic rhythm against my ribs. I have to make this work, I have to make sure the people of this city know what's really going on.

I pull up at the city hall and already, people have started to gather, refugees from an unjust system come with equal parts fear and hope in their eyes. I open the back of my beat-up pick-up truck and unload the mangled robotic pigeons on to the pavement - their metallic guts spilling out in a twisted display. I hook up my old loudspeaker and start to talk, spilling out my findings, opinions and showing them the evidence I've collected.

I can hear the murmurs of shock and outrage as the crowd grows - the truth bearing down on them like Atlas' burden. I'm determined to fight, to hold the government accountable and daring them to try to silence me. The crowd is starting to get into it, their eyes burning with anger, their fists up in the air. I look around at the unique faces and I know I'm helping to build something powerful, unbreakable.

This has to end and it's starting here - a new strength, determination fills me and I start to yell and gesture wildly. I wave around the robots, emphasizing the depravity of the government, and continue to share my findings. My words are starting to get through and the crowd starts to shriek in understanding. The police arrive and try to break the gathering up but barely manage to contain the outrage.

My words seem to spread like wildfire through the city, travelling from ear to ear and igniting a mass understanding of the danger. The next day is filled with news stories, government apologies, and promises to never use robotic pigeons again - I'm filled with a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I have made a difference. Even if my efforts never get acknowledged or remembered, I know that I did what I could and it was enough.

The next day I’m in my truck, just fucking around, kind of in a weird, numb state of mind. I can't stop thinking about yesterday, it's been replaying over and over again in my mind, the victory, the sweetness of succeeding at something. I stretch out my arms across the steering wheel, close my eyes and just sit there. All the worries of life, all the bad shit i've done, none of it matters right now. I'm too happy to think about the consequences of success. But then, suddenly, my phone buzzes beside me with a strange message.

"Congratulations on your victory, but your fight is far from over. The government has other, more sinister plans for the robotic spy pigeons, and if you don't stop them, it will be too late." Instantly I jerk up and my head fills with fear and dread. What are they up to? I try to trace where the message came from, but of course, it's untraceable.

I can't help but think that the government is watching my every move, and that this message is a warning about the true purpose of the robotic pigeons--something far more sinister than just spying on people. I know I have to get moving, but it feels like I'm stuck in a trance.

I take a deep breath, let it out, and reluctantly turn the ignition. The engine roars and I'm drawn in by the promise of the unknown, a mixture of anticipation and terror swirling inside me. As I drive, my mind is spinning, memories of the times when I had failed bubbling up, filling me with adrenaline and determination. I keep my eyes trained on the road, silently awaiting the answers I'm seeking and my chance to put an end to the government's clandestine plans.

I pass buildings and street lamps and spotted dogs. I turn my attention to the sky, and there, amidst the stars, I see a flock of robotic pigeons, gliding beneath The City sky, in eternal stillness and silence.
