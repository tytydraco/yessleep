I've always been terrified of bathrooms.

I know this sounds silly but please bear with me. Just something about being so vulnurable and the heavy sense of isolation a bathroom creates makes me feel uneasy. Sometimes, the difference in how the air feels in there almost makes it feel like I'm in the mouth of a great beast. The strange growths, the slight dampness, the noises a pipe makes... all of it is enough to make my skin crawl. All of that being said, I've been living in a nightmare.

Being a broke, social recluse, moving out of parents' house and finding a place to live proved to be one of the hardest things I've ever done. Working at a gas station, I can barely afford to survive, let alone find a comfortable living space. Ad after ad, every apartment I found either came with a bunch of roommates or were way out of what I could realistically afford. Until I found what I was looking for. The apartment was tiny. It was a studio with a tiny bathroom in a rather sketchy part of town. I applied instantly. I got a call back later that night.

A week later, here I was with the keys to this apartment on the second floor with a note from the landlord explaining the rules. The landlord, Gary, was an older man, I'd guess late 50s. He reeked of cigarettes and piss. He was nice enough to help me carry my stuff upstairs but I was glad to be rid of him when he finally left. As I finally lay on the creaking wooden floorboards, I finally took a look at the rules\*\*.\*\* It was just stuff I expected.

**Don't be too loud.**

**No pets.**

**Do not feed the rats.**

**Rent is due no later than he 5th of every month.**

things the ad mentioned anyway. As my weight shifted and the floorboards creaked, I realized something that made me uneasy. Why does it feel like I am the only person in this whole building? I thought about it again...and even though I remember seeing some people around the hallway and the lobby, there not a single sound other than my own breathing.

The bathroom was tiny. The toilet seat crowded with the tiny shower space. There was a nauseating thickness to the air. The place had a smell of decay to it, covered up with cheap lemon spray. I slowly turned the knob on the sink to brush my teeth, all the while dreading the color of the water. To my relief, the water looked clear and didn't smell like anything. I quickly brushed my teeth, washed my face and went back out, making sure to close the door behind me.

My first night in that apartment was plagued with nightmares. In my dream, I was tiny, with little tiny hands. My fur was covered in grease and my skin burned as I skittered over the slippery bathroom floor. My eyes slowly lost their function as the chemicals slowly ate their way under my skin. I didn't think in words, I just felt fear. Fear and the sinking feeling of despair as my life faded. I found my way down a drain pipe, finding some comfort in the fact that I could escape into the sewers. But as I slid down into the foul smelling darkness, my breath was caught and I woke up. Coughing, choking on something caught on my throat, I ran to the bathroom. But before I could make it all the way, I puked all over the floor and myself. This was not a good first night.

I was hesitant about getting in the shower. The pipes creaked and there was a strange guttural noise before the shower head started to work. As I stood there naked, covered in my own vomit, I considered leaving and going back to my parents' house. This was still an unfamiliar place, and my fear of bathrooms began to slowly take hold of me. I was anxious about closing my eyes under water. Even if it was for a second, the idea of being all alone under pouring water put images of sinkining into a dark, deep abyss in my head, of being swallowed by a beast.

I finally gathered the courage to stand under the water, letting it run down my body. The soothing warmth of the water almost made me forget about the whole ordeal. The arms of heat wrapped around me like a mother comforting her child. I stuck my tongue out to rinse my mouth only to immediately spit it out. The water was salty. Not like ocean water, but almost as if I was tasting my own tears. All of a sudden, the shower stopped. A draft of cold air hit my bare, wet skin and I began to feel nauseous. I shook the shower head a bit, only for some water to drip through the sides. Turning the knob, I heard water pressuring up behind the shower. Slowly, I began to unscrew the shower head, bracing myself against being splashed... only for there to be nothing. My eyes shut tight, I was hesitant- anticipating a gross sight. I heard water trickling down the pipe and slowly brought myself to look.

An eye stared back at me. I felt the hair at the back of my neck stand up as my blood froze, paralyzing me. Forced to look at what I prayed was just a dream. A human sized eye was in the pipe, bulging out towards the end, leaking water in what looked like tears. The eyeball rolled around, shocked and fearful. Lodged in place, without a body attached to it, the eye remained attached to the brass pipe. I kneeled and began to retch. All the while, the eye stared at me. I never heard the pressure build back up and all of a sudden the water began to flow again. I ran out the bathroom, damp and almost busting my head in the process.

Trying to calm myself down, I began to breathe. Slow, deep breaths. I needed to relax and think about it. There was no way I just saw what I saw. I had to be dreaming, there had to be something wrong with me. I must be exhausted. My self talk brought me some comfort. The water still ran in the bathroom, and I grabbed my balls, mentally telling myself to man up and turn the shower off. A second look and there will probably be nothing there.

I still could not bring myself to look as I turned the water off. "Don't be a pussy." I slowly turned to look. The eye still stared back at me, following my every movement. I grabbed my toothbrush, letting my intrusive thoughts get the best of me as I slowly used it to poke the eye. Water dripped down, like tears from the eye. I gagged again.

A sudden knocking on my door made me jump. Putting some clothes on my still wet body, I answered.

Gary stood there in a greasy tank top. He looked exhausted, still reeking of piss and smoke.

"You're being too loud. I've had complaints." He said, unamused. "And you won't answer the phone."

"Sorry..." I blurted out.

Gary grunted, turning to leave. "Read the rules kid. I don't wanna make a second trip. Whatever you're doing, keep it down. You've got neighbors."

"Wait." I said. "There... something wrong with my shower."

He laughed, looking me up and down, at my wet clothes. "I can tell. I don't wanna hear it right now. It's too damn late, office hours are 9am - 5pm, outside of those times, emergencies only."

"But-" Before I could finish my sentence, Gary turned around. His eyes slowly widened as and fear washed over his face.

"You're not feeding the rats are you?" He asked through a strained whisper.

"What?" I asked.

"Don't do it." Gary coughed and began walking away, mumbling to himself.

I stood there for a moment longer in the dusty hallway before getting back in my apartment. I turned around to see my vomit spilled on the floor halfway to the bathroom. I did not plan to go anywhere near it, and so I grabbed my phone and left the apartment. It was about 4 am. I figured I'll just go to work early, get changed in my car.

As I walked down the dusty hallway. I felt another chill creeping up my spine. Why did it feel like I was surrounded by eyes?

I caught a wiff of the same foul darkness from my dream. A fleeting scent. The floor above me creaked, like something heavy settled its weight down onto it. It's too late to get out of my lease.
