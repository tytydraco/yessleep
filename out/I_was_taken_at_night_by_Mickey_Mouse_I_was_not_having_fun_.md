You probably heard tales of Disney's abandoned properties. Parks and resorts that they spent billions on and closed either because of a scandal or some inconvenience. These parks are still a topic of many discussion and different scary stories. But have you ever wondered if there are any more parks like it? Because i think i found one park that probably no one knows about. Cause it just so happens to be placed deep inside a forest next to my hometown. 

I lived in a very nice town next to a forest, and it just so happened that i was living very close to it. I work as a rookie cop at my town's police department. I was never a big fan of Disney, i did like some movies and cartoons, but i never was obsessed with it. I never went to Disneyland and i never had any thoughts about visiting the happiest place on Earth, cause it's expensive, far away from where i live, and i was never a big fan of different rides and attractions. And after what i experienced, i don't even want to step my foot to the land of the rat. 

Everything started on a one particular day. Police officer i worked with, let's call him Reginald for privacy's sake, informed me that a kid has gone missing, and he was last seen entering the forest, so it's now our job to track him down. We sat in a car and drove to the place where he was last seen, we stepped out and went searching for the kid. Trying to find someone in the woods is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I went very deep into the woods, and i noticed something odd.. a castle.. in the woods? I was curious, so i got closer.. and i was right.. a literal wooden castle in the woods, and not just a castle, but a goddamn park. The park was large, overgrown, and it looked unfinished or maybe just broken? Since i was looking for a child, i knew well that there is a possibility that kid entered the park, so i went in. 

"Henry! Where are you!?" - I yelled, as i looked at my surroundings.

 I saw a statue of what seems to be Mickey Mouse in a lumberjack outfit, holding an axe and a log. A disney park?  I couldn't believe my eyes. Is it a some sort of bootleg park? Art project? Or is it an actual abandoned park? I was more focused on searching for the missing kid, so i put those thoughts aside and continued to call his name. If i said i didn't feel paranoia, i would be lying, cause this place feels like it is not supposed to be this empty. I felt like i was hearing something moving, so i looked around, hoping to find the child, but instead i found no one. What i found instead was a.. drawing on the wall. It looked to be a mouse, and few other messy doodles of a duck, a dog, another mouse and a dog person holding hands. I took a picture of the drawing, and i suddenly received a call from Reginald, telling me that he found the kid. I sighed with relief and ran to the exit.. but on my way to the exit, the feeling of being watched intensified. Some people say that they can feel when they are being watched, well, that's what i felt while going back to Reginald's car. I looked back, but saw no one behind me.

When i returned to Reginald, the Kid was sitting in the car. A small boy, approximately 7 years old, sat with a worried look on his face. I walked up to him, and told him that we will take him to his mommy, and that everything is gonna be ok. Kid looked at me with a smile, and i felt relieved that this little boy was safe. We drove him to his house, and his mother thanked us for finding him. We sat back into the car, and i told Reginald about the park. Reginald looked confused, like i told him that my grandpa saw an owl with breasts in Taiga. 

"What do you mean a Disney park in the forest?"

"Yes! An abandoned disney park, with a forest theme, i think. I didn't even know it existed until now! I even took some photos! See?"

I showed him pictures that i took of the place. Reginald was convinced surprisingly. He asked me where i found it, and i told him that i found it deep in the woods, but i don't know the directions. Reginald took some notes, and told me that maybe if we''ll have time, we can take a look at it together. I nodded, and we drove back to the station. The rest of the day was normal, but i couldn't get this place off my mind. How could i? I literally found an amusement park in the woods, and not just any amusement park, but possibly a resort made by The Big Mouse. 

When i got back home, i decided to find some information about some abandoned parks that i might not have heard about. I haven't found any information on the illusive forest park. Most of the links lead to articles and pages about the big 2, the Treasure island and River country. I had so many questions and so little answers, so little is an understatement, i haven't found any answers whatsoever, like they hide them on purpose. I sighed and i felt dizzy, so i went to bed. I decided that maybe i'll check the place with Reginald tomorrow, cause going there alone felt like a bad idea. Reginald was a strong middle aged officer, so with him by my side, i will feel safer there, i thought. I eventually just turned my brainnoff and fell asleep, trying not to think about the park.

I woke up in the middle of the night from the sound of music coming from outside my house. I lived next to a forest, and usually the sound of rusting trees and wind helps me fall asleep, but now i hear strange music instead, and that means that my sleep is probably not gonna be as tight as i thought. I tried to fall asleep, and ignore the sounds, but i realized something.. that was music from Steamboat Willy. The first ever cartoon about Mickey Mouse, for those who don't know. I felt chill run down my spine, was it coming from the park? I usually sleep facing the wall, so when i turned around to look at my window.. i found myself looking at the face of an unwelcomed visitor. A tall, lanky, dark creature, with a wide smile, large eyes, and round ears, stared at me through the window. 

I was completely defenceless, i didn't have a gun, nor a knife to defend myself with, nor am i a master of martial arts, so i didn't know what to do. I realized what this creature reminded me off.. Mickey Mouse. This thing looked like an ugly version of Mickey, it looked wrong, completely wrong. I just stared at it as it stared at me, until it suddenly opened my window and crawled to me very quickly. I screamed, but i couldn't run, like something nailed me to my bed. It quickly grabbed my hand with a tight grip, looking at me with a wide smile as it started talking.

"Let's go to wonderland! Haha! Come on! Come on!" - It said to me, while desperately trying to pull my hand.

It's grip was so tight, i felt like he was going to rip my hand off. It's voice.. it sounded like Mickey's, but it felt more like an imitation of his voice. It didn't sound right. I desperately tried to pull my hand away, trying to escape, but it was so tight. I had to do something so i answered.

"I don't want to! Let me go!" 

"It'll be fun! Let's go to wonderland! Haha! Haha! Hahahaha!!"

I felt like i couldn't actually escape, so i had to figure out what to do. He won't stop until i go to "wonderland" with him.. so i decided not to make him angry, or else he will definetely rip my arm off. I took a deep breath.

"Fine.. Take me to the wonderland." - I answered.

After hearing my words, he instantly rushed out of my house, taking me with him. He was fast, my legs barely kept up with his. We ran through the woods, i tripped several times along the way, but we ended up at the entrance to the same park i came across at the woods. He suddenly stopped. I tried to catch my breath. This.. Mickey really wanted my attention. Why me specifically? I didn't know. What i did know, is that i had to comply, or else he'll do god knows what to me. The sound of music came from the park, and it was not lit up by lightbulbs. And now i can clearly see the park in the darkness. The place was filled with wooden houses, huts, and in the middle of it all was an unfinished castle, similarly to one that they have in actual disney world, but smaller. I found more statues of different disney characters in the park too, some of which had weird doodles on them.

Mickey looked at me with his smile, and i had to mention, i didn't see a single tooth inside his maw, just pure darkness. He began to speak.

"This is my home! Hope you like it! Haha haha! I want you to meet my friends! Haha! Here they are!"

He grabbed my arm again and took me somewhere. He seems to have a habit of constantly laughing, i thought. There was a small pond at the park, where i saw what seems to be.. Donald, at least.. what i assumed to be Donald. He had white feathers, had his good old blue hat and sailor costume, but he had wings, or.. arms? Or maybe a mix of both perhaps. He tried to swim like a duck, but he couldn't, so he just stood in the pond. He stepped out, his legs were skinny, he had duck like legs, and very small eyes.. and he had not only a duck beak, but also some teeth inside his mouth. 

"This is my good friend Donald! Hello Donald!

The duck tried to talk, but instead of words, or funny duck noises Donald would make, he made a mix of gurgling and screeching. Throat sounds, so to speak. Mid sentance he spat black sludge, which grossed me out and i nearly threw up. Donald watched me close, scratching himself in different places while doing so. I decided to back away, which caused Mickey to grab my arm and lead me to Goofy next.

Goofy stood down next to a Dog House. He looked like a literal dog man. With human teeth and two large teeth that Goofy is famous for. His eyes were small and he looked dazed. He smelled like sweat and dirt. 

"And this is my friend Goofy! How do you do, Goofy?"

"I-I'm.. Fine.. Mickey.." - Goofy answered, stuttering and muterring his sentence slowly. 

Something didn't feel right, and i felt like he was nervous or scared of Mickey. And his voice was not even close to Goofy's, it was deep and..raspy. That's when i noticed that inside the dog house, there was a dead body of a dog that looks like Pluto.. i couldn't understand why it was even dead in the first place, but i tried to ignore it. These weird things did not look like people in suits, they looked real and.. deformed. I felt a little scared of even looking at them. I felt like i was in a freak show. I was not dreaming, it was real, if it was a dream, i wouldn't have felt the pain in my wrist caused by Mickey's tight grip. 

Mickey grabbed me arm again, and with laughter he ran to a wooden replica of the steamboat from Steamboat Willy. This was the source of the music it seems. He let go of my hand and jumped onto the boat, and started spinning the wheel and whistling.. at least he tried, but he couldn't. 

"Jump on! Let's go on an adventure! Haha!"

I could always just run away, but i don't want to make him angry, so i jumped on-board and began put a sailor hat. Mickey looked at me, and thew me a shovel. 

"Come on, buddy! Throw the coal into the fire.. p-please.. i beg you.."

Total tone shift made me nod my head and play along, throwing coal into the fire, which was a cutout of fire. Mickey looked joyful and tapped his foot on the floor. While i threw coal at the cardboard fire. He suddenly stopped and jumped off the boat with me and ran to another direction. This kept going for an hour or so.. he would take me to another part of the park, like he tried to have fun with me.. i did not feel like i was having fun, i felt more concerned and curious why he was doing it. Eventually he ran out of things to show me and he left me on my own devices.

"Alright, little princess, you can explore my little home on your own if you want.. just.. don't.. Run off.. haha..got it?" - Mickey said, as his voiced started to change when he looked at me.

His huge eyes turned a little red, he gripped onto my arm tightly. I just nodded. He let go, and waved at me, and hopped somewhere else. I decided to not make him angry, so i decided to find another way out of here, maybe i need strategy to escape. I had no phone, so i had to rely on my own survival skills. One building in the park stood out, which looked like a small wooden house with a sign that said "Mickey's house". I decided to go and check it out for myself. The door was open by the looks of it. But i jumped after i saw what was lying next to the house. A corpse.. that looked like another mouse character? It looked more like a mouse than actual Mickey. He had two big front teeth, a snout, and mouse ears. He looks like he was beaten to death, his teeth lied next to the body, he was bleeding from the mouth and he looks like he was missing eyes, but upon further inspection.. he did have eyes.. human eyes, just deep inside his sockets. 

I shook my head and went to the door, gently opening it. I looked around and saw a newspaper on the table, a broken cup of coffee. The house was very dirty. It had a staircase leading to the second floor, so i went to check the second floor.. and i found a room that was open. I suddenly heard whispers coming from the other side. I looked inside.. and found what supposed to be Minnie Mouse.. i assume at least. Minnie had a big smile like Mickey, had a polkadot dress on her, and she sat on the floor in the corner. She looked straight at me.

"Who are you? A guest?" -She said, with a tired yet calm voice.

"Mickey brought me here.. but i did enter your park at one point while i was searching for a kid"

"I see.. guess he found his newest visitor. He tries to make a good impression. Are you enjoying the park so far?"

"Not really.. i am a little nervous.."

"Well, unless he lets you go, you're stuck here."

"I don't want to stay here! What if he will kill me like that guy next your house"

"Oh.. That's Mortimer. Mickey's rival, i guess. At least he was made to be one."

"Made?"

"He really liked me, but Mickey didn't like that, cause i'm supposed to be HIS little mouse. So he beat him until he was no more."

"Can you explain what you mean by made? I don't understand"

"We all have our roles. And Mickey wants us to follow them, like we are supposed to. Unless we'll ruin the magic."

"He definetely wants to make feel like this place is as magical as actual Disneyland huh.."

"He tries his best.. but not many want to follow the rules. Recently Donald ate Daisy, out of sheer boredom. He then tried to go for me, but Mickey stopped him, and they nearly fought."

"How many years have you been here?"

"They weren't always here. They got brought here. Cause supposedly they were useless to their creators. I am not one of them.. they just forced me to wear this.. ugly mask.. mutilated me to the point where the mask is now my face. I may not be the only one. I was made to be Mickey's Bride, so i have to please him, or else he will get mad.."

"How can i save you?"

"Don't bother.. You'll just waste time.. I do not need saving.. i just can't live without Mickey."

I felt disgusted hearing this, but now it started to make sense. These.. creatures.. they were made to act like the characters? Living mascots? They were made for entertainment purposes? That explains why Mickey is like this. My thoughts got interrupted by a loud gasp from the middle of the park. I decided to check it out.

"Before you go.. i guess you need more information.."- She said as he handed me a some sort of document. 

"Don't ask where i got it.. it will all make sense to you after you read it. The sun is rising. You should leave. I'll be fine"

"Thank you, Minnie.."

"My real name is Carol actually.. just.. remember this name"

I quickly rushed to see what caused this commotion. Mickey looked at Goofy with raging eyes, his hands were shaking and he was hunched. Goofy looked scared, and he was backing away slowly. I knew what happened. He found Pluto. And there is a possibility that his death was caused by Goofy. They argued with each other, Mickey screamed his lungs out at Goofy, who was barely even able to talk properly. Donald was also there, probably came here to see what happened.

"You Imbecile! How could you do such thing to Pluto! He was our friend! And you.. murdered him!?"

"I was.. hungry.

"You ruin the magic of this place! You're not meant to do that! First Daisy, now Pluto! Get in the dog house! I'm making you my dog!" 

"I won't.." 

Donald tried to intervene, making ugly sounds that made him puke more of the liquid from his mouth. 

"Oh, so you want to defend him!? You can't even swim properly, let alone talk! You are not Donald! You are an ugly duckling!"

Donald spat in his face. Mickey was enraged and his hands turned into fists as he rushed at Goofy and began to fight him. Goofy was barely able to defend himself, Donald tried to help but he became a victim too..now fighting two of his best friends, Mickey grabbed Goofy and ripped his jaw off, before proceeding to push his body inside the small dog house, finishing him off. He tore Donald's wings and choked him to death. I just stood and watched as this massacre unfolded. Mickey began to breath heavily, as he turned to face me. I expected him to come for me next.. but his eyes showed fear and sadness. He started to shake and his legs started to buckle.

"Haha! I-i did not expect you here! Haha haha! Sorry for haha for uh.. loud noises. W-we had a little fight haha! Don't worry!"

He turned his back to me and looked at the dead corpses of his former friends, he tried to put them back together, he began mumbling something and whimpering, like he was going to cry. He grabbed his head and began crying, i no longer heard the voice of Mickey, i heard the voice of a person who Mickey actually was. 

"No no no no no no no no no no.. no no no.."

I didn't know what to do? I could run away probably, but at the same time, he might catch me. As he cried, i noticed a big rock on the ground. As much as i didn't want to do it, i didn't want to do it, i had to, cause this may be the only way i could escape this place alive. I lifted the rock behind him as he weeped.. and hit him from behind in the back of the head, making him fall on the ground unconscious. I bashed him more and more until his head was nothing but a black mess. The black goop, it was their blood.. as much as i regretted my actions, i felt like this was the right thing to do. 

I grabbed my document and found my way out of the forest, before i passed out from shock. Later i woke up at the hospital, where Reginald was waiting for me. He was worried sick, cause i didn't show up to work. When he went to check on me, he found my door unlocked and house empty, so he called backup. I told him my story, and he explained that they will check the place after i'll get better. The document evidence i had was a document.. which i read while i was on my hospital bed all alone.

The document was about a project that Disney company were working on, a project to bring their toons to life. Experiment was conducted on homeless people, who were found on them property of Disney. Their memory got wiped completely in process of transformation and mind programming, which would allow the experimental prototypes to be just like their animated counterparts. Experiment did not succeed in making real copies of the toons. They didn't know what to do with them, so they decided to send them to an unfinished forgotten park by the name of "Woodland Wondeland", as a way to get rid of them. In order to keep the creatures entertained they brought several dogs, and women who were made to look like Minnie and Daisy, the list of women was huge.. and one of the girl's names was Carol, who was a young worker of Disneyland staff. Who knew that these creatures would end up becoming so desperate for attention..

After 1 week, our department was unable to investigate the park, cause they found the place destroyed and wrecked. They haven't found remains of the creatures, nor any statues of disney characters at the park. The case was closed and forgotten. Nobody ever spoke about the park.. and maybe that's for the best..
