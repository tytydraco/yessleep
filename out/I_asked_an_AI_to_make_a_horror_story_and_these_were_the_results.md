My name is Anna and I have a story to tell.  , It's a very small story but It's a scary story about an experience I had in an old house in the countryside, where things happened slowly but terrifyingly.

 I was looking for a quiet place to spend my vacation and found an abandoned country house that sounded perfect to me.  It was large, with a large garden and an incredible view of the mountains.  I decided to rent it for a few weeks and enjoy the peace of the countryside.

 At first, everything seemed smooth.  I spent my days exploring the area and relaxing on the porch.  I was loving spending time in that house, it was very nice and I had a lot of peace in it, one night I invited friends to visit me there, it was a lot of fun, we played games, we had a lot of jokes, we spent the whole night playing and making jokes, at 10 hours of the night we had pizza for dinner, we divided it normally for each one, and we finished the meal, they left at 12 o'clock, and I was also sleepy so I went to sleep, when I was in bed I saw a figure pass by my door, I thought that it was my imagination so i ignored it and went to sleep, i woke up the next morning with my makeup mirror lying on the floor, i thought i had done it myself while i was sleeping, so i just left it in its place, went to have breakfast , the day was beautiful, I went outside to look at the day and see, it was beautiful 

But, after a few days, I started to notice strange things happening around the house.  It was something subtle that I couldn't put my finger on, but I knew something was wrong.

 At night, I hear strange noises coming from inside the house.  They were so subtle that I couldn't place where they were coming from, but they were enough to put me on my toes.  I also noticed objects starting to move by themselves, as if something was pushing them. i went to check the house, i checked all the rooms, the house was pretty dark but i kept checking, i found nothing so i went back to my room and locked the door 

 One night, when I was lying in bed, I heard a noise coming from the hallway.  I knew there was no one there, but I got up to check anyway.  The hallway was empty, but I felt a shiver run down my spine, like someone was watching me.

 I started having horrible nightmares every night.  They were so vivid that I had a hard time differentiating reality from imagination.  In one of those nightmares, I saw a woman in a white dress standing at the end of the hall.  She looked at me with empty eyes and said "You shouldn't be here".

 I woke up with a scream and felt something tugging at my feet.  I looked down and saw a pale hand gripping my ankle.  I tried to free myself, but the hand was strong and wouldn't let me go.

 I finally managed to break free and ran out of the room.  I didn't know what was going on, but I knew I needed to get out of there as soon as possible.  I started to pack my things and get ready to leave, but something strange happened.

 The doors to the house began to close by themselves, as if someone were pushing them.  I tried to open them, but they were locked from the inside.  I was trapped in the house, with something or someone I couldn't see.

 I was terrified.  I did not know what to do.  I was desperate to get out of the house, but the doors and windows kept closing by themselves.  I felt trapped, surrounded by something terrible I couldn't see.

 I started to hear voices whispering my name, but when I looked around, there was no one around.  I knew I needed to find a way to escape the house, but I was so terrified I couldn't think straight.

 I decided to hide in the basement of the house, where I could wait until someone came to rescue me.  However, as soon as I entered the basement, I realized that something was wrong.  There was a bad smell in the air, and the temperature was very low.

 I continued to hide in the basement, but things continued to get worse.  I began to see figures darting by out of the corner of my eye, and I could hear screams and moans coming from dark and shadowy places.

 I knew I needed to get out of the house as soon as possible, but I was so terrified I couldn't move.  I felt something tugging at my leg, like something was trying to drag me into the darkness.

 I finally managed to break free and ran for the basement door.  I opened it with all my strength and ran out of the house.  I didn't look back until I was a safe distance away.

 When I finally got far enough away from the house, I looked back and saw that the windows and doors were all closed, as if nothing had happened.  I knew that house was haunted, and that I would never go back there.

 Since then, I have never stayed in an old or abandoned house.  The experience I had in that house left me forever traumatized, and I will never forget the terrifying things I saw and heard
