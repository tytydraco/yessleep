My husband is a diehard Bears fan. 

Lives for them. Breathes for them. During our whirlwind courtship, I didn’t quite understand the extent, but he puts on a good face in front of everyone. 

I also didn’t realize how bad this team was, either. 

We had been married for a few weeks when I saw what kind of a fan he was. What kind of a man he was, really. 

I was making dinner as the game kicked off, and elaborate spread of chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, and potato skins. It was our first time watching the game together in our new apartment, just the two of us, and I wanted this to be the start of a fun new tradition. Until the screaming started. 

“Jesus Christ!!”

He was screaming every curse word I had ever heard in my life. I pictured him limbless, in a pool of his own blood. Terrified, I quickly ran out of the kitchen to find him as red as a fire truck, shaking. “What’s wrong?”

“Shut the fuck up!” he bellowed. I staggered back. I had never seen him so worked up before, his bulging eyes glued to the screen. It took me a few seconds to realize he was reacting to the game.

“Honey, the neighbors-“

I didn’t finish my sentence. The beer bottle aimed at my head did it for him when it grazed my cheek and exploded against the wall.

I came to despise football season. 

He wore an incredible mask of self-control when he was out in public or had friends over, but when it was just the two of us, I knew to brace myself. Every shout made me jump out of my skin. I learned to be as quiet as a mouse, because the minute he remembered I was in the room, something was getting thrown at my head. Or worse.

One night, as I was taking out the remnants of an end table he had destroyed in the aftermath of an another lost game to the dumpster, I ran into my neighbor, Tabitha. She was a middle-aged woman with huge, pale blue eyes who never smiled no matter how many friendly waves I sent her way. But tonight, she spoke to me.

“Another rough night?”

I couldn’t meet her eyes. “I guess you could say that.” I didn’t realize she knew what was going on but with how loud he was, who wouldn’t?

“I used to be married to a man like that, you know,” she said, her voice suddenly low. I finally turned and looked at her. She was smiling.

“I know how you can fix your marital issues. It worked for me.” She winked.

I didn’t say anything, just stared. She approached me and pulled what looked like a small pebble out of her pocket. Grasping my hand in hers, which felt as delicate and ephemeral as a bird, she pressed the smooth little stone into my palm. “Just as the game is starting, swallow this.” 

She released my hand and started shuffling away, then turned back around one last time.

“Have fun.”

Dumbfounded, I put the pebble in my pocket and headed back up to my apartment. I ruminated on the encounter a bit, but my husband was drunk and soon I had some bigger problems to deal with than my odd neighbor. 

The next weekend, my fingers gripped the ladle I was using to stir the chili pot so tightly they were turning white. The team was failing me yet again and I was tense with anticipation as I heard the shouts grow louder. Every thump made me drop or knock something over with fear. As I smoothed my apron nervously, my hands brushed up against something small and hard in my front pocket. 

The pebble. 

I remembered Tabitha’s face, the way it glowed luminously in the street light with a kind of strange glee. 

“Fuck!” A glass smashed against the wall. The second one tonight.

Without thinking, I stuffed the pebble into my mouth and swallowed. Fear set my skin on fire and whatever Tabitha gave me had to better than the situation I found myself in now.

Her words echoed in my mind as everything around me slowed. Have fun.

The kitchen grew smaller. Steamier. Claustrophobic. I felt my muscles and sinews swell and my breath grew hot and frothy. I felt larger than life. Powerful. More in control than I had ever been. 

Slowly, I made my way into the living room. I could see his red, bulging hand squeezing another glass full of Maker’s Mark. I knocked over a dining chair as I rounded the corner toward him.

“Jess, you better stay out of my fucking face right now!” he bellowed, eyes still fixed to the tv.

So I waited patiently until the next commercial break. Like a good wife.

He finally turned and dramatically started to say “what—“ until his bulging eyes began to practically pop out of his head for a reason other than a shitty defense for once.

My jaws hung open in anticipation. I wanted him to see all of my new teeth. 

I relished the fear in his eyes. Thought about all of the times he made me feel constantly afraid in my own home. It aroused me. Drove me crazy. I couldn’t hold back anymore. I loved the way he looked at me.

After all, my husband LOVES bears.
