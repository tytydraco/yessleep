**PRESENT**

I have only told a few people about what I’m about to tell you guys. I’ve mostly kept this a secret all my life.

When I was just about to turn 14, I wanted to have a sleepover with all my closest friends. I was the leader of my small gang, so everybody knew where my house was, and how to get there. My friends, Matthew, Jude, and Neo were all coming over to watch movies, eat cake, and obviously... play Call of Duty, like any other about to be teenager would. 

**??? YEARS AGO**

**7:14 PM**

As all moms do at sleepovers, they make you go out to go get your friends from outside.

“Hey guys, wassup?” I asked.

“Not much, where’s the cake?”

“Calm your fat ass down, you’ll get it later,” I said, laughing.

Jude, obviously said he wasn't fat and decided to call us fat instead, because that's the kind of arguing that 14 year olds continue to do.

Luckily, my parents didn’t hear me say that. They hate it when I swear. 

Once my friends and I were all situated, and of course after we ate some cake, we decided to put on a movie. A movie that I thought was a timeless classic.

“Cam, I’m getting so tired of this crap. We’re literally falling asleep. Can’t we watch something else?” Matthew asked. 

“No dude, *Predator* is peak. These movies are amazing, but you, my good sir, are just too dumb and stupid to realize it, because all you watch is Anime.”

Matthew, being the weeb he is, started rambling about why *One Piece* is the greatest show ever. (None of the other guys watched Anime)

Once the masterpiece of Arnold shooting up an alien in the jungle was over, we got bored.

“Yo, Neo and Jude, whaddya guys wanna do?” I asked them both.

“Man, anything except watching another stupid 80s movie,” Jude said.

“I agree, that movie was kinda ass,” Neo said in a sarcastic voice.

“Well, my bad for choosing a “terrible” movie that you mentally ill kids don’t understand.”

“Man, we ain’t any more stupid than you are,” Neo said.

We all had a good laugh about that. We are all best friends, after all.

**8:37 PM**

We all played a some Call of Duty once my parents fell asleep, and after a few hours, we decided we should probably sleep.

**1:17 AM**

I was lying on one of the couches awake. Neo was asleep on the floor on an air mattress, Jude was asleep on the other couch, and Matthew was asleep on the rocking chair. I could hear the light sprinkling of the falling rain coming down from the sky, and the smell of the leftover buttered popcorn in the bowl on the coffee table. I took a handful of popcorn and shoved it in my mouth, dropping some pieces. That’s when my heart stopped. I head somebody or something whisper my name. 

“What the hell? Who’s there?” I whispered quietly.

More whispers filled my ears, and I thought I was going. Maybe I really was mentally ill.

“Please stop it,” I started raising my voice and covering my ears.

“Haha, we got him guys.”

The living room light filled the room, and there, I saw all my friends, wide awake, laughing their asses off.

“Man, that was not funny at all! I thought I was going crazy!” I yelled.

“That was the point, dumbass,” Neo said.

“What now?” I asked.

“I dunno man, all go back to sleep?” Jude pleaded.

“Nah, now that we’re all wide awake, I think I have an idea,” I said.

I proposed my idea to all of them.

We just had to make sure we were quiet, so my parents wouldn’t wake up.

Haha, if we were caught, we’d be dead.

**1:30 AM**

As the stupid kids we are, we all headed down to the local park right down my street.

Along with 5 cans of spray paint. Our plan was to tag the bathroom, inside and outside.

We arrived in the park around 1:30, and it was still drizzling lightly. It was as foggy as the underhalf of the Golden Gate Bridge, and it was hard to see much of anything. I forgot how big it was.

I thought I saw something in the dark, but I decided to rub it off my shoulder. Probably wasn’t anything.

Once we arrived in the bathroom, we got out some flashlights, a speaker, turned on *American Idiot*, and got out all the spray cans.

**1:45 AM**

We tagged some pretty cool stuff in the bathroom, made some sick drawings. That’s when we heard something outside.

“Shit, man, is that a cop or something??” I asked with a shortage of breath.

“I don’t know, lemme go check it out,” Neo said.

I walked out with him, and he said he wanted to go look around for a minute. I walked around with him for a bit, then went back.

He stayed behind.

I was surprised he volunteered, I didn’t know he was that brave.

**1:50 AM**

“Neo still isn’t back yet. I’m going to look for him,” I volunteered to do.

Outside, it was raining even harder. I was sure no cops were here, because there wasn’t a car parked outside.

“Neo?” I called out to him.

No answer.

I shined my flashlight around, looking for him, and then I saw him.

Not standing there in front of me, but *hanging*.

There he was, hanging from the nearest tree, a rope was wrapped around his neck, throat slashed, one leg missing.

“HOLY SHIT! NEO!” I screamed to him.

That’s when I realized that it wasn’t a rope. He was hung up by his lungs.

“Cam? Is everything okay out there, man?” I heard Jude call to me.

“NO DUDE, NEO’S DEAD!”

“WE GOTTA GO, MAN,” I yelled to Matthew and Jude, who were still hiding in the bathroom.

We collected our cans and were about to head out, when we realized that the front gate was closed. There was no official way out.

“I think I know a way out, near that fence in the back? I think that there’s a hole in part of it!” Jude told us.

“Okay man, I just wanna go home,” I said, crying.

**???**

We were just a few minutes away from the gate, when I had to stop. My asthma was kicking in, and I realized that I forgot my inhaler.

“Guys, lemme go rest for a minute, I think we’re good for now,” I said, out of breath.

“I wanna rest too. Matthew, keep lookout,” Jude said.

“Okay, Cam, what do you think happened to Neo”?

“I have no idea, Jude, I just want to go home. This was a terrible idea.”

I turned around for one second.

When I looked back, Jude was ripped apart, with brain matter exiting through the vertical slice in his head.

His blood was splattered all over my white shirt. I was soaked in it. Half of his head fell off the top of his neck. I then realized that his chest was ripping open and his lungs were flung everywhere. That’s when I threw up.

I screamed to Matthew,

“DUDE, WHERE ARE YOU?”

“I’m right here, man, what happened?”

“JUDE’S GONE. HE DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.”

“WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?”

“His head was sliced open right down the middle,” I explained.

“Jesus Christ man, what do we do?”

“Get as far away from here as possible, even if that means just going home.”

Matthew and I started running towards the fence where the hole was, and it led into a restricted area where a bridge being built was crossing over a large hole going horizontally all the way across the length of the park. The bridge was done, but there was no support. Matthew and I decided to try to cross the bridge, even if it meant we both didn’t make it. It didn’t hurt to try. The rain was coming down very hard, and it was even foggier than it was before.

“Come on Matthew, we might not make it!”

“I’m coming, just hold on, my legs hurt!”

“MATTHEW, HURRY THE FUCK UP!”

“MATTHEW!”

“MATTHEW?”

I turned around when we were halfway across the bridge, and saw Matthew.

He was there, but his head wasn’t. As I saw his head fall to the ground with a pool of blood surrounding him, head on the ground, guts ripped out of his stomach, intestines pouring out, I looked around. 

“WHY DID I SURVIVE? WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DIE?”

There was nobody else to be seen.

…

**???**

There was a security camera at the park. We are now able to see who committed the murders.

**POLICE STATION INTERROGATION ROOM:** **PRESENT**

“Do you know why you are here?”

“Because some of my friends were killed.”

“Do you know who committed these murders?”

“I already told you, no. Why do you keep asking me the same question?”

“Why do you think?”

“I don’t know. I really don’t.”

The police then showed me the footage of what happened at the park that night.

The footage showed me, brutally murdering my three friends. It was all there. I ripped out. Neo's intestines and hung him from the tree. I sunk a rusted machete into Jude's head. I hung Matthew from the bridge with ripped out lungs. The reason that I am able to be writing this right now, is because they are giving me one last chance to write something or call somebody. Tomorrow is my execution.
