It was hard to tell under the faintly translucent red coating, but I thought the house beneath looked quite old. There was a chimney too large to be decorative poking out from the sludge, and the bricks were laid without mortar in the old Nartem style. 

Ana’s footsteps slowed beside me, and I stopped a few meters away from the beginning of the wax. I scanned the perfectly smooth red floor, as pristine as if it had been set mere seconds ago. What I’d thought was wax acted more like mercury, flowing together instantly around our feet without leaving so much as an indent where we’d walked. Thankfully our rain boots’ waterproofing seemed to work on whatever substance this was, although you never knew. 

The door was sealed over, but I’d looked up the blueprints for the house that had been here, and assuming the spective hadn’t warped geometry the entrance should have been right in front of us. “Stick, please,” I said, holding out my hand.

Ana wordlessly placed the six-inch ivory baton into my palm, and I probed the wall of wax. To my surprise the stick went straight through; a little more exploration outlined the shape of a door half-ajar, frozen in ever-liquid wax.

Walking through the coating over the door felt a little like going through a drive-thru car wash, if that car wash used a particularly offputting shade of red soap. Liquid sheeted over my helmet for a heartbeat, then let me go without so much as a stain. Ana was already on the other side, her body loose and ready to burst into motion as she scanned the room for threats.

I was more focused on what this room told me about our client. Bizarrely, the wax seemed to have covered everything in the room nigh-instantaneously. The refrigerator door was still open, despite the fact that it should have been spring-loaded, and after staring at it for a little, the strange shape on the counter resolved into a milk carton frozen mid-pour… which meant that the lump on the chair behind it was…

“Tsu, I’ve found three of the missing persons,” Ana said, somewhat unnecessarily. 

The spective had entombed a family of three here. One at the stove—even the *fire* was outlined in wax, that’d be worth a few bucks in our intel report—and two more at the dinner table, stopped mid-gesture.

I wasn’t sure whether to hope they were still alive.

Ana nudged one of the frozen bodies, and immediately, the entombed figure retched and doubled over. Ana jerked back in a flash, reaching out to catch them, but the moment she lost contact, the figure stiffened once more. Before I could say anything, something must have caught her attention because she leapt forwards in a blur, standing between me and the table. A heartbeat later, a ripple in the wax shot upwards, pouring into the coated shape of a child too young to gender.

“Hello,” I slowly said. “I’m Tsutarrah, we’re Orchards, and we’re here to help.”

“Get out of here,” they whispered, strained.

Though she stayed between me and the spective, Ana let me take the lead. I held up my hands, showing them to be empty, and said, “I’m not going to hurt you.”

“I know,” the spective hissed. “But if you don’t leave I’ll hurt you. I’m sorry.”

I brushed against Ana, and she widened her stance. “You’re not going to hurt us, either,” she said, and even if I hadn’t seen her kill the people who were too far gone I would have known bone-deep that she was telling the truth.

The child of wax just clenched their fists. “The voices say you have to go,” they snapped. “You’re ruining everything!”

“You hear voices?” I asked, gently. 

They nodded frantically, droplets of their liquid body splashing and melding into the whole. “They’re going to stop you,” they said. “It’s too late.”

Ana drew an artifact from her belt, aiming it at the walls as they began to writhe red, but the only fear I felt was for the child spective. Even going in blind, Ana and I were not the ones in danger here. And if by some miracle this child did manage to stop us from returning, they’d be screwed anyway. No path that started with violence ended well for the child in red.

So I did the only thing I could and empathized.

“Can I ask the voices a question?” I said.

The tendrils of liquid wax curling in from the walls quivered, and though Ana’s eyes flicked from side to side she let me speak. The molten body in the shape of a child rocked back as if struck.

“They… you can’t hear them. Can you?” the child asked, voice quavering.

“I can’t,” I confirmed. “But could you ask them a question for me?”

The child shivered, little droplets of wax dripping from the ceiling and sliding stainlessly off our suits. “Nobody’s ever… I haven’t tried before. I don’t know.” They looked up, and though they had no face I saw the outline of their mouth between waves of disturbed fluid. “Can I try?”

I nodded, the motion awkward under my biker’s helmet. “Can you ask them why they want to hurt us?”

The walls thrashed, and Ana grabbed me with one arm, but the child visibly *strained* and the room fell calm once more. 

“They can’t tell you,” the child whispered. “But… if you wanted… I think I could *show* you.”

Ana squeezed my arm gently, the motion a question in a language only the two of us knew. *Will you risk yourself for them?*

In response, I peeled myself away from her protective grasp. *This time.*
