As an autistic child, I had a wildly active imagination. While I watched the world fly by as I sit in a comfortable minivan seat, I would take pictures of the world around me with each blink, creating beautiful - and sometimes, jarring - scenery. Dancing sugarplums, blackened, charred remains of animals and otherworld creatures hit my mind like a bomb; and with the synergy of empathy for creatures, human or not? That can create recipes for disaster. Though I know they have never been real, I know the aftereffects, pain, and misery, of their existence coming to fruition.

Some doors are never meant to be open.

When I was younger, I slept in a room with a small, double-door closet. I had never once found anything in there that wasn’t supposed to be there - except perhaps, a few spiders of course - but everything that was supposed to be there, was there. And yet, I still fear it to this day.

Throughout the years, there have been many a time where my body twitches and distorts into inhumane forms - bones should be snapping, blood spewing, tendons beyond repair, and yet, they aren’t. 

However, with this newfound power, some things people may call “twitches”, “ticks”, or perhaps “repetitions” of words, movement, or pain, can feel truly paranormal.

Only, a few years ago, while I ticked, my body involuntarily closed my mouth, focused on one spot of the baby-blue wall, and hushed me. I tried to move, and yet, I couldn’t. Talking, looking around - nothing, as if I was in sleep paralysis. And yet, I knew, if I turned around, I would die. An ominous, almost destructive amalgamation of living creeped behind me. 

Now, common sense may tell me that no being, human or not of this earth, could ever instill this amount of fear into anyone - but I wouldn’t dare take that chance.       I could feel it - darkness, slowly creeping out into the room through the closet, forming a large body behind the black pleather chair where I sat, involuntarily hushed by my own body, as if it has a voice and consciousness of its own.

I could feel the beings’ claws, terrifyingly sharp, scar the paint and metal in the room, begging me with a terrifying, alien-like voice, its body, as if it hadn’t eaten in months, years even - and I, the plump, juicy offering.

If it were to truly come for me, I knew that nothing may stop its rampage of destruction, terror, and fright. Not even a single finger to hush someone, sitting as if turned to stone.

When I was younger, I had a wildly active imagination. As I read my first books, I imagined the long line of children, twisting and turning in the Great Hall as another sits for the Sorting Hat - a tanned leather hat, scarred and bruised, with a oversized belt sewn to if - yelling one of the Houses. While most of my imaginative nature was for beauty and wonderful storytelling, the nights went from peace and calm to horror turned reality.

As I finished up my bathroom break to head back to another round of redstone antics on a cherished Minecraft server with buddies that were in the same boat as I was - absolutely not supposed to be awake - I come to find my body, for the first time, not letting me open the door.

As I go to turn the handle and swing the door open, I realize an odd thing; I hadn’t actually done that. I stood, almost paralyzed, my body fighting back from opening the bathroom door, as if there was a giant mass behind it, ready to swallow me whole; a grim reaper, executioner no less, ready to bring my head to their master.

So I stood there, staring into the mirror, petrified. I had learned from a very young age due to the passing of my great grandmother that death comes for us all. Was this it, behind this door? Was death behind this door?

Suddenly, without explanation, my body clicked. As if it had told me I was safe, I swung open the door, and made a mad-dash to my room, not knowing the strange occurrences to come.

When my body involuntarily reacts, I know now not to intervene. It knows things I don’t. And sometimes - No, every time - it is for the sake of my survival.
