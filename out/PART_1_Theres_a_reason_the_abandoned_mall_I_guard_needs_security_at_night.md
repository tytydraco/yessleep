My name is George, and a few weeks ago, I was laid off from my job as an escalator technician.

Not a fabulous job, but it was consistent work, if not a little tricky due to the complex parts involved.

Unfortunately, I was forced to look for another job, and I happened to stumble across this one.

It was advertised simply as: Mall Security.

I'm not familiar with the area, and it's a little far from where I live, but the pay was something I couldn't turn down.

There was no interview, just an email from the hiring manager of the company informing me that, based on my past experience, I was the prime candidate and would be starting that weekend.

The shift was 10 PM to 6 AM, and my first day would be with another guard who I'd be replacing. He would show me the ropes, and then it would be up to me.

The guy I was replacing was a super chill guy. His name was Adam, and he'd been working there for a few years before deciding he wanted to get out of the night shift routine.

The center was pretty large, three stories, and definitely in a state of considerable disrepair.

Adam greeted me at the main center entrance. He's a bigger guy, reminds me of a bear: surly, big beard, and heavy set.

He unlocked the main entrance fire door, clicked on his flashlight, and took me inside, showing me where all the points of entry were before taking me to the control room.

The floor of the centre was littered with paper, bags, flyers and other detritus like dirt, leaves and sticks.

To call it a control room was laughable. It was a service closet-sized room with a small computer. He took a torch out of the drawer and handed it to me, it was heavy, large, and made of metal. Adam also asked what shirt size I was and handed me a polo shirt with the company name on it.

"There isn't any WiFi, so you'll have to hotspot," he told me, pulling the chair out to sit down.

Adam showed me all the things I would be required to do at night: write small logs on the computer showing that I was actually doing things, check all the areas thoroughly, and make sure nobody had snuck in. Apparently, it's quite common to find kids sneaking in and filming videos.

He did mention that since the company didn't want to pay for multiple training shifts, this would be the only training I would receive, and the rest would be purely hands-on learning.

I didn't foresee many issues with this, since the center was already in a bad way. It wasn't like more damage would really affect anything.

"So why is there even a guard here? Like, what are we guarding?" I asked Adam as we walked through the center. He had been showing me all the fire exits.

"Well, people love to sneak in, and if they get injured, it's not ideal," he said after taking a second to think.

I accepted this answer, although I still wasn't convinced.

"What about meal breaks?"

He let out a hearty laugh.

"The whole shift is a meal break, brother. No cameras."

I frowned. "So, hypothetically, you could just sit in the office for the whole shift?"

Adam stopped and turned to look at me, his face turning to a stern look.

"Absolutely not. This job is a huge responsibility, only bestowed upon those carefully selected by a team of behavioral scientists."

I chuckled nervously. "Right, of course."

"Why is there no guard during the day?" I continued after a small pause.

"Not needed." Adam turned back to facing forward and kept walking.

The rest of my first shift was quite simple. Adam showed me the entries and exits and the main places that people like to go to if and when they break in. He also showed me some of the many corridors that led to loading docks.

"I know it feels tempting, but don't ever go inside the stores." Adam stopped in front of a clothing store and ran his hand along the roller shutter. "Won't end well."

Naturally, I thought he was kidding, so I chuckled. He didn't.

Tough crowd.

When six hit, he led me back to the main entrance, unlocking the fire escape door and pushing it open.

The sun had started to rise and bathed the car park in an orange glow. It was actually kind of beautiful.

He shook my hand, placing a small key with an orange tag in my palm, and gripped my shoulder.

"Good luck. Don't be afraid to be stern with the kids who break in, they respond better to a strong, commanding voice. And..."

He paused and took a breath.

"We don't employ a maintenance worker. If you see a guy wearing a high-vis vest and he says he's from Maintenance, please calmly return to the control room and call this number."

He handed me a slip of paper with a phone number and a name. "Mark," I said, looking at the slip of paper.

With that, Adam turned and headed to his car, a beat-up hatchback that he was much too big for. He gave me a final wave before climbing in and taking off.

I looked back at the center. The morning light was creeping through the windows and illuminating the inside, somehow making it look serene despite looking like it had been hit by a cyclone.

I went home and tried to get some sleep, but it took me a few hours of tossing and turning. It would take me a while to get used to the new schedule.

That night, I put on the uniform and climbed in my car, mentally preparing myself for the night ahead. I was nervous, of course. It was a little bit daunting being there alone.

When I arrived, I parked right next to the entrance. For some reason, it eased my nerves, if only a little.

I unlocked the fire door with the little key Adam gave me and clicked on my flashlight, heading inside.

Being there alone was incredibly spooky. As soon as I walked in, I had a shiver run viciously down my spine.

I made my way down the stopped escalator (give me thirty minutes and some power and I'd have it up and running like it was brand new) and down another set of stairs before coming to the "control room."

I let myself in and took a seat at the computer, hovering my hand over the keys before trying to remember what Adam told me the password was.

I looked around the computer for some kind of clue before looking underneath the keyboard and finding the words "PW: Adam1986."

Sure enough, the computer unlocked with that password, and I began my first ever log.

"Shift Commenced, 22:00"

When I finished, I stood up but paused in front of the door.

How the hell was the computer getting power but the rest of the building wasn't?

I looked under the desk and saw that the computer was simply connected to a regular wall socket.

I made a mental note to explore the electrical maintenance rooms.

I headed out into the center and started making mental notes of where all the stores were in each area.

The center was laid out like a cross, the main entrance dead in the middle, branching into four long corridors.

The first couple of hours can only be described as lonely. The whole place felt isolated from the rest of the world. It was completely silent; every step echoed loudly.

I was about four hours into the shift, exploring one of the corridors, when I found a room with a metal sign plate on the door that read "Blank Room."

I was a bit perplexed at this, so I decided to try the key on the door.

It took some jiggling, but the door unlocked.

The hinges groaned softly as I pushed the door inward.

I guess I wasn't really sure what I was expecting, but after shining my flashlight around the empty room, I discovered it was a room completely painted a stark white. No writing, no furniture, just a small room with no lights.

I was tempted to walk in, but there was a small voice in the back of my head that was screaming for me not to, so I carefully closed the door and locked it again.

The thought of the bare room lingered in my mind. For some reason, it was actually rather unsettling.

I continued my patrols as normal, checking common spots that I thought people would hide in: bathrooms, even venturing out into the empty loading docks.

At the end of my shift, I did everything Adam told me to: ensured all the doors were locked, was up to date on my logs, and had done a thorough sweep of the entire center. I made my way back up the escalator and down to the main entrance when I stopped.

Something flashing caught my eye.

I turned to my left and saw inside one of the shops, through the hazy plastic roller doors, a camera mounted to the ceiling inside with a flashing red dot.

But how?

Slowly, I made my way up to the tenancy and attempted to get a better look inside. I considered trying to unlock the roller door, but I remembered the warning Adam had given me.

*"I know it feels tempting, but don't ever go inside the stores."*

I took a photo on my phone and figured it might have just been some trick of the light. Maybe the morning sun was peeking through a hole somewhere inside and...

"Ah, fuck it," I groaned, leaving the building and locking the door behind me.

I found it harder to fall asleep that day. I would lay in bed, but it felt like I wasn't tired at all, like I was completely awake even when my eyes were closed.

As usual, that night I got into my uniform, climbed into my car, and headed to work.

I yawned countless times before even getting to the main entrance, taking out the key and sliding it into the lock.

I opened the door and was immediately hit with an immense sense of unease.

I hesitated in the threshold between the outside world and the center before clicking the flashlight on and heading in.

As I walked down the escalator, I noticed movement in one of the shops. My blood ran cold.

I shined my flashlight inside the store and caught something bright exiting underneath the roller shutters.

It was a person wearing some kind of vest.

"Hey!" I called out, mustering what little confidence I could pull out in that moment.

"Y-You can't be in here!"

The person looked up at me. He was a tall guy: black pants, a grey polo, and a high-vis jacket.

He wiped his forehead with a greasy hand and squinted as I shined the flashlight in his face.

"Hey, pal, you must be the new guard." He waved jovially.

"I'm Chris. I'm the maintenance guy here!" Chris squinted in the light, still smiling.

I stopped dead in my tracks at the bottom of the escalator.

Shit.

Without a word, I turned and attempted to make my way to the security control room as quickly as I could.

"Alright, I'll see you around then!" I heard him call out from behind me.

I heard shuffling behind me. I looked over my shoulder, and saw him, still smiling, following me at a distance. 

I picked up the pace, almost a light jog.

I found my way to the room, unlocked it, and threw myself inside. I quickly locked the door.

Why was I so scared? I know Adam had warned me about him, but maybe he was just some weirdo who enjoyed poking around in abandoned shopping centers.

I fumbled around in my pocket and fished out the bit of paper Adam had given me, which was now folded and smudged.

I quickly dialed the number and waited.

After three rings, someone with a gruff voice picked up on the other end.

"You've reached Mark. How can I help you?"

I hesitated for a second, unsure what to say.

"Hello?" His voice rang out from the other end.

"Hi, uh—hello, uh, it's—My name is George. I work at the-”

"Maintenance again?" he grumbled.

"Well—uh, yeah," I responded.

"I'll be there shortly. Stay in the control room."

And with that, he hung up.

I pressed my ear against the door, trying to figure out if he had followed me all the way to the room, but I couldn’t hear anything coming from outside.

While I waited, I poked around in the desk drawers. The standard stuff was in there: documents, master licenses, more documents, some stationery.

And a small diary.

I was curious, so I flipped to a random page and had a look.

It was full of notes.

*"1:58 AM Dock 11 singing is back, reminder to push back patrol to 3 AM."*

I read some more.

*"2:46 AM Valleygirl lights on, taking an alternate route to the South wing."*

My throat went dry. What was this? Surely this must have been from when the center wasn't abandoned.

I took a breath and started flipping through the pages until I came across one with an odd sentence in the middle of the page, circled in red pen.

*"LOCK IN BLANK ROOM."*

What the fuck?

What is the blank room for? Is it some kind of fucking holding cell?

That's when I heard a loud crash from inside the center. It shook the room. I jumped and dropped the book. My heart was racing as I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket.

I pulled it out and looked at the screen. The screen showed Mark’s number.

I answered the phone, slowly raising it to my ears.

"All done. Enjoy the rest of your night."

Before I could ask what the hell happened, he hung up.

I paced around the room for a minute, trying to collect myself.

Nervously, I made my way back out into the center. I cautiously made my way through, stopping in front of the store that Chris, the maintenance guy, was standing outside of.

He wasn't there anymore, and the shutter was now closed. I tried to peer in, but it seemed empty.

Continuing through the center, I carefully checked all the service corridors and loading docks, pausing for a minute in Dock 11, trying to listen for any kind of singing. 

It was as quiet as it's always been.

I decided to head back and keep reading through the Diary I had found.

I entered the Control Room, placing my flashlight on the desk and picking the book up off the floor.

I flipped the pages all the way back to the start and began to read.

Page one was nothing interesting, just some doodles and sketches of random things: a flower, some swirls, and a drawing of a duck.

I flipped to the next page. There was what looked like a couple of phone numbers without any context and a small note at the bottom that just read: *"key 18."*

I had noticed that the key I was given had a tag reading "Key 20" written on it, so perhaps that had been a key that had gone missing or been replaced.

The next few pages were more drawings and scribbles. The quality of the drawings was actually improving a little bit. Whoever drew these must have been getting very bored.

It was only after the tenth page where it started to really get interesting.

Page 10 had the following entry:

*Yellow High-Vis guy, seen in Target, Sketchers, Dock 9, Service Corridor A and B.*

This caught my eye. I began reading a bit more intently. *"Seen on occasion with a work bag, tools and even a lunch bag."*

So this must be the same guy, I thought.

A little further down was a name and phone number.

*Mark's*

Continuing onto the next page did nothing to help my unease. *“Kids in South Wing, NOT REAL!”*

The words “NOT REAL” were underlined in red pen. I shifted nervously and felt the hairs on my neck stand up. 

I put the book back in the drawer and took a shaky breath.

I saw that my shift would be ending soon and breathed a sigh of relief. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to return the next day, what the fuck was going on here? 

Walking past the place where I saw Chris made me uneasy. The entire interaction was still playing over and over in my head.

As I was about to walk out the main entrance, I noticed that the flashing camera light was off, despite the pink morning light bathing the center.

Maybe it wasn't a trick of the light.

At home again, I was finding sleep more and more elusive, less tossing and turning and just more awake. I stopped trying after a while. I just did some chores, hung out, and watched TV.

I found that I didn't really feel the need to sleep at home. I felt wasted when I was working, like I would fall asleep at the desk at any moment, but at home I was wide awake. I made a note to visit the doctor on my day off. It probably wasn't healthy to not sleep.

As I started to leave, I noticed the sky looked darker than usual, and checking the weather app on my phone, I noticed that there was a storm warning coming in.

During the drive, the rain started to fall, heavier and heavier, until I could barely see where I was going. 

Slowly I found my way to the center and parked close to the entrance, jumping out and jogging through the heavy rain and under the awning.

Soaking wet, I unlocked the doors and clicked on the flashlight. I could hear the rumble of thunder overhead.

After my encounter with Chris, I was extra vigilant, peeking through the shops with the torchlight, carefully inspecting everywhere to make sure it was clear.

In the control room, I made my "shift commenced" log and headed back out into the center.

The thunder rumbled heavily through the center. I could hear the heavy rain rattling the ceiling, disturbing the otherwise soundless interior. I saw some water streams leaking through and had to watch the floor to make sure I didn't slip on some of the puddles forming.

I made my way to the southern wing of the centre, closing a service door that was slightly ajar on my way through. 

Just after finishing a patrol of Dock 9, I saw a beam of light flickering, off in the distance.

I carefully made my way forward, shining my own flashlight to get a glimpse of where it was coming from.

That's when I heard laughter, like a group of kids. 

Begrudgingly, I picked up the pace, and rounding the corner, I saw the culprits: a group of kids, three of them. Two boys and a girl. One of the boys was trying to open one of the shop's roller shutters.

"Hey!" I called out, making myself sound as intimidating as possible.

They all jumped and turned to look at me.

One of the boys had short, jet black hair, pale skin, piercing green eyes and freckles, wearing a black hoodie. The other boy had longer, dirty blonde hair, grey eyes and a white hoodie.

The girl, shorter than the two boys, with shoulder length brown hair, pale, with brown eyes, wearing a green jacket. 

"Get out of here! You're not allowed here!" I yelled out, making my way over to them.

They all looked at each other before turning and running down a nearby service corridor.

Shit.

I took off, following them and reaching the service corridor’s doors.

I pushed through them and heard them slam behind me.

I had no idea where they were going or even where these corridors led to.

I had caught up to them when they rounded the corner.

But when I rounded the corner, they were gone. The noise of their shoes was replaced by the continuous heavy rain thundering outside.

"What the fuck?" I half-whispered to myself, taking a second to catch my breath.

I turned around and shone the flashlight.

No connecting doors or ways out, just a straight corridor. So how the hell did they just disappear?

I continued down the hallway, jogging, trying to see where they ended up.

At the very end of the hallway, there was an emergency exit sign above the door. I pushed my way out and into the rain.

The door slammed behind me, and I spun around, trying the handle, but there wasn't one. It was a one-way emergency exit door.

Shit.

I held my arm up, shielding my eyes from the harsh rain, and walked back to the main entrance, getting soaked in water all over again.

There is no way they were fast enough to close the distance to the door that quickly. Where the hell did they go?

I unlocked the main entrance and headed back in for the second time that night.

Grumbling, I headed back to the security office to log the event.

As I headed down the escalator, I heard laughing and multiple loud voices from one of the stores ahead.

Right, that was it.

I marched up to the store and banged on the roller shutters.

"Hey! Get the hell out of there! You're not suppo—"

An ear-piercing scream rang out from behind me. I spun around and shone my flashlight around.

I saw a figure standing on the balustrade on the floor above. She was one of the teenagers from the group.

I shone my light up at her and called out.

"Hey! Get down off there! You could—"

She threw herself backwards.

I stood there, frozen in horror.

She sailed down three floors before hitting the floor at the bottom with a sickening wet thump that echoed through the center.

I ran to the railing and shone my light over.

Nothing.

The floor below was completely clear.

What. The. Fuck.

My heart was hammering in my chest.

I sprinted down the escalator and onto the bottom floor. Where the fuck did she land?

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I shone my flashlight around the lower levels.

I had never really explored this lower level much since it was technically the basement level.

There weren't many stores on this level, mostly just service corridors and switch rooms.

Right at the end was a single door access corridor, the door slightly ajar, slowly inching closed, as if someone had just gone through there. 

I cautiously entered, unsure of what the hell I had just witnessed, and chalked it up to the fact I hadn't really slept.

It was a tight corridor, and I shone the flashlight down it, slowly making my way through.

I thought I had explored the whole center, but I don't ever remember this one existing.

There was a door halfway down the hallway with a metal sign on it, but it was blank. Just as I was about to continue down the hallway, I heard something from inside.

A soft crying coming from the other side of the door. Really pained, moaning sobs, full of emotion.

The hair on my neck stood up as I contemplated just ignoring it and pretending it wasn't real, but I figured it was my job to investigate.

I tried the handle, but it was locked.

Still reeling from the girl jumping off the top floor, I pushed the key into the door and tried the lock.

No dice.

What the hell? How did someone get in there if it was locked?

I took a deep breath and knocked on the door, the noise echoing loudly down the corridor.

The second my hand hit the door, the crying stopped.

"Fucking hell," I groaned, unsure of what the fuck was happening, when I heard a voice coming from my left.

"Need a hand? I think I have a key that should work, pal."

I spun around and lifted my flashlight right into Chris's eyes.

I froze, words caught in my throat.

He raised his arm to cover his eyes, blinking.

"Hey, can you stop doing that? You're going to send me blind one of these days." He chuckled.

Without a word, I backed down the hallway, refusing to take my eyes off him.

Chris frowned and raised an eyebrow. "Are you okay, champ?"

He chuckled and started walking towards me.

Fuck. That.

I spun around and sprinted back down the corridor, exploding out the door and through the lower floor of the center, up the escalator, down the toilet corridor, and threw myself into the control room, slamming the door behind me and locking it.

I went back through my call history on my phone and was about to hit Mark's number when I heard a loud knock at the door.

"Hey, buddy, you dropped something when you were running. I figured you might need it," Chris announced eagerly from the other side of the door.

I hit the call button and waited. Just like before, after two rings, Mark answered.

"Hello, you've rea—"

"He's back!" I gasped as quietly as I could into the phone.

Chris knocked on the door again, sounding slightly more impatient.

Mark audibly sighed loudly over the phone and grumbled to himself before answering.

"I'll be there soon. Don't let him in." His voice trailed off, and he hung up the phone.

Another, faster knock.

"Hey, buddy, you're not calling that guy again, are you?" Chris called out, his voice wavering nervously.

I backed up against the wall, breath shallow and quick.

There was some shuffling on the other side of the door, and then I could hear a key rattling.

Oh shit. Did he have a fucking key this whole time?

I threw myself against the door and held the handle.

I heard the key enter the lock and twist, but then stop.

Chris's voice rang out from right on the other side of the door. "Don't you want to see what you dropped?"

My blood ran cold, and I gripped the door handle tighter.

The handle began to move, and I struggled to hold it up. Chris must have been strong because even with my full strength holding the door handle up, it made its way down, and I felt the door push inwards.

I put one foot against the wall and pushed my entire weight against the door, straining to keep it closed.

I looked over my shoulder and saw fingers.

Then a hand gripped the door from the outside.

I bit back the urge to yell. I focused all my effort on keeping the door closed when I heard something from the other end of the hallway.

A voice called out, and the pressure on the door dropped away. The hand slid out, and I slammed it shut.

I kept my weight against the door, unsure of what was happening. Then, some yelling angry yelling, I couldn’t make out what was being said, but it sounded like someone was yelling at Chris, loud and aggressive.

My heart hammered in my ears, and I took a few heavy breaths before a familiar noise pulled me out of my panic.

My phone was ringing.

I pulled it out of my pocket. Mark.

I answered it quickly.

"H-Hello? Is he gone? Was that you?"

Mark's voice crackled through the other end of the phone.

"I'm going to be a touch late. This damn weather is hard to navigate."

That's when I heard a noise from the ceiling, one of the panels was being lifted, and slid out of the way.

**End of Part 1**
