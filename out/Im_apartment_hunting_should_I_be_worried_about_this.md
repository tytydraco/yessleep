Hey everyone,

I've been apartment hunting for a while now, and I stumbled upon a listing for Apartment 3B in the Redwood Heights complex. It looks perfect for what I need, and the housing market is crazy right now so I’m desperate… but during my research I found an old building forum and some of the posts are giving me second thoughts. I’ve compiled the posts that concerned me.

Can anyone shed some light on this? Should I be concerned? Or are these just typical apartment management issues blown out of proportion? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

**Title: Strange Noises from Below**  
**Username: RedwoodResident22**   
Hey neighbors, I've been hearing some bizarre noises coming from below my apartment lately. It's like scratching or scraping sounds, but it's irregular, not like the typical noises you'd expect from pipes or rodents. It usually happens late at night, and it's been keeping me up. Is anyone else experiencing something similar?

 I've been living in the building for a while, and I've heard those noises too so I talked to the building management about it, but they couldn't find anything out of the ordinary

I posted a while back about the strange noises from below my apartment. Just wanted to provide an update. The noises have been getting louder and more frequent. I even went down to the basement to see if I could find anything. I'm starting to get really worried that there are rats or something. Has anyone else had any developments with this issue? I don’t wanna pay out of pocket for something that should be building management’s issue…

Hey RedwoodResident22, I've been experiencing the same thing in my apartment too. Imo it’s definitely not rats or typical building noises but I’ve tried talking to management and they just brushed it off as old building sounds.

I've been hearing those noises too, and they're getting on my nerves. It's not just you. I wonder if there's some kind of maintenance issue they're not telling us about. Maybe they're trying to cover something up? I agree tho, we shouldn't have to pay for whatever the issue is.

I agree, sounds to me like they neglected some kind of problem and now they're trying to downplay it… Maybe we should band together and demand a more thorough investigation from management. This isn't something we should ignore if it's affecting multiple units.

Given all the discourse about the strange noises and concerns regarding building management's response, I think it's time we organize a building-wide meeting to address these issues collectively. We need to ensure that our voices are heard and that appropriate action is taken to resolve the situation. Please meet in the lounge on the first floor at 6pm, January 1.

**Title: Smell from pipes on fourth floor?**   
**Username: todayjunior**   
It was great to see everyone at the building meeting. I’m looking forward to management receiving the letter we drafted. Im just wondering if anyone else on the fourth floor is getting any smell coming up through their pipes?

I’m a retired plumber and the smell could definitely be a sign of sewage backup. Call management immediately and insist they send someone to check it out… If they don’t send anyone, reply to my message so I can check it out for you.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We will dispatch a maintenance team to investigate the reported sewage odor on the 4th and 6th floors immediately. Your safety and well-being are our top priorities, and we appreciate your cooperation.

**Title: barrels…?**   
**Username: CuriousNeighbor99**   
Was putting away my Christmas decorations (late I know) but near the storage lockers, there are several large metal barrels emitting a rancid smell. Whoever is responsible for these barrels, could you please consider relocating them? It's not exactly pleasant to stumble upon during our day-to-day activities in the basement.

I've noticed those barrels too, and I have to agree with you. It's not exactly a pleasant sight or smell.

Hi CuriousNeighbor99, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate your concern; please be aware that those barrels are part of our regular garbage disposal system. We will address it promptly to ensure the comfort of all residents.

**Title: Wet Concrete in the Basement**  
**Username: BuildingManagement1**   
Dear Residents, We'd like to inform you that our maintenance team recently conducted some routine repairs in the basement. As part of these repairs, we poured fresh concrete in certain areas of the floor to address structural concerns. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and we assure you that the work was necessary to maintain the integrity of the building.

Thanks for the update, but I'm a bit confused. I was in the basement just a few days ago, and I didn't notice any issues with the flooring that would require concrete repairs. Could you provide more details on what exactly was damaged? I don’t want our building fees being used for frivolous repairs…

*Reply 2*   
*Username: stardust2000*   
It's pretty concerning that there wasn't any prior notice or indication of structural issues in the basement. Was it even safe for us to be going down there???

*Reply 3*   
*Username: ApartmentRenovator78*  
The repairs are on the floor so I don’t see how it would be dangerous to us… unless you expect to fall into a bottomless pit because of a crack in the concrete, smh

*Reply 4*   
*Username: TheTenant101*  
Whatever the repair was, it wasn’t just a crack. The amount of wet concrete down there is... well, let's just say it's more than a few minor patches. I'm with fishero59 on this one; it seems a bit excessive without any prior notice or explanation.

Everything will be alright :)
