Prudence was five minutes late to her doctor’s appointment. It was Saturday morning, and she hadn’t wanted to go to the doctor anyway – and she didn’t want to leave her house. She wasn’t a fan of doctors, and didn’t like appointments. But, her prescription for her thyroid medication would not be filled, the nurse had told her, unless she came in for a yearly physical (it had been two years, but they were not going to be lenient any longer). Prudence knew she needed it; her brain fog was coming back, and she was getting forgetful. She felt sluggish, and her clothes weren’t really fitting. Thyroid, menopause – whatever it was. It sucked. But, so is life, she thought, as she walked to her car. Her moment of reflection was jarred by the incessant barking of the neighbor’s dog, Kip. Kip liked to yip, they said home. Kip barked constantly, and was always outside. She knew her neighbors were at home, but she imagined they had soundproof glass – so Kip stayed outside for the world to hear, while they got respite in their home.

Also, Prudence had been up late last night at “book club.” Air quotes intentional – they did talk about books, for about 15 minutes. Usually, right before they dispersed for the night. Most of the evening was spent lamenting the day to day of a bunch of middle aged ladies. While there were always laughs, and always some good gossip, these evenings didn’t make Prudence as recharged as they used to. Instead, she began to fret about what they would do to her sleep cycle, and how she’d tackle her ever growing to-do list the next morning. 

Prudence made her way to the clinic, and checked in with Tera, the receptionist. She noticed Tera looked different – thinner maybe? Tan? She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but she quickly made her way to an exam room – the benefits of being a bit late. The nurse began her usual line of questioning, took her blood pressure, and then checked her current prescriptions. 

“This will just be a prick,” she said, looking up, smiling, as she took a quick blood sample from Prudence’s finger. 

Next was the doctor. Dr. Lucky was the best doctor in town, of which there were many. He was a good listener, patient, and just a good guy. 

When Prudence’s middle son, Tony, was struggling two years ago with anxiety, he developed a nervous tic; it became a verbal one, and Prudence would watch in horror as he appeared to talk in tongues at times. His actions became reckless, and he’d try to touch the hot stove or run into the street. Prudence brought him to Dr. Lucky in tears, and he calmly reassured both of them. He offered a variety of treatments – therapy, medicine, wait and see. In the end, Tony, began taking some medication and within three days, all the issues were gone. It was like a miracle.

One of her friend’s son’s had been diagnosed with an advanced case of MS. It was a shock, and it was tragic really. Dr. Lucky researched a salve he could use, and after using it for a few months, Shane made a really drastic recovery. No one could explain it, but no one cared. He was saved. 

“I hope you’re not going to ask for ozempic,” he said as he listened to her breathing. 

“Of course not,” Prudence laughed.

“Or an antidepressant. Asking for adderall? That’s the new one. That or hormone therapy. Hormone therapy isn’t really even a thing – that and vitamin cycling”

“Nope – I am perfectly content with being slightly overweight and slightly depressed. I think that is what is normal.”

“You’re just too reasonable, Prudence. I should’ve known better,” he said smiling. 

They talked about her children, his children, busy schedules, too. Everyone was doing fine. Everything was fine. Work was work, and home was busy. The middle age mantra.

“You’re all set. I’ll see you back in a year – for real this time. Don’t make my nurse keep hounding you, okay?”

“I know, I know. I just get busy, and I just don’t really feel like coming each year. I have an apple a day, I am fine with aches and pains. There are so many things – with work, with the kids. Around the house. Things suck – but that’s life. It’s not a highlight reel, you know? But, I will try. I will make the appointment before I leave so I can held to it. I don’t cancel things that are on my calendar.”

“If you do really want to avoid things like this, I do have another option. It is something new. My pharm rep just brought it last week. She says it is completely harmless, has remarkable results, and should be completely approved and vetted within the next 6 months,” he said, not looking away from his computer as he completed Prudence’s chart.

Prudence paused. Where was this coming from, she thought. They had just been discussing the normal aspect of growing older and growing less enthusiastic. Embracing the suck. She had been declared reasonable, for Christsake. 

“No thank you,” she said. “I’m good. Well, fine. You know.”

“Well, if you change your mind, call the nurse. Since I just saw you, it would be easy to set it up. Only thing is, since it’s not totally approved, you wouldn’t pick it up at the pharmacy. I have it here. So, you know, you’d have to come in, but I’d just leave at the desk with Tera,” he said, finally looking at her and smiling. 

“Just stay reasonable. No one likes someone who doesn’t do as they’re told,” he said, as he walked out.

What an odd statement, Prudence thought. He had never spoken to her that way. Maybe she hadn’t noticed it before, but Prudence thought Dr. Lucky’s eyes seemed different, as he said this. She had never paid attention to his eyes before, so maybe they were always that unusual shade of gray, almost silver. Maybe it was the lights. Prudence shook the thought from her mind.

They exchanged their goodbyes, and Prudence left the room, setting her appointment for the next year as she passed by the receptionist’s desk. 

“So, are you going to take it?” Tera asked as she handed her the prescription card. 

“Take what?”

“Oh, didn’t he mention it? The new meds we got. I started this week, and let me  tell you. Everything doesn’t suck anymore! Isn’t that amazing? Like, I feel better, lost ten pounds. I don’t yell at my husband, I don’t mind making lunches or doing laundry. Everything is just easy. And, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel good.” Tera looked up expectantly. 

“Yeah, medicine isn’t really my thing. And, you know I don’t like doctor visits. I’m good.”



\*\*\*

Prudence quickly walked out to her car. She ran a few errands. There were groceries to pick up, a quick trip to the post office. She got a text indicating her prescription was ready, so she headed to the pharmacy. As she waited in line, she thought about the conversations she had had. It was just so strange.  

When it was her turn, the pharmacist let her know her prescription was out of stock.

“This has been happening a lot, unfortunately. Good news though; we checked with Dr. Lucky, and he has a substitute you can use until we get more inventory. It’s the exact same as the thyroid medicine you were taking before, but it just looks a bit different and has a different name. He did say take two today – right away, though, because you haven’t been taking it for a while. We put you on autofill, too. I know things get crazy,” she smiled. 

“Well, thank you for taking care of all that. And, will do,” Prudence replied, sticking the bottle in her purse. 

“Hey, they did that to me, too,” an older man standing behind her said. “And, I love it. Best change. My arthritis is gone!” he said smiling.

“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Prudence said. “But, I don’t have arthritis.”

“Don’t matter. It just makes everything better.”

She got to her car, and took two of the small, gray pills, as she had been instructed. Though she had never taken two pills before, aside when she probably overdosed herself if she forgot she took it, she did as she was told. She trusted Dr. Lucky, even if he and Tera were a bit off today. Plus, she had to do something about this crabbiness and shortness she was feeling. Prudence didn’t like feeling this way, but she knew it was normal. Washing it down with some water, she made two more quick stops, and headed home, mentally planning out the rest of the day, which included chores, practice, food prep, and catching up on some work. 

As Prudence pulled into her driveway, she noticed something strange: Kip, usually a blur of energy, sat perfectly still in their yard, staring at her car. Its eyes seemed off—dull and glassy, like it wasn’t entirely there. Shrugging it off, she hurried into the house, the sense of unease lifting as she busied herself with unpacking groceries, starting laundry, and getting lunch fixed for the boys..

Her phone buzzed. It was a text from an unknown number:**“Change your mind yet?”**

Prudence frowned and blocked the number. It had to be some kind of sales spam.

Another text. This one from the book club girls:

**“My head is killing me. Haven’t left bed. Who’s going to do all my laundry today?”**

Not me, thought Prudence. Embrace the suck, she typed back, and got a few “haha’s” – they were all in the same boat.

\*\*\*

That night, as she lay in bed, she dreamed of Dr. Lucky. In the dream, he wasn’t in his office but standing at the foot of her bed, smiling kindly. "Everything could be easier," he whispered, his voice calm but insistent. "You wouldn’t even notice the change. No more aches, no more pains. Just... *better*."

She woke with a start, heart pounding. The room was silent except for the faint sound of her phone buzzing. Bleary-eyed, she picked it up. Another text from a different number:**“It’s not too late.”**

Prudence deleted the message and tossed the phone onto her nightstand. This was getting weird. She decided to call the clinic in the morning and find out more about whatever was happening.

But by morning, something else had changed.

The neighbor’s dog’s incessant morning barking was gone. In fact, as she looked out her window, she saw Kip sitting directly next to their fence, staring intently at her. Silently. Maybe they got one of those shock collars or bark collars. A holiday miracle, she thought, as she walked into the kitchen. Her usual morning sluggishness was also gone. Prudence noticed it as soon as she stepped out of bed—her body felt lighter, her head clearer. It was unsettling. She didn’t feel like herself, though she couldn’t put her finger on why. And, it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Maybe it was that dose she took yesterday; maybe this new medication was just better. She took her gray pill, washing it down with some coffee.

Her phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with another unknown number:**“You’re welcome.”**

That’s when Prudence remembered Tera’s words. *“Everything doesn’t suck anymore.”*

She stopped in her place. A chill ran over her body. Had they done something to her? Was it a trick, or worse—an experiment? She tried to call the clinic, but the line was busy. She called again. No answer.

Hours passed, and Prudence couldn’t shake the feeling of calm, even though she was never calm on a Sunday. Sunday Scaries were real for her – she’d had them ever since she was a little girl. The strange lightness in her body turned into an eerie detachment, like she was floating through the day. Her kids noticed her distraction and were louder and more rambunctious than normal, but she let it pass. Her husband mentioned her blank stare. Prudence brushed them off. She was just relaxed, she told them. But, she couldn’t put her finger on it. She wasn’t panicked by all this. She was actually being way more productive than she normally was. The entire thing was just strange. 

When she finally drove back to the clinic to talk to Dr. Lucky on Monday morning, the building was dark, the doors locked. A sign on the door read:

**“Closed for reorganization. Thank you for your patience.”**

Her phone buzzed one last time:**“Don’t fight it, Prudence. It’s easier this way.”**

Prudence’s breath caught in her throat as she stared at the sign on the clinic door.

Her phone buzzed again in her hand. She didn’t want to look but couldn’t resist.

**“Make an Appointment. We’ll explain everything. xxx-xxx-xxxx.”**

She backed away from the clinic, clutching her phone tightly, the screen still glowing with the message. Her mind raced. How could they know she was here? Was she being watched? And, why her? She was just a regular person – a reasonable one, she reminded herself. Her body still felt lighter, more energized than usual, but that sensation left her feeling as though her own limbs were not entirely under her control. “As if driven by a motor,” she thought to herself. 

This evening, she couldn’t sleep. Her husband had no trouble, and while she was usually annoyed by his snoring and snorting, she found comfort in knowing she wasn’t alone. The sound of the wind outside resembled whispers. When she finally drifted off, the dreams returned—this time more vivid. Dr. Lucky was there again, his warm, confident smile now an unsettling mask. He stood next to her bed, holding a small vial of shimmering liquid.

“Why fight it, Prudence?” he said. His voice echoed in the dream, soft yet commanding. “You don’t have to struggle anymore. No one does. Be reasonable.”

She woke in a cold sweat, her throat dry, her heart hammering against her ribs. Stumbling to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake the lingering unease. When she looked up into the mirror, she froze.

Her reflection stared back at her, but something was wrong. Her eyes, usually warm and brown, were now faintly tinted with silver, the irises shimmering in the dim light. Her hands trembled as she reached up to touch her face, as if to confirm she was still herself.

\*\*\*

The next day, Prudence called the number she was instructed to on her phone. Tera answered, cheerful as usual. 

“Hey, girl! Did you change your mind?” Tera asked.

“No, not at all. Look, I need to make an appointment. And, I saw you guys moved. Why didn’t anyone mention that when I was there?”

“Oh, yes. I must have forgot. It’s been busy, you know. And, we’re busy. We’re about two weeks out. Everyone is trying to get this new medication. We’re actually having to work from an old office while we fix things up at the clinic. But, it’s right downtown. xxx Main. Will that work?”

Prudence paused. She wanted to talk to Dr. Lucky now. But, she wasn’t sick. And, maybe this eye things was just an old age thing. She’d look that up when she got home. 

“No, two weeks works. See you then.”

“Sounds good. I have you down. And remember, if you do change your mind, you don’t need an appointment. You can just call me, and I’ll open up for you.”

“No. Thank you.” Prudence ended the call. 

\*\*\*

**“How are we going to make it? Bonus book club? My house? Bring wine?”**

The next two weeks went quickly, and were filled with texts like this from Prudence’s group. Luckily, there were no more texts from the unknown numbers. Prudence had blocked each and everyone of them – someone got her number and was having some fun, she thought – the only reasonable explanation.  It was the last two weeks of school before winter break. Prudence’s days were full of work, then activities. Concerts for the boys, sports practices. Potluck prep for her husband. Not to mention gift buying, and wrapping. Along with holiday cards. These weeks were always the worst. There was so much to do, and one couldn’t even enjoy it.

But, this year was different. It was busy. It was so busy. But, Prudence just sailed through. People at work complimented on how fresh she looked. Her clothes were fitting better, but she associated this with just running all over the place and actually taking her meds. The staff at her school raved about the ham and beans she brought, and everyone even got seconds during their own luncheon. Her children didn’t complain about going non stop. Her husband complimented her and showed his appreciation through words and his actions. He even began doing laundry and making dinner a few nights during the week.

The only thing that was off – other than “things not sucking” as Tera had said, was the dreams. Prudence began to dream of Dr. Lucky every night. They didn’t feel like dreams. It felt like he was right there beside her bed. He wasn’t, obviously, because it would wake up her husband. But, it felt like he came to her each night, asking her questions, as he did in the office. Requesting she give this new medication a try. By the end of the two weeks, these talks had taken a turn. Dr. Lucky became angry, foreceful. One time, he had shaken her. 

“You’re just not being reasonable. Prudence, you need this. Your family needs you to take this. Look how much better this break was. Just take it.”

In another, he smiled and put his hands around her throat. 

“If you won’t be cooperative, then I am going to have to call someone else in. Just be reasonable, or else I won’t be able to help you.”

She awoke each time before she succumbed to the doctor, catching her breath. She reached over to her husband, who snorted and rolled over. They were always just a dream. 

One would think these nights of restless sleep would start to wear on a person. But, Prudence kept on keeping on, as she had started to say. They weren’t pleasant, but they weren’t hurting anyone. And, they weren’t holding her back. They were dreams. Dreams come and go. There is always a reasonable explanation for strange dreams. Just like her eyes, which continued to shimmer with a silver glow. She could explain this away, as well. It was the reflection from the new lights in the sconce her husband had installed. Same in her car – the silver was probably from the snow that blanketed the ground as the endured the first cold snap of the season. Everything was able to be explained. 

\*\*\*

Her appointment had finally arrived. As she approached the building, the sky looked – different. It was almost as if the sun and sky were washed out. Flat, almost. That happens sometimes when the sun is low, she thought. As she crossed the parking lot, she stopped. The building, this new one, seemed to be glowing or shimmering – metallic almost – though made of the same old brick as many other buildings in town. This stark contrast to the watercolor sky and surroundings was unsettling. It’s the position of the sun, she told herself. This time, the building was unlocked, though the waiting room was empty, its lights flickering faintly. A low hum filled the air, like machinery working behind the walls.

“Dr. Lucky?” she called out, her voice trembling.

A figure emerged from one of the exam rooms. It wasn’t Dr. Lucky. It was Tera, the receptionist, but her appearance was different. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes shone with the same silvery hue Prudence had noticed in herself.

“We’ve been expecting you,” Tera said, smiling too wide, her teeth unnervingly perfect. “You’re going to feel so much better, Prudence. You probably already do. We thought you needed a little push. You’re just so reasonable. But, you’ve only gotten the tiny dose. Today, you get it all. Then, you’re going to feel so much better. Just like the rest of us.”

Behind Tera, shadows moved, taking the shape of figures—patients, nurses, all with the same silvery eyes and too-perfect smiles. 

She saw the man from the pharmacy, smiling as he received an infusion of a silvery liquid, which shimmered and glowed in its bag, and appeared to illuminate through the man’s veins in his thin, thin arms. There was her neighbor, Suzanne, who was waiting, smiling, on an exam table, as a nurse Prudence had never seen prepped a syringe of the same silver liquid, and smiling, shut the door in Prudence’s face. It appeared each of the 10 exam rooms were full, and in each, someone Prudence knew was ready to be seen. 

Tera came closer, trying to take Prudence by the arm. Prudence started to back up, but was stopped by a tall man dressed in scrubs, who towered over her smiling. She turned to run to the exit, which was only feet away, her pulse roaring in her ears. She realized too late that the clinic door had closed behind her with a soft, deliberate click.

\*\*\*

When Prudence got home from Dr. Lucky’s, she began dinner and a load of laundry. There were moments when she felt as if she were just going through the motions, like there was some silent scream ready to leave her lips. But, she helped her kids with their homework, rubbed her husband’s feet, and read two chapters in her book club book. The laundry was done and loaded, and the boys and her husband complimented her on the dinner. There were no fights over the video games, and no eye rolls when she said it was time for bed. The feeling she had, the terror and the dread, were wrapped, tucked deep, as if enveloped in a heavy, wool blanket. 

As she lay in bed, she grabbed her phone, and texted her book club group chat.

**“Hey there, girlies! It’s been a while. Just checking in. I’ve been reflecting a lot lately—about how hectic life gets, especially now. But something's... shifted for me. It’s like this quiet clarity settled in. Everything feels lighter, easier, like a fog lifting. It’s strange to explain, but I feel** ***aligned*****, you know? Things just... fit now. No struggle, no noise. I can finally breathe without feeling the weight of it all. There’s this place—Dr. Lucky’s new space. It’s serene, almost surreal. No waiting, no fuss. Feels like stepping into something** ***right*****. Be reasonable. Treat yourself. You deserve it.”**
