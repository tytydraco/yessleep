[Part 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jdpa01/my_friend_and_i_do_building_renovations_and_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I didn’t need to be told twice. We bolted, leaving behind the grotesque tableau of Lyle and Mark, our feet pounding a frantic rhythm against the floor.

But we hadn’t gone far before we heard them again. Two voices now, not words but an awful chorus of sound, pursuing us with renewed vigor.

"They're faster!" I gasped, disbelief and terror fueling my flight.

Jake kept a step ahead, urgency pulling him forward. "Keep moving," he said, more command than encouragement. Our path took us through the winding guts of the building, we could barely believe the sub basement was so large.

"You think we're next? Lyle probably did not need another excuse to kill us even before this." Jake said, grimacing at how hollow the attempt at humor sounded.

"No I think they just want to talk to us about their favorite era of dolls... of course we are!" I said, the words cutting through my gasps for air.

The lights above us flickered and dimmed as we passed, giving the unsettling impression that the building was drawing power from us, feeding on our terror.

"This isn’t happening," I said. "This is insane!"

But every echo of their relentless pursuit told me otherwise.

Then, a miracle. We found a derelict elevator shaft that loomed up ahead, a steel cage of promise and escape. We had no idea where it might take us, this was probably not even the main elevator, but it was our only way up that was not back towards the things we left behind.

"This way," Jake said, veering toward it. I followed, the light and sound swelling behind us. Mark and Lyle, closing in.

The wall gave way to a narrow hall, the elevator just visible at the end. We threw ourselves at it, hands and feet colliding in chaos and hope. The doors parted, and we fell inside, collapsing against the metal as the old cables creaked and groaned under our weight. The doors slid shut, separating us from the terrible light. We lay on the floor, gasping for air as the elevator rattled upward.

I could feel every shake and shudder as it climbed, each one threatening to send us plummeting back into the nightmare below.

"What if it stops?" I said, the panic barely contained.

"Then we find another way," Jake said, breathless but determined. "Same as always."

Floor by floor, we rose.

The first was a mess of tarps and scaffolding, the signs of our work, half-finished and forsaken.

The second was stripped to the studs, bare walls and exposed wires, everything a dull gray that blurred as we sped past.

The third was crumbling, layers of decay peeling back to reveal the years and ghosts beneath.

The elevator shook, rattled, but didn't stop.

And then, finally, we found an exit, likely on the 4th floor.

We piled out into a room that did not seem to have any windows or doors. It seemed like a dead end, but at least those things couldn’t follow us.

We had a general idea based on where we thought we were and we started looking at a section of wall that might be weak enough to make an opening. We did not have much time to consider the situation before we heard the terrible shrieking below us in the elevator shaft and knew we would not be safe there after all.

We both started kicking and battering the same section that should have exited into the 4th floor hallway. We heard something clawing at the doors to the elevator and knew we had to hurry. With a crash we managed to breach the thin layer of wall that had concealed this room and we spilled out into the hall, just as the elevator doors were wrenched open and we saw what was left of Lyle reaching for us through the bending metal of the elevator doors. As we started to run we had to stop and run down a separate hall when to our horror we encountered another “Broken head” This one looked like it had been Nina. Her face was split open and her jerky motions almost caused her to tip over as she stumbled after us, but she quickly began pursing us with the same malevolent speed the others had.

My lungs already felt like they were tearing, but I couldn't stop. I couldn't even slow down. Jake and I barreled through the building's hallways, tripping over tools and abandoned pieces of equipment. We skidded around a corner, and I risked a look back. They were still there. The broken-headed things that used to be our coworkers. Their limbs moved in fits and starts, twitching like something being electrocuted. We turned another corner and the lights buzzed and flickered above us. In those blinks of light, I could see more of them, coming out of rooms, shambling toward us. Their heads were horrible to look upon. Cracks split their faces, and beneath those cracks, something dark leaked through, like whatever was inside them was trying to claw its way out.

I stumbled, almost falling, but Jake grabbed my arm and yanked me forward. We didn't say anything. Didn't need to. My mind was a blur, thoughts crashing into each other like a wreck on the freeway. My heart pounded so loud I could feel it in my throat, and I forced myself to keep running.

They kept coming. The building was alive with them, as if it had spawned these things from the rotted wood and broken plaster. I could see more of them now, crowding the hallway, all of our old crew with their heads shattered and grins split by ragged lines. It made me dizzy, trying to count them, trying to understand how so many could change so fast. Just minutes ago, we'd all been working, joking about the weirdness in the basement. Now, they were things, hollowed out and filled with whatever the hell this was.

Their footsteps echoed, a chorus of uneven beats that surrounded us from all sides. I imagined their stares on my back, those awful eyes in their crumbling heads following every move. Every breath burned, and it felt like the air was thickening, like we were running through wet concrete.

We crashed into the next corridor, and we saw the main door. We raced towards it, but a wall of grinning broken heads covered the exit.

I tried to focus. Had to. We could find a way out. There had to be a way out. But the more we ran, the less sense the building made. Whatever hellish entity had been unleashed had transformed it all somehow. It felt like a nightmare, the kind where everything familiar turns just strange enough to scare the hell out of you. Where were the stairs? How could they be this far?

We ducked into another hallway, this one narrower, and I almost slammed into Jake's back when he stopped. There they were again. More of them. A wall of bodies and twisted limbs, all moving with that horrible stop-motion jerk, like they were learning how to walk again. I didn't want to look at their faces, didn't want to see what I thought I recognized beneath the cracks and madness.

We kept hearing the stuttering and horrible voices, mumbling, then saying, then shouting,

“You are it now…play with us.”

No way out. No way past. I could feel myself starting to slip, like ice was spreading in my head. They were everywhere. They were going to catch us. "This way!" Jake's voice cut through the noise, pulling me back, and he was moving again, taking a sharp turn toward the west wing. I followed, legs shaking but still working. If we couldn't get past them, maybe we could go under. I understood what Jake was thinking before he'd even finished the thought.

We had to get back to the basement. The natural gas line. The propane tanks he had stored there for temporary use. It was the only plan we had left. We raced toward it, through a warren of rooms that grew tighter and darker, and I knew this was our last shot. This whole place had to go, whatever hell we unleashed here, it had to burn.

It felt like the whole building was shaking, the walls and floors vibrating with some angry, diseased energy. We slammed the basement door and locked it, but the sound of them outside, the broken heads, only seemed to grow louder. I heard taps and scrapes, the horrible music of their movements, and my own heart pounding out of my chest. The stairs were slick with something wet, and I stumbled down them, nearly pitching headfirst into the dark. Jake caught me, his grip like iron, and together we half-ran, half-fell to the bottom.

The basement was worse than I remembered. Shadows crept and crawled, and every step echoed like a gunshot. The place was a mess of debris and old equipment, stacked high in a labyrinth of clutter. We had to navigate through it, tripping over cables and rusted pipes, making our way to the far corner where the tanks and gas lines waited. My breath sounded ragged and wrong in the stillness. I didn't want to think about what would happen if they found a way in. If we didn't have time to finish this.

"Here," Jake said, voice calm, like the world wasn't ending around us. It helped, more than I wanted to admit. We stopped by the main gas line, and I could see the propane tanks stored near it. It was funny just then, thinking that when Lyle ordered us to store them here, I thought it was a safety hazard and could risk a fire or explosion, now I was grateful that it would do just that.

We didn't talk. We knew what needed to be done, and it needed to be done quickly. I pulled wires out of my pocket, hands moving like they were someone else's, shaking and awkward. Everything felt like a dream. A nightmare. My mind kept jumping back to the way they'd looked, the way our crew had turned into those things. I tried to shut it out, tried to focus on setting everything up correctly, connecting the lines, setting it just right.

The air was damp and foul, a stink of rot that clawed at my throat. I glanced at Jake. He was working steadily, his face a mask of concentration. It steadied me too, even as the fear gnawed at the edges of my thoughts. I knew this was our only shot. Blow it up. Burn it all down. It had to work.

A loud bang made me jump, and I almost dropped everything. The door. They were at the door. Pounding, scraping, trying to get in. I fought to keep my hands steady. It wasn't going to hold. I knew it wasn't going to hold.

"Keep going!" Jake said, and there was a fierce, urgent edge to his voice. I forced myself to move, forced myself to think. Another bang. Louder. A crack split the air, the sound of wood starting to give.

We were so close. Almost there. I wrenched the valve open, praying it would work, praying we wouldn't be here to see it if it did. The smell of gas filled the air, sharp and bitter, mixing with the smell of fear and sweat.

"Now!" Jake yelled, and I knew he was right. Now or never. I twisted the last piece into place, felt the cold metal bite into my skin. I thought my heart would explode, thought we'd never make it. I didn't let myself look back.

We finished setting the firebomb, the tanks lined up like dominos, ready to blow. A mad, desperate hope flared up, almost as terrifying as the fear. This had to work. It had to.

Jake's eyes met mine, I nodded, more to convince myself than him. We were ready. Ready to get out of here, ready to run and ready to make damn sure this place didn't survive us.

We had one last desperate plan to escape. We armed the bomb and knew that once the fire started the whole place would be engulfed in minutes. If we could escape through the back maintenance panel we might be able to get out, assuming the malign growths did not block that way as well.

As we started to move we saw him. He was standing between us and the stairs. Like he'd been waiting. His head was cracked like the others, jagged lines spider-webbing across his skull, but worse. So much worse. My mind didn't want to understand, but I knew. I knew it was him. The huge frame. The way he stood, almost like he was about to laugh. Mark. He lurched forward, and I thought I saw him falter, thought I saw a moment of doubt as if some part of him knew what he was doing. We charged, desperate to get past, and the force controlling him seemed to take over. The sound of tearing filled the air.

He looked at me, and I swear I saw something human, some trace of Mark, beneath the madness. It was gone in an instant. His head tilted, and the cracks seemed to yawn open, wide and hungry. A dark smear oozed across his face, like the shadow of a grin. It was more than I could stand, more than anyone should have to. Jake and I rushed him, praying for a miracle.

Mark moved with terrifying speed, faster than the others. His massive arms swung wide, and I barely ducked in time. The wind from it knocked me sideways, into a heap of metal and debris. The pain flared sharp and hot, but there was no time to think about it. Jake was already on his feet, grabbing my arm, pulling me up.

"Go!" I yelled, but it sounded more like a gasp. My own voice, scared and small, almost lost in the chaos.

Mark paused, just for a second, like he was fighting something. Like he was fighting himself. His movements jerked, a grotesque dance as the force tried to take control. I didn't know if I should feel anger, or horror, or guilt. I didn't know what to feel, so I didn't. Not then. There was no time.

He charged again, and I saw Jake dodge left, saw him grab a sledgehammer from the demolition tools and swing. It connected with a sickening thud, and Mark's head snapped to the side, but it didn't stop him. He staggered, then turned toward us, eyes blank and endless in their cracked flesh mask. I thought we were finished. I thought this was the end.

But something shifted. I saw it in the way he moved, the way he hesitated. Something in him was breaking free, and for a moment, I could almost hear his voice beneath the groans. A low, agonized sound, like he was pleading for it to stop. To be over.

That moment passed, and he lunged. I couldn't see how we'd make it, how we'd ever get past. My mind spun with the impossibility, the way everything had gone from bad to worse, worse, worse.

Jake shoved me to the side, and Mark's swing missed by inches. It left him open, left us just enough room to push through. I grabbed a length of chain, didn't think, didn't hesitate, just wrapped it around his legs and pulled with everything I had. It slowed him down, more than I'd hoped, more than I dared. We ran, limbs and lungs on fire, scrambling up the stairs.

I heard him behind us, the sound of his struggles and the terrible echo of his steps. We were out, out of the basement and into the hallway, the nightmare following at our heels. The walls loomed and flickered, alive and angry, but it didn't matter. We were ahead. We'd made it.

Somehow, impossibly, we'd made it.

I could feel the blood dripping down my arm, hot and sticky, but there was no time to care. No time for anything but getting the hell out. The hallway stretched in front of us, impossibly long, impossibly dark, and I knew they were right behind. I could hear them. The sound of broken porcelain. The sound of nightmares. We moved like we were in a dream, the kind where your legs don’t work, the kind where you never get away. We couldn’t stop. Couldn’t let them catch us. Not now. Not when we were this close.

We heard the rest of them, clambering after us in the dark. I gasped for air, but it felt like breathing through a straw. My lungs screamed and my muscles burned, but none of it mattered. We turned a corner, another, the building a maze that twisted back on itself. Jake was a step ahead, moving like a man possessed, the determination carved into his features. The lights flickered overhead, a strobe that lit the horrors around us. The walls seemed to lean in, suffocating, smothering, but we kept going.

Plastic sheeting stretched across a window, a thin barrier between us and the outside. My heart leapt and stumbled, a mad dance in my chest. It was right there. It was hope and escape, and it was real. If we could just make it, just hold on a little longer.

The building groaned, and the temperature spiked, heat rolling off the walls in waves. We knew the fire had started, if we did not make it out at least those things would burn.

I could hear them, those things, those creatures, getting closer. I could almost feel their fingers on the back of my neck. Almost see their shattered heads in my mind, cracks spreading, grins widening. I thought of Mark, thought of all of them, and I pushed myself harder. We were too close to fail. Too close to let it end like this.

We reached the maintenance door. It was blocked but we had to try something. We saw the disturbing blanket of plastic heads was thinner near an adjacent window. I didn't hesitate. The torch I had recovered, flared in my hand, and I set it against the plastic, watched it bubble and curl and peel away. I could hear Jake behind me, the scuffle and thud of debris as he threw it aside, his breath as ragged as mine. The smoke stung my eyes, and the whole world narrowed to a single point: get through. Get out. Get away.

They were almost on us. I could hear the thump of their steps, the discord of their limbs. It made my skin crawl, the way they moved, the way they never stopped. Never slowed. Jake grabbed the torch, held it like a weapon, and I smashed through the last of the barrier. It cut my arms, my face, but the pain barely registered. Nothing registered.

We burst through the window and onto the deck, the world exploding into color and noise. It shook beneath our weight, and I thought it would give, thought we'd tumble back down into that hell, but it held. We scrambled down, the sound of the firebomb roaring to life inside, the whole building coming apart behind us.

The blast hit like a shockwave, heat and noise and the scream of something alive. A wall of fire shot into the sky, and I turned, transfixed by the sight of it. The building seemed to melt, to fold in on itself as the flames devoured it. The air filled with the terrible music of burning, of cracking wood and twisting steel, and something else. A chorus of other sounds, the wails of things that should never have existed.

We hit the ground, and my legs almost gave out. We were away, but the heat licked at our backs, chased us as we ran for the van. Jake wrenched the door open, and we threw ourselves inside, slammed it shut. It was only then, only when I heard the metallic click of the lock, that I let myself believe it. Let myself know we were out. Alive.

We sat there, gasping for breath, watching the building die in a blaze of fury and noise. The sky above it glowed a sickly orange, like a wound that wouldn't close. I couldn't stop shaking, couldn't stop seeing the cracked heads and dark eyes. I didn't think I ever would.

"Think we might need another new job," Jake said, voice raw and ragged, but steady.

I laughed, or tried to, but it came out like a sob. “Yeah I am not sure how we are going to explain this one to the authorities, but this is getting old.”

We didn't look back as we drove away, I could feel it behind us, feel the heat and madness of it. I wondered if I'd ever outrun what I'd seen in Mark's eyes, what I'd heard in the way the building screamed as it burned.

We drove, leaving the nightmare and a piece of ourselves in the flames. Maybe it was all we'd ever have, Jake and I. Maybe it was enough.



Jake and I are doing okay now and have mostly recovered. Once again, we are both going to look into a different line of work after this. Renovation seemed safe, but after what we saw, we lost the will to do more.

What do you think, anywhere else that is hiring?
