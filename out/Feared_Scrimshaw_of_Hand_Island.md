I'm a fisherman. My brother and I have been working in the Gulf of Mexico for years. One morning, we were on the water, doing our usual routine when we got a call. It was on the radio. A yacht had crashed on a small uninhabited island nearby. There were two people alive, but one of them was a child and was seriously injured.

We didn't think twice. We turned our boat and headed toward the island. We didn't know what we were getting into. When we arrived, we found the wreck. The yacht was wrecked, and it looked like no one had been able to escape. But there was the mother, holding her injured son, barely able to speak. We unloaded them from their boat and told them we were going to get them out of there.

We thought we were done, but that was just the beginning. As we were about to leave, I noticed something strange. My brother was looking down at the beach where we left our boat. He looked confused, like he saw something that didn’t belong. I turned around and saw them.

At first, I thought they were just shadows, but then I realized they were moving. Big, dark shapes with long legs and sharp claws. They were like… like dinosaurs, but they had feathers. And they were circling our boat. Watching us.

The mother’s eyes went wide when she saw them. “We need to go,” she whispered. “They’ll come for us, too. You have to hide.”

We didn’t wait for her to explain. We grabbed the survivors and ran, climbing upon the rocks where the yacht had crashed. We found a sea cave, and we'd climbed up from the sand, hoping they wouldn't find us. We huddled inside, trying to stay quiet, trying not to breathe too loud. I could hear them outside, sniffing the air, their feet scratching the ground as they moved closer.

“They... they killed them,” the mother said, voice shaking. “They killed my husband... my crew. Took them into the jungle. That’s why the boat crashed. They... they don’t stop.”

I told her to be quiet. I couldn’t believe it. These things were real. And they were hunting us.

Then we heard it. The sound of water, the tide coming in.

"Hand Island." my brother, Hermano, reminded me. I nodded.

Nobody comes to Hand Island, it is a dangerous place. The tide was coming in fast, flooding the lower portion of the cave. In the dark, we huddled, shivering in fear.

The creatures were in the water now, too. They were swimming toward the cave, moving fast, like they knew exactly where we were. We could see them at the entrance, their eyes like the eyes of snakes, like they could see our body heat in the darkness.

I held my breath, clutching the survivors as tightly as I could. My brother looked at me, and I saw the same fear in his eyes that I felt in my chest.

There was nowhere to run.

At that moment, in my most desperate terror, I remembered the legend of Hand Island.

Long ago, many, many years ago, a sailor had come to our village. He was a silent man, broken by the sea. He had rowed alone, the last survivor of a shipwreck on the rocks of Hand Island.

The others, he never said what happened to the crew of his ship. He just whittled away at a piece of wood. It was large, a scrimshaw totem, an effigy of the things that had killed the others.

I had seen it, its mouth open, teeth aimed, claws wide in a cruciform of death. Upon their feet they each had a curved dagger, polished and glistening. I remember seeing his art, and it had terrified me. Somehow, since childhood, I'd forgotten that these were the inhabitants of Hand Island.

They climbed carefully up the slippery rocks towards us, and they made purring noises to each other, and answered back and forth as they trapped us in the back of the cave.

"We die here, my brother." Hermano told me. "But not if I make them busy. You take the boy on your back, and woman, you swim behind. Escape without me."

"No Hermano, I love you..." I told my brother. It was the last thing I could say to him.

Terror gripped my heart, beating like jungle drums. He rushed forward with a rock clutched in his hands. He screamed in defiance, echoing like a blast in that hollowed sea cave. As he hurled the stone at the nearest of the creatures, the thing gracefully dodged the attack, and advanced eagerly to meet him.

Although I was filled with dread, I held the boy on my back and he clung to me, despite the dazed look in his eye from a concussion. Hermano was not with us as we splashed into the rising tide, swimming with great difficulty against the current.

The two fearsome things claimed their prey, while we escaped.

As we waded back onto the beach, I saw another of them atop the rocks, alone. It called into the jungle like a low coughing noise, and more of them answered. As we ran along the beach the boy began to feel heavy, and in my panic, I considered dropping him.

Then, from somewhere within me I could hear Hermano's voice saying: "Carry him further, do not falter. The boat is near."

I looked up and saw the boat was near, like he promised. Running alongside us the creatures came swiftly, but it was the woman they pounced on. She fell with a scream, and they began killing her. I did not look, there was nothing I could do for her.

We reached the boat and I dropped the boy into a seat and shoved us away from shore, fighting the incoming waves with oars. I saw some of the creatures in the water, swimming agilely.

I shouted in raw terror, grabbing the cord to start the motor. Once we were over the waves, I saw they had given up pursuit.

Hermano was my brother, and I loved him very much.

He enjoyed fishing with me, and he was the stronger and braver of the two of us. He was my younger brother, but he was the leader of our duo. Without him, I am alone.

He liked horses and wanted to someday own a horse. He said he would ride his horse every day and he would feed his horse sugar cubes. He would make sure his horse was always so happy, because he knew that his horse would make him happy.

He didn't like the taste of tequila. He only went to church if the weather was nice. There was a girl in our village he had a crush on for his whole life, but he never once spoke to her, he was scared of her.

She was the only thing he was scared of.

Farewell Hermano, you will always be my hero.
