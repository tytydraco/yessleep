I don't want to flex here, but it might sound like so... I am infectious. I start talking a certain way, and over time I notice friends and others talking like my lingo whether online or in life.

When I say torture, I mean exactly that. The best way I can describe it is you fall asleep and somewhere along the rabbit hole, you experience pain usually around 25% of what the pain would be in a waking experience. I've taken saws to my shins, porcelain cups to the face, and blunt hits. It's probably happened six times or more. I think it all started after I didn't believe a veteran when he said he had nightmares about getting shot. I asked if there was pain and thought he was being dramatic.

The first time it happened, all these foam boxes were falling from the sky, and my friends were saying that all the little things I do were tallying up as influence. Then, I had this procession down a river where along the banks all these men were hitting me with their fists. I woke up feeling like Neo physically sore all over.

Let's fast forward to a happier experience at an online school...  I decided to drop out and use my grant to purchase an MPC for making music. In my head it was an all-in decision. Music or bust. The most common theme was I kept improving but got ignored more each iteration of material I put out. Now we can fast forward a bit more, and it's my birthday (yesterday). I participated in a tarot reading which I've done before, but this one was spot on with likely a true psychic. They were putting me through the paces with my ex and whether I should mend the relationship or condemn it. I understand these things can be very generic and apply to a wide audience, but she was reading me like a simple script. For some reason the reading really made me angry at God. I chose to never forgive my ex, but that was just the introspection to then channel me into a talk out loud rant about "The Most High". What I realized is that although events like Charlie Kirk are incredibly frustrating and sad, I'll never give into a God-fearing complex. Jesus was perfect, so we are bound to him? You can bleed any amount of pain and insight into a future person, but that doesn't make you own my soul. I suppose I've been putting off this ongoing debate in my head because I want to be a kind person, and I mostly am. However, I have witnessed a lot of supernatural experiences to believe that a creator exists, but I have finally hardened my heart to never let him in again. 

When my brother died at the age of 34, it always perturbed me that my family spoke of him chatting with God about physics and math in the heavens. My brother saved my butt by opening my eyes in my teens. I wish I had more closely aligned with him and earlier because he would still be here.

The woman that did the tarot told me twice that I was being saved internally by myself. I want to continue believing this because there is one main distinction between God and me. That is simply, I hope for a chaotic universe where anything goes, but it's clear that after a strong psychic reached out to me authentically, there is no use for a karmic creator that plays favorites. He abandoned me and most of my family long ago despite being generally acceptable and influential people.

As far as the religiosity debacle, my simple happy explanation is that a chicken awoke and started drafting big without considering the egg.
