I am a scientist, Dr. David Anders. I lost my wife and son in an airplane crash. The incident shattered me, and I felt guilty for not being able to save them. For years, I worked on finding a way to bring them back. Finally, I had a breakthrough and decided to clone my family. However, the repercussions of playing God were far worse than I could have ever imagined.

The clones of my wife and son looked just like my real family, but there was something different about them. They lacked the warmth and emotions that made my family so special. They were like robots, programmed to follow my every command. At first, I was overjoyed to have my family back. I spent all my time with them, trying to recreate the memories we had shared before the accident. But I soon began to realize that my family was not the same. My wife was cold and distant and careless, and my son was always angry and locked himself in his room half of the time.

I started to regret my decision to clone my family, but I couldn't let go. I finally got my family back, and I thought that with some tampering with the code, all of this would be fixed. As time passed, things started to get even worse. The clones began to show signs of aggression towards each other, and I couldn't figure out why. I tried to modify their programming, but it was no use. They had developed their own personalities, and they were not the kind, loving family I had hoped for.

One day, I was in my lab working on a new project when I heard a scream. It was my son. I rushed out of the lab and found him lying on the floor, with my wife standing over him. He was bleeding, and his eyes were blank. I knew immediately that he was dead. My wife had killed him.

I was horrified, but I knew I had to keep my family together. I couldn't let them be destroyed, so I kept my son's body in the lab and worked on a way to bring him back. But something strange was happening. I started to have flashes of memories that weren't my own. Memories of a life I didn't live.

I put my hand on my neck and felt the main power switch. I went to my drawer where I kept all my updates and saw a stack of notes. Most of them said: "How many times have I done this," while others said: "I hate myself for doing this. I don't deserve to live, but I can't die. I have an idea."

I walked into the morgue. It was my "first time" in there. I used to just keep the bodies outside, but this was different. The morgue had every single slot filled with bodies, including my own. There were hundreds, thousands, so many that I had lost count.

My "wife" walked into the morgue with me and said: "It's beautiful, right?" I was confused because she wasn't programmed to say that. My wife turned around to go to the lab. I caught a glimpse of a sticky note on the back of my wife. It said: "2/5/2017."

My wife walked in carrying my son's rotten dead body, pretty much a full skeleton, and said: "Ready to try again?"
