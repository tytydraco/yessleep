So last week I visited my cousin who is living in an apartment, her room is in the 3rd floor, close to the staircases. The apartment was relatively old, she says that this apartment is older than our parents, at least that's what she heard from the others. She moved there because she doesn't like dorm, and since I told her I'll be visiting her frequently, she had her dad bought a double deck.

Anyway, I arrived at her apartment like 10 or 11 AM, and as usual we greet each other with a hug and then I'll drop down my baggage in her room, and we spent a lot of time talking.

She bragged about how cheap the rent is and how lucky she is that the people next door are nice and how the guy in the opposite side of the hall is hot.

It was until 4 when she got up and said she'll be going out to buy some snacks, she asked if I want to go with her, but I was feeling lazy so I said, "Nah I'll pass." She didn't mind it and asked if there's anything I want and I said, "Noodles, the spicy beef one, that's all ehehe." She nods and waves her hand before going out, a few seconds I saw her close the door and I was alone.

Well nothing really happened aside me lazing in the bed and for the record I used the lower bed, I don't really like sleeping on top. I was browsing through my fb when I heard someone knock thrice at the door, "Eh? Is she back that quick?" I stand up and went to the door and open it without a second thought.

There my cousin was standing in front of me but something's odd, for starters she is empty handed and her skin is a sickening death pale, her expression was blank and she was staring at me.

I freaked out and asked her what happened, but she didn't say anything and just went inside, shoving me away. 

I followed her and kept nagging her to at least talk to me cause I'm getting scared as fuck. I don't know if this is some sort of prank or something bad happened to her, I just don't know cause she won't say a thing to me. 

She got on top of the bed, she lied down, curled herself up and hid herself in the blankets. I sighed and said to her, "Hey, you know you can talk to me if there are things troubling you, anyway I'll give you some space." With that I also rested myself below and distracted myself using my phone.

After 10 mins or so, a chat head pop up and it was my cousin, I instinctively opened it and what I read made me chuckle. "I knew it! You fucking got me there asshole!" I shouted and burst out laughing, while kicking the mattress. Her message was, "Yo there's no spicy beef here, you want something else?"

But there was no response, not a laugh, not a crackle, not a damn word. There was nothing. I kicked the mattress again and messaged her this time to knock it off.

But her response made me confused and quite to be honest scary, she messaged back and said, "tf you mean to knock it off?"

I dismissed and rolled my eyes, "Seriously, stop it, it's not funny fr fr" I messaged her back.

She messaged me again, "I swear to God you're getting on my nerves, what the hell do you mean 'to knock it off', you lazy bum!?" 

I got agitated and furiously mashed the keyboard replying as fast as I can, "You! You came back empty handed with a fucking pale face and you straight up ignore me! I thought something terrible happened to you!" After I sent the message she read it and didn't reply to me.

I got even more restless, a minute pass and she still haven't replied. I was about to message her when she sent a photo. It was a picture of her in the convenience store with a puzzled and annoyed look, but her skin wasn't pale at all.

I clicked my tongue in annoyance and kicked the mattress again, "You probably took that before going back." 

She replied quickly this time, "Fine then, you prick." After she sent that message she immediately called me. I picked it up and she readily opened her camera. She was in fact in the store, there with her normal complexion, her annoyed expression.

Immediately, my blood ran cold and my hair rose up, shivers went down on my spine. In a weak voice I uttered, "Then who was it the came inside this room?" 

My cousin noticed my horrified expression and asked me what I saw. I slowly said everything what happened to her and she too was terrified.

I want to run, I want to get the fuck out of here, but I remained paralyzed, unable to move my legs. My eyes teared up and I was panicking.

"HEY! GET OUT OF THERE!! KAT!!" My cousin's yelling broke my stance and with every adrenaline in my body, I sprang out of the bed.

I fell into cold wooden floor and when I got up, I made the biggest mistake in my entire life and that was taking a glance on top of the bed.

What I saw there will forever haunt me for the rest of my entire life.

It's height is comparable to a little boy, it's skin were burned, it got no eyes, only a darkness void, it's mouth was contorted to an inhuman grin, baring it's yellow teeth and fangs. It was sitting in a fetal position and I felt like it was staring into my soul.

It made me freeze for a few seconds, staring into that, if my cousin sees what I'm seeing now she'll pass out and I'm glad that I accidentally end the call when I sprang out of the bed.

It slowly reached towards me and when it was so close to my face, it said, "Let's play!" It was no voice of a child but a demon or a monster, it was like a low guttural voice, forcing itself to make itself sound like a child.

It broke the dam and I screamed to the top of my lungs and ran fast as I can never to look back. 

I got out of the room and quickly descended the flight of stairs, I got down and exited the apartment, where I tripped and fell to the ground, I cried and cried, as I stand up to run again. I look back and saw it, peeking at the stairs. I shrilled like a crazed lady and run till I reach the convenience store.

I got there inside and quickly saw my worried cousin, I run to her and hugged her deeply, while begging her to move out. I raised a commotion for sure but I don't care, I will only stop when my cousin agrees to me.

Maybe a couple of minutes have passed and she agreed and with that the energy was sucked out of me and I passed out.

Me passing out was probably the last time I'll be unconscious without nightmares.

Anyway I woke up in my home, my cousin was playing with her phone and when she saw me she quickly hugged me. She cried, repeatedly saying, "thank God!" Anyway she soon calmed down and I asked what happened.

"Well before I moved out I asked the neighbors if they know something about this. Apparently, there was a family who lived there back then, a mother and her only child. They say that her mother was busy at work since she was a single mom and her only child was always left alone in the room, one night there was a fire accident that burned down the entire third floor and the mother was late at work so she wasn't able to save her child and no one was able to save them as well. The mother soon took away her life. After that they have that place restored back, but soon that room I rented started having weird things happening, like they'll hear a child crying or calling for their mom. But yours was probably the worst that could ever happened. I'm so sorry if only I know."

I let it all sink in and I flopped down the bed, tears welled up and I sobbed, while my cousin comforts me. "It...was...like...a...demon" I choked the words out. 

Ever since that day my life was a living hell, every night I have nightmares, I kept seeing it from the corner of my eyes when I'm alone and sometimes I'll hear it when I'm cooking breakfast, giggling like a child but it sounded more like of a low pitch hollow giggle.

I don't think I'll live normally again after this.
