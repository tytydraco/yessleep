I suppose I got my longing for another chat with John, but I didn't take the opportunity until a couple days later. While trying to figure out the situation, I decided that visiting John - either one, for that matter - wouldn't help. And in all honesty, the thought of him made me sick, more sick than the sight of his corpse, which I presumed was still resting under the layer of dirt and leaves.

He noticed my absence, as he called regularly to ask where I was, if I wanted to go to a bar with him, the usual. Even just picking up the phone made me shake. I declined until he told me to stay with Dahlia while he was out in town. I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to finally talk to her. The need to confirm what she knew finally got me out of the house. When John left us alone and we made sure he was gone, I felt Dahlia's hand on mine.

“Where have you been-” she started, but in my frenzy I accidentally cut her off.

“Have you noticed anything weird about John?”

“...like what?”

I sighed. “Like…” I wasn't sure myself what I was asking for, as John had seemed completely normal to me when I talked to him earlier. When I came back a week ago to find him alive on his couch, and today when I came in, he acted as if nothing had happened. “Just anything.”

“Not really. Have you?” I stayed quiet, not able to bring myself to lie. Her answer stumped me for a moment, making my stomach twist. I had anticipated this answer, but it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. “Why are you asking?”

I debated telling her what was wrong with John, what had happened to me a week ago. I couldn’t find a way to start without sounding crazy. Dahlia was already looking at me with concern.

“Last time I was here, did you… hear anything? Unusual, I mean.”

“I… no.”

“No gunshot?”

“Gunshot? What? No…” I stared blankly at her with furrowed brows, with her looking just as confused as me, until she put a hand on my face and rubbed my temple with her thumb. “Did something happen? Are you okay?”

“Yeah, yeah - no, I’m fine.”

“You feel hot.” She wiped a bead of sweat from my head before I took her hand in mine. She guided me to sit down on the bed, surprisingly firm in her gesture. “Are you sure you’re okay?”

She got on the bed next to me, close enough to where her body touched mine. Her hand moved mine to her waist and allowed me to rest it there. From her touch to the way she was looking at me, I took it as an invitation.

“John will be back in an hour.” I reminded her, clearing my throat. I welcomed the topic change and she didn’t press further.

“Isn’t that enough time?” 

“Should be.”

My mind still lingered on what I didn’t manage to tell her while she kissed me. It wouldn’t do me any good to rack my brain over it. While she continued asking in between kisses, curious about my sudden questions that must’ve been nonsensical to her, I realized I couldn't tell her without sounding insane. So I forced myself to focus on something else. I let her straddle my lap and kissed her back.

“Dahlia?”

“Yes?”

“Where do you wanna go?”

She understood me immediately, and thankfully accepted my refusal to answer. “Anywhere, as long as there's a beach. Somewhere by the coast, maybe south? Just not here. I've had enough of Oregon.”

A beach house with Dahlia. I liked the idea. Away from people, no dark woods around us either. Just us two and a view of the wide ocean to wake up to. I surely had enough savings to get us a place to stay. If only we could be on our way already. I let myself get lost in the fantasy and her company until we heard John’s car stop in front of the house.

“Did’ya have a nice time?” John asked when he came back. Dahlia had excused herself to the couch, careful with her request, but John granted her privacy with an uncharacteristic kindness. I realized she had learned quickly how to not upset him, much quicker than most people did.

“Yeah.” I shrugged, watching him pull out two beers from his fridge, handing me one. There was no warning undertone this time, just smalltalk.

“What was up the past few days?” He asked. I stalled by taking a sip, muttering something like ‘*you know, the usual*’, but John didn’t let up. “No, I'm serious. You were doing fine until last week.”

“I don’t know, it was just… you know how I get about this whole thing sometimes.”

He gave me a smile, sly and condescending, and I watched him lean against the kitchen island. “There’s nothing to worry about.”

“Not *nothing*.”

“How often have you worried and nothing happened?” I didn’t give him a reply. “You’re good at this, you know? Why would I involve you in this if you weren’t?”

This compliment somehow managed to make me smile, much to my annoyance. He pointed it out immediately with a poke to my ribs.

“Whatever..” I gave him a soft push, watching him saunter over to the counter and unpack his groceries. I found myself unable to pull my eyes away from him. John grabbing the food and putting it in his fridge couldn't have been less exciting, but it held me hostage. He was talking about something that had happened while he was out, but I couldn't focus on it.

What was I doing? I had a plan and I was somehow letting myself get paranoid about… what even was it? The more I thought about it - maybe because I had put a week between the initial catalyst and now - the dumber I felt for being so hung up on it. It’s hard to describe, but in a moment of clarity, when I saw John laugh and talk to me and Dahlia, and be so obviously real, I couldn’t believe that the corpse in the woods was real as well. It felt like a figment of my imagination, and try as I might, I couldn’t bring myself to feel the same horror as then.

It was a dream. Yeah.

For some reason, I hadn’t considered this possibility in my week-long isolation. But now that it had suddenly come to my mind, it seemed plausible. More even, it felt like the one right answer. I hadn't ever had dreams as lucid as this one, but it wasn't out of the question. I must've woken up at some point and just mistaken it for real life. It could’ve transitioned perfectly into reality. And I couldn't possibly be dreaming now, because when John had jabbed a finger into my ribs, it hurt.

“I gotta grab something from my car.”

“How about you help me unpack?”

“In a minute, okay?”

“Fine.”

I left the house and made my way down the short path to my truck. This realization suddenly flooded me with tranquility and I cursed myself for going crazy over a dream. Though I supposed, with how real it felt, I couldn't fault myself too much. Nevertheless, I felt calmer. I opened the glove compartment and pulled out my handgun.

It was only natural to process stress through dreams. How often have my teeth fallen out in a dream because I had a job interview coming up? I could imagine my subconscious working through the nervousness before I got to realize my plan. I let out a short, quiet laugh at this. It was something I would've told John about, and he would’ve laughed too, but that wouldn't happen now. I'd tell Dahlia instead, maybe when we were on our way to the coast.

This time wasn’t as well planned as the last. Despite my newfound clarity, I hesitated longer than in my dream. It was only a second or two, but John had enough time to turn around and offset my aim. I had aimed square at his chest, but the bullet bore into his shoulder and the impact knocked him against the kitchen island. I cursed under my breath and before John could even say anything above a raspy gasp, another bullet shot through his head and he collapsed. Bits of brain and skull splattered the white marble. I grimaced at the mess getting in the gaps and crevices of the kitchen and considered whether a deep cleaning would be necessary. 

Before the blood could spread I packaged up John’s body in a couple black bags. I couldn’t get to the blood as I noticed Dahlia by the doorframe when I straightened back up. She stood by it, eyes glued to the blood on the counter, then looked at me. 

“Ah-” I opened my mouth to speak, but didn’t know what to say. She shrunk away when I walked towards her, making me stop. My hands were stained with blood, so I ran them under cold water in the sink. “Hey, it’s alright.”

I approached her again and this time she let me lay a hand on her arm. It left the faintest pink handprint on her shirt, to my dismay. “You…” she mumbled, finally looking up again. She took a deep breath and I nodded, gently pushing her out of the kitchen.

“I know, I know, I’m taking care of it. I know what I’m doing.” I saw Dahlia’s eyes gloss over and I held her steady by her waist. Her face was growing pale. “I’ll just get this taken care of and then we can-... are you okay?” 

Dahlia nodded, but her body became heavier in my arms for a few seconds before she regained consciousness. “Yeah, y-yeah, I’m… sorry, all the blood…” 

I led her to John’s bedroom, setting her on the bed. “Are you gonna throw up?” I asked, worried by her unsteady breathing and refusal to speak. I gave her a moment in which she just sat and tried to compose herself, staring at nothing in particular. Eventually, Dahlia shook her head. 

"N-no, I don't... think so."

“Stay in here for a bit, okay?” I said only when I was sure her nausea was mostly gone. Dahlia nodded. “I’ll be done in… I don’t know, it might take me a few hours. I’ll pick you up when I’ve got it all taken care of.” She nodded again, this time laying down on the bed. Her body was shivering. I placed a bucket by her side, gave her a quick kiss on the head and left her to herself.

I spent a tedious hour and a half cleaning the kitchen before I arrived at the clearing and repeated the process. As convinced as I was that this had been a dream, I decided to dig in a different spot. When I had John’s body covered with dirt, my eyes fell on the spot where I had buried him in my dream. I debated with myself whether or not I should check if he was there. I must’ve stood there for at least a few minutes, just staring at the patch of dirt as if hypnotized.

I came to the conclusion that I didn’t need to check, because John obviously wouldn’t be there. I’d just be wasting my time, and if I’d dig up the grave, I’d end up feeling dumb when I’d eventually find nothing inside. I didn’t need to entertain my delusions.

I stepped over the spot and left it behind myself as I returned to my car. In the naive belief that the events from last week wouldn’t repeat, I drove back to John’s house. The drive back was filled with silence. I didn’t bother turning on the radio and I tuned out the sound of the tires on the uneven ground.

I hesitated at the door, and as I reluctantly pressed my ear against it, I heard the muffled sound of soft jazz on the other side. My bodily reaction was immediate, my head swimming as if I was no longer inside my body, but I told myself I wouldn’t let it cloud my judgement. Could it make sense - *yes, it could* \- that Dahlia had left her room and, with John dead, she decided to put on some of his vinyls? I imagined the relief on her face when she saw that I had kept my promise, and I imagined her avoiding the kitchen and choosing to sit in the living room instead, waiting for me. It was convincing enough for me to feel a small shock when I entered and saw John in the kitchen, swaying his shoulders to the music as he cooked dinner. I didn’t bother driving back to see if the body was there, neither the fresh nor the week-old one that I now knew was still buried. 

“Oh, look who decided to show up.” John greeted me with a glance over his shoulder, which I barely reciprocated. I looked at Dahlia, who was sitting at the dinner table, holding her glass of water with steady hands. The spot on her sleeve had turned into a desaturated light brown, but I was evidently the only one who noticed. She gave me a smile, a genuine one. “Didn’t I ask you to come over at nine? Where were you?”

“What? I *was* here-” But I hadn’t been here, not in John’s recollection at least. I remembered the gap in memory between him and me. “I mean-...”

“My *ass* you were here.” he finally turned around, irritation on his face. “Didn’t think about giving me a call or anything?”

“Sorry, I… got caught up. Work ‘n shit.” I muttered, sitting next to Dahlia. I put my head in my hands as John acknowledged my answer with a grunt.

“Long day?”

“Very.”

I didn’t go home that day. I stayed for dinner, of which I didn’t eat any. The memory of the bits of brain and blood clinging to the counter killed my appetite. I agreed to watch a movie with them while trying to push down the despair that was starting to set in. Dahlia had definitely noticed it. She was shooting me glances, and the ones I managed to catch looked like she was silently asking if I was okay. I just gave a subtle nod in return, a forced smile before I returned to my tense posture. John was blissfully unaware.
