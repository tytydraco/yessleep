Truth is I wasn't always a believer, all that bullshit on the internet of fake photoshopped photos of ghost sightings and videos made me chuckle. Because I know they're fake because I have seen them. The real them. 

I recently was diagnosed with lung cancer. I never smoked a damn cigarette in my life. What a damn joke. I was healthy, fit, and in shape. Running was my escape. Yet as the leaves began to fall I started to feel pain in my chest and have coughing fits after attempting to run on the trails we have here. I ignored it for a few weeks, to be honest. I figured I was getting sick since it was that time of the season and took a break from working out. The coughing persisted though and as I coughed I choked on something wet. As I let out a big cough, I saw it for the first time, blood. It was then I realized something was wrong. Really. Really. Wrong. 

Finding out the truth was hard. They took x-rays and blood tests and told me the news. I'm a man of many strengths but I cried. I couldn't process the reality of death. They told me I was lucky if I got 6 months to live.  I never found a wife or even had a child. I never settled because I thought I had more time I'm only 26 years old and I have no one. 

I'm going to die alone as the thoughts began to rush in from the magnitude of this news. The doctor discussed my options and I opted out of chemo and surgery. The cancer spread to the point I would have only prolonged my suffering. Honestly, I didn't want to do multiple surgeries either. Cut open, sown up again, just to be opened up again. I decided to go home and hire a nurse to come see me now and then to check on me. Then go to hospice when It's officially my time. I wanted to be in the comfort of my home though. Not a hospital bed. Little did I know at the time comfort would only be a dream and I would be tormented. 

Even as I write this I see them. Staring at me with lifeless eyes and grin on their face. When they smile I see rotted teeth that look black, as if someone rubbed charcoal all over their teeth. The worst is the smell. A putrid smell of rotten eggs fills my nose when they are near.  As to tell me they are close and ready for their supper. To eat away at any remaining life I had. It wasn't always this intense though. The events started small. I would discover things going missing, and being a nonbeliever at that time I figured it was the pain medication they gave me, but then I started to hear the voices.

The first time I heard it was in my room. It was my dad's voice. I was in the kitchen at the time and I heard yelling. As I walked closer and closer I could make out what was being said. 

‘YOU STUPID PIECE OF SHIT, YOUR MOTHER ABANDONED YOU BECAUSE YOUR A LOW-LIFE LOSER YOU FUCKING NOBODY YOU WERE A MISTAKE”  

Memories of being a child flooded my mind. As I peeked I saw it in the corner. It was the spitting image of my father.  He was twitching and moving his body in unnatural ways. The yelling stopped and the room became quiet as a chill ran through me. Gurgling noises and the snapping of joints as he began to shift and morph his body to be on all fours, His neck snapped, turned to me, and ran at me. I stumbled and started to try to run but I began to cough and as my chest seized I fell to the floor. My oxygen tank…. I saw it for a split second but then the weight of my father began to crush me.

“WE KNOW” With a distorted voice he begins to cackle. 

His voice starts to distort as he begins to eat at my legs. After each bite, he grins while my blood pours out of his mouth. 

Then he stopped. Looked at me and said “Not yet” in a unison voice that sounded cold and shallow. 

I passed out from the sheer terror of the horror I had been through. Waking up I'm on the floor I see my legs are fine. Confused I shakingly get up. I was sick to my stomach. Thinking the horror is over I see them peaking at me behind the doorway this time silent… Watching me… every move I make their eyes dart in every direction I go.  
They do that a lot now in between their torment. To remind me they will always be here. 

Each day as my health becomes worse they haunt me . Each attack is in waves and the truth is I deserve this though and that's why I'm writing this. They know what you have done in your life and they know when your time is coming. They smell death lingering off your body as you get closer and closer to death's cold embrace.  Believer  or not, they will find you. They will consume you. They will eat and tear into your soul until you are pronounced dead and will make you pay for what you do in this lifetime. As I grab my pain meds, they look up giddily. They know what I’m about to do and they want me. I’m just pushing up the timeline. I can’t take this anymore. 

She was only a teenager and I’m only sorry I got caught. Law enforcement couldn’t find me since I hid her body well. Yet they know and I will pay for my sins.As I write this confession. They are getting closer and closer to me. I hear their voices damning and condemning me. Laughing after each pill I swallow. 

But I’m realizing my death will not be the end or peace. My  skin is beginning to feel like it’s being burned as each limb feels like it being torn. I’m rushing writing this as my eyes grow heavier. The voices are getting louder as well. Laughter mixed with cries of joy. My time has come and I will pay for eternity. They always known I would but it was only when I was close to death did they reveal themselves.
