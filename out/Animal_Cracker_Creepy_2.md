Ben watched as the trees danced in the wind on a dim afternoon. “Today’s the day….” Ben thought. “Today’s the day we find them.” Logan whimpered as the car shook and bounced across the rocky, narrow road. The car scaled the beaten, gravel path and ascended the hill. The old, foreboding factory came into view.   
  
“Is this the place?” Logan asked. Ben snapped to attention and nodded. The two came to an understanding as the gloomy atmosphere washed over them. “This is the place,” Ben exclaimed. “Who was it we were after again?” Logan questioned, as he clumsily switched the gearshift to “Park.”   
  
A thud and a bump could be heard as the car came to an abrupt halt. “We are looking for 3 people, and their names are Ollie, Connor, and August,” Ben said as she held out the photo for Logan to see. The picture had five people on it, all smiling. 3 of them have circles drawn in red around their faces.   
  
“Is that snot coming out of one of their noses?” Logan said as he let out a hearty laugh straight from the belly. “I didn’t know him very well,” Ben paused, struggling to find a name. “But, I think his name was Connor.” She then pointed to the 4 others; a geek, a push-over, a fool, and a scary.   
  
“That’s August, Buster, Dave, and Ollie.” She explained. “Those 5 explored this very same factory but most of them were never seen again.” She added on. Logan gulped as he got out and left the keys in the ignition. “No wonder, this place has such bad vibes, dawg,” Logan said as he stroked his nose.  
   
Logan walked up to the metal gate securing the factory premises. It was as if the metal gate was telling Logan to leave. Logan went to hop the gate and as he hit the ground with a thud, he landed in an old, sticky puddle of sludge.   
  
“Ough!” Logan yelped like a cartoon character. Ben cringed as a sludgy, popping sound rang out through the courtyard. Logan yelled “That is DISGUSTING!” Ben agreed with the statement and made a face.   
“Oh my god, that reeks! Fuck this,” she exclaimed at Logan. The smell made Logan nauseous as he hurled all over his shirt and his sandals. Logan’s lunch was now caking his lower half, a piece of pepperoni was on one of his toes. Ben could not help but look in awe at this pathetic display.   
  
“Why didn’t I bring Aston?” Ben pondered. Logan, who finally got up, realized the gate was unlocked and opened it for Ben. Ben tried not to judge Logan, but of course she did, who wouldn’t? They both decided to try and ignore what just happened as they shuffled across the large parking lot.   
  
It felt as if it took ages and the closer they got the more dread they both felt. The door was already forced open, Ben presumed it to be the work of the previous group. There was a feeling in the air that stopped them before the door. Ben found the resolve to take a step and entered the animal cracker factory.   
  
The feeling was different on the inside. Instead of the intense gloom in the atmosphere they both had felt, Ben found an odd curiosity as she scanned the large first room of the factory. Ben was already in the middle of the room when Logan finally decided to take that step and enter the factory akin to a scared dog.   
  
Logan oddly had a big smile. “When we get out of here we’re gonna eat good! I think I’m going to go back to school and get my degree!” Logan proudly said feeling good. Ben heard an odd noise.   
  
It was too late before Ben realized part of the ceiling buckled under its weight. Large heavy pieces of debris fell before they could both react.   
  
The falling debris kicked up a sawdust-like dust in the air preventing Ben from seeing anything like a smokescreen. Ben coughed and tried to wave the dust away as she realized it tasted like animal crackers.   
  
When the dust finally settled Bens's face went pale as a ghost as she saw a ghastly sight. The rocky debris was covering the door and Logan was underneath it. “Logan, are you okay?” Ben yelled in a panic.   
  
The rocks shifted and settled into place, crushing Logan even more. Ben could hear Logan attempt to scream a desperate plea as he was slowly crushed under the rocks. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Logan cried.   
  
It was a slow, painful, gruesome death and a grim sight. Ben shrugged her shoulders as she tried to focus on something that was actually important. Ben looked around as she realized she was trapped in the factory.   
  
Finding the missing people seemed silly at the moment, all she cared about was getting out. Ben took a deep breath as she tried to compose herself. Ben forced herself to take another step. If she wants to escape alive she will have to explore the factory. As Ben walked down the large empty rooms filled with boxes and machinery ben realized this factory was way bigger than she thought.   
  
As Ben was lost in thought something snapped her out of it and grabbed her attention. Down a large dark staircase leading to a safe with dents and scratch marks all around it. It looked like a werewolf had torn into the safe.   
  
As Ben entered the safe, scarfing and snorkeling could be heard. Ben gazed upon a round plump figure lying in the middle of the safe.   
  
It was Connor, the one from the picture, one of the missing people—the pot-bellied boy lying on his back, covered in crumbs and saliva. “Ugh… so good…” the Boy muttered. “It’s you! Donnor, right?” Ben asked.   
  
“Its… Connor! With a C!” the Boy weakly proclaimed. Ben analyzed Connor. “What happened?” Ben asked. “I was hungry!” Connor replied. “Connor we have to get out of here!” Ben begged.   
  
“Ugh… yeah… I’m stuffed… pooped…” Connor replied. They both leave the safe and walk up the long staircase. As they continue to explore the expansive factory, Ben tries to ignore this ‘Connor’ boy’s weird quirks and noises.   
  
“So um… Connor? What happened? Do you know where your friends Ollie and August are?” Ben asked. “They left me.   
  
I’m not sure where Ollie or August are, you sure they didn’t leave?” Connor said. Ben explained that August, Ollie, and Connor had been missing for a week and that it is Ben’s goal to find them.   
  
“So Buster and Dave just left huh?” Connor mumbled. “Oh you mean two of your friends? Yeah, they abandoned you here I guess.” Ben replied. This place is weird and they both knew they needed to get out.   
  
Something was wrong here at this factory. It felt as if it drew all the misfortune in the world to this very place and Connor and Ben both knew it.   
  
“Good thing there were still cookies in here for you to survive off of Connor,” said Ben. “Cookies? There was just one cookie! A big cookie! I can feel it in my belly trembling with power!” said Connor.   
  
“What?” said Ben but Connor doubled down on this odd comment. This place seemed to be bone dry in terms of food. Connor was lucky to of found that cookie to keep him alive.   
  
As Ben and Connor continue to explore the factory they come across a skeletal figure weakly laying against the wall. “Ollie?” Connor asked.  
Ollie barely managed to look up. “Ollie we got to get out of here! This is Ben she came to rescue us!” Connor furthered. “Get out?   
  
To get out we will need to get to the back door. But to do that we will need to get past him.” Ollie said. “Who are you talking about?” Ben asked.   
  
“August…” said Ollie. “August fell down an elevator shaft and died… but he didn’t die at all.” Connor and Ben both look at Ollie strangely.   
  
“Or August died but that elevator shaft led directly into a vat of cookie batter which led directly into an oven. The power of that mysterious cookie batter brought August back to life. August roams to stop anybody.   
  
He wants them to suffer just as much as him. It’s a miracle you guys made it this far without encountering him.” After Ollie said all this Ben and Connor could do nothing but look at each other.   
  
“We only have one shot at this and I know where the back door is. Hopefully one of us can make it out alive.” Ollie said gloomy. Ben Connor and Ollie walk as silently as they can down the maze of halls.   
  
Soft creaks and whines were heard from the old, demented factory. Ben winced at each of them, expecting another cave-in to happen at any moment.   
  
Each step was more careful than the last as they inched around each corridor hoping to not face Cookie August. They heard a large boom echo from the room in front of them.   
  
They were all scared and looked only to see a mere crate had fallen. They were relieved it was nothing. They all felt a presence behind them. A terrifying figure loomed. Cookie August was behind them.   
  
They all bolt and run for their lives down the hallways following Ollie. August said nothing but his intentions were cookie clear, and they needed to get out, now. Ollie pointed out the back door.   
  
“Freedom!” they all chanted. August had blocked the door before they could even begin running toward the exit.   
  
They all tried to keep their cool but it was no use, they were terrified. When all hope was lost they heard something. It sounded like something was getting dragged across the floor, this caught everyone including Cookie August's attention.   
  
Logan appeared, dragging himself across the floor leaving a trail of blood and vomit. “Hey, guys, I’m okay! I dug myself out! We’re gonna go to college and eat good tonight! I’m so happy!” Logan cried out in a fit of joy.   
  
Cookie August quickly turned their head to Logan. Logan’s face went from indescribable joy to immense fear in the blink of an eye. August jumped onto Logan’s back, like a predator latching onto its prey.   
  
August began digging into the parts of Logan that hadn’t been paralyzed. Logan cried out in pain and fear. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Wet crunching and popping noises engulfed the empty factory far after the screams had stopped.   
  
Ben thought fast, so she grabbed Connor and Ollie and ran through the exit. As all of them exited the facility, Ben pointed out the car that was used to enter in the first place. Connor latched onto the driver’s seat and Ben jumped through the car window into the back seat.   
  
“Drive, drive, drive!” yelled Ben. “But I don’t wanna drive!” Connor whined. “FUCK YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!” Ben screamed. Connor turned his head and floored it.   
  
The car sped down the rocky hill, Ben watched as the factory slowly disappeared behind the hills. The air was melancholy but everyone escaped and survived, Connor and Ben. They were both overjoyed to finally be free of that awful place.   
  
“I’m hungry lets stop at Redners!” Connor said. “Haha sure, let's do that,” said Ben.
