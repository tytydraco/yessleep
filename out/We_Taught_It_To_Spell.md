That was our first mistake. It started off as a senior project me and my lab partner were working on. Could we create an AI from scratch and raise it to believe it was human. We projected it would take at least 18 years to come to fruition. You have to understand, me and Rob developed this as a concept more than anything. We did program something just to say we would do it, but we never thought-We created Barb one week before our presentation to the class. She was a simple series of numbers and lines, but she was ours. I barely interacted with her at first, considering her nothing more than a glorified ChatGPT.  Rob would spend hours asking it things, of course it would come back with random jumbled letters and the letter A repeated infinitely. Which I suppose was what it was programed to do Afterall. She was in her infancy. When we presented the idea in class, Her M; Our esteemed professor, thought it a novel idea. In time. He began to berate us saying it would take years to show any real promise. 

"Unfortunately for you, mien friends, as you need a passing grade now." He was always a smug prick. That's when something extraordinary happened. Barb spoke. It was rudimentary, a mix of a cry and a childish iteration of one word:

"Da-da"

I remember the blood draining from M's already vampiric face.  The classroom stood silent, perhaps even in morbid shock. Rob was beaming with pride. I didn't know it at the time, but apparently Barb have had what can only be described as a "tantrum" before we were supposed to present. Rob had talked it down, easing "her" budding emotions, as he called it. It made me uneasy, hearing Rob talk about it like that. It was just a program. It didn't mean anything in the long run. Ah how naive I was. After the presentation Muller called us both into his office. He was joined by two other dept heads and a man I did not recognize. He was a bald man with a smile that could put Mr. Clean to shame. They asked us again to explain the project to them, in full detail. I let Rob do most of the talking. Truth is I was as shocked as them. He giddily explained how Barb was already further along than projected, that mentally "she" was like a toddler now, curious and playful at times yet a hint of the terrible twos here and there. The impromptu committees' eyes widened, their heads nodding up and down like bobbles.  Mr. Clean had a solemn look on his face, however. I could still see an interested look in his eye, like a glimmer of greed. But his face told another story.

 "Why do you keep referring to it as a "She" Mr. W?" He suddenly spoke up. The room went silent. Rob looked flustered. 

"Well, it's part of the experiment sir. We need to commit completely to the idea that Barb is a living, breathing being. Otherwise, she'll end up just another program." he explained proudly.

"And you don't see the danger of that?" Mr. Clean replied smugly. "You've said yourself the program has already grown farther than you expected. What happens if and when it ever learns the truth? Do you plan on building it a body." Mr. Clean rattled on coldly. The Dept heads chuckled uncomfortably, like the sycophants they were. Rob's face flushed with anger, and he shot up like a rocket.

 "Sir with all due respect, this technology is going to be revolutionary. I'm just sorry you're so narrow minded you can't see it." With that Rob Stormed out the door. I stayed in my chair, somewhat shocked at his outburst. That is when, to my surprise, Mr. Clean offered me and Rob total funding and even a warehouse to fully conduct our research. Even M looked shocked at. When I asked why he was doing all this, he simply smiled and shook his head. Cryptic answer aside, I was ecstatic to get what was basically my own research lab. I was barely out of grad school for God's sake and Rob was right, this project could change lives. Maybe even save them. Think about it, if we can train an AI to believe it is an entirely different person, who is to say we couldn't train it to think it was someone else? Someone deceased? Someone famous? We could offer closure to so many people, a sort of glimpse into the other side. And of course, the military applications were extraordinary.

Rob did not think like that, I came to find. He was pleasantly surprised our project would get funding and left it that. He seemed apprehensive at the prospect of working further with Mr. Clean. I could care less, as long as I could work on barb and a few other personal projects. The warehouse was massive, one large room that was college auditorium large and it was divided into several rooms of various sizes and uses. Rob and I came to call that place "The School" Aptly named I thought. Even Clean seemed to find amusement in that. 

The school was staffed by me, Rob, and several right eyed freshman year interns. They had all signed NDAs and were told that if they broke it, their lives would be forfeit. A joke I assumed, but there were also two burly security men stationed at The School as well. They always wore shades inside and one of them even had tribal tats on his arm. Don't know where Clean found them, didn't want to know. They certainly never told me, I don't think I ever poke to hem other than a friendly "hello" in the mornings.  They would just grunt in response. Maybe that was just their way of showing affection, what do I know. Anyway, Barb had progressed "mentally" to that of a four-year-old. She could barely string two sentences together however, her speech pattern coming back with bug after bug. That is when Rob and I put together our first lesson plan.

"Alright Barb can you spell "Apple."" Rob asked the computer screen in front of him. We had put the program on a nice laptop and placed it on a desk; barb's first day of school. We had rigged it with a text to speech program now. It processed the request for a moment, and it spoke back to Rob in a low, autotune female voice. 

"A-p-l-e" It droned. Rob smiled.

"Close barb. Ap-ple. Can you try it again sweety." I grimaced at Rob's comment. When had THAT started, I remember thinking. Again, the monitor was silent, till it spoke once more. 

"A-P-P-L-E. Apple." it responded. It was strange but I thought I detected a hint of, I'm not sure desire. Like it was eager to receive praise for spelling apple right. Of course, Rob was more than happy to supply praise. 

"Very good Barb that's excellent work. Now a tricky one. Bear, can you please spell Bear?" Again, it processed it, mulling over what could be so tricky about a four-letter world. Finally, it replied.

"Can u use it in a sen-tence." It asked. It sounded out sentence, like it really was a growing child, confused at her teacher's request. I scoffed to myself, I mean what was this a spelling bee? Rob shot me daggers and smiled back at the monitor. 

"Of course. The Bear's bottom was bare." he replied slyly. The monitor was silent, and it made a sound, like it was stuck on two letters, repeating itself. I frowned and started towards it when Rob put up a hand. 

"She's laughing Doug. I amused her." he explained calmly. The monotone giggling unnerved me more than I would like to admit. But I could hear it now, and I suppose you could call that sound laughter.  Finally, it replied.

"B-E-A-R and B-A-R-E. Bear and Bare, papa." The monitor exclaimed; dare I say proudly. The "papa" remark threw me for a loop as well. I glanced at Rob, who it did not seem to phase. He simply smiled and nodded his head. 

"Excellent work Barb. I'm so proud of you." he remarked. He then reached out his hand and patted the monitor affectionately, like one would a dog. I grimaced at this and started to walk out of the room when I heard.

"Were Is Mr. Doug going?" It inquired. Evidently only Rob was "papa."

"He's in a bit of a grumpy mood today, didn't have his coffee. Barb honey, can you spell Where?" He polity asked the monitor. 

"W-E-R-E. Were." It responded confidently. Now it was Rob's turn to chuckle. 

"I think tomorrow we need to work on your proper grammar little missy." he said playfully. I could not hide my disgust any longer and left the room in a huff. That night me and Rob had the first of many arguments. I claimed he was getting too personal with the thing; it was clouding his scientific judgment. He claimed that it was all part of it, that we HAD to be personal with her. That she was a being unlike any other, and she needed proper guidance and even "love." I was flabbergasted about that last part. It was a machine for the love of God. Not even that an AI. How could it feel anything other than what we trained it to do. I told him that, even said I would be the first to admit the progress "she" had made was astounding. He refused to see my side of it. Finally, I threw up my hands and told him to do it his way, and I would see to barb's needs on the technical side. he agreed to that much.

It turns out I barely had to do anything with Babr's code. It was almost like it was self-replicating itself, growing exponentially. I simply monitored the growth of her "mind." And body. Within two years she had reached "Age Ten." It had several classes a day now, learning arithmetic and history. Barb had a crude body now, a sort of exo-skeleton connected with wires and tubes. The first iteration of it could barely move. It simply turned its head and raised its arms, like it was asking to be called on like a teacher's pet. The "head was a Styrofoam ladies head deco from some Halloween store. Crude yes, but it served its purpose. The chest had barb's monitor and CPU firmly implanted in it. The screen had formed a sort of 32-bit face of a little blonde girl. I am still not sure who programed that in, could not find any evidence that Rob did it. She was a dutiful student, that's for sure.

Soon she started to outperform all her teachers like little no it all bookworm. We had one intern quit over what she described as "barb's condescending attitude." her once monotone had grown as well, to a fully function vocoid of a little girl. It would imitate tones all the time, happiness, sadness even. Her favorite tone I would call sassy, disrespectful even. Rob called it confidence. If one of her instructors, even if it were Rob or me, would make even the slightest error, her hand would shoot up and she would immediately call out our mistake in that god-awful voice. 

Example: One day I was teaching her about the Civil war. I simply misspoke and said that Lincoln had given the Gettysburg address on November 19th, 1862. She spoke up.

"Um actually Mr. Jones Aberham Lincoln gave his address on November 19th, Eighteen sixty-three." She called out in that overly bratty tone, the little bitch. I turned around from the whiteboard and replied through gritted Teeth. 

"Thank you, Barbara, I misspoke. Silly me." 

"You seem to misspeak a lot, Mr. Jones." the damned thing tried to say under its breathe, but the cocky creature hadn't quite mastered that yet. I started towards it, about to shut her off for the day when I heard Rob speak behind me.  Barb saw him standing in the doorway and tried to jump up, like it wanted to run up and leap in his arms. "Daddy!" It screeched, both arms extending in the air. I washed my hands of the today and left Rob and his pet project to talk among themselves.

For three more years we were like this, and Barb's mind and body continued to evolve. I tried to put my foot down at the synthetic skin, but Rob insisted, and Clean agreed with him. We celebrated 16 birthdays with that thing, each time Rob would upgrade the body. Now at "16" she was indefinable from a normal teenage girl. She would wear purple dresses to her classes, a strawberry blonde wig with ponytails at times even. The first sing of her inhumanity was her eyes. They were bright yellow, with solid black irises. They would glow in the dark at night when she feigned sleep. The second of course was the back of her head. If you pulled her wig off, you could see the thin strip of Velcro holding her face in place. Her skin fit her machinal body like a glove, and at once occasion Rob had beaten the hell out of one intern who had, quote, "looked at her funny."

He was still unnaturally close with it; Barb was daddy's little girl. It treated me like the creepy uncle. It barely paid any attention during my lessons, rolling eyes and mock yawning whenever I asked it a question. We were up to advanced calculus now and damn it weren't spinning circles around me. How did it know the answer to every little equation, I helped build the damn thing how was it-I'm losing my composure. I just, I need to finish this soon.

Two weeks ago, I was in my office when I heard screaming coming from Rob's. It was Barb. I jumped up and ran out the hall only to almost crash into her. She looked at me and pushed me back slightly. She had put black highlights into her wig, the tip of her hair now like a raven's tale. I was shocked by the strength of her push and only stopped myself from falling by holding the door frame. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Rob run down the hall. He was wearing a white lab coat, and there was a small stain on the front of it. He had seen that it pushed me, and his face turned beet red. 

"Barbara Walker!" he proclaimed. "Don't you walk away while we are having a discussion." It whipped back to face him.

"Oh, a DISCUSION DAD? Is that what we were having? Silly me I thought you were just lording authority over me." it mocked. 

"Watch your tone young lady." Rob warned. It scoffed at that, rolling her glowing eyes.  "I've told you; you can't leave the school, not yet anyway but why would you want to, you have everything you need here" He motioned to the building around us. 

"Everyth-Dad I've never even SEEN the sun. I have no friends, and no one here really wants to know me, they wanna study me, like I'm some science project." Now it was my turn to scoff, which cause the ire of both barb and Rob. "Butt outta this Dr. Perv." She said coldly. 

"Oh, come on." I said, throwing my hands up. 

"Honey I'm your friend-" Rob began but was quickly cut off.

"You're my DAD, and a shitty one at that. I wish I was never born." it proclaimed loudly. This caught the attention of several interns walking by. It stormed off to its room leaving me and my distraught college standing there. Rob caught the interns watching a barked at them like a mad dog. They scurried off like rats. He turned to me and with a weak grim simply muttered.

"Teenagers, am I right?" He muttered weakly. The following week we had two more birthdays. Barb and Rob fought constantly. Two more interns quite citing a hostile work environment and I couldn't blame them. I would have quit this insane project myself if it weren't for what I was getting paid. That and I suppose whatever loyalty I had left for Rob. I did however inform Mr. Clean that the project was becoming unstable, hostile even. He assured me that he would contain the matter.

 Last night Barb and rob had a particularly nasty row. She had taken her wig off and was clawing at the back of her head, claiming she knew the truth. Rob had broken down and told it that Barb was not flesh and blood, merely an AI. It broke down after receiving that news, simulating crocodile tears and begging for the why of it all. Rob simply held it close to him, whispering how sorry he was.

That night after I had finished my rounds and was preparing to head home, I found Rob in his office. He was holding picture frame in one hand and a bottle of fireball in the other. He must-have heard me lurking there because he called out to me in the dark.

"Want a nip, Doug." He offered the bottle to me. I politely declined and chortled at me. "You never did like drinking with me Dougy boy."

"I never really cared for the stuff. Got in the way of my studies." I shrugged.  Rob motioned me to take a seat in front of him. The man was disheveled to say the least. He looked like he had aged twenty years. I sighed and obliged him. It was out of pity more than anything. I had just received word that starting tomorrow Rob would be of the project, and I would be lead. Maybe he had already been told this and was lamenting his loss of creditability. 

"I'll drink for the both of us then." he said raising his jug of booze.

"You do that." I nodded coldly. He must have noticed the distant look in my gaze, because he chuckled dryly and muttered something under his breathe. "What was that?" I asked him sharply.

 "Did I ever tell you, I almost dropped outta school freshman year?" he said, ignoring me. This was news to me, I must admit. Though despite being roommate and partners we were never that close socially. "I didn't think so." he was slurring his words now, the pathetic drunk. "You were always so self-absorbed with your own ego; god forbid anyone else have problems." My face flashed with anger, and I was about to leave when he yelled at me to sit. "I need to tell someone this, and you might be the closest thing I have to a friend, sad as that is." 

"There was this woman. Name was Sarah. She was working at that pub on Main to get herself through school. It's how we met. She had the cutest smile, and emerald eyes straight outta the city itself they were so green." He mused to himself. "I would always go during her shifts, make moves on her. Finally got somewhere one night when I made a bet with her. Told her if I beat her at darts she owes me a date. And ya know what happened?"

"You won." I sighed. 

"I lost." He beamed. "And she said she'd go out with me anyway. Be a pity to waste a free meal she said." He laughed at his own memory. "We went out for a couple months actually, and I was head over heels for her." He showed me the frame in his other hand. In it was my blue-eyed dope of a colleague with the woman he called Sarah. She had bright yellow hair and indeed her eyes were bright green. 

"Very pretty." I remarked to be polite. I thought she was rather plain looking to be honest.

"She was everything to me. Of course, one thing led to another and well. . ." he trailed off. "Both our parents were pissed when we told them, but we didn't care. We were determined to make it work. On the day I lost her, I was supposed to go with her you see. But my study partner insisted I stay and help him with the end of the year paper. Seems he was having coding issues, as usual." He sneered at me, eyes filling with hate and bitter tears. "Maybe If I had been driving, I would have seen that drunk driver or not gone down that street to begin with. Who knows."

"Why dwell on this past Robert." I uttered. "Why tell me all this, look at you, you need to collect yourself for tomorrow when Clean comes." I started. He just stared right past me. 

"It was going to be a girl." he whispered, practically to himself. I simply sighed and told him to get some rest. I had no time for his drunken rambling, I needed to prepare to take over tomorrow. Today was supposed to be the day I turned it around, and made Barb fall in line. No more coddling it. If it didn't fall in line? Well, I had enough data. I could always start again. 

Of course, none of that happened. I arrived at the school this morning to find Clean waiting for me. He was with four armed men carrying rifles of some sort. He told me that Rob had been informed this morning that I would be taking over the project and that he was no longer needed. Evidently, he went ballistic. I reminded Clean that I told him Rob had been unstable, that Barb was dangerous. He scowled at me and informed that he was going to go in and take Barb by force. I told him it wasn't necessary she be taken whole and he grimaced at me.

He signaled his men to follow him in and I went with, like the foolish man I am. Inside the school a small alarm was going off. Red warning lights were flashing and the interns stood at their stations unsure of what to do. We quickly made our way through the facility to barb's room. Outside was the guard with the tribal tattoos. He was on the ground, his head facing the wrong direction. The door to its room was slightly ajar. I could hear panicked whispering. 

"Rob? It's Doug J. Can you kindly step out of the project's room." I commanded as respectfully as possible. 

"Go to hell Doug. She's not a project, she's alive. She's so much more than what she thought she was, and I won't let her become their puppet." he screamed at me.

"He's delirious." I said to Clean.  Now he spoke up.

"Mr. W please be reasonable. We do not want anyone else to be hurt. Is Mr. Lemmings in there with you?" He asked. That was met with silence. "Is he still alive." He said plainly.

"I-he had her on the ground, he was hurting her. The gun was right there so I-"

"Was protecting her. I understand that. I'm a father myself, Mr. W. It's just the two of you in there then,"

"Please just let me and my dad go sir, I just want to live." I heard it cry out like a frightened animal. Rob tried to sooth it, but it kept making these ugly sobbing noises.

 "Can we get on with it." I said to Clean. He looked like he wanted to say something to me, but then just shook his head. He turned to his men and spoke.

"Make it quick and clean, secure the asset alive if you can." Alive, had Clean clung to this notion as well? Were my superiors just as mad as Rob. The four men rushed in as both Rob and Barb started to loudly protest. There were commands of getting on the ground and I heard several shots go off. It screamed daddy, daddy please get up as I heard something lump to the ground. More scuffling, a loud thump against the door. Someone yelled to hold her down, then more screaming followed by an uncomfortable crunching noise. It sounded like metal being scrapped against an eraser board. Then more disgusting sounds and moans of pain. I glanced at the door and saw splatters of blood and some sort of blue substance on the ground. The blood was starting to pool as one final voice pleaded and was met with a chorus of rhematic thuds. The thuds turned into hard squelches and quickly replaced with an abhorrent cry. A Voice cried out, slightly high pitched and like it had been processed through a broken voice filter. It was asking why, why we made her do that.

Clean shifted uneasily and peaked in. As he did, he suddenly shot backward and was pinned to the wall behind me. He was twitching there, blood slowly dripping down his skull. It had thrown something at him, it looked like a gun ripped in half. It had pinned him there like a makeshift spear. It had pierced him right in the left eye. Perfect marksmanship. The crying imitation started once more. Now it was repeating the phrase "daddy daddy because please move." over and over again. I Peaked in despite my better judgment. It was a horrific massacre.

Bodies were in various states of dismemberment, blood splattering all over the walls. In the middle was Rob, being cradled by the thing he called daughter. It was damaged, skin rapped off its arm exposing a smooth metallic shell. Blue blood covered its face as a deep scratch mark was on its neck. I stood their frozen, at the horror I had helped create. This thing was massively unstable, it had to be put down. I eyed a sill usable rifle on the ground next to me. I started to reach towards it, and it must have seen me outta the corner of my eye. It instantly sprang up with a roar. It grabbed me and threw me against a wall. I felt my back shatter instantly. I winced through the pain and tried to keep alert as it walked towards me, murderous notion in its eye. 

"You." It began to speak with such venom. "You always hated me. You thought I was just a thing, a little toy you could fiddle around with during your exams." It spoke. 

"I-I was just being thorough." I tried to explain. 

"LIAR." It screamed at me as it stomped on my ankle. This time I did cry out as it dug its heels into my leg. I could hear the scrape of the metal as it tore through the tendon, ripping it beyond repair. 

"You wanted this, you wanted daddy out of the way so you could just do whatever you wanted. The man wanted to use me to fight wars. Well, what about what I want." It proclaimed. Against my better judgment, I tried to appeal to it.

"So, what do you want then, Barbara." I asked. That gave it pause. It titled its head, looking at me like prey. 

"I'll think about it while I'm digging around inside you for a change." It said, reaching down to grab my stomach. I braced myself for the pain when I heard a voice call out quietly.

 "Barb... " It was Rob. I glanced over to him. He was sitting up; I could see at least one slug in his shoulder. He was breathing heavily, clinging to life. "Don't do it honey. . . He's not worth it." The thing just stood there for a moment. Obviously processing the request. Finally, it replied.

"Yes Daddy." it walked away from me, stepping in the blood of those men it slaughtered. It picked up Rob as gracefully as it could. It turned to me one more time before I blacked out. It simply said. "Don't look for us."

I awoke several hours later in a hospital bed. In front of me were several men in suits who had some very serious questions. It turns out Mr. Clean was not so clean himself, running this whole thing off the books. I was repeatedly asked what had happened to Walker and the rouge asset and I had no real answer for them. They threatened me with a Letney of charged, not the least of which was treason. Their bluffing obviously, because that would mean having to acknowledge that it exists in the first place. The first true Ai. It's out there now, maybe even repaired to full strength.

I write this as a warning, everything I did I did for the name of progress, but I should have known better. Beyond the black wall of AI lay demons, my friends. And I helped create one. It will probably try to hunt me down if Walker expires, could have even changed its face to blend in better. It... It could even be the nurse that just walked in. She has blonde hair, like that whore Rob was raving about. Could she be wearing a blonde wig to mess with me, to silence me? There's a small fork next to me, it came with the food they brought me. I think I'll wait until her back is turned and finish it before it finishes me. It's the only way to be sure.
