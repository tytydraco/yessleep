I know how this sounds. Your dead fiancee is contacting you.... not over a oujia board or a spirit box... but Amazon?! C'mon now!

Please, just hear me out. I don't know who I could turn to in my real life relationships. 

It all started almost a week ago. It was about 10:30 at night that Monday and I was just getting into bed. 

While I'm absolutely exhausted, sleep has been hard to find since the tragedy. Instead of even trying to rest, I decided to look on Amazon for Rook (our huskey) a new dog bed. 

As I opened the app, I noticed there were 3 items in my cart. I do not remember placing a single item in my cart, much less 3. 

Curious, I clicked on the icon to view what was in it. 

I blinked a few times as the screen loaded the images. 

The first item was a Pittsburgh Steelers Jersey, the second was a stuffy in the shape of a "male factor" and the last was a sexy nurse outfit. 

I was in shock. This was too freaky... too familiar!

Again, I understand you are still confused. 

Now, with some back story, I can explain.

My fiancee (Mitch) and I were high school sweethearts. After college, we made two big decisions: to move in together and to share an Amazon account.  Both turned out to be some of the best decisions of my life. 

Living together was magical. Mitch started adding things to our cart on our joint Amazon account that he wanted for our home. I'd go into the app, see multiple items he was ready for me to look at and purchase if I, too, approved.

That's how our "Amazon Game" started. Mitch would not only add wishlist type of items, but also some hilariously ridiculous stuff I didn't even know existed. Along with "sexy fun" things for us to possibly enjoy.

This was a constant in our relationship. I'd get all excited to check out our Amazon cart to see what craziness he had left for me almost daily. 

Just over a year ago, I came home after a long day of work to, what I thought, was an empty house. I had just sat on the couch when my phone went off. I checked to see a text from Mitch: Have you checked the cart lately? 

I felt myself grinning as I quickly went to open the app, wondering what on Earth he had put in there. There was only one item in the cart. I clicked the icon to see a banner with the words "Will You Marry Me?" 

As I stared at my screen in shock and confusion, I could hear commotion behind me. I turned to see Mitch on one knee and holding a small box containing the most gorgeous ring I had ever laid eyes on. 
It was the most perfect proposal I could have ever imagined. 

Now, hopefully, you understand how significant this "game" of ours was to us. 

Back to present time and the 3 items that mysteriously appeared in my cart.

Pittsburgh Steelers were Mitch's favorite football team. The stuffed "male factor" is one of those crazy items he'd put in there to make me laugh and the costume would be one of his "sexy fun" suggestions. 

Normally, I'd be overjoyed with these items. But, as I've mentioned, Mitch is dead. 

I lost him... I lost my everything almost 3 months ago. In what was explained as a tragic accident. While it was very much tragic, I also found it incredibly suspicious. 

Mitch and I rarely ever argued but there was one topic.... or person, rather, that was a sore spot for us. His "best friend" Sammy.

I tried so hard to like Sammy. He and Mitch had been best friends since pre-k. While he ended up going to a different high school than us, he still was very much around in all our weekend hang outs. 

I found him to be loud, obnoxious and arrogant. After high school though he got so much worse. 

He got into gambling, drugs, cheating scandals, you name it.

This would lead to him showing up at our door, begging Mitch for a place to crash for a few days to which Mitch would allow. Sammy would take over our living room and eat all our food for days until finally begging Mitch for money (again, Mitch would give in) and then disappear until the next time he needed something. 

The last day I would wake up with Mitch beside me would start with another demanding text from Sammy after weeks of silence. He wanted to buy a vehicle from someone off of Facebook Marketplace and basically told Mitch to give him a ride to meet this guy and look over the car.

I had had it. I flat out told Mitch absolutely not. I knew what Sammy had planned. To get Mitch there then guilt him into paying for some or all of the cost of this probably junky car. 

Mitch and I argued. I told him we had a wedding to plan and pay for, that we could not keep funding his friend's way of life. Mitch said he was only going to give his "best bro" a ride. I had to work that evening and we didn't exactly separate on the best terms. 

I was angry. I told him I loved him but didn't know how we could move forward if he could not start considering me when it came to his "best bro". I pecked him on the mouth and left. If only I had known what was coming....

Work was busy that evening (I work as a nurse at our local hospital) and barely got to check my phone. 


When I finally was able to check my phone, I was surprised at the number of texts and missed calls. 

Mitch: I'm sorry baby. You are right. I will give Sammy a ride this evening but this is it. No more after this.

Mitch: I love you. I'm headed to pick up Sammy. 

Mitch: You okay? 

**Missed call from Mitch**

Mitch: Honey, can you please call me???

**Missed call from Mitch**

Mitch: You were right again. 
Mitch: I think Sammy has lost it.

I remember the knot in my stomach that grew in that very moment as I began to call Mitch repeatedly and it going straight to voice-mail every time. 

Something was wrong and I could feel it. I ran to my supervisor and told her I had to leave. 

Me: Where are you??  I have left work and coming to get you

I called multiple times with the phone still going to voice-mail and no return texts from Mitch. 

I drove to our home to see he still had not returned. The acid was building from the pit of my stomach into my chest and throat. 

As yet another call to Mitch went to voice-mail, I hung up and went to my contact list. I clicked the name "Idiot" and hit the phone icon. 

Sammy answered quickly. 

Sammy: Kyra! I was just about to call you! Have you heard from Mitch?!

Me: No! Where is he, Sammy?! What did you do to him?

Sammy: I didn't do anything! We got into an argument and he drove off pissed and I can't get ahold of him. 

Me: You what?!!! What did you fight about?? Where did he go??
Sammy: Look, it's too much to explain over the phone! Can you meet me at the diner and I can tell you everything. I'll go with you to look for him!

I angerly agreed to meet Sammy. When we arrived, I started asking questions and demanding answers. 

Sammy explained they went to look at the car and on the way there Mitch was cold towards him. Sammy started asking what his problem was and Mitch told him he was done doing stuff like this for him after this. An argument started. They went back and forth until they were close to the house of the person with the car. 

Sammy told me that he demanded that Mitch pulled over and let him walk the rest of the way. Mitch obliged and sped off. That was the last he had seen or heard from Mitch. 

I started crying. I told Sammy I was calling the law when what had to be my 200th call to Mitch went to voice-mail. Sammy was reluctant and said that wasn't necessary and he was sure he would show up once he calmed down. 

But I knew Mitch and he would never ever let me worry like this. 

I did not tell Sammy about the calls and texts I had received from Mitch. I could feel that Sammy wasn't telling me everything and I didn't trust him. 

I called the cops and after sobbing, explaining everything and begging on the phone, they agreed to send a couple of cops out to take a statement and go from there. 

Mitch's car was found around 10:00pm that night. A cop that felt sorry for me was riding around town looking and ended up going down one of the very vacant backroads. He noticed skid marks leading off the road. That's when he discovered Mitch's car over the bank... and Mitch in it. 

I'll never forget that call or when I arrived on scene. 

They said he probably swerved to avoid hitting an animal and it ended in disaster. 

After further investigation, they found Mitch had his wallet on him but his debit card was missing and there wasn't any cash. Sammy then admitted the car he was driving was purchased from the guy they were heading to see. He claimed Mitch gave him cash for the car then loaned his debit card to him for gas before speeding off after their fight. 

I told the cops the very story Sammy relayed to me. How he never mentioned Mitch giving him cash or his card. I also mentioned that Mitch absolutely hated the road where they had found him. He had been in a traumatic accident on that road before when he was a child and his mother was drunk driving with him in the car. He never even liked to speak of that road, much less drive on it! 

I told them there had to be more to this story. I begged them to look into Sammy. I showed them the text messages. 

They did bring Sammy in for questioning but said his story stayed the same. 

Mitch's phone was found badly damaged in his car. Something else I found very strange. The cops kept it as "evidence" but I never received any updates on if anything was recovered. Even after repeatedly calling and asking. 

Mitch's death was dismissed as a total accident.

The cop that found Mitch is the only one who seemed to care at all and promised to keep me updated. But has since went silent. 

My life has been dark since that night. My family has been checking on me often. They are who finally got me to return to work to get me out of the house. 

Sammy seemed to care until after the funeral. He has never contacted to check in since. He's living his life while mine is in shambles.

This all brings us back to the mysterious items that appeared in my cart. As strange as it was, I deleted the items and have done my best to not think of it. 

Until this morning. I woke up, made coffee and fed Rook. I laid back down and went to my Amazon to check on the status of Rook's new bed to see 3 more items in my cart. 

I felt my heart drop again. My palms grew sweaty and every hair on my body stood up. 

My finger lingered over the cart icon. Did I dare to look? And many other questions flooded my brain. 

After what felt like an hour, I clicked the cart.

The items loaded on the screen. The sexy nurse costume and stuffed "male factor" were back but the third item was different.

This item was a book. Now I felt more curious than anything and wasted no time clicking on the book to read the description.

The Description: Kacie Landon has been struggling since the sudden death of her newly-wed husband. Everyone tells her it was a horrible tragedy she has to accept and move on from. Kacie feels it's much more than that. She begins the journey into investigating the loss of her lover and ends up finding out more than she ever dreamt to discover. Her husband was murdered and all signs are pointing to someone close to both of them. 

I'm now left with two questions.

Am I crazy? And
What are you trying to tell me, Mitch?
