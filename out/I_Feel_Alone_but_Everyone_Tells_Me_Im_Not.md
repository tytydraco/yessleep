My name is Harvey… but I don't know for how long. But It's mine and something I cling to these days as proof that I remain unchanged... human. Everyone around me seems different now, despite their constant insistence that it's all in my head. Something changed one day, and somehow didn't. You might think I'm going crazy from the pills I was taking, yet I stopped those a while ago. They didn't help my problem—they only made it worse.

It started with two things I couldn't ignore. My neighbor Tom would water his lawn at exactly 7:43 every morning, his movements following the same arc, down to the precise bend of his wrist. I timed it for a week straight—not a second's difference. The barista at my local coffee shop, Sarah, began drawing identical patterns in every latte—perfect spirals that never varied, each loop precisely matching the one from the day before. I even took photos to compare them. These were little things, easy to dismiss... until they weren't.

Watching my neighbors and coworkers became like observing people rehearsing how to be themselves. Their gestures and speech carry a touch too much deliberation, like actors perfecting roles they don't quite understand. The wrongness of it makes my skin crawl, but who can I tell when everyone around me has become a perfect replica of themselves?

Then came the dreams—no, nightmares. Even that word fails to capture their weight. They began last month, and now, whenever I close my eyes for more than a minute, my body betrays me. It's as if someone flips a switch, and I'm out. Even when I fight to stay awake, my consciousness slips away the moment my eyelids drop. I jerk awake, drenched in sweat, the sheets twisted around me like restraints.

Tonight was no different. I forced myself to stay awake, but it didn't matter. When I opened my eyes, I found myself back on that train, the 8:43 to downtown. The familiar unease crept in as I looked around at my fellow passengers—some reading news, others absorbed in their phones, a few waiting listlessly for their stops.

Until it started.

A sound erupted—a scream, visceral and raw, echoing through the train's walls. It was agonizing and distorted, like nails scraping across a blackboard but emanating from human mouths. The passengers collapsed in unison, their screams matching the first. Bodies jerked and slumped, limbs moving like tangled puppets on invisible strings. The lights flickered and died. In the darkness, I could hear them: wet sliding noises and stiff, unnatural creaks that shouldn't come from human joints. The sounds were rhythmic, precise... like an assembly line at work.

When the lights returned, they were back in their seats, perfectly still. Their heads snapped upright with a sound like splintering wood, eyes facing forward... until they turned.

Their eyes. God, their eyes.

Each iris held a tinge of gold and red, like a solar eclipse painted on flesh. They didn't blink. They didn't move. Their heads remained perfectly still as their eyes tracked me. A woman three seats ahead had her arm bent backward at an impossible angle. It hung there until it snapped into place with a stiff, awful crack.

I woke up gasping, but the horror clung to me. Their eyes followed me into the waking world. I began seeing flashes of them—golden-red rings—in reflections, in mirrors, windows, even in the blank screen of my phone. Always watching, always present, just for a moment before vanishing.

I went to Dr. Lyra because I had nowhere else to turn. Simple tasks had become mountains. I couldn't function. She diagnosed it as stress and prescribed pills that made the world blur around the edges. The first dose hit me like a wave of static—not just in my vision, but deep in my skull. Colors bled together, sounds became muffled, and my thoughts felt like they were being pressed through cotton. Reality itself seemed smudged, painted over with something more... perfect.

When I stopped taking them, I thought it was over. But the world sharpened—too much. Colors became richer, sounds crisper—everything carried a weight that felt unnatural. My teeth buzzed with every sound, and my skin prickled as if electricity was running just beneath it. Beneath it all, I started hearing things: soft stiff creaks when people moved, the faint click-click of pupils adjusting to light.

During my last appointment, Dr. Lyra's face lingered too long in a smile, as though she'd forgotten to stop.

"How are the pills working, Harvey?" she asked, her tone breezy but flat. Her voice echoed strangely in the room, hollow like a metal chamber.

When I told her I wasn't taking them anymore, her expression froze. Everything stopped—not just her face, but the room itself. For a fraction of a second, I swear I saw her flicker, like a TV losing signal. Then she resumed, too quickly. Her voice piled on top of itself as her smile stretched wider than humanly possible.

"That's... great news. Wonderful progress. But I think you should keep taking them—just a little longer. For safety."

Her hands trembled as she shoved another bottle into my hands, and I saw something... moving beneath her skin, as if her veins were alive and rearranging themselves.

I should have listened, but I didn't.

That's when I started noticing changes everywhere. The old corner store, once grimy and cluttered, gleamed with impossible cleanliness. The cashier, Mrs. Chen—always so grumpy and loud—stood behind the counter wearing an empty smile. Her head tilted exactly fifteen degrees as she rang up my items.

Then I saw the cat.

It sat by the road, perfectly still. Too still. It was Mr. Peterson's old tomcat - I recognized the notched ear and gray patches from all the times I'd seen him prowling the neighborhood. But something was wrong. His usually matted fur, earned from years of street fights and adventures, was impossibly pristine. The scars and patches that had given his face character were gone, smoothed away like they'd never existed. When I approached, reaching out despite my instincts, his fur felt... wrong. Too perfect. Even the roughness from that time he'd gotten into a fight with a raccoon had vanished, replaced by fur so uniform it might have been manufactured.

His head turned in sharp, stiff increments, click-click-click. And his eyes... those golden-red rings. Like camera shutters adjusting their focus. They were still his eyes, the same green I'd known for years, but now they held something else, something that had erased every mark of the scrappy alley cat he'd once been. My breath caught, and the cat bolted, its movements precise and segmented, like each muscle had been calibrated to perfection.

I ran home and haven't left since. From my window, I watch, and I see it all. My neighbors' movements are too synchronized, their routines perfect. Mrs. Peterson waters her flowers at exactly 9:17 AM. Children play jump rope in flawless rhythm. Even their laughter stops and starts at precise intervals, as if on cue.

Whatever is happening, I need to figure it out before it gets to me. Am I going crazy? Am I being paranoid? The logical part of my brain screams that none of this is possible, but I've seen too much to trust logic anymore.

A knock at my door broke through my thoughts. Three precise taps, evenly spaced. Peering carefully from the corner of my window, relief washed over me as I recognized the visitors. My parents stood on the porch, wearing worried expressions that didn't quite reach their eyes. Of course—I hadn't been making my usual calls. I let them in, and they slipped into their roles: mother nagging about my self-care, father heading to the kitchen with bags they'd brought.

My mom switched to that gentle voice she'd always used when I was upset. Maybe this was what I needed after my self-imposed isolation. Maybe it was all just in my head. After all, I couldn't be wrong about my own parents. I felt warmth emanating from her as she held my hands, though something about her touch felt... odd. Her skin was too smooth, like warm plastic, but I dismissed it as she may have been too worried about me.

My dad was laughing in the kitchen, joking about what I'd been doing all this time. I finally felt relaxed, experiencing peace I hadn't known in weeks. Mom let me doze in her lap, just like when I was small. Her hand stroked my hair in perfect, metronomic motions, just like when I was a kid.

Then dad came in and saw me half-asleep. He went to the cabinet and retrieved something. Through my drowsy haze, I saw mom's smile shift, becoming more like Dr. Lyra's, more like Mrs. Chen's, more like the cat's mechanical grin before it ran off. She held my head still as dad pressed that familiar pill to my lips.

With my last bit of strength, I grabbed my mother's arm - a desperate act of defiance. That's when I felt it. The scar on her palm, the one she got years ago catching a falling knife meant for me, was gone. The rough, jagged line I'd traced a thousand times as a child had vanished, replaced by impossibly smooth skin. It was still her hand, still had every line and freckle I remembered, but it was like someone had erased the imperfections, smoothed away the history written in her flesh.

"Just take your medicine, dear," she whispered, her voice harmonizing with mechanical undertones. "Everything will be clearer once you stop fighting it."

As darkness began to take hold, I heard snippets of their conversation, but the voices... no... it couldn't be.

"Why are we still keeping this one?" My mother's voice had lost all warmth, becoming clinical and detached, layered with whirring sounds.

"Mhmm, an experiment more or less," my father's voice replied, but the familiar deep tone held none of its usual affection. "The longest-lasting subject yet. Fascinating how he senses something's wrong but can't quite grasp what."

Before my vision finally dimmed, I saw her face above me, frozen in that too-wide smile. Her eyes rotated—those golden-red rings locking onto me.

I try to fight the darkness, but I know it's too late. It always was.
