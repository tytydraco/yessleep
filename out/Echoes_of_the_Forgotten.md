I never believed in ghosts. Not until that fateful night when I stumbled upon the abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. The moon hung low in the sky, casting long shadows that seemed to dance with a life of their own. Despite the warnings from locals, my curiosity got the best of me. I had to explore.

As I stepped through the rusted gates, a chill crept down my spine. The asylum loomed before me, its windows shattered, and its walls covered in ivy as if nature itself was reclaiming it. The air was thick with a sense of foreboding, but I pressed on, my footsteps echoing against the decaying concrete.

Inside, the darkness was suffocating, swallowing every ray of moonlight that dared to penetrate its depths. I fumbled for my flashlight, its weak beam casting eerie shadows along the narrow corridors. Each step sent shivers down my spine, as if unseen eyes watched my every move.

I wandered deeper into the asylum, the silence broken only by the sound of my own breathing. Strange graffiti adorned the walls, crude drawings of faces twisted in agony. The air was heavy with the scent of mildew and decay, making it hard to breathe.

Suddenly, a noise echoed from the darkness—a low, guttural moan that sent a shiver down my spine. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. I told myself it was just the wind, but deep down, I knew it was something more.

I pressed on, my flashlight trembling in my hand. Every creak of the floorboards sent a jolt of fear through my veins. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, that unseen eyes followed my every move.

Then, I saw it—a flicker of movement in the shadows. My breath caught in my throat as a figure emerged from the darkness. It was hunched and twisted, its features obscured by the shadows. It shuffled toward me, its movements jerky and unnatural.

I wanted to run, to flee from whatever horror lurked in the asylum's depths. But my feet were rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear. The figure drew closer, its breath rasping in its throat.

And then, it spoke—a whisper so faint, I could barely hear it. "Help me," it pleaded, its voice filled with agony and despair. I wanted to turn and run, to escape from whatever nightmare I had stumbled into. But something held me back, a curiosity that bordered on obsession.

I followed the figure deeper into the asylum, each step bringing me closer to the heart of darkness. The corridors twisted and turned, leading me further into the labyrinthine maze. I had lost all sense of time, all sense of direction. All that mattered was uncovering the truth behind the asylum's dark past.

Finally, we reached a door—a heavy metal barrier that seemed to bar entry to whatever lay beyond. The figure turned to me, its eyes pleading for mercy.

"Please," it whispered, its voice barely audible over the pounding of my heart. "Free us from this prison."

I reached out, my hand trembling as I grasped the handle. With a creak of protest, the door swung open, revealing a sight that would haunt me for the rest of my days.

The room beyond was filled with cages—rows upon rows of them, each containing a figure trapped in its confines. Some were twisted and deformed, their bodies contorted by years of confinement. Others were little more than husks, their eyes vacant and lifeless.

I stumbled back, horror coursing through my veins. This wasn't just an asylum—it was a prison, a place where the forgotten were left to rot away in darkness.

And then, I heard it—the sound of laughter echoing through the halls. It was cruel and mocking, filled with a malice that chilled me to the bone.

I turned to flee, to escape from this nightmare once and for all. But as I ran, the laughter followed me, echoing in my ears long after I had left the asylum behind.

I never returned to that place again. But even now, I can still hear the echoes of the forgotten, their voices whispering in the darkness, a constant reminder of the horrors that lurk just beyond the edge of our reality.
