That damn insomnia… It had been tormenting me for almost half a year. No matter how tired I was, I could barely fall asleep: just tossing and turning, suffering through the entire night, no matter what I tried. Lately, I’d gotten into the habit of watching videos, streams, or movies until, finally, after much struggle, sleep would claim me. I’d especially gotten hooked on Twitch; I had a few regular streamers I liked, ones who played games that interested me.



This night started the same way. I spent hours browsing, and by around three in the morning, I was still trying to decide what to watch. The insomnia had been especially brutal in recent days: I’d barely slept one or two hours a night for over a week.



Groggily, I scrolled through Twitch, trying to decide what would get me through another long night. That’s when one of the recommended live streams caught my eye — a young guy’s channel. He was just sitting in his chair, in front of his computer. Doing nothing, just staring at his desk. Zero viewers.

I felt sorry for him, he sat there so listlessly, staring into space. I thought I’d be nice and click in to see what he was doing.

The moment I joined, his eyes went wide as he glanced at his monitor.

  


“Oh my God, finally someone!” he shouted into the microphone.

  


I felt a little good about myself, knowing I’d made him that happy just by checking out his stream.

  


“Please, don’t leave! Wait!” he continued nervously. “You have to help me! I need to get out of here!”

  


I watched the stream with a frown. What kind of bullshit is this? He’s probably going to try to scam me out of money. Still, fine — I typed and asked what he wanted.

  


“Oh, thank God! Finally! Finally, a real person after all this time. I’m stuck in my room — you have to help me somehow!”

  


I just shook my head. The guy was a really good actor,  his pleading, hopeful face looked frighteningly genuine.

  


“How can I help?” I typed, curious.

  


“Well, I’m not exactly sure. But wait! Don’t go! I’ll think of something in a minute.”

  


The guy started rummaging around his room, as if looking for something. I saw a box fly from one end of the room to the other.

  


“Still there?” I typed, after he’d been digging through his stuff for minutes on end.

  


He rushed back to his computer the moment my message notification pinged.

  


“Yes! Yes, I’m here! Please, don’t go anywhere. I promise, I’ll figure it out in a minute. Uh… can you tell me what time it is where you are?”

  


I looked at him suspiciously. What the hell does he even want? What is this kid streaming? It was like he was deliberately stalling for time. But for what?



I couldn’t clearly see what he was doing — the camera was too far away. He just kept rummaging through his things, pretending to search for something.

  


“I think I’m gonna go,” I typed. I didn’t want to be rude — poor guy didn’t just have zero followers, he had no viewers besides me.

  


“Wait! Please, I promise I’m almost there. 03:39, that’s when you first messaged me, right?”

  


“Yes. It’s 03:43 now,” I replied.

  


The guy suddenly jumped right up to the camera, his face almost filling the entire screen. Hollow, tired features. Dark, sunken eyes. He looked like he hadn’t left that room in days.

  


“Please! My only wish is to have one follower. Please! You can unfollow me afterward, but just follow me for a single moment!”

  


I felt a little unsettled. The kid was seriously weird,  almost like he wasn’t all there. What the hell is wrong with him?



For a while, I just listened to him beg, saying that this was all he wanted, that it was his life’s dream and he desperately needed it.

Eventually, I gave in. What harm could it do to follow some random guy on Twitch? Worst case, I’d just unfollow later.

As soon as I hit “Follow,” the guy let out a scream.

  


“Yes! Finally! Fuck, finally!” he shouted in triumph. Then he swept everything off his desk — all the junk, his camera, and probably his computer too. “I’m sorry… but I’m finally free!” he yelled, practically coming apart at the seams.

  


I just stared in shock as he raged around the room. He was so happy he was almost destroying the place.

  


“Finally, for fuck’s sake! Freedom!” he roared.

  


Then, without warning, he slammed his door open and bolted out of the room.

That was the last thing I saw. The stream cut off. I just sat there, frozen, staring at my monitor. What the hell was that? Was the guy completely insane?



I shook my head. I’d be better off just watching some series tonight. I stood up from my chair. Maybe I’d even take a sleeping pill so I could actually get some rest.



Then I opened my own bedroom door — but there was no exit.

I froze in place. Behind the door, there was only a wall, as if it had been bricked up.



In the wall, there was a single message, scratched deep into the surface, surrounded by gouges where fingernails had dug in:

  


“Keep someone here in your place, if you want to get out.”

XOXO, Krevez.
