It was supposed to be a fun night with my friends, a sleepover filled with scary movies and ghost stories. But we made the mistake of using an ouija board, and that's when everything went wrong.

We gathered around the board, our hands lightly touching the planchette. At first, it was just a silly game, with the planchette moving randomly and spelling out gibberish. But then, something changed. The planchette began to move with purpose, spelling out words and phrases that sent chills down our spines.

We tried to stop the game, but it was too late. We had summoned something evil, and it had taken hold of the planchette. It began to speak to us, taunting us and promising us things we didn't want to hear.

One by one, my friends began to fall under the influence of the evil presence. Their eyes turned black and their bodies convulsed as the demon possessed them. I was the only one left, and I knew I had to get out of there.

I ran out of the house, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the demon laughing and mocking me as I fled. I didn't know where to go, so I just kept running until I reached the safety of my own home.

But I couldn't shake the feeling that the demon was still with me. I could hear its voice in my head, promising me things I couldn't even imagine. I knew I had to find a way to banish the demon, or it would consume me as well.

I spent months researching and studying, trying to find a way to exorcise the demon from my friends. But it was no use. They were lost, consumed by the evil that had taken hold of them.

I was the only one left, and I was all alone. The demon had taken everything from me, and I was left to live with the guilt and the horror of what had happened. I knew I would never be the same, and I would be haunted by the memories of that night for the rest of my life.

But at least I was still alive. I was the only survivor, and I had to live with that. I had to live with the knowledge that I was the only one left to tell the story of what happened at the sleepover with the ouija board. And I knew that no one would ever believe me.

That's why I'm posting this on r/nosleep, hoping that someone out there will read my story and understand the dangers of messing with the supernatural. I never thought it would happen to me, but it did. And I don't want anyone else to go through what I did.

Please, if you're reading this, don't use a ouija board. It's not a game, it's not a joke. It's real, and it's dangerous. Don't make the same mistake we did, or you might not be so luckyâ€¦
