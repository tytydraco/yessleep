“Okay, last question before we get started— is there anything you want to keep,” the interviewer pursed her lips, “off-limits?”

“What do you mean?” It was the wrong question. I understood the question. I just didn’t know why it would be necessary to ask. “I mean, we’re just talking about the orchestra, right?’

The interviewer shrugged one shoulder and smiled. With her elfin face and slight frame, the gesture came across as insouciant, a whimsical “who knows?”, but her eyes were shrewd. “The orchestra, yes, but also your life in general. Your experiences, how you got where you are, what it was like for you. The full picture.”

Nodding, I thought about it for a moment. I’d listened to a few episodes of First Chair before I ever agreed to come on the podcast, and they did go into some detail on the lives of the musicians they interviewed. The host, Claire, would recite an opening monologue describing the episode’s guest, including some biographical detail, before the introductions. The guest would add more detail of their own based on Claire’s questions, and each episode seemed to wrap up on a happy note. There were no “gotcha” questions, and any tragedy or hardship got just enough airtime to make the guest sufficiently sympathetic. So I shrugged back. “Nothing comes to mind.”

For a second, her brow creased, as if she had expected a different answer. Maybe her other guests were more sensitive. “Sure. Just promise you’ll let me know if we start heading in an uncomfortable direction at any point.”

The calluses on my hands rasped against my skirt as I ran my palms over the tops of my legs. “I promise.” It felt silly, like a schoolyard pinky swear. It also felt silly to be dressed up, wearing one of the silky skirts I wore for performances and events, when no one but Claire and her crew would see me. But it was just anxiety getting the better of me.

In an odd way, the anxiety was reassuring. Nerves put me on my a-game, and I wanted badly to get this right.

Finally, Claire nodded at a man in a hat and, at his thumb’s up, said, “All right then, let’s begin.”

She began by asking me to introduce myself to the audience. 

Swallowing, I smiled so it would be audible in my voice as I said, “I’m Amanda Kemp, and I’m first chair violin in the Riverside Orchestra.”

God, it still felt good to say that. I imagined it was how Ph.D. students felt when they introduced themselves as “doctor”, but with the queasy thrill of knowing that their honorific could be taken away at any time.

“That’s right,” Claire said, her bright-white teeth flashing in the lights of the recording studio. “Such an accomplishment, and such a treat for all of us who have had the privilege of attending one of your performances. Your solo last spring was just magical. I’m not ashamed to say it sent me down a massive internet rabbithole. I think within twenty-four hours of that show, I’d watched your senior performances from high school and college multiple times each.”

I laughed and ducked my head as I always did when people were impressed with me. “Well, that’s very kind of you. I’m surprised you could find them!” 

Claire waved a hand. “Oh, come on. You went to the Central Arkansas School for the Arts, not to mention the even more prestigious Brady Conservatory at Holden College. They both love to showcase their students. For anyone listening, we’ll put the links to those YouTube videos in the episode notes. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to provide the link for the incredible dress Ms. Kemp is wearing in the most recent one. Where did you get that, by the way?”

My senior showcase dress. It had indeed been a thing of beauty, and thinking about it made my throat ache a little. “That dress came from a consignment store two blocks from the Holden campus. I was saving up my money to move to the city after graduation, so I didn’t have much of a budget. My mentor, Dr. Patricia Barnes, actually paid for most of it. It was the nicest thing anyone had done for me in a long time, and at first, I didn’t want to let her. But she told me I could pay her back when I made it big. How sure she was that I would make it one day…that meant more to me than the dress, as lovely as it was.”

“Oh,” Claire cooed, “how precious! And did you?”

My smile tasted bittersweet. “I wish. Dr. Barnes actually left Holden not too long after that, and we lost touch. None of the other faculty was able to tell me anything about her new job or even what city she’d gone to— which, of course, makes total sense to me now! That would’ve been a huge breach of privacy. But I would’ve loved the chance to pay her back. I still would.”

“Well then,” Claire cut her eyes to the side, as if she were addressing a studio audience. “Dr. Barnes, if you’re listening, now’s your chance to come and collect!” 

“Seriously,” I added. “That dress is still in the back of my closet, and it’s had a hundred-dollar bill pinned to the garment bag for…well, since the orchestra hired me, so about five years now. If anyone listening knows Dr. Barnes, please tell her it’s all hers.”

Immediately after I said it, my cheeks burned. Why had I tacked that on? It sounded whiny and desperate even to my own ears. 

But evidently it didn’t sound that way to Claire, as her eyes softened with what looked like genuine empathy. “That’s unbelievably sweet, Amanda.”

Trying to smile my embarrassment away, I shifted in my chair. “Well, you know, I didn’t come from much. The odds that I would have the opportunities I’ve had are so slim. I guess it’s important to me to remember all the people who helped me along the way.”

“People like your mom and dad?” Claire asked, raising her eyebrows in encouragement. “I read the profile the paper ran on you last year, right after you were named first chair. You said they went above and beyond to help you in your career.”

I had said that, and they did, in their own way. “Absolutely. CASA is a boarding school, and I know it wasn’t easy sending me off. In fact, when I got accepted, they picked up their lives and moved so they could be closer to me. I really and truly can’t thank them enough for all that they did for me at that time in my life. Getting the Brady Conservatory scholarship was, frankly, the least I could do!” 

This was only partly true. My parents had moved to Green Point, an hour away from CASA, before I had even applied. Dad had been out of work for months back home, so when an opportunity arose halfway across the state, he jumped on it. The new job just happened to be close to the school I’d been fantasizing about for years, and after the move, I started finding the brochures they sent me on the counter instead of in the trash. Honestly, I couldn’t say if my parents truly supported my dream of being a professional musician or if it had just been convenient. On the one hand, my playing around the house had always annoyed them, and they didn’t miss an opportunity to tell me that music wasn’t a job; on the other, they did eventually come around to the idea of it, once they found out my school would be paid for. On a third, neutral hand, they had come to exactly one of my performances a year for the last five years. It could’ve been more, but it was something. And if that wasn’t our relationship in a nutshell…

Claire’s face creased in amusement at my joke, but she didn’t laugh. Instead, her face turned serious. “Interesting that you mention the move. That would’ve been around 2002, right?” 

“Right.” It almost came out like a question. Where was she going with this?

She waited a beat, like she expected me to say more. When I didn’t, she plucked at the hem of her blouse, seemingly unconscious of the way it must be jostling her lav mic. “What I mean to say is,” she began, stumbling a little for the first time, “did your family move because you got into CASA or because of the disappearances?”

My forehead scrunched and my lips pressed together, eyebrows and chin conspiring to meet in the middle of my face. I opened my mouth to speak, but all I could do was shake my head, not understanding.

“You know,” Claire said, making a clarifying sort of gesture with her hand, “in Albertville. Like I said, I read your profile, and it makes for quite the Cinderella story, coming from this rural, underserved town in Arkansas. I looked into in for this episode, just to get a little more context, and I read about those two children going missing right around the time you moved. I wasn’t sure if the two were related or if it was just a terribly sad coincidence. They would’ve been in your grade in school.”

Stupidly, all I could think to say was, “At Gaines Middle School?” 

“Yes!” She nodded, glad that I was seeming to get with the program. “Two children, both students at Gaines. They disappeared that summer. Do you…remember that? Maybe it was just after the move?” 

Running my tongue over my dry lower lip— had it always been cracked, or had I bitten the skin off without noticing?-- I asked, “What were their names?”

Claire opened her mouth, then gestured at a young guy in a hoodie. He brought over a basket containing her phone and mine; no phones in the studio. Except, apparently, right now. Claire reached in, plucked out her phone, and began swiping her thumb across the screen. A few taps later, she exhaled a little aha. “Here we go. Their names were Elizabeth Hughes and Mark Berger.”

The chair beneath me dissolved and I dropped for what felt like miles before I could feel the wood of it again, pressing against my calves, my thighs, my palms as I gripped the edge of the seat. “You said Elizabeth and Mark?”

“That’s right,” she said, a little distracted as she locked her phone again and handed it back off to the kid. Then she turned back to me, focused again. “Were they classmates of yours? If they went missing after you moved, maybe your parents just didn’t want to upset you. And middle-schoolers weren’t exactly on social media then the way they are now…” 

I think Claire gave a little half-hearted laugh, trying to lighten the mood that had taken a very sharp turn, but I barely heard it. No, we weren’t on social media then. That would’ve required a computer or a smartphone, and none of us could afford something like that.

Well, that wasn’t true. My family had an old Tandy that my parents had found at a garage sale. Turning on the monitor had always made my arm hairs stand on end. What we didn’t have was internet service. I think Mark’s family did, but he wasn’t much for sitting still, even to play video games. And Beth’s family…



“‘Beth Used’. That’s what he called me,” she said, sitting down hard at the base of the big tree we used as our landmark. Her legs were long, pale, and knobby, and as she drew them into herself, the sole of her left sneaker flapped loose at the heel. “‘Because everyone knows the Hughes kids can’t afford anything new.’”

“That’s stupid,” Mark declared. He kicked a rock, and it flew a few yards through the grass, landing with a thunk that underscored the finality of his words. “And Jeremy is stupid. Jeremy Golpin… I’ll tell him he can try golpin down my nutsack.”

Beth’s face was buried in her knees, but I could see her body shake with laughter. “That—,” she wheezed, “that’s so dumb.” She was right, but her voice, so sad and worn down just a moment before, was delighted. “You can’t tell him that.”

“I can!” He insisted. “Mandy, tell her I’ll do it. You know I will.”

“He will,” I called from my branch. It wasn’t high off the ground, but I was stretched out on it longways with my arms and legs dangling. I’d seen pictures of big cats lying like that in our science book and thought it looked comfortable. It wasn’t. I supposed it was different leaning your cheek against the bark when you had fur. “Remember when Rachel G. started wearing thongs and made fun of my underwear in the locker room?”

Beth’s nose wrinkled. “Yeah. Big whoop, nobody could see your butt crack through your gym shorts like hers.”

I pointed one of my dangling arms at her. “Exactly. She wanted to brag about her permanent wedgie, so Mark told everybody he saw her digging in her butt after dodgeball. Nobody would let her hand them anything for a week!” 

That got Beth laughing again, and me too. Mark just looked pleased with himself. “Well, she had butt hands! Nobody wanted her germs. And I know for a fact that all the guys picked on Greg for holding hands with her. I’ll bet that’s why he dumped her.”

Beth sobered a little at that. “That sucks. I mean, she was a jerk, but still.” Good old Beth. Slow to get angry, quick to feel embarrassed or ashamed, and even quicker to empathize. “He shouldn’t have done that.”

Mark just shrugged. “She’s mean. I bet she was mean to him too. Hey, maybe she and Jeremy should get together!”

“Ew,” I said, sitting up from my branch and dusting crumbs of bark off my face. “They both have weird, sticky-out teeth. Their babies would be ugly *and* mean.” 

Beth flashed me a grin, her teeth straight and perfect. One night, in the latest dregs of a sleepover, she’d told me she was glad she was born with good teeth, because it wasn’t like her parents could afford to get her braces. I knew it wasn’t really about her teeth, but I agreed anyway and told her that she was better off than I was. We couldn’t afford braces either, and I had a weird crooked tooth. She had giggled when I bared my teeth to show her my left incisor, which angled out like a kickstand, and told me it wasn’t even that noticeable. Still, she’d gone to sleep with a tiny smile on her face.

I figured that sometimes you just need to feel like you’re not the worst off. It helped to feel better than somebody, even for a second. I couldn’t change the fundamentals of Beth’s life— too little money for too many kids, all running around a cluster of mobile homes not even big enough to call a trailer park. But I could let her feel like she had one up on me. She needed that. We all did sometimes.

“Probably,” Mark said, elbow-deep in his backpack, “Anyway, I just remembered— do y’all want these? I accidentally grabbed extra, and they’ll just melt if I leave them in my bag.” He pulled out two yellow packets of matte foil and held them up like he was selling newspapers. 

Ah, Mark. Where I was okay with taking a step down for Beth sometimes, he always wanted to pull both of us up, to erase the differences between us. Like the brightly-colored fruit snacks my mom scoffed at and said we didn’t need. His mom always bought them— the *big* boxes too— and he made excuses to share them with us. With a pack of Gushers in hand, we could pretend we were all middle class for the afternoon.

So we accepted the candy without question, standing in a triangle and touching three sticky little gems together in the center to toast our last day of seventh grade. To the beginning of summer.

-

“I’m sorry,” I muttered, shaking my head like something had come loose inside it. Maybe something had. I swallowed. “No. Um. I mean, yes. Yes, they were classmates of mine. Friends, actually.”

Claire tipped her head to the side, waiting for an explanation. Some reason why it was totally normal that I had forgotten, or perhaps had never known, that my two best friends had gone missing that summer.

I could feel how weak my smile must’ve looked, how twitchy around the corners. “I… I suppose I blocked the memory out. I remember Beth and Mark, as clearly as I remember myself at that time. Clearer, even. They were my best friends. But I had no idea…”

Claire bit her lip, looking like she regretted ever bringing this up. Was this what she meant when she asked about topics that were off-limits? That would explain why she looked so surprised when I implied that my past contained no tragedy, no soft spots better left untouched.

Well, she couldn’t possibly be more surprised than me.

“Maybe,” she offered again, “with the timing of the move…maybe you were already gone by then, and your parents didn’t want to put you through the trauma of losing your friends in a more permanent way.” 

“Maybe,” I nodded, knowing this excuse was a lifeline for both of us. We needed to move on, badly. “And like you said, social media wasn’t that prevalent yet. It wasn’t unusual to lose touch with your old friends when you moved. And, of course, starting at CASA meant a lot more practicing, a lot more people. Not many opportunities to think about life before.”

But that wasn’t true. Claire was so relieved to be moving on to a new topic, I couldn’t tell if she knew I was lying or not, but she could figure it out if she tried. If she looked at the dates. Because back in 2002, we had just finished seventh grade, not eighth. It would be another year before I started CASA as a high school freshman. We had moved away from Albertville halfway through my last year at Gaines, but I would have been there when my friends disappeared. I would have heard about it every day at school, seen it on TV, seen their parents, for God’s sake. Since I didn’t finish out the year, I never got a yearbook, but I would bet anything that their names were on the first page.

And I didn’t remember a thing.

-

“I’m tired of climbing trees,” Mark said, turning in a circle to look at the woods around us. “Let’s do something else.”

Beth looked down from the crook she’d holed up in, sketchbook propped against her knees. The book’s cover was torn and had some unidentifiable baby substance splashed on the spine, but she loved it so much. “Want me to do a portrait of you?” 

Mark pursed his lips. Getting him to sit was a losing proposition, but he had a collection of drawings in his top drawer at home, all Beth originals. The pictures weren’t anywhere normal like his desk, either; they were buried under his balled-up socks like a secret. He didn’t know I knew about them. I never would have known if I hadn’t gone rummaging around for a pair of dry socks after we’d gotten caught in the rain a few months back. So it wasn’t totally surprising when he said, “That depends. Could you make me look like Goku?” 

Beth snickered but nodded. Big-eyed, spiky-haired anime characters were her thing these days. “Probably.” She adjusted her position to face him. “Do a power pose or something.”

“Oh, hell yeah!” Mark cheered, his voice only breaking a little in the middle. He dropped from the branch he’d been straddling, hitting a dramatic three-point landing before bursting up into a wide-legged stance. He puffed out his chest and held his arms out to the side, bowed out slightly and several inches away from his skinny torso. He looked like the burly police officer who came around the school to tell us about drugs, if the police officer had been deflated like an old balloon.

When I laughed at the thought, Mark shot me an evil glare, daring me to make fun of him, but he didn’t break his pose. Across from me, Beth was already drawing, her eyes flicking from Mark to the paper and back. I didn’t know if Beth liked Mark like that— *like* liked him, you know— but I couldn’t say for sure that she didn’t. So, like Mark, I decided to abandon my tree. Give them some space. As weird as it would be if my two friends decided to date, and weirder still if they dated and broke up, I couldn’t bring myself to intrude on whatever this moment was, or could be. 

“Where are you going?” Mark called as I picked up my bag. 

I nodded to the west. “Just down to the creek. I’m all sweaty, and it’s cooler over there. Besides, I bet all the baby tadpoles are full-on frogs now.” 

For a second, he visibly wavered, almost moving to follow. But Beth clicked her tongue at him, and he settled back into place. “If you find frogs, you have to come get us, okay? Or a turtle! Especially if it’s the big one we painted on before.” 

I grinned, thinking about the huge box turtle we’d found a year before. We’d used Beth’s new paints to carefully inscribe our initials on its back. E.H. to the left, M.B. right on top, and M.K. on the right. In hindsight, I should’ve written A.K., but no one in the world called me anything but Mandy, and I was pretty sure they never would. “Obviously! I’ll come back with a full report.” 

Satisfied, Mark nodded his approval before shifting back to watching Beth watch him. Standing there for just a second longer, I could’ve sworn he glowed under appraising eye.

The creek was only a few minutes’ walk away from our clearing, and I could feel when I was getting close more than I could see it. The air was less stuffy as the trees thinned out, full of invisible droplets of water that I could almost taste. The feel of it was so refreshing, I ran the last few yards, ignoring my backpack bouncing against my sticky back. 

As I broke the tree line, I took in a deep lungful of air that seemed to wash the stagnant heat out of my insides. The tide was higher than I expected, whisking over the sheared slabs of rock that usually broke the water’s surface. If we got a few good days of rain, Mark, Beth, and I could bring floats out and lounge in the water all afternoon without dragging our feet against the creek bed. It wasn’t the same as going out on the river, but that was a rare treat, reserved strictly for when Mark’s brother was home from college and could wheedle their dad into letting him take out their boat. Mark’s dad, Mr. Jimmy, always made him take us too, and Jim Junior didn’t mind. He’d set up the big tube and let us take turns holding on for dear life as he whipped us around every bend in the river. In the end, we all lost our grip at least once, our flailing bodies skipping over the surface of the water like flat stones before we went under.

I picked up a stone of my own from the edge of the creek, eyeballing where I could throw it for maximum skips. There was a stretch of calm, unbroken water a ways away from shore, too far for me to reach, but there was a long platform of rock just under the water’s surface halfway between us. So, with nothing else to do and sweat still pooling in my socks, I went for it. I ditched my bag, socks, and shoes but filled my pockets with as many good-looking skipping stones as I could without weighing them down too much. The last thing I wanted was for the extra cargo to drag my stretchy shorts down to my ankles. I’d walked home in soaking-wet clothes before, and it had given me a rash.

Wading into the creek, I was careful to drag my feet the way my dad had taught me, back when he used to take me fishing. Before he lost his job. Can’t step on a catfish or some other sharp critter if you don’t step down at all. As I reached the slab of rock, I remembered what he said about climbing on slippery stuff— always test it once before putting your weight on it, because a careless step could be your last. As I clambered up, the water flowed over the rock faster than I expected, and my hands slipped once, then again. The second time, my nails snagged against little divots in the surface of the rock, but it was no good— I couldn’t catch myself. Instead, I twisted as I went down, some instinct knowing that it would be better to take the impact on my arm than my face. 

My elbow met the unyielding stone first, then my shoulder and, despite my best efforts, my head. I could feel the crack resonate through my temple more than I could hear it, and when I opened my mouth to gasp, gritty water flowed between my teeth. Water blinded me in one eye as it covered half of my face. My lungs fought for air, and from a distance, my brain shouted at me to stop, that I was only sucking more water in through my nose. Eventually, my writhing body conspired to lift my head above the water, my legs churning until my toes found purchase on the jagged shelves of stone. Blind with panic and lack of oxygen, I squirmed my way onto the rock, arms still curled uselessly at my sides. Lying on my side, curled like a shrimp, I managed to drag my battered left arm up to fold under my head, just enough to keep my nose and mouth dry. For a long time, I coughed up water, then kept coughing until I could finally take in a ragged but dry mouthful of air. It wheezed in and out of me, and I just lay there, waiting for my body to calm.

Of course, once my heartbeat slowed, no longer raging in my ears, that’s when the pain seeped in. I sat up to take in the damage. From the feel of it, I figured I had about ten broken bones and no teeth left. Running my hands over myself hurt— my palms were badly scraped— but inch by inch, I realized I was okay. My left elbow was bruised and scraped, still ringing with funny-bone pain, and my shoulder would definitely bruise too, but I could deal with that. My head hurt too, but no worse than any bad bonk would do. Altogether, it wasn’t as bad as I expected.

Until I saw a stain spreading across the front of my t-shirt that definitely wasn’t water. As I watched, another drop fell from my chin, and now that I was aware of it, I could feel the thick, warm rivulet running down from the side of my head. The spot just above my temple was throbbing, more insistently now that I had noticed it.

I needed to get back to Mark and Beth. We needed to go home, get peroxide and bandaids and whatever you were supposed to use for a bump on the head. But as the stain continued to spread across my front, I knew I couldn’t go back like this. The bleeding wasn’t stopping, and I would scare them half to death. So, I sat up on the rock, the water running over my legs, and tried to clean myself up. My cuts and scrapes stung as I scooped up handful after handful of water, splashing it on my face, the side of my head, my shirt. Now that I was up, I realized my hip hurt too— bad. Giving up on my impossible task, I reached down to probe the side of my leg.

Instead of cotton-covered flesh, my fingers found a hard lumpy mass that shifted under my touch. The rocks. I groaned aloud. I’d fallen right onto them, then ground them into my skin more as I wriggled up to safety. Suddenly furious— at the water, the rocks, my own stupidity— I ripped them out of my pocket, letting them fall wherever they landed. I emptied my other pocket too, staring down at the last rock that remained. 

It was a perfect oval, flat and smooth, and if I looked up, I knew I would see that calm stretch of water that had seemed so accessible just a moment ago. All this just to skip some stupid rocks. 

I turned that last, perfect one over in my hand, getting some strange satisfaction out of covering it in my blood. Now we both looked stupid. Suppressing a scream, I grit my teeth and hurled it blindly, not bothering to try and skip it at all. But I did listen to hear it land— maybe a good, loud splash would feel like a small revenge against the creek that had tried to drag me under.

The splash never came. 

I looked up from my lap. The other side of the creek was closer now, but still not close enough for me to hit it, especially with such a wild fling. 

I looked around, not really knowing what I was looking for. But I found it anyway. “It” was a man, standing on the far bank. He hadn’t been there before, I thought, but he was standing so still… It was easy to think that his stillness had caused my eyes to pass right over him.

“Are you alright?” he called. His face was concerned, but his smooth drawl held no sharp edge of worry. When I didn’t reply, he waved with one hand, leaving the other curled at his side. “Can you speak? Looks like you hit your head real good.” 

Reflexively, I swiped one torn-up hand over my face, my hair. It wouldn’t do to be so messy in front of a grown-up. The man looked a little older than my parents, but not old-old, like a grandpa. His hair was combed, and he wore slacks and a polo shirt like the vice principal at school. Unlike the real vice principal, though, he looked more curious than disapproving. 

“Yeah,” I said, voice hoarse from coughing. I swallowed, painfully, and my next words came out clearer. “Yeah, I think so. Sorry.”

The stranger looked at me a little funny when I apologized; I don’t know why I did it either. It was just a reflex. “Bet you got a couple of scrapes too, huh? Especially your hands.”

He was right about the scrapes, and about my hands. I hadn’t had time to think about my hands before, and now I stared at them in fresh horror. Even beyond the injuries to the rest of me, the damage to my hands was heinous. Not because the scrapes were deeper and more crusted in rock dust but because they would make it nearly impossible to play my violin. The neck and bow would rest right in the grooves of my palms, and I shuddered just imagining how back it would hurt. Because impossible or not, uncomfortable or not, I was still going to play, and I could already imagine the scabs cracking open and weeping fresh blood every time I practiced. “I’ll still be able to play,” I murmured to myself, not meaning to, but desperately needing the reassurance.

Somehow, the man must have heard me. “Do you play an instrument?” he asked as he stepped forward, into the water. He didn’t roll up his pants or take off his nice shoes, but he must have been in a shallow spot, because neither seemed to get wet. It only took a few steps for him to reach a long, flat rock like mine. He stepped up easily and sat on the edge. His new position brought him only a few feet closer to me, but his voice was much clearer, almost as if he’d closed the distance entirely. The rock was tall enough to not be covered in water, but his feet, I noticed, were fully submerged, socks, shoes, and all. 

I nodded, looking away from him long enough to plunge my hands into the river. I flapped them, then brushed them together, trying to clean out the ragged gashes as best I could. “Violin.”

“Are you any good?”

The question surprised me. It wasn’t the kind of thing adults asked a kid. It was always, “Oh, how long have you played?” or, “Do you like it?” Or the occasional, “I bet your parents love that…!” that could either be sarcastic or sincere, depending on the person. 

Still, I liked being asked. “I’m really good,” I said. “My teacher says I can apply for the special arts school next year. She thinks I can get in.”

“Do you think so?” Another practical, adult question; equally unexpected but welcome.

“I do.” And I really did, but that wasn’t all that mattered. There was another worry that had itched at the back of my head ever since Mrs. Brown had suggested it. I hadn’t told anyone, not even Mark and Beth. There was nothing anyone could do about it. Still, there was something about talking to a total stranger, especially one at a safe distance, that felt somehow safer than talking to a friend. So I said, “I think I can get in, but I don’t think I can go. It costs, and there’s no way my parents can afford it.”

The stranger hummed sympathetically. I probably shouldn’t have been able to hear it over the hissing water, but it was a warm, rich sound that felt comforting. “There are no scholarships?”

I shrugged, straightening out my shorts. By now, I was sitting cross-legged on the rock. My butt and legs were soaked, but the damage was already done. “Maybe. But even if there are, the school is far away. The kids live in dorms. There’s no way they’d let me go, even if it meant they wouldn’t have to listen to me practice anymore.” I chuckled at that, a little sheepishly. 

“They don’t sound very encouraging.”

Frowning, I pursed my lips and shrugged. He wasn’t wrong, really, but they were still my parents. Even if they weren’t the biggest fans of my playing, when my teachers called me unfocused or refused to make the other kids stop picking on me, my parents had defended me. “No, they are,” I said, not sure if I was lying or not. Wanting to sound wise and grown-up, I added, “Times are just tough right now.” 

The man nodded like he understood. Maybe he did, but from the way he so casually let his nice clothes get dirty, I doubted it. “What about your friends? Do Mark and Beth want you to go?”

I bit my lip. They said they did, that they wanted me to be the best violin player ever. We hadn’t really talked about what it would mean for me to go away, but I had thought about it. On the one hand, it would be nice if they really did want this for me. On the other, that almost made it feel like they wouldn’t mind if I left, if they had to finish middle school and high school without me. When I was cranky or feeling insecure, I sometimes wondered if that wasn’t what they wanted— for it to just be the two of them. But in my heart, I knew it wasn’t true. They just wanted me to follow my dreams. And it wasn’t like they’d be the ones leaving. So I said, “I think they want me to go. Not to leave, I mean, but to go to the school if I want to.” 

For a second, I also wondered when I had mentioned Mark and Beth. But my head was still so discombobulated, I could hardly recall.

His serene smile tipped up a little at one corner. “So they’re willing to let you go. And I guess it goes without saying that you’d be willing to give up your friends if it meant you could go to that school and make all your dreams come true.”

The thought made me uncomfortable— that was such a heartless way to put it. But hadn’t I already considered it? Hadn’t I lain in bed and reckoned with that very trade? It hurt to think about. But every night, I went to bed with my mom’s old Vivaldi cassette playing at the lowest volume I could hear. With that music flowing over, around, and through me, it was like my heart didn’t have room for anything else. My voice came out choked as I said, “I don’t *want* to leave Mark and Beth.”

“But you would,” he finished for me. There was something in his expression that made me think he wasn’t judging me. That he actually understood the way passion, real passion and ambition, could sometimes shine so brightly that everything else shrank into shadow. “And it wouldn’t just be them, of course. It would be all of your friends.”

That almost made me laugh, except that I was already on the verge of crying. Mark and Beth were all of my friends. Not that I would say that out loud, even to a stranger. “I guess so.” 

At that, the stranger broke into a full grin, so unexpected and out of place that it made me shiver in the heat. “So, you’d give up all your friends to go to that school, huh?”

He still didn’t sound judgmental about it, but I didn’t like the way he said it, like it was nothing. It wasn’t nothing to me. I loved Mark and Beth so much. But maybe, in a deep, selfish place that I didn’t like to look at too closely, I loved my music more. And they would still have each other. From the looks of it, that would be enough for them. Maybe if I just accepted all of that, it wouldn’t hurt so much. So I said, “Yes. I would have to, wouldn’t I?” 

“Oh, now,” the stranger said, with the kind of impatient compassion adults reserved for playground knee-scrapes. “Dry your tears, Mandy.”

A cool wind drifted off the water and rippled through my wet hair, chilling me. I hadn’t realized I was crying, and I was sure I hadn’t told this man my name. Struck silent, I grabbed the neck of my t-shirt and used it to scrub at my face. Hopefully, the man would think I was wiping my tears away as I secretly checked for some kind of nametag or other way he might’ve identified me. There was no nametag on my shirt— and why would there be?— only a wide, brownish stain that was so much bigger than I remembered. Looking up from my shirt, I tried to get a better look at the man, to see if we’d met before. There were plenty of people at school and church whose faces I couldn’t remember that well. But raising my head only made me dizzy, my vision blurring and stomach churning like I was riding the Gravitron at the county fair..

Before I could ask the stranger how he knew my name, he clicked his tongue at me. “Come on now. Wipe your eyes.”

There was something in his voice that reminded me so much of my dad. A little dazed, I thought of how he sounded the last time we went on a trip to see Grandma. All morning, he sounded like he had a schedule in his head that Mom and I weren’t sticking to, and he was trying to hide that he was getting mad about it. Maybe that was why, without stopping to think or question it, I did just as he said, swiping the heel of my hand over my eyes. 

As I did, almost like an afterthought, he added, “And throw me one of those rocks, would you?”

I was so tired. Tired of this stranger, his probing questions and commands. My head had started throbbing again, and I just wanted to be back home. So, my hand still damp with fresh tears, I scooped up one of the remaining rocks and tossed it in his direction, hoping I’d miss. Then he’d have to get up and go get it, if he wanted a rock that bad, or he could get one of his own. 

Despite my bad throw, the rock sailed in a clean arc toward him, and the man plucked it right out of the air. He did it one-handed, his other hand still curled at his side like before. Turning the stone over in his hand, he smiled again and looked back to me. “That’s that, then.” 

I opened my mouth to speak as he stood and brushed off his slacks. They weren’t dirty, and his shoes didn’t even look wet, but my vision had gone swimmy again. “Huh?”

“It’ll be just like you said,” he assured me, his words nonsense to my ears. “You’ll make the trade. You already have.”

I shook my head, which felt so heavy and yet light enough to float right off my neck. That was another thing grown-ups didn’t say. They told you to work hard and do your best; they didn’t make promises to kids, especially ones they couldn’t keep. How was he so sure? I opened my mouth to ask, but I couldn’t make words. A heavy, dark fuzz crept in, starting at the edges of my body and moving inward until my vision tunneled. As my bones went loose and watery, the last thing I saw was the man looking at me with mismatched eyes. No, not eyes— two rocks, both small and flat and good for skipping, one stained a deep red-brown. He held them over his eyes like binoculars, or like he was playing peek-a-boo. Beneath them, a wide grin.

And then nothing.
