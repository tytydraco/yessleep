Clean white walls, and the strong scent of chlorine greeted me, as Jamie and I stepped into the clinic.   
Researchers bustled back and forth in the standard white lab coats their faction was known for, footfalls echoing on the black and white tile floor. Some pushed into the laboratory through a set of doors on the right, others split up into examination rooms down the hall to the left, while the rest tended what few patients we had in the main ward in front of me. Most of the beds stood empty, their pearl-colored curtains drawn back, bathed in the glow of the morning sun from windows behind them. Here, the last shreds of our old world remained; phone lines had been strung between separate offices on the two floors so the academics could talk to one another without leaving their work, and thus the sound of their ringing echoed in the pristine corridors. Machines hummed in electric idle, complicated squares of plastic and stainless steel used to monitor heartrates, bottle pure oxygen, or pump blood that would be irreplaceable if they ever left this building. I’d heard it said that the clinic was one of the few buildings in New Wilderness with an entirely metal subframe, which had somehow kept the electromagnetic radiation at bay, preserving the machines. A tiny square window in the maintenance doorway at the back of the main ward flickered with the glow of a soldering iron, as more technicians assembled primitive imitations of old-world tech from scraps. Shortwave radios, headsets, and even a few rare Geiger counters were fashioned here, along with other custom electronics that were more precious than gold. Most were made for official use, but any surplus items sold for extremely high prices at the market, making the Researchers some of the wealthiest members of our little society.  
“Hey guys.” From behind the receptionist desk, Sandra Abernathy grinned back with pearly white teeth, her dark hair flowing down behind a neat turquoise headband. “Didn’t know we had rangers coming in today. Whatcha looking for?”  
Jamie leaned one elbow against the counter, and tucked her left boot behind her right, causing a few crumbles of dirt to fall onto the gleaming floor tiles. “Had some field stuff to discuss with O’Brian. Is she in?”  
A few of the nearby researchers eyed Jamie’s boots, which were still rather muddy despite her best efforts, and I caught their eye rolls of disgust. I’d grown used to being around the rather male-dominated rangers, with their rough military attire, blunt mannerisms, and copious rude humor. The few girls who did join our ranks had to keep their hair short or tied back, our nails trimmed down, all traces of lipstick and perfume forbidden while on duty. Such things were luxuries we couldn’t afford in the wild, not when our survival depended on the Breach-born not smelling us on the wind, or an ELSAR platoon spotting a shiny fingernail during an ambush.   
By stark contrast, the researchers were almost three-quarters female in number and wore slip-on moccasins made from racoon pelts in the market, their hair adorned in fashions of the old world, and sported colorful makeup as if they had just come back from a shopping trip. They rarely ventured into the vast unknowns of Barron County, and not since the first days when ELSAR had thrown themselves at our walls did they do much in the way of fighting. No, these members of our fledgling society waged war using books, test tubes, and calculators. Instead of hunts and gunfights, they tracked mutant migration with remote-control drones, studied local plant life in special greenhouses, or provided healthcare for livestock and humans alike. They were vital to our survival, but due to being shielded from the harsh realities of the world beyond the wall, researchers could be rather pretentious at times, to the annoyance of the other two factions.  
*Those shoes look super comfy though.*  
I glanced down at my own scuffed boots, and wondered how much a pair would cost. Christmas would be here before I knew it, and Chris might like a new pair of soft moccasins to wear around his room in the Elk Lodge. Jamie could do with a set too.  
“She’s in the radiology room.” Sandra rose from her desk and beckoned us to follow her, white lab coat swishing against her purple button-down blouse and tan office slacks. “You came at a good time. We’ve got an observation convoy scheduled just before lunch, and then there’s the Ark River redemption ceremony sometime in the afternoon. It’s going to get busy around here after that.”  
She led Jamie and I down a narrow corridor on the left, and I tried to focus on the task at hand. My camera hung heavy on its strap, and I debated how much to tell Dr. O’Brian. After all, I could have been seeing things. But even so, this was less about what I’d seen, and more about exposing the traitor. Learning more about the bizarre Puppet-art was just a happy bonus.  
*Knock, knock, knock.*  
At the end of the hall, where the stairs began to lead to the second floor, Sandra rapped her knuckles on the last right-side doorway and turned the handle to poke her head in. “Couple of rangers here to see you, Dr. They said it’s field intel.”  
On the other side of the pinewood frame, a voice too low for me to make out words mumbled a response, and Sandra bobbed her raven-haired head.  
“Yeah, Jamie Lansen and Hannah Brun. Should I . . ?”  
In reaction to an unseen command, she swung the door open for Jamie and I, waving us in with a cheery smile.  
“Thanks.” I stopped to gesture back at the hall, where a few more clumps of dirt had fallen off our shoes. “Sorry about the mess. We just came in from a hunt, I should have wiped my feet better.”  
Sandra threw a smirk at a huddle of her colleges down the hall as they stepped around the dirt with wrinkled noses. “It’s fine. I mopped lots of floors to pay for veterinary school. Some of these dainty flowers need to learn how to dance with a broom.”  
Her snideness made me grin, and some of the stress over my predicament eased. I didn’t know her very well, but I decided that I already liked Sandra. She seemed down-to-earth and easygoing, the kind of person who would make a good teacher. If Chris ever managed to open that school he talked about for the local children, we’d need at least one person who didn’t clutch their pearls at dirty tilework.  
*Maybe I could put in a good word for her . . . once we get this spy business straightened out.*  
On the heels of Jamie, I shuffled into the radiology room, and pulled the door shut behind me.  
It was a small, cramped space, with a semi-reclined examination bed and an array of monitors to one side. Dr. O’Brian sat beside a small screen with a white plastic device in her hand, gently gliding it over the stomach of a slender golden-haired girl. A little older than myself, the girl watched the computer screen along with the doctor in tense anticipation, holding up her tunic with one hand to expose her midriff which had a barely discernable bulge to it. The other hand remained interlaced with her husband’s, and he stood beside her, square face set as if bracing for some kind of impact, sandy brown hair clinging to the sides of his head.  
Eve looked up in time to see Jamie and I, and my face flooded with embarrassed heat. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you guys were—”  
“We’re going to see the baby.” Her face shone with relief on seeing us, as if we would somehow bring good luck, and Eve jerked her head to urge me closer. “Come on, come see.”  
Adam chuckled at his wife’s energetic appeal, but I could see the same nervousness in his toffee-colored eyes as well, both of them wound up tight like a spring. “We just got started. Thankfully, the good doctor seems to have done this before.”  
Dr. O’Brian kept her gaze fixed on the monitor, the gray, black, and white lines a mystery to the rest of us in their meaning. “You’d be surprised how similar human anatomy is to several animals, Mr. Stirling. Ultrasounds for one aren’t that much different from another. Just give me a moment and . . . there.”  
Fading into view on the screen, a jumble of white lines on a grayish black background solidified, like ancient paint on a cave wall. To me, it all appeared a chaotic array of sand, but as I watched a definitive shape appeared, lines emerging from the shadows to form a small dark circle with a curled silver object inside.  
Dr. O’Brian straightened up in triumph. “You see that halfmoon shaped thing there?”  
She pointed to the silver crescent on the screen, her plastic wand motionless over a spot on Eve’s gel-covered belly.  
Eve swallowed and gave a rigid nod.  
With the air of a lecturer in a university, Dr. O’Brian traced out various paces on the fuzzy image with her forefinger. “It’s not clearly visible yet, but at six weeks, the face, nose, jaw, and throat have already begun to form. There’s the little spinal column there, see? Its heart is already beating, though it has a way to go before it’s fully developed. Right now it’s the size of a lentil, but in another few months it’ll be around the size of a pea pod. Once it’s big enough, the baby will be able to sense light, and even voices from outside, and . . . sweetheart, what’s wrong?”   
Face white as a sheet, Eve’s jaw worked, and her gaze switched to Dr. O’Brian with a pleading aura. “Is it normal?”  
At the sight of tears rising in her golden eyes, my heart melted in my chest. No matter the strangeness of her origin, Eve fit her name well, beautiful and insightful, with an innocence that made her exceptionally gentle with others. Like the Puppets we’d caught today, her life had begun as a monster in the forest, until Adam had converted her by a chance encounter, and she’d been vital in building their community ever since. Being the first of her people to become pregnant had both overjoyed and terrified her, and Eve worried for her baby’s health as a result. I’d been the one to suggest they come here, to trade quality healthcare for their vast knowledge of our twisted new world, and I waited with bated breath for the doctor’s answer.  
Dr. O’Brian’s expression softened, and she rested one hand on the girl’s knuckles. “Congratulations. You’ve got a healthy *normal* baby on the way.”  
Eve’s body slackened, as if she’d been holding her breath the entire time, and she let out a muffled sob of relief.  
Adam’s face slid into a weary but happy smile, and he squeezed his wife’s hand as she reached out to touch the shape on the monitor.  
“Wow.” Eve studied the dot on the screen as if it were life on Mars, her face soaked in crystalline streams of joy. “Hey there, little one. Look at you.”  
A muffled cough came from my left, and I turned to see Jamie wipe at the corner of her eye for a moment, feigning interest in the ceiling tiles. She had always been somewhat critical of the Ark River people, especially after witnessing one of their ‘redemption’ ceremonies firsthand. It had been a particularly sore point between her and Chris, and Jamie didn’t like to interact with our golden-haired allies all that much as a result. But even now, I could see in her tough exterior a pang of sympathy at how Eve caressed the monitor, and Jamie chewed on her lower lip like she wanted a distraction.  
*See? Not everyone is an enemy. She wants to take care of her family . . . just like you.*  
Adam blinked hard a few times and cleared his throat. “So, everything looks good then?”  
“A textbook pregnancy.” O’Brian patted Eve on the knee. “Every test we’ve done so far has come back with flying colors. But we’ll keep up the regular appointments anyway, just to keep an eye on things. I’ll write a recommended nutrition standard, and some exercises you can do once you hit your second trimester. Would you like me to print this out so you can have your own copy?”  
Eve beamed, and the color returned to her face, rosy around her cheekbones like a renaissance angel painting. “Of course! The others will be thrilled to see it, especially Miriam and Japeth. They’ve been trying so hard, maybe this will encourage them.”  
Once the gel had been cleaned off, and the pictures of the ultrasound printed, Eve threw her arms around Dr. O’Brian, Jamie, and I in turn, an excited bundle of giggles. Hand-in-hand, she left with her husband, childish glee written all over their faces.  
For my part, I watched them go with mild jealousy. While I knew I had a lot of things to do in life, I still couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to feel that way, to know a tiny person was growing inside me, and see that glowing look of pride and adoration on Chris’s face.  
*Imagine a little boy with his eyes, or maybe a girl with his smile. Maybe we could move to that house Chris owns in Pennsylvania and start a little farm. The kids could ride their bikes down the driveway, Chris could build them a treehouse, and I could make snacks to eat around a campfire in the backyard . . . what I wouldn’t give for that.*  
“Yes!” Startling me from my thoughts, Dr. O’Brian pumped her fists in the air as soon as Adma and Eve were out of sight in a rare display of excitement.   
“Big day, huh?” With casual indifference, Jamie leafed through a medical book on a nearby countertop that lay open to a page about pregnancy care.  
“Massive.” Dr. O’Brian rushed to collected various papers from the desk near the radiology equipment, her enthusiasm unbounded. “This is the most important work I’ve ever done, hands down. Forget the reverse genetic adaptation in our animals, forget the electromagnetic readings in the atmosphere, we’ve got the first successful conception post-Breach . . . and it’s a hybrid.”  
Something about that word stuck in me the wrong way, and I frowned. Dr. Alecia O’Brian was our best researcher and lead medical officer. She had a warm, caring side, that endeared many students in the Researcher faction to her. However, the woman had a habit of letting work overshadow her tact at times, and occasionally got too absorbed in the science of it all to hear the words coming out of her own mouth.  
“It *is* healthy, right?” I crossed my arms and watched her scribble notes down on a chart with furious speed. “Eve has done nothing but worry about the baby, and if something goes wrong . . .”  
Dr. O’Brian waved a dismissive hand at me, still laser-focused on her jumbled notes. “Why would I lie to a patient, Hannah? Besides, we have as much stock in that little one’s survival as they do. Just the existence of these people is a miracle of science. I mean, new humans, new sequences of DNA, completely foreign to our own? Think of the possibilities of that! They’re already smarter than us, they can sense so many more things, and their learning capabilities are off the charts. If that baby is born, and survives, we might be looking at a brand-new genetic line that has never been seen on earth before.”  
“As if we need more competition.” Jamie regained her grim demeanor and craned her neck at the doorframe in suspicion.  
“Think of it more like the alliance between Plymouth Rock and Squanto.” Oblivious to Jamie’s dire tone, O’Brian stuffed documents into a manilla folder with glee. “Cooperation with their tribe has been the single most important point of our studies here. Their knowledge of the herbs and mutants has given us so many scientific breakthroughs. Just this morning we began a trial to see if the Lantern Rose nectar they use for medicine can reverse cancer cells in mice. *Cancer.* Can you imagine the impact if it works? A cure for cancer, here, in Barron County, literally growing all around us! With enough Lantern Rose plants, we could provide a free source of lifesaving healthcare for people all over the world, and it’s entirely thanks to you, my dear.”  
It took me a moment to realize her words were directed at me, and I picked at the buckle on my camera case, unaccustomed to such praise. “Technically Chris and Jamie helped with the negotiations. And Adam and Eve deserve the credit for the medicine. I figure as long as the baby is okay, they’ll be glad to help you with the research.”  
“They are the research, don’t you see?” Jumping up from her swivel chair, Dr. Obrian strode back and forth, animated with the zeal of a detective on the verge of breaking a major case. “If they can inter-breed with other pre-Breach humans, their genetics could make future generations more resilient to these kinds of phenomenon. We’re talking about potentially longer lifespans, higher brain capacity, and the erasure of mental illness without any artificial modification whatsoever. It’s a gift of evolution.”  
My eyebrow went up, and before I knew what I was doing, I blurted out my thoughts. “They would say it’s a gift from God.”  
Dr. O’Brian frowned and rolled her eyes with a huff. “Their only flaw, unfortunately. How such advanced beings can believe in an undead Jewish carpenter is beyond me. But I suppose it could explain the myths of angels with golden hair appearing amongst ancient men to help them. Think about it, Hannah. How much of what we know today as ‘myth’ was really people encountering Breach-like activity, without the scientific knowledge to understand it? What if all the world’s religions are just misinterpretations of Breach-made life forms? Maybe what we thought were gods, angels, demons, and spirits were really just mutants? Thousands of years of religious, cultural, and scientific dispute. . . and the keys to the truth are walking around inside our walls right now.”  
“So, you’re not religious?” Still too curious to keep myself in check, I stuck my hands into my pockets, and remembered the chapel at Ark River, with its almost otherworldly feel to it.  
Putting the pregnancy booklet down, Jamie snorted, as if she already knew where this debate would go.  
“If God exists, he has a lot to answer for.” Dr. O’Brian curled her lip at the name but seemed to regain her civility and spoke to me in an almost whimsical tone. “No, my dear, religion was invented for tyrants like Rodney Carter to use as a cudgel to keep others in line. At its core, their faith refuses to accept that mankind could be improved, perhaps even perfected, given the proper collective guidance. If the others on the council understood this, New Wilderness could be an excellent place to try a new social direction for humanity . . . but sadly we’re talking about stubborn men from Appalachia.”  
“Funny how ‘perfecting’ humanity always requires us blue-collar people to shut up and get in line.” Jamie quipped with a smirk, but an icy layer to her voice signaled that her patience had worn thin. “A college degree doesn’t give you the right to rule the world you know.”  
“And a gun doesn’t give you the right either.” Turning her nose up at Jamie, O’Brian faced me instead, and did her best to disengage from the previous argument. “Anyway, I doubt you two came here to listen to me rattle on about the world. Sandra said you had some field intelligence to share, correct?”  
My hand brushed at the camera that swung by my side, but I thought better of it. Dr. O’Brian had just finished telling me she didn’t believe in anything spiritual. I myself still wasn’t sure where I stood. In my brief visit to Ark River, I’d talked with Adam about the existence of God, and had wondered curiously if such a deity really was out there somewhere. Yet Dr. O’Brian seemed so sure of her view as well, and I wasn’t smart enough to debate with her, nor did I want to. After all, what if there *wasn’t* anything or anyone else out there? What if I had just been seeing things? Maybe the Breach just messed with my screen? I could be making a big deal out of nothing, wasting Dr. O’Brian’s valuable time with yet another fairy-tale that would have fit in with countless others in our species’ long history. I didn’t want to look stupid.  
Then again, this could be too important to keep quiet about, and there was still the matter of clearing Chris’s name.  
*Worst she can do is laugh at me.*  
“I, um . . . we found something.” I tapped on my camera case and lowered my voice. “Something sensitive.”  
Her eyebrows arched in interest, and Dr. O’Brian’s mouth curled upward at the edges. “How so?”  
“Defense secrets.” Jamie gave up her efforts to feud as well and cast O’Brian an imploring glance. “Do you have somewhere more private we could talk? The walls here are too thin for this kind of thing.”  
Defense secrets. A word that had become common for those of us in the know, a security measure put in place by Sean Hammond, ex-sheriff’s deputy, and commander of the entire reserve. He’d been the one to author our laws, create our political system, and keep the factions from fighting with tactics like defense secrets. It was a word that could justify locked doors, unanswered questions, unexplained changes of work schedules, and unlisted convoys going in and out of the gates at odd hours. It was a magical term that both awed and frightened everyone who heard it, as we knew it was all preamble to something bigger, something important . . . something dangerous.  
And I was among the few who knew exactly what it meant.  
Dr. O’Brian’s mouth thinned into a hard, knowing line, and she plucked her sheaf of papers from the desk with a precise nod. “Follow me.”  
Back through the busy corridor and crowded main room we went, with Dr. O’Brian directing her subordinates to various tasks along the way. More than a few cast curious looks our way, as face-to-face time with any faction leader meant official business.  
Out near the foyer, we came to a plain metal door on the right side of the room, tucked almost obscurely behind a tall potted plant. Dr. O’Brian produced a ring of keys from her white lab coat pocket and unlocked it with a flick of her wrist.  
She ushered us through as soon as the heavy door swung slightly ajar, and I squeezed into the dark expanse, cold air blasting down on my head from above. Jamie stumbled in behind me, and Dr. O’Brian’s moccasins scuffed over the floor as she yanked the door shut.  
Blind in the pitch dark, I backed away from the doorframe so the others could have room, and my elbow hit something hard and smooth.  
A rustle came from behind, the sound of cloth falling erupted in my ear, and dim bluish light filled the room as I whirled in surprise.  
Milky white eyes stared back, surrounded by a waterfall of greasy black hair. Gray skin lay covered in ebony cuts, and the teeth were square like wooden pegs. Standing upright like a normal human would, it was so close that I could see myself reflected in its hazy eyeballs. On its face lay the same eerie grin as always, and my heart dropped into my guts.  
*How did that get in here?*  
Somehow, one of the Puppets had broken loose . . . and without the daylight to rescue us, there was nothing we could do but scream.
