I had never given much thought to Mr. Hawthorne, the janitor at our school, until the shower drains began cutting kids feet. At first, everyone dismissed it. Scrapes happen in communal showers, right? But these were not ordinary cuts. They were deep, ragged, jagged, as if someone had sharpened the metal with deliberate cruelty. And Hawthorne was always there, quietly smiling, gliding through the halls with his mop, humming under his breath like a hymn only he could hear.

No one noticed the smell at first. Damp soap, rust, and something sour and metallic, something almost alive. But it lingered, clinging to the showers, to the air ducts, even to his overcoat after he had gone. Students began to complain of infections. Minor cuts festered overnight; bruises turned black and oozed. And still, the administration did nothing.

One late afternoon, after track practice, I stayed behind. The showers were empty, silent except for the steady drip of water. That’s when I saw it. A thin trail of blood leading toward the boiler room. My heart thumped, but I followed it, and found the door slightly ajar. I thought I heard a sound. A wet, sucking sound, as if something were drinking.

Curiosity, or perhaps some darker impulse, drove me forward. The boiler room was hotter and darker than I expected and smelled of something fetid. I gagged quietly and covered my nose. Around a large black pipe, I saw the source, a vat. Large, black, glistening with a strange sheen. Floating in it were…fragments. Bits of skin? Soap? I could not tell. The air pulsed with heat and Hawthorne…he knelt beside it, grinning, his hands coated in the mixture as he dipped, tasted, and hummed.

At first, he seemed human enough, but then I saw his eyes. Black as coals. His skin began to bubble, tiny eruptions that hissed softly, as if the vat itself were feeding something beneath his skin, some hidden horror lodged within his flesh. He slurped the mixture with a feral delight, licking grime and blood from his fingers. It was not sustenance alone; he was nourished, transformed. Each drop of soap, each scrap of skin, each infection made him more alive…more grotesque.

I do not know how long I watched, frozen in a mixture of awe and terror. He did not notice me, he did not need to. The vat provided All, and he, in turn, became its favored child. Swirling his fingers, scooping grime, sniffing it, gulping it down, his black eyes glinting, his bubbling skin hissing and quivering as though itself was aware and sentient. He thrived in the filth.

I told no one what I saw. Who would believe it? Who would wish to? A janitor feeding on the discarded filth of the students, a grotesque parasite sustained by blood, soap, and skin?Yet the next day, a student appeared in the nurse’s office, their foot wound already festering with infection. Hawthorne was there, mop in hand, smiling faintly, always watching, always humming.

At night, I still hear it. That wet, satisfied sucking sound, rising from beneath the boiler room, as if the walls themselves fed him. I fear he knows I saw, and he waits. 

I’ll never shower again.
