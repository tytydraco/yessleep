Looking back, I’m not sure if I ever should have read Sadie Miller’s essay. As a first grade teacher for more than three years at the time, you’d think I’d have seen it all. Hilarious spelling errors, wild imaginations, and the occasional heartbreaking stories of troubled homes. But nothing in my three years of teaching had prepared me for what I would read that day, or for what I would learn soon after.

The day started off just like any other day. The kids were all settled in their seats. Half of them trying to stay awake, the other half not even bothering to stay awake. Some kids in the back of the class murmuring to each other about a cartoon that they watched earlier that week, and then there was Sadie Miller.

Sadie would just sit often just sit in the back of the room, keeping to herself. That wasn’t really a bad thing. She’d never disrupt class, and she always did her work correctly, so I never really had a problem with her, but I sometimes wondered if everything was okay in her life.

Well that day, I had an assignment for the class. Writing a small essay on their personal hero. It was an easy assignment, sort of a warm-up to see where the kids were at, and what all I might need to teach them.

I handed out all the pencils and paper, and almost immediately the room fell quiet. Everyone was lost in their own thoughts as they scribbled onto their papers.

I walked between the desks, offering encouragement where I could. Little faces scrunched up in concentration as they tried to spell “Mom” or “Batman,” some words coming out crooked and misshapen. It was always fascinating to watch—how such small minds could come up with such big ideas.

When I walked past Sadie Miller, something caught my eye. I glanced over her shoulder to read what she was writing, and saw the words “The light man” being written down.

That was odd, I thought, but I decided to wait until she turned it in to read it, and get a better understanding of what she was writing.

After about 30 minutes, the kids all turned in their essays and headed off to lunch. I noticed that Sadie was the last one to turn her’s into the tray. My curiosity was eating me, so I decided to go ahead and read and grade her essay right away.

My dad is my hero. He keeps me safe from monsters, and demons. One time I was sleeping and I woke up and saw the light man standing outside my window. I was scared and couldn’t move. The light man stood there watching me. His eyes started glowing and I screamed. My dad ran into my room and saw the light man. He chased him away from our house. My dad isn’t scared of anything.



After reading Sadie’s essay, I sat back in my chair to ponder what I had just read. The story was unsettling yet surprising well done for someone in the first grade. This Light Man standing outside her window watching her with glowing eyes was creepy and imaginative. 

It seemed clear to me that Sadie had a very active imagination, and I could tell that she had a penchant for writing, so I graded her essay based on the subject, and I added some extra credit for creativity.

I set the paper aside, but the image of the Light Man lingered in my mind. Something about the description unsettled me. The way she described him—watching her, glowing eyes—was oddly vivid for a first grader. Still, I convinced myself it was just a child’s imagination. Kids often created monsters to make sense of things they couldn’t explain.

The day went on like any other, but I couldn’t stop glancing at Sadie during class. She sat quietly, working on her math problems, her face as calm and expressionless as ever. For a moment, I considered asking her about the Light Man, but I stopped myself. I didn’t want to embarrass her or make her think she’d done something wrong.

The next day, I had a parent-teacher conference scheduled with Sadie’s dad. I planned to bring up her essay—not as a concern, but as a compliment. Maybe it would make him proud to hear how creative she was.

When Mr. Miller arrived, he looked exhausted. His face was lined with worry, and dark circles hung under his eyes. He shook my hand politely and took a seat across from me.

“Thanks for coming in,” I said. “Sadie’s doing really well in class. She’s bright, hardworking, and—” I hesitated, pulling her essay from my folder. “She’s also very creative.”

I slid the paper across the desk to him. He picked it up, his eyes scanning the page. At first, his expression was unreadable, but as he read, his grip on the paper tightened. By the time he reached the end, his hands were trembling.

“Is something wrong?” I asked carefully.

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he folded the essay in half and tucked it into his jacket pocket. Finally, he looked up at me, his face pale.

“You said she wrote this?” he asked, his voice low.

“Yes. She turned it in yesterday. I thought it was quite imaginative.”

Mr. Miller shook his head, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. “Imaginative? No, no. You don’t understand.”

“Understand what?”

He leaned forward, his voice barely above a whisper. “The Light Man isn’t something she made up.”

A chill ran down my spine. “What do you mean?”

“I mean he’s real,” he said. “And he’s been watching our house for weeks.”

I was taken aback by this. What could he mean he’s real? I tried to ask him, but he continued.

“He’s not some creepy man with glowing eyes like Sadie wrote in her essay.”

“For several weeks now, a man has been coming by our house at night taking pictures.”

“I’m not sure if it’s racially motivated or what, or maybe he’s just a creep, but it’s been a problem for a while.”

“The story Sadie wrote in her essay, it happened about two weeks ago. I heard screaming coming from her room, and when I got there, I saw some white man standing outside her window with a camera.”

“I ran out after him, but by the time I got to where he was, he was gone. Since then, every now and then, I see flashes outside the window late at night.”

“Have you tried reporting this to the police?” I said

“We have, but without a description of the guy, there isn’t really much for them to go off on.”

“We’ve looked into installing cameras, but without my wife out of work, and me working minimum wage, it’s just not possible right now.”

I stood there dumbfounded. This whole time what I thought was a child’s creativity was actually a young girl documenting her encounter with a predator. That made me uneasy.

“Look Mrs Harper, I thank you for encouraging Sadie’s creativity, but if it’s all the same to you, I’d like it if we kept this conversation to ourselves.”

I agreed and he handed me back Sadie’s essay. Soon after he left for work, and I just sat there looking back over at Sadie’s essay.

The light man stood there watching me. His eyes started glowing and I screamed.

It’s scary how her mind processed a man taking pictures of her, into something like this. The mind of a child is truly something that can’t be comprehended.

I wish I could say what happened with the man that was harassing the Millers, but really I don’t know. I only ever met Sadie’s father once after that day, and I wasn’t sure if bringing up the man taking pictures of them would be appropriate.

I did see Sadie Miller again a few years later when I started teaching High School reading, and I’m happy to say that her creativity has still continued on in her writing. 

She seems to enjoy writing horror, and while it’s not really my favorite thing, I still get lost in the worlds that she creates. I just know she’s going to blow up one day.

I still haven’t asked her about The Light Man. I don’t even know how to approach the topic, but I just hope that whoever that man was, he either moved on, or was finally apprehended.
