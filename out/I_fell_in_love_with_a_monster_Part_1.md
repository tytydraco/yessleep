My life in high school was tough, even now that I was in my senior year. There were few places where I felt comfortable: at school, Ben Connors and his two cronies made my life impossible whenever they could, and things weren't much better at home. I'll just say that being the town drunk's son is not easy, and even less so when you wear glasses, you're skinny, and, to top it all off, you're homosexual.

All my childhood friends had moved away from the town years ago. Three afternoons a week, I volunteered at the local orphanage to read books to the little ones or to help with the distribution of food and gifts. If it weren't for the gratitude of those children, I doubt I could have endured the daily bullying. Despite everything, most of the time I felt alone. But everything changed in the middle of the school year.

My town was usually quite peaceful, and rarely did anything interesting happen. But suddenly, the local news reported that blood and torn flesh had been found in the vicinity, belonging to two neighbors who had recently disappeared. Although one was a guy with a criminal record for sexual offenses and the other was a woman who had lost custody of her daughter due to abuse (people whom almost no one would miss), it was all anyone talked about for the whole week.

Many speculated that a potential serial killer was on the loose, but the authorities declared that they had actually been attacked by a very aggressive animal. The mood calmed down when a huge bear was put down not far from town.

A few days after the gruesome discoveries, a boy named Sam Winter joined my class. The teacher introduced him to us first thing on a Monday morning. As soon as I saw him, I had no doubt he would quickly become the most popular kid in the class. He was a handsome, tall boy with a strong build, and his eyes were as green as emeralds. Many of my female classmates smiled delightedly, and some even sighed.

“You've been here for less than five minutes, and you've already become the Romeo of the class,” Ben mocked, echoed by the laughter of his friends, Ron and Zack.

Sam didn't seem bothered by his words; he didn't even look at him, and I took that as a good sign. The last thing I wanted was for the new kid to become friends with the worst bully in the school. The teacher instructed Sam to sit at the desk next to mine. I greeted him with a shy 'hello,' which he returned with a smile, and the morning proceeded as usual. Well, except that everyone occasionally asked Sam to sit with them for lunch, join their respective sports clubs, or go out for a drink with them after school.

At lunchtime, as usual, I found myself nibbling on my lunch alone. Or at least that was the case until, barely five minutes after I had sat down, Sam came over to me with his tray in hand.

“Do you mind if I sit with you, Henry?” he asked kindly.

“No, of course not...” I replied, feeling both shy and confused.

I didn't understand why someone like him, who already had everyone at his feet, would want to spend time with me, the class outcast.

“Aren't you worried they'll make fun of you for sitting here?” I asked. Deep down, I appreciated that he did, but if they started bullying him too, I wouldn't forgive myself.

“You're the person I most wanted to sit with, to be honest,” he replied naturally.

I couldn't help but blush, but I immediately assumed he was lying. Maybe this was all part of a cruel joke, the kind where someone pretends to be friendly just to humiliate you when you least expect it.

“I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth,” he suddenly said with a solemn tone, looking at me intensely with his green eyes.

“I never said I doubted you.”

“I know you doubt, I can smell it.”

I couldn't help but burst into laughter.

“Do you have some sort of superpower in your sense of smell or something like that?” I said.

Sam gave a wide smile before responding.

“You could say that, yes” he replied.

Suddenly, something hit me on the back of the neck, and I turned around; Ben had thrown a half-eaten apple at me and was celebrating as if he had just scored in a professional basketball game.

“Why are you wasting your time eating with that loser?” Ben asked, directing his gaze towards Sam. “Come with us before you catch the 'gay fever.'”

Ron and Zack laughed as if he had told the joke of the year. I clenched my fists and lowered my gaze. Defending myself had only brought more trouble, so ignoring them was the best I could do. Sam, on the other hand, stared at him without hardly blinking.

I could have sworn his eyes glowed for a second before he stood up, holding something in his hand. With a swift movement, he threw it in Ben's direction, and the impact nearly knocked him backward. I blinked in astonishment when I saw that what had hit Ben in the face was an apple, now lodged between his teeth.

“The pig is ready for the oven,” Sam said, as if he were a chef giving orders to his assistants.

The entire cafeteria burst into laughter, causing Ben's face to turn as red as the apple. With a hateful look, he spat it out and left the place muttering something, followed by his sycophantic lackeys.

At the end of lunch, Sam surprised me again when he asked if we could meet that afternoon so I could show him around town. I couldn't say no. Once classes were over, I guided him to the best places, and we ended up having a drink at my favorite café, a moment we used to get to know each other better.

Sam had come with his parents from one of the big cities on the other side of the country. Both were novelists and often moved to deal with writer's block, although Sam didn't seem to mind not being able to put down roots anywhere.

“Why did you decide to come to this town in particular?” I wanted to know as I sipped my soda.

Sam seemed to ponder the answer.

“There’s good food here,” he simply said.

I raised an eyebrow at his words. My town wasn't famous for any particular food or restaurant; in fact, it wasn't famous for anything. But aside from that conversation, the rest of our meeting was quite normal.

That was the first of many afternoons Sam and I spent together. At school, he never left my side, which deterred Ben and his friends from bothering me, as Sam found a new way to humiliate them each time they tried. I helped him with the subjects he struggled with, and he alleviated my loneliness.

Two weeks after we became friends, Sam invited me to his house. His parents, William and Carol, were very cordial to me, and after a few days, they started inviting me to dinner. I gladly accepted; my father didn't care where I was since his beer cans and the TV were enough to make him ignore my absence.

And so, my life took on a new routine, with Sam playing an important role: we ate together in the school cafeteria, did our homework in the library or in his living room, and then sat in his room to watch series or play video games. Since my house was all about sports and news, thanks to Sam, I became a fan of cult animes like “Cowboy Bebop”, “Evangelion”, and “Gurren Lagann”.

I discovered I wasn't the loser many thought I was when I beat him in almost every game of Mortal Kombat and Mario Kart. On weekends, we went to the movies, had a burger in the park, or simply lay on the grass in his backyard to stargaze. Sam even decided to volunteer at the local orphanage.

The Winter family treated me with increasing familiarity. William lent me some mystery novels and took me fishing occasionally, and Carol taught me how to prepare all kinds of recipes and shared her love for classic fantasy literature. Sam also started to become closer to me, but in a different way. He would gently touch my head as a greeting, pinch my nose to tease me, and tickle my ear with his finger when I was distracted. Soon, I realized I had fallen in love with him, but I didn't dare to make a move, fearing he would reject me and I would lose his friendship.

One day, I felt confident enough to tell him about the desolate situation at home: how my father, when he wasn't drinking himself into a stupor, blamed me for my mother leaving when I was just seven years old, and sometimes I believed him.

But Sam told me it wasn't my fault that had happened and that my parents should be the ones feeling bad for being so negligent with me. And then, Sam tenderly kissed me on the lips. I could see his cheeks were red when he pulled away. I didn't know how to react since I had never been in a relationship before.

"It's also the first time I've done this," he said, not daring to look me in the eyes.

"How do you know it's the first time I've been kissed? Are you using your super sense of smell again?"

"Uh... yes?" he replied with a nervous smile.

I let out a light laugh, which gave me the courage to lean in and return the kiss. It was the most magical moment of my life. Unfortunately, that magic was overshadowed the next day by terrible news.

The father of one of my classmates, Mindy Littleford, had disappeared without a trace. Many people supported Mindy, and some offered to help her search for her father. Four days later, they found a severed hand and ear in an abandoned apartment, amidst a large pool of blood. DNA tests confirmed they belonged to Mr. Littleford, but they couldn't find any suspects.

After that, Mindy became withdrawn, often excusing herself to go to the bathroom, but we all knew she went away to cry. People were terrified, and the mayor was considering imposing a curfew to prevent more potential tragedies.

A week later was my eighteenth birthday. As always, my father forgot even to wish me a happy birthday, but the Winters surprised me with a surprise party in their living room. Carol and Sam made the cake themselves, and they all gave me some gifts. I couldn't help but cry with happiness. The most special gift was from Sam, who gave me a bouquet of yellow roses, my favorite color, along with a card that said, "I was born to meet you."

"You stole that line from Evangelion, didn't you?" I teased.

"You learn fast," he replied with a mischievous smile, then kissed me on the forehead.

As night fell, Sam offered to walk me home. But halfway there, he asked if we could detour to the entrance of the forest for a moment. He said he had something important to tell me. I was confused but also excited, so I followed him without hesitation. We stopped in the middle of a clearing illuminated by the full moon.

"You mean a lot to me, Henry," he said, taking my hands in his.

He squeezed them slightly, and I could feel his nervousness.

"And that's why I must..."

The sound of footsteps made us turn around. Ben Connors emerged from behind some bushes, accompanied by his two cronies. They sneered in disgust when they noticed us.

"Ugh! We can't even get away from these f\*gs here," Ben muttered, and as usual, they burst into laughter like hyenas.

My old self, the one from before I met Sam, would have hung my head and stayed silent. But this time, a wave of bravery washed over me, and I walked towards them with a determination I didn't know I had.

"Shut up, Ben. Leave us alone and go be an idiot somewhere else," I said firmly.

The bullies reacted with brief astonishment, but Ben's face quickly reddened with anger, and swift as a snake, he knocked me down with a punch to the stomach. Before I could even attempt to get up, he grabbed me by the hair and pressed something cold and sharp against my neck. He was holding a knife to me.

"Henry!" I heard Sam shout.

"Ben, what are you doing?" Zack asked, bewildered. "This is going too far."

"And what does it matter? I think we'll be doing his father a favor this way," Ben replied coldly as he pressed the blade against my skin, causing a drop of blood to trickle down.

A powerful growl suddenly filled my ears. Ben withdrew the knife from my neck, allowing me to turn my head towards the source of the noise. I was petrified to see that it was Sam who was growling. His eyes gleamed like green flames, and I could swear he had suddenly grown a meter taller. Sharp fangs protruded between his lips.

"No way!" Zack screamed, fleeing from there like a bat out of hell.

Ron, though hesitant at first, lunged at Sam with a desperate cry. I noticed he also had a knife in his hand, but he didn't have time to use it. Sam's arm pierced through his chest like butter, holding a viscous lump in his hand, or rather, in the enormous claw that had once been a hand. I quickly realized it was a heart.

A large pool of blood formed at Sam's feet, soaking his shoes. With a sudden movement, Sam threw Ron's body to the other side of the clearing. He observed the heart for a couple of seconds, and to my horrified surprise, he brought it to his mouth and crushed it between his teeth. His eyes now shone brighter than ever. He looked nothing like the Sam I had fallen in love with...

Ben let out a scream of horror, but instead of releasing me, he aimed his weapon at my throat once again.

"Don't... don't come any closer! I'll kill him, I swear if you come closer I'll kill him!" Ben screamed in a futile attempt to sound defiant, but I could hear the terror in his voice.

Sam growled again, displaying a fierce grimace.

"Let him go," he hissed with a tone more fitting for a beast than a human.

"Force me, you damn monster!"

I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streaming down my cheeks. I couldn't believe I was caught in such a nightmare, one from which I couldn't wake up. Suddenly, a brief breeze brushed against my ear, and the touch of Ben's arm vanished. I don't know where I found the courage to open my eyes, but when I did, I saw a scene I will never forget.

Sam held Ben in the air, his claw closed around his throat, while the bully thrashed desperately. The boy I loved, now transformed into a horrifying creature, brought Ben closer to his face and sniffed him. He sighed as if he were savoring the finest dish in the world.

"Mmm\~ You have such a delicious scent. You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this."

Ben opened his mouth to scream, but before he could, Sam's mouth stretched like rubber and he swallowed his skull in one gulp. With a simple tug, Sam tore it from his body and crushed it between his jaws. At that point, my mind couldn't handle it anymore, and I vomited until my stomach was empty. I passed out immediately.

I woke up amidst the tumult of several voices—it was Sam and his parents. They were talking in the hallway of the house. I found myself in Sam's room, lying on his bed.

"I couldn't control myself..." Sam murmured, sounding regretful. "They were willing to kill Henry, and they smelled so good..."

"Easy, son, we'll handle this," William murmured.

I was stunned to hear that the Winter family knew about their son's true nature, but thinking about it rationally, it made some sense. What if they were... like him? Had they brought me to the house to kill me, or worse, to devour me? I had to escape from there somehow!

But the mattress made a noise as soon as I moved, and the Winter family entered the room. As quickly as I could, I grabbed a lamp from the bedside table as a weapon and pressed myself against the wall.

"Stay away from me!" I shouted at them.

"Henry, calm down. We would never..." Sam began, taking a step towards me.

"Are you going to kill me like you did with them?! Were you just playing with me all this time to ensure an easy prey?!" I cried.

Tears streamed uncontrollably down my cheeks as I articulated each word. The three Winters looked at me with solemn expressions. Sam even seemed pained.

"It's not what you think. Well, not exactly..."

"I saw you bite Ben's head off! You tore Ron's heart out! What am I misunderstanding here?"

William placed a hand on Sam's shoulder and looked at me seriously.

"We're really sorry about what has happened, Henry," he said, then turned to his son. "We'll leave you alone so you can explain all of this calmly."

As soon as his parents left the room, Sam sat down on the bed. He kept his gaze on me, filled with sadness. Did he regret killing Ben and Ron?

"I'm so sorry, Henry. This shouldn't have happened," he began in a somber voice. "I should have told you everything a long time ago, but I was afraid you'd reject me if you found out... what I am. What my parents and I are."

Sam explained that they belonged to a lineage of creatures that had taken on human appearance to blend in among us. His species was characterized by their unique dietary needs: consuming human emotions and thoughts. While some of his kind sustained themselves on fear, happiness, worries, or even memories, the Winters fed on cruelty, consuming the very source of such emotions. All the recent disappearances had been their doing, feeding to survive.

It made sense considering two of the victims were despicable individuals, but...

"What about Harold Littleford? Everyone said he was a good man and an exemplary father."

"Everyone was wrong," Sam replied. "That guy was actually a monster who abused young children, including his own daughter for a while. We found out he was paying one of ours, specifically a memory eater, to erase from his victims' memories the horrible things he did to them. That way, they could go on with their lives as if nothing happened, and he could convince himself his conscience was clear."

Damn it... That man used to organize forest trips for the children in the town when I was young. If what Sam said was true, if my father hadn't forbidden me from going, fearing that my crying might expose him, who knows what would have become of me.

"A scumbag like him was a very delicious prey for us," Sam spoke again. "As for Ben and Ron, they were willing to harm you, even to kill you. They exuded so much cruelty that I could almost taste it in the air. So my desire to save you and my natural instincts... Well, it was impossible for me to control myself. I never devour children, and rarely do so with people our age, because often their cruelty stems from ignorance; and as they grow, they usually come to understand the harm they've caused and become better. But some, like Ben, with so much evil within them, are beyond redemption."

I remained silent, absorbing his words. I had never rejoiced in anyone's death, not even someone as wicked as Ben, but I admit that I was also sure he would have killed me without hesitation. If not for Sam, perhaps I would have been the one dead.

"You're a good person, Henry," he continued. "It would never cross my mind to devour you. Partly because you would taste awful, and partly... because I love you."

Again, I didn't know how to respond. I loved him too, knowing full well that inside him lurked a monster that devoured men... No, in reality, he was a monster that devoured other monsters. And he had saved my life in more ways than one. But still, one last doubt gnawed at me.

"Why did you take me to the forest?" I asked.

Sam smiled sadly and, cautiously in case I rejected him, stood up and took my hand.

"Now that you've turned 18, you're no longer legally obligated to live with your father. I intended to propose that you come live here with me. I talked to my parents about it a few days ago and they agreed."

I choked back an exclamation. I hadn't expected anything like this at all.

"But before proposing it, I wanted to tell you the whole truth about what I am and my nature. Well, now you know; and if you want to leave and never see me again, I'll understand."

I couldn't find words to respond, so I simply cupped his face and kissed him. Sam looked utterly confused when we pulled apart.

"Aren't you afraid or disgusted by me?" he asked.

"Something similar I thought when you sat with me for the first time. You saved me from Ben back then, and today you did it again." "

I kill humans to eat them, Henry. Doesn't that sound insane to you?"

"No one can draw a clear line between sanity and insanity, and we move it depending on how it fits with ourselves."

Sam laughed outright.

"You stole that line from Cowboy Bebop," he said, pinching my nose.

"As you said, I learn fast."

A few days later, I left my father's house to move in with the Winters. He didn't react when I told him I was leaving, except to declare that from now on we would have nothing to do with each other. I agreed, and though I was still saddened by the realization that I wouldn't be in contact with my father anymore, I found solace in the thought that I now had a real family. I didn't care that they were monsters; they had treated me better than many humans throughout my life.

As for the deaths of Ben and Ron, the police found traces of blood in the clearing where they died, but again they couldn't find a convincing suspect, and eventually the case was closed. Although I felt sadness when I thought about their families, if I had to choose between thugs with psychopathic tendencies who tried to kill me, and a creature that only sought to feed and also wanted to protect me, I definitely sided with Sam. It may sound cold and selfish on my part, but I don't regret my decision.

Today, Sam and I are married and have formed our own family. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to meet other monsters, experiencing incredible and terrifying situations. But that's a story for another day.
