Hi all.  This is an old story that happened to me and my then boyfriend a few years ago.  I'm still new to reddit, I only joined after telling my friend this story and she said I should post it here, so if I did it wrong, I'm sorry.  

Anyways, here's the story.  

I was probably 19 when it happened, maybe newly 20.  My, then boyfriend, Christopher, who I called Kitt, was visiting me from Seattle to celebrate my mums birthday in our hometown, a city called Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.  

I was living in Alberta, attending a university there when Kitt arrived.  We were planning on driving out to my mums place together.  I was very eager to introduce him to my family.  They were eager to meet him.  The two of us were excited and giggly while we were getting ready to leave.  I was packing up the last of my schoolwork and clothes while rambling on about what snacks we should buy for the long drive, meanwhile Kitt, who hadn't unpacked from the flight, already had his bags in the car.  He was going to drive for the first half of the drive, and I drive for the second half.  

&#x200B;

after only a couple hours of driving, we had switched and I was driving.  The sun was setting by now.  I remember Kitt pointing out how pretty the pinkish orange sky was.  And before we knew it, it was dark.  

It had still been an uneventful drive.  We were listening to a podcast.  Pointing out owls or raccoons in trash bins when we passed truck stops.  Nothing of note.  Until a deer appeared in the street out of no where.

I slammed on the breaks and we stopped maybe 20 feet from the deer.  And it was just there standing.  Staring back at us.  Not unusual for a deer as I'm sure you all know.  But it was staring for an uncomfortable amount of time.  Even for a deer in headlights.  like three to four minutes at least.  I honked the car horn a couple of times.  No response.  After another couple minutes a guy in a white Honda drove up behind us and stopped.  He was honking too.  And we both sat there honking at this deer.  Or maybe he was honking at me honking at the deer.  Anyways eventually the deer walked off into the woods, his nose pointed in the air.  And we carried on.  The Honda guy was clearly in a rush cause he passed us the second he got the chance, and then we were the ones following him.  

That's when something really weird happened.  We heard a loud, deep voiced, "help!" from a direction I couldn't quite pinpoint.  It was loud enough to be heard over the podcast, yet quiet enough to seem far away.  We slowed down a little bit and glanced at each other.  I suppose just wondering if we actually heard that.  The Honda slowed down too.  We decided it was just a background noise in the Podcast, which was a true crime podcast so it made sense, and carried on driving.  When again we heard a "Help!  Help me please!" at this point the podcast had ended and we slowed down again, looking out the open window.  The voice was the same as the one before, and sounded just as far as the one before, but we were going too fast for anyone to keep up with us.

The guy driving the Honda stuck his hand out his window and gestured us to pull over.  We stopped at a touristry photo area beside a lake with some factory across from it.  I think its a cement plant or something.  The Honda driver and his wife both got out.  They were both in their, maybe late 50s, and asked us if we also heard the cry for help.  We said yes.  And the four of us chatted for a bit about it.  And then, again, from an undetermined direction, "Help!  Please Help!" the older man called out to the voice, "hello?  Is someone there?  Are you ok?" the voice responded "Help!  Please Help!" and he responded "Where are you?  Are you hurt?" the voice sounded significantly closer this time.  And sounded almost contorted "Help!  Is someone there?" the old man, after hearing the change in the voice, went pale white.   He looked at his wife, then at us, then over at the forest, and said, yet much quieter, "hello?" and the voice, once again, though this time much deeper, and even less human sounding, replied "Help!  Is someone there?" we were all kind of freaked out, so the older couple called the police, as did we, and then we went back to driving.  As we continued down the road, Kitt and I didn't talk.  We were both wildly uncomfortable.  We just watched the tree line.  Counting the deer we saw.  Quite a few of them for so late at night.  Although I'm not a deer expert.  Maybe they graze at night or something.  

we eventually arrived at my mothers house, and I told her and my sisters about the event, and they all got really anxious listening to it.  My older sister scolded us, saying "someone could have been in serious danger" and I suppose she was right.  But I'm not sure.  The voice it made didn't sound natural.  The more it called the less human it sounded.  Every cry for help got more and more twisted.  I'm not well educated on the matters of local folklore or mythology.  I don't know if there's some cryptozoological boogeyman out there who could explain it.  Or maybe all of us were just sleep deprived and sharing some sort of mass hysteria. I'm not sure.  But it was still the creepiest event of my life.
