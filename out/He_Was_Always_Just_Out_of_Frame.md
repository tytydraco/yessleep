Hey everyone.
Ever since I was little, people have called me Speedy. Mostly as a joke because I’m disabled, in a wheelchair, and homebound. I’m bringing it up because it matters more than anyone realized.

I grew up in the 90s. When I was a kid, I was slowly losing my ability to walk. Along with that came something else: I talked to myself. Not just mumbling full conversations. Questions. Answers. Laughing at things no one else could hear. I still do it, but I’m more aware of it now. Or at least, I think I am.

No one thought much of it. I wasn’t shy. I had friends. People just assumed it was part of my disability.

One of those friends was named Juan.

I met him when I was about five or six. Most of the kids in my neighborhood were Latino we lived in a mostly Latino area, and I am too. Juan lived about a block away. He came over almost every day. We talked about Ninja Turtles, X-Men, Animaniacs whatever was on TV back then. He sat next to me on the curb. Watched movies with me. Sometimes helped push my chair when my arms got tired.

I never questioned how quiet he was around adults.

I never questioned why he only showed up when I was already outside.

I never questioned why he never knocked.

The first time someone told me Juan wasn’t real, I laughed.

Then my parents said it.

Then my siblings.

Then friends I’d grown up with people who lived on the same street in the 90s told me they didn’t remember any kid named Juan. No family. No house. Nothing.

I told them they were wrong. I remembered him clearly. I remembered birthday parties. Standing next to me with his hand on my shoulder.

When I graduated in 2008, my mom gave me a photo book. Every birthday. Every party. Every friend I’d ever had growing up.

Juan wasn’t in a single picture.

Not one.

There were empty spaces where he should’ve been. Spots next to me that felt wrong like something had been erased, not forgotten.

I’m 36 now, and I’ve stopped pretending this is normal.

I don’t talk to myself the way I used to.
At least, I don’t think I do.

Now, when I catch myself doing it, I try to pay attention. I try to notice whether I’m answering myself or waiting for something else to answer first.

Sometimes, if I glance to the side without turning my head, I think I see someone standing there. Just a shape. A suggestion of a person. I can’t say for sure it’s Juan anymore. I don’t know if it ever was.

It doesn’t matter if the house is empty.

Whatever it is, it doesn’t leave.

The first night I realized it could still touch the world, I was about 20.

I had climbed out of my wheelchair and into bed. My caretaker had already left, and my family was hours away. I was alone. I knew I was alone.

I lay on my side, facing my closed bedroom door.

I heard it creak open.

The room dropped in temperature instantly like winter forced its way in. My breath fogged. My body locked up. I couldn’t move.

I felt breathing behind me.

Slow. Careful.

Footsteps crossed the room, light enough that the floor barely complained. Like whatever it was had learned how not to be noticed.

I grabbed the remote and turned on every light at once.

Nothing.

The door was wide open. The room was warm again. Silent.

I didn’t sleep that night. When my caretaker came back in the morning, I asked if she’d come by during the night.

She said no. She’d been home with her son.

It happened again years later.

This time my parents were home. I woke up freezing. That same unnatural cold. I called out for my dad. He rushed in, half-awake.

“What’s going on?” he asked. Then he stopped. “Why is it so cold in here?”

I never mentioned the temperature.

I asked if he’d been in my room earlier. He said no. He checked the locks. Everything was fine. He told me I was probably dreaming.

But I wasn’t.

Because as he left, I felt something shift beside my bed. Like someone standing up after sitting too long.

I don’t see Juan the way I used to.

I don’t even know if what I see now is him.

All I know is that when I talk to myself, sometimes there’s a pause longer than it should be. Long enough to feel like I’m waiting.

And lately, I’ve had this feeling I can’t shake. I don’t know what it is, or why it’s back after all these years. Nothing has happened yet but it feels the same way it did before. Like the air is holding its breath. Like something is leaning closer.

Sometimes the room gets cold for no reason.

Sometimes the floor creaks once, softly, like someone adjusting their weight.

I don’t know when it’s going to happen again.
I don’t know what again even means anymore.

All I know is this feeling hasn’t been wrong before.

And if I’m being honest, I’m starting to worry that whatever I’ve been calling “talking to myself”…

…was never just me.

If you have questions, ask them.
I’ll try to answer. Just nothing too personal
