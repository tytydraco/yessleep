Hello readers, Thank you all for your support and advice. Before I get into the update I want to address some of your questions and concerns.

Multiple people asked me to call the police, They have been called but since nothing really happened to us we weren’t sure what to report. In the end we called them and asked them to do a welfare check. To our disappointment they found the house completely empty and my parents were nowhere to be found. 

I dont think demonic possession is involved, Theres definitely something going on but I dont feel like this is a fruitful avenue to pursue. I will, however, consult a priest. 

So the missed calls, they were from a landline, possibly a payphone, so no texts were left and there were a few voicemails. None of them with any real content. A few had shallow breathing and a crackling in the background. These voicemails quickly ended as if someone had accidentally stayed on the line too long. As for what they were I have 2 theories. A: my “real” family trying to call me and warn me B: It was my family trying to call us back to the house.

The phone in the house being inoperative. I believe it was deliberately disconnected, Either to stop incoming calls or to stop use from making outside calls. 

My girlfriend is scared but were doing fine. The loss of King has been tough on us. I wish I had taken his collar or something, It just didn’t occur to me at the time. 

The hole. I couldn’t find any natural way to mention the hole to the police. They didn’t mention anything to me either. To further describe the hole, It was a large deep ditch, I couldn’t see the bottom from where I was standing but it was about 20 feet across and tapered inward, getting deeper towards the center before a steep edge where a smaller pit was. The smaller pit I couldn’t see the bottom of but it was the size of a well. 

Any other questions or comments will be answered in future parts. 

Heres whats happened in the past week: 

The first day was normal, We unpacked what little luggage we had in our car. We left a large amount of our belongings in the house. The next morning we called the police and tried to call back the number that had left so many missed calls, This proved unfruitful. I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept getting spooked by normal small noises around the house. Scared to even get out of bed. 

In the morning I sat with my coffee staring out into the backyard. This is when I noticed the dirty set of footprints tracking across our porch. They were large boot prints circling the house. It might seem immature but I cried, I was so exhausted and stressed the rollercoaster of emotions finally weighed on me. I showed my girlfriend but she was only interested in rationalizing. She explained it was probably a neighbor or someone we had doing yard work. I agreed with her to avoid conflict, I knew it was a lie. 

Later in the evening I was smoking out back, a habit I had successfully broken only recently. From the edge of our yard I heard a familiar heart breaking sound.  A light, subtle, palpable, jingling noise. I shot up in my chair, a mix of excitement, relief, and fear coursed through my veins. I slowly walked to the edge of the yard. I approached a crouched low form stalking int the brush, I was met with a low threatening growl.  As I backed away I could see the glint of bared teeth in the encroaching moonlight. Possibly also the reflective eyes of an animal. I retreated to the house and didn’t mention anything to my girlfriend, But I’m sure now she knew something happened. All night we listened to the sounds in the yard, The running, growling, barking, and the heartbreaking jingle. Occasionally a scratch at one of the doors or windows. At some point I fell asleep from the exhaustion. 

Yesterday Morning I ventured outside to take a look, again, paw prints circled my home. Some of the prints were on the wall, where the beast jumped up to peer into our home. 
I went to work as if nothing was going on. At work I couldn’t help worrying, I couldn’t get anything done. On my way home I received a call from my girlfriend that someone was trying to get inside the house. Im usually a very safe driver but My foot was to the floor the whole way home. When I arrived the door was wide open, A large footprint in the center of the door, With splinters of the frame littering our front room. I feared the worst and called out to my girlfriend. She screamed from the bedroom. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and rushed in.   
There was no one in the room besides us and i comforted my girlfriend as she told me what happened 

“ It was your father but there’s something wrong, its not him. “ She whimpered in my arms.  Before I could even process what had happened a sound came from the other room, This is when I remembered that the door was left wide open. Peeking around the kitchen I came face to face with him, my father. He looked taller In filthy ragged clothes.His skin was loose, pale, and sickly. His eye’s dark and inhuman. Something subtle about the eyes were what gives it away. The angle or shape is just so slightly different. He lurched forward slowly before speaking, In a disjointed and labored tone. “ you know, you really upset your mother leaving without telling anybody … We were supposed to have a nice family christmas! I was going to ask you to come to work with me. Now i want you to apologize! I want you to come back and- “ He was cut off. 

As he made his advance I kept the knife hidden. Before he could finish his reprimand I pounced slamming the knife down into his collarbone. An unholy shriek rang out into the room, so loud it left my ears ringing. A torrent of black blood spewed forth onto me and the carpet as my father scuttled out of the house on all fours. The blood burned my skin and left dark stains on the carpet. I sat crying over the event. 

This morning I cleaned up the house a bit as we debated calling the police, we came to the conclusion that we were too deep. I had potentially just killed someone I had previously conducted a search on, We figured we would just fold off for now, we could reassess In the future. In the evening I get this odd feeling, like a call. It was one word over and over, “ HOME” It rang out in my head all night. 

In the last hour I was helping replace our front door when I heard a rustle from the nearby bushes. I cant recall what made me pursue it. The growling came as I knelt down In front of the bush. I reached out an arm. The growling fell slightly. “ King?” I called out tears welling. In an instant the form struck forward. I was able to block it with my arm, 
Thick teeth sunk deep into my flesh as I flung the dog away and grabbed at my wound. I ran back into the house to bandage it. I am sitting at the computer typing this up as the call plays over and over in my mind. I have to go . 

I Have to go back
