The first time I noticed the door, I was walking down the hall to grab my coat. It was plain and unassuming, tucked between the bathroom and the guest bedroom.

I stopped in my tracks. I’d been staying at Jake’s house for nearly a month while my apartment was being fumigated, and I’d walked this hallway a dozen times. That door wasn’t there before.

“Hey, Jake?” I called out, heading into the kitchen where he was making coffee. “When did you put in a new door?”

Jake didn’t look up from his mug. “What door?”

“The one in the hall, next to the guest room.”

He finally glanced up, frowning. “There’s no door there, babe.”

I blinked. “Yes, there is. I just saw it.”

He chuckled, shaking his head. “You’re imagining things.”

I didn’t push it at the time. Maybe I was mistaken. Maybe I’d just never noticed it before. But later that night, after Jake had gone to bed, I found myself standing in front of the door again.

It wasn’t locked. The handle turned easily under my hand, but when I pushed, it didn’t budge. It was like the door was just for show, a fake.

Still, the sense of wrongness lingered.

The next morning, I decided to ask Jake about it again. “That door in the hallway—are you sure you don’t know anything about it?”

He didn’t answer right away. His jaw tightened as he stirred his coffee. “I already told you,” he said. “There’s no door there.”

“But I—”

“Drop it, okay?” His voice was sharp, final.

I tried to let it go, but the door haunted me. Every time I passed it, I felt a pull, like it was daring me to open it again.

A few nights later, Jake fell asleep early, and I couldn’t resist. Armed with a flashlight and a butter knife, I slipped down the hallway.

This time, when I turned the handle and pushed, the door opened.

The room inside was pitch black, and for a moment, I considered turning back. But then I saw something glinting in the light of my flashlight—something metallic.

I stepped inside.

The room was small and windowless, the air stale and suffocating. The walls were lined with shelves, and on those shelves were boxes. Dozens of them, each one labeled with a name.

My stomach turned when I spotted the one with my name on it.

I pulled it down, my hands shaking. Inside were things I hadn’t even realized were missing: my favorite earrings, an old diary, a polaroid of me at a party years ago—before I’d even met Jake.

Underneath it all was a leather-bound notebook.

I opened it to the first page and froze. It was a detailed timeline of my life. Not just the big things—birthdays, graduations—but little things, too. The day I got my first cat. The time I sprained my ankle. The first time I ever spoke to Jake.

The last entry stopped me cold.

She’s asking about the door again. I’ll have to deal with her soon.

The notebook slipped from my hands as a sound behind me made me whirl around. Jake was standing in the doorway, his face unreadable.

“I said you should forget about the door,” he said softly, stepping into the room.

I backed away, but he moved closer, blocking the exit.

“You weren’t supposed to see this,” he continued, his voice calm and measured. “It’s not time yet.”

“Time for what?” I whispered.

“For us,” he said, reaching for the box in my hands. “I’ve been planning this for so long. You just had to be patient.”

My mind raced as I stumbled back, knocking over a shelf. Another box tumbled to the floor, spilling its contents—photos, journals, even a lock of hair.

But the name on the box wasn’t mine.

It was Emily.

“Who the hell is Emily?” I demanded, panic rising.

Jake didn’t answer. He just smiled, the kind of smile that made my blood run cold.

“She didn’t understand,” he said simply. “But you will. You’ll see why this is necessary.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I shoved past him, sprinting down the hall and out the front door.

I’ve been staying at a friend’s place ever since, but Jake keeps calling. He leaves me voicemails every day, apologizing, begging me to come back.

But the last message he left wasn’t an apology.

“I know you’re scared,” he said, his voice calm and steady. “But you need to come home. It’s time we finish what we started.”
