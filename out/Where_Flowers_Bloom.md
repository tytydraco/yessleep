It was weekend and me and my friends were hanging out on the basketball court all 8 of us. There used to be 11 but they changed up. There was TJ, Taya, Mag or Maggie, Little Queen and Big Queen who were twins , Aera my best friend and Davonte then of course me Rene. There was a lot of us and a lot to keep up with. The neighborhood wasn't the best we still liked to go out at late hours of the night. People knew us all around our neighborhood even in the alley ways and the corner stores where god knows what happens there, they all knew us. This park was like our territory, like our home.

When I was younger coming to this park  I was told to never go into the woods. So as kids do, I decided today is the day where I go into the forest. Before the trail that seems like it never ends is a field of flowers. Me, TJ, and Little Queen left into the field and we reached fence that never seemed to be there before. On the fence it had writing that said nelli waz here and a couple of \_+\_ there was Z+D, A+L an one that was scratched out horribly that said R+J. "Well guys if I do this can I be Big Queen" Little queen said. "Its too late for that" Davonte said then the rest of them shoved us toward the fence so we would climb it. 

We climbed the fence and said our goodbyes and Taya recorded us Going away. We heard only the wind and the sound of our own breath. We were of a couple of minutes in the eerie forest and Little Queen wanted to leave. 

Then the sound of our steps would be echoed. I stopped and Little Queen and TJ followed after me. We were all frozen. We heard the sounds of Steps getting closer. I could hear my own heartbeat and I almost could hear all the others heartbeats too. Flowers started blooming out the ground and in less than a minute grew taller than the average sunflower. The flowers started to weep very quickly then the roots ripped it self out the ground. 

The flowers were crawling. One grabbed Little Queen but there was no time to turn back.

My gut told me to run but I was froze. TJ Had to push me as he ran by so I can break the trance I was in. As I ran I heard screams and slowly realized it was Little Queen. I seen Big Queen running toward us to retrieve her twin but she ended in the same tragic fate. We don't know what truly happened to the Queen Twins but we never reached that gate that we longed for we were literally running for our lives. 

Eventually I got tired took a break and found a gate covered in thorns and led TJ to it. We got scratched and but got out. When we left all we heard was screams of desperate children trying to escape. I didn't know where we were but a flower started to grow out of my hand and One on TJs neck.  I slowly rotted away and felt myself spread and slowly become a gruesome flower who only wanted to escape.
