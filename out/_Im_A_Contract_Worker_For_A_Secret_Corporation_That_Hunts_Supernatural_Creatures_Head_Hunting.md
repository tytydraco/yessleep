[Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h58wfw/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

I should have been resting for a little while longer, but I’d gotten so bored I couldn't deal with being stuck at home for one more day. I hadn’t gotten any emails for jobs which I assumed was because of Klaus. What he didn’t know was that I had enough connections to land a job. Since I started working again, I had added a few new contacts to my phone. Seeing the new names gave me an odd feeling.  

Cameron heard I started working with Agents more often a while ago. She requested I put a good word in for her. Soon, we started exchanging cat memes. I think she enjoyed being able to talk with someone who didn’t care that she was a succubus.   

I asked Harp if she knew of any good jobs. Someone must have gotten to her before I did, and she refused to tell me until my broken bones were fully on the mend. The traitor. I turned to April, who just called me a nerd and refused to share information about work.   

Evie came through for me. I asked her what August was up to. She told me about a head-hunting job starting a few minutes after I sent her the message. I offered to keep an eye on him, and soon she sent over the key that would magically connect my apartment door to that location.   

I found myself in a busy field just outside a forest—of course, the job would be in a forest. There was a mixture of Agents and Contract Workers. I didn’t see any Hunters, which made me already know some details of this request. I tracked down someone in charge to get some more information.   

I was given a basket like the one I had used for trash. I attached it to my hip and rented out a small sword. Headhunting was exactly what it sounded like. There were some monsters wreaking havoc inside the forest that needed to be killed. Each person would be paid per head. It sounded gruesome, but most of the time these monsters were raging beasts without any kind of intelligence. And nearly all the time these kinds of monsters were the results of the Hunters.  

The Hunter organization had some serious money backing them. They had a great deal of secret labs where they experimented on monsters trying to create weapons to kill other supernatural creatures Often those experiments got loose and The Corporation needed to clean up the mess. The Hunters always used sneaky tactics so they could never be blamed for the labs. Their favorite excuse was to say the ones working at the labs weren’t associated with the main organization.   

Due to the danger of this sort of job, the weaker Agents and Contract Workers needed to go in pairs. I spotted someone in the crowd I knew and called out to him.  

Jacob turned. When he saw who had shouted his name he scowled and then started to walk away. Even after our meeting at the card convention he still didn’t like me much. He looked different from the last time I’d seen him. His hair was tied back, and he wore form-fitting clothing. Any sense of style was replaced with function. His shoes were practical, and he wore a few blades around his waist. He looked to be getting stronger, but I still worried about him.  

I needed to find a partner. I kept scanning the busy crowd hoping to see August. Instead, someone else found me.  

A shorter man called me over. My stomach tightened when I realized who it was. I hoped to not run into him again so soon. At least our meeting was quick.  

“Richmond, was it? Could you partner up with Kurt for tonight?” Lupa asked as he gestured towards another man nearby.  

He heard his name and gave a small wave. From the looks of things, Kurt was another Contract Worker. He also had a basket on his hip. There was a holster for a small pistol on his thigh. Overall, he didn’t appear overly fit. In fact, he looked so thin I wondered if one good hit might be enough to take him out.  

“I don’t mind. I'm ready to go whenever he is.” I nodded.  

We both started towards the forest as most of the Agents had already gotten to work. I saw August and called out to him hoping the three of us could work together. He barely acknowledged me and kept walking. That was odd. It was fine if he already had paired up with someone, but his smile appeared forced. I expected him to at least come over to give me an update about Lucas.  

“What a cold shoulder. Is that an ex or something?” Kurt joked.  

“No. I think he just has some personal stuff going on. Let’s get started before everyone else clears out the forest.” I said pushing the exchange out of my mind.  

We didn’t go very far into the woods by the time we came across the first body. Only the Contract Workers needed to collect the heads to be paid. The Agents were paid differently. Most of them did this job to protect humans and often didn’t even accept the full amount offered.   

The creature was human-like and thin. The skin was a pale blue color. An Agent had killed this creature and left the body to be collected later. The creature's eyes were a gross milky white that budged out of their sockets. The nose was nothing but slits in the face and the teeth were extended sharp points that didn't fully fit inside the mouth. Kurt stopped to give the creature a slight nudge to make sure it was dead. He then got down pulling a long knife ready to cut off the creature’s head.  

“What? It would be a waste to let it sit here.” He said without an ounce of shame.  

It would take him too long to saw off the head. I wanted to keep going not just because of the money. The more we kill the less likely other people fighting tonight would get hurt.  

“Can I see your basket for a second?”  

Kurt stopped in his grim task to consider if he trusted me enough. Carefully he handed over the basket and watched as I shoved the creature's head inside. The baskets had a spell on them to transport only these creatures through and to a processing area. I looked hard trying to see the threads of magic making the spell work. It wasn’t a complex spell, so I was able to turn it off for a second. Turning off the spell was basically closing the door. As I removed the basket, I turned the spell back on. The creature’s head had been neatly cut off when the spell stopped. Kurt didn’t understand what I had just done. He turned over his basket trying to understand what had just happened.  

“I’ll send the heads through for us. It'll be much faster that way.” I told him but didn’t explain myself.  

“Alright. Thanks.” He carefully said.   

I bet he was trying to think of what sort of half-breed or creature I might be. I just was overly good at controlling magic compared to other humans, nothing more. We carried on looking for any more signs of the creatures lurking in the trees.  

I kept my ears strained trying to pick up any sounds of distress. These experiments may appear weak but would be a problem for even an Agent if they attacked in numbers.   

“How long have you been doing this job?” Kurt asked, trying to break the tension.  

I didn’t think it was time for a chat, but I answered to humor him.  

“On and off since I turned eighteen.” I told him.  

He appeared on the younger side. I bet I had more experience killing monsters than he did. At least he wasn’t scared so I didn’t need to worry about him getting spooked and then running off the moment a monster appeared.  

“How did you get into this job? I mean, if you’re human then most likely a monster ate someone you cared about.”  

I sighed, not wanting to get into all of this. Most Hunters were humans who had been hurt by a monster in the past or were close with someone who had been. The job of a Hunter was revenge. Contract Workers were after money.  

“My mother was a Contract Worker. She never wanted me to follow in her footsteps, but I’ve been around supernatural creatures since I was born. I started working after she died. Can we now focus on the task at hand? These creatures are going to hear us and try to jump us.”  

Kurt waved away my concern. The sun had started to set, and I wasn’t looking forward to being ambushed in the dark.  

“We’ll be able to hear those clumsy things a mile away.” He shrugged.  

“Above you.” I told him.  

It took him a second to realize my warning. I pulled him out of the way just in time for one of those creatures to fall from the branches. It landed hard, mouth open and screeching. It recovered quickly and moved fast on all fours. I almost didn’t get my sword out in time to slash at its claws. I cut it before it reached me. Since it was focused on trying to rip my guts out, it didn’t notice Kurt. He drew his pistol and fired once into the large white eye of the monster. It collapsed into the dirt. I drove the sword into the skull just in case. No such thing as overkill when it came to monsters. The creature jerked and twitched as I pulled the blade back out.  

“Came I have this one?” Kurt asked with a half-smile on his face.  

I assumed he needed the money more than myself. I nodded and took his basket again. When I started to put the creature's head inside the basket, the mouth moved on its own. I pulled away but a few teeth caught my hand. The cut wasn’t that bad. It just stung a little.  

Kurt was nice enough to clean the blood off my hand with some tissues he had in his pocket. He slapped a Band-Aid on the small wound. We were ready to keep moving, this time with much less talking.  

When night fell, small floating lights started to appear. They had been made by some Agents so the ones who couldn’t see in the dark had more of a fighting chance. We ended up killing three more of those creatures but didn’t bump into anyone else. Kurt made sure to land the killing blow so he would be the one to claim the bounty. I was doing most of the work, but I didn’t care enough to make a big deal about it. If August was here, then that meant I could get a free dinner at his place after this job. I could afford one day without pay if someone needed it more.  

“I think they overestimated how many of these creatures are here. We haven’t come across that many. I was hoping we wouldn’t be able to go ten steps without finding them.” Kurt said after two hours.  

“There were a lot of people here tonight. Maybe they already got to them?” I suggested.  

We’d come across five headless bodies. It did feel like a bit of a low number considering how many people I saw entering the forest to take care of this job. Maybe there wasn’t a lot of contract work right now? It was a bit odd to have so many Agents for such a low threat level.  

“We haven’t seen anyone either. Kinda weird.” Kurt pointed out.  

“Not really. Most Agents have better senses than us. They know where we are from a hundred feet away. They’ll only come if we need help. They want to cover more ground so no sense in grouping up.” I explained.  

“Is that so...” Kurt muttered to himself from behind me.  

I kept walking, my eyes scanning the dark trees looking for movement. I heard a shot echo through the trees. At first, I thought Kurt was in danger. I turned, trying to see the threat only to find him standing, gun drawn in my direction. An odd warmth started to flow down my side. I glanced down to see something my brain hadn’t caught up to yet. I had been shot in the back.  

“What...?” I asked my brain in shock.  

Kurt tossed something at my feet. His smile appeared even more menacing in the dim light. I found my legs grew unsteady. I collapsed to my knees, staring in horror at the charm made of twigs. It was a simple triangle with the bloody tissue and a piece of those creature’s flesh in the middle.   

“Oh, you know what that is? It'll attract all these creatures to you. Dead or alive, they’ll come racing through the forest to eat you.”  

He started to take a few steps backward ready for a creature to appear at any second. This asshat had been planning all this from the moment we entered the forest. He made sure I didn’t have any family to miss me. He gauged the strength of the creatures so he knew he could easily kill them. And he made sure no one was around to see him carry out his plan.  

“Why...?” I asked as I struggled to get to my feet.   

He raised his hand to rub his thumb and finger together.  

“Money. Kindness doesn’t pay the bills. They’ll always be more Contract Workers and they’ll always be dying on the job.”  

I gritted my teeth for being so stupid. When it came to this job you needed people on your side to stay alive. I’d been lucky enough to never encounter someone ready to throw others under a bus to get ahead.  

I heard sounds of something tearing through the woods towards us. I didn’t have much time. I placed a hand over my wound and pumped magic into it. It hurt like hell, but it closed the bullet wound enough for me to stand and move. When the monster came crashing through the trees Kurt realized why so many Agents had been requested.  

The beast was massive. It had a long body with arms and legs along the side. The head was made of other skulls piled onto each other. Some fused while others stuck out. Kurt fired three shots into the exposed eyes but didn’t seem like it affected the monster in the slightest. We watched in horror as the monster's arms stretched from the body, and then fused together into a mass. It wrapped around a young tree then ripped it from the ground roots and all.  

The tree came down on Kurt. I put everything I had into running in his direction. I grabbed him around the waist in time for us to roll away from the deadly blow. The creature kept slamming the tree into others nearby and above our heads. We stayed ducked down waiting for the right moment to move.  

“We can’t kill it on our own.” I told him explaining why I’d saved his life.  

He nodded, face pale from fear. I just hoped he wasn’t going to shoot me in the back again. My side hurt like a bitch, but I got up and ran towards the monster dodging blows. Kurt kept shooting aiming for weak points in the heads keeping the creature unfocused.   

No matter how many limbs I sliced off, it felt endless. My stamina wasn’t endless as well as Kurt’s ammo. We needed to think of something fast. I fell back to hide behind a tree signaling him to do the same. While I was catching my breath, Kurt was doing something else. He'd taken a piece of chalk to start drawing a large rectangle on the wide tree trunk he was hiding behind.  

The magic doors were a simple concept. Draw a door, insert the key in the drawn-on lock then the fake door will become a real one. If you had access to a real door, you had permission to use, you could insert the key for the same result.   

Kurt had his hand on the handle ready to bail when the monster curled around the tree. He ducked as the long body wrapped around the large trunk, easily snapping it in half destroying the door and the one-use key in the process. The monster lowered its collection of heads eating away at the wood confused about where the magic it sensed had gone off to.  

Well, there goes that idea. I didn’t have a key to get us away from here. Kurt appeared too scared to move and would be eaten in the next few seconds. My sword wasn’t doing enough damage. I needed to think of something.  

I stared hard at the creature looking at the flow of magic it held looking for a weak spot. It held most of its power inside its many heads. The heads we were supposed to be collecting.  

An idea came to me. I raced over and climbed up the abomination avoiding snapping teeth. I ripped the basket from my waist and shoved it over the first head I saw. I then shut off the spell, cutting off the head, and moved on to another. The beast screamed in pain. If we had any chance at killing this thing, we needed to take off the heads.   

I was tossed off landing hard on the ground. My lungs and muscles burned from the effort. Kurt stayed on his knees, his mind overwhelmed by shock. Yes, he tried to kill me, but I pushed past that to save us.  

I was slammed down to the ground at least five times. My body wanted to give up. I refused. I swallowed my pain and fear to keep fighting. When I was tossed aside for the final time, the monster was done with me. It grabbed a hold of my chest with a powerful large hand to keep me still as its neck transformed. All the heads fused into one. The long neck transformed into something snake-like. The face shot out towards mine; mouth open with countless teeth waiting to rip into my flesh.  

Two shots rang out. Kurt had used the last of his ammo to distract the monster long enough for me to force the basket over its head. I turned the spell off, finally killing the gruesome beast.  

I let myself sit on the rough ground to collect myself. Kurt slowly walked over to remove the large hand from around my chest. He sat next to me, eyes wide and face nothing but a blank expression.   

“Hey...” I said and my voice made him jump. “Are we cool?”  

I was done fighting for the night. After a rest, I could only walk out of the forest. If Kurt wanted to kill me, he could have. I was more beat up than he was. I waited for his answer praying he trusted me enough to not tell anyone he had tried to murder me. He slowly nodded his head. That was a relief.  

I finally stood up, my every cell protesting.   

“Are you guys alright?” A voice asked as a figure came through the woods.  

“August?” I said a bit surprised he found us.  

His clothing was clean. If he had fought those creatures that night, he’d had an easier time than us. I was glad to see him, but something felt off. His smile was different. It made a chill run down my spine. I even looked at his magic flow to make sure it was really him.  

“What happened here?” He questioned.   

I nodded towards the creature as if that was all that was needed. August silently walked through the ruined area of the forest following our fight. He bent down and brushed away some broken branches to pick something off the ground. He held it out to show us the broken charm Kurt used to lure that massive monster in our direction. At least we knew no more of those creatures would be coming our way.  

“Oh, uh... We made that because we weren’t finding anything.” Kurt said nervously.  

I didn’t like the expression on August’s face. I couldn’t read him in the dim light. He felt so distant even though he was only a few steps away.   

“Why does Richmond have a healed bullet wound?” He said in a low accusing voice.  

My hand covered the spot on reflex. An ache started in my chest. I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came. I already knew nothing I said would stop what was about to happen.  

Kurt realized it as well. He started running but August caught up to him in a second. The smaller man was knocked down and rolled on his back. He begged and pleaded to be just arrested. August didn’t listen to a single word. He took Kurt’s head into his hands and leaned in close.  

“How many Contract Workers have you killed?” August asked in such a dark voice it scared me.  

“ Arrest me and I’ll admit to everything.” Kurt replied, his voice on the verge of tears.  

That was the wrong answer. I wanted to look away, but I forced myself to watch. August turned his hands into sharp claws. No matter how much Kurt struggled, he couldn’t get free. The tip of the claw came down in the middle of his forehead causing him to freeze. August slowly dragged down the claw through the middle of the other man’s face. His cold expression never changed. When he reached under the chin, he stopped. Then, he placed his thumbs on either side of the long cut and pulled. A cracking sound echoed through the woods as August pulled open Kurt’s face. He finally let his human mask slip. His monstrous face lunged downwards to devour the soft tender brains waiting for him inside the now halved skull.  

I must have fainted then. My next memories were waking up on a cot inside a small medical tent. My body hurt and I felt too exhausted to sit up. A pair of hands reached over to adjust the blanket over my chest.   

August sat next to me, silently ensuring I was comfortable.   

“Did Lupa put you up to that?” I asked my voice cracked from a dry throat.  

He nodded confirming my suspicions. Lupa didn't like wasting resources. He simply would not turn a blind eye to someone disposing of something he could use. He also knew Kurt wouldn’t admit to all of his crimes. The only way to know for certain how many lives had been lost was to use August. Being able to absorb information by eating someone’s brain was a rare useful skill.   

“How many people did he kill?” I sat and forced myself to sit up.  

“Six. But that’s just the Contract Workers. Who knows how many people those Contract Workers could have saved?”   

My stomach hurt from stress. I hated what happened that night. I hated that August had been used to kill someone. And I hated I had been used to bait out a killer.  

“I was selfish. I didn’t want you to come tonight because I knew Lupa would have picked you for this. I would have rather a random Contract Worker risking their life instead of you.” August admitted.  

“That’s...” I started unable to put my thoughts into words.  

If I hadn’t been here Jacob may have been picked. He would have died in those woods and Kurt most likely would have been eaten before August reached could save him. The truth Jacob would have died for would be lost. August was all alright with that outcome. He knew my train of thought. His smile didn’t reach his eyes as he slightly shook his head.  

“I am a monster after all.”  

I already knew that. August was a good father and a kind friend. He was also a monster. And I had been working to accept both sides of him.   

“What’s going on with you? Something else is wrong.” I said wanting to not think about what happened that night.  

He appeared shocked I had picked up on his mood. Being used to kill a troublesome human was nothing new to him. He internally debated on if he wanted to spill the beans.  

“Lucas’ remaining family wants to take care of him. His aunt and uncle are getting ready to start taking him during the week and I’ll have him on weekends.”  

My mouth dropped open. No wonder he had been acting odd. I didn’t want to believe after everything he’s done well that Lucas was going to be taken away.  

“But you’re the one who adopted him! Where were they then?” I pressed my cheeks getting hot.  

Strangely enough, August softly laughed.  

“I ate a man’s brain in front of you. Twice. And you still say something like that. It's true, I love him and will do anything to make him happy. But I’m not human. He should be with his biological family and around humans who’ll understand him. It’s... frustrating but I’ll always treasure the time I had with him.”  

He sounded like he’d already given up. I shook my head, not wanting to believe this. Even after everything I seen him do, I couldn’t bear the thought of him losing the son he loved so much.   

“It’s alright. For now, I still get to see him. You’ve had a long night so don’t worry about it. Get some more rest and then head straight home.”  

August stood up ready to leave. He needed to fill out a report and tell the higher-ups the information he learned from his snack. I hated how I couldn’t do anything for him. At that moment I felt a little bit worthless.  

When I finally came home, I found out I had gotten paid for the heads Kurtis sent in. He must not have any family for the money to go to instead. It still felt dirty to accept it. I donated the payment to a homeless charity not wanting to use it to my own goals.   

Guilt still sat heavy in my stomach. I understood why things happened in the way they did. It didn’t stop how conflicted I was. Cameron sent me a random text. Unaware of how I was feeling I ended up talking to her for a few hours doing my best to keep my mind off things. One more job down, but I had accomplished nothing.
