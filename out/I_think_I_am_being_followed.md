I am currently inside a cabin within Yellowstone National Park, and I believe something may be following me.

I'll explain why.

Once upon a time, me and my family thought it'd be a good idea to go on a camping trip for our summer vacation. Normally we'd be camping for a day or two, but we decided that we would rather stay in Yellowstone for about a week before heading back home. So, we packed our stuff and settled on staying in the Indian Creek Campground. We had fun momentarily, but then my uncle didn't show up for our scheduled reconvention. We figured, "Hey, he probably went on a wrong track," due to the fact he had done so on a prior hiking trip, we went out looking for him. Eventually, we split up. 

Without thinking, I went out searching alone, and I couldn't regret it more.

I had walked into a woody area, and kept calling him by name for quite a while until I looked back, and saw that I couldn't remember where I came from. I shouted out for help, but I had gone so far to the point where my family couldn't even hear me calling for help. I tried to dial 911, but I had no signal. With no sign of finding my way back, I thought that if I walked in a certain direction, I would eventually find a campsite from which I could have gotten helped. Following that train of thought, I ventured out into the unknown.

It had reached night time by the time I got worried that I may end up never to be found, or that I may up dead by the time they find me. I had seen a horror story or two and I know what happened in the ending, so I checked over my shoulder every second or so. Soon enough, I jumped at the sound of every crack or hoot I heard after I recalled what happened in Friday the 13th. But nothing creeped me out more than what happened following all that paranoia. 

Silence. Total silence. No croaking, no chirping, no nothing. I walked in a pace slower than that of a turtle! "Is there a bear behind me, or in front of me?" I felt like I had been being watched.

\*thud\* 

My heart skipped a beat. Nothing I had ever heard before were alike to the sound I had heard in that moment. A loud, \*booming\* sound, that sounded like it came right behind me. I froze.

\*thud\* \*thud\*

A pattern akin to that of a human walking.

"...I am being followed." My hair stood up.

I immediately realize the amount of danger I am in. I begin walking in an accelerated pace. 

They're getting quicker by the minute. I turned around.

An \*inhuman\*, human face. Though blurred, I could make out what I had seen. 

It bared an open mouth which revealed staggeringly large teeth, out of regular proportion, coupled with each eye wide open, unblinking, staring at me from above. 9 feet tall. The thing smiled.

Dread, pure dread.

I start running through the dark. I didn't care anymore. Adrenaline fueled my body.

 I felt impending doom heading my way. I could only feel dread while running from that \*thing\*. 

I kept on running, until I spot a lone, wooden cabin. I open the door and lock it. I hide under a bed.

I take out my phone. "I have a signal!" I lift my hand up in relief. I dial 911. A woman picked up the call.

"Yellowstone Interagency Communication Center, what is your emergency?"

"Hey! I need help, I can't find my way back to my family, some THING hunted me down and I-"

"Sir, where are you currently situated?"

"I don't know, I'm in a cabin, alone. I don't see anyone or anything near except for tha-"

"Remain calm. You hallucinated and we don't want that now, do we? We need the exact information."

"Ok, ok, thank you."

She told me to look out the window and to tell her if I see anything that could help in pinpointing my location. I proceed to tell her what I could see.

"I see some snow, and I see the moon in front of the cabin... I think that thing went away-"

"Alright, I think we know where you are at. We're sending help right away."

She hung up. 

I'm shocked at how quick they are at their job. I thought they'd take a while, but they're very efficient, and I'm glad. I don't like how she made out what I saw to be a hallucination, however.

I go on to send a text to my family group chat.

"Hey. I couldn't find my way back to the campsite. I've contacted 9/11, they're sending help my way. Something may be following me, something out to get me... Have you found \*my uncle\* yet? Is he okay?"

They haven't replied yet. 

I begin to write what you are reading right now soon after that. I don't even know if I'm safe or not. But if I'm not, well, you'll know what happened to me.  

Oh, and I've told my family about what happened too. Hopefully they'll believe me. I'm waiting for help to arrive right now, I hope they're coming soo-

They're here! I hear them knocking! I'm gonna go look, I'll be right back.

...They're not here. IT is here.
