I hadn’t seen him in years. The visits were much more frequent in my childhood, for whatever reason. 

The most embarrassing times were when he’d visit at a friend’s sleepover. This was before I understood.

The moments of my childhood where I was most afraid, like moving from our hometown or my mother undergoing chemotherapy or my older brother being rehabilitated for violent behavior, always seemed to be when the little man managed to crawl out from under my bed the most. 

He normally headed from my bed to whatever corner was closest and linger in that shadow and stare back at me. His eyes barely stood out in the darkness.

Sometimes the little man would simply stand there in the shadows and observe me. I’d drowsily fade in and out of cognizance as I’d see the little man stagger in place, scratch his chin, adjust his posture. More than once I swear he whispered my name.

I would open my eyes and face the shadowy corner head on. My body would freeze. From out of the corner the little man would shuffle towards me. He himself darker than the shadows. 

I tried my hardest but was never able to stir a single limb as the little man climbed up the side of my bed. 

The little man sat on my chest, crossed his legs and put his hands at his thighs as he scrutinized my wide open eyes. My breathing would be in short bursts due to my constrained efforts at screaming.

These moments I remember the most, of the little man examining my face and me completely unable to move, to call out for help. I became familiar with the little man who sat on my chest this way.

Until, eventually, I would finally manage to scream. It would always end with my scream. 

To this day I never know where the little man goes.

One of the last times the little man visited was when I slept in the guest room of my then girlfriend’s stepfather’s home. Only this time the little man had grown. He seemed to be seven feet tall.

The tall man laid on top of me. 

His face aligned with my face, and his body aligned with my body. 

He smothered me like this until I couldn’t breathe anymore. 

All I remember is Elizabeth and her stepfather standing over me with faces full of worry.

The little man returned last night. 

He crawled out of the bed like he used to. 

He shuffled to the corner of the room like he used to. 

He made his way up the side of the bed like he used to.

The little man crawled onto my chest. He crossed his legs and focused on my eyes.

My wife said the sounds of my strange breathing woke her up last night. It sounded like I was suffocating. She said she couldn’t get me to move for what seemed like hours. I didn’t scream, which is maybe why it took forever for me to wake up. 

At this point in my life I’m old enough not to be afraid of the little man, but I can’t help freaking out over what could've possibly made him decide to pay me a visit last night.
