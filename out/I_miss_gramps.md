For as long as I can remember, Gramps been a cheery old man. With fluffy white hair and a clean shaven face adorned with wrinkles. We used to visit him often, but after Grandma died, the tradition kind of fell off. So I feel like you can imagine my shock when for the first time in 9 years, we decided to pay him a visit.

He greeted us at the door, a few new wrinkles, a bit less hair, but definitely still my beloved gramps. My mum and dad had wanted to leave me with him, so they could have a bit of fun without having to worry about me, so they dropped me off, and went on their merry way, my mum reminding me to call her later.

Me and gramps first settled down with lunch, I was starving, and God, he sure knows how to cook. He was a chef before he retired. So after some incredible lasagna he asked me about the journey, and I told him it was fun, and that I was happy to see him after such a long time. He said he also felt the same. We played a couple of board games, and then he remembered that we needed to clean out the room where I was meant to stay in.

I was 17 at the time, so I wasn't surprised he wanted my help, and I was definitely more than happy to do so. We moved a few old boxes to the loft, and he seemed quite solemn when we moved a box containing a picture of all of us, including grandma. He insisted on taking it up, and took a bit of extra time coming back down. I decided not to inquire.

The room was, well, a room. Nothing of much significance there. It was fairly large, with cream coloured walls  and a single bed. Used to be my dads. I plopped my laptop on the desk, and got to work, whilst gramps cooked up spaghetti for dinner (he used to work at an italian restaurant ). After dinner, he told me togo to sleep, which was odd as the night was still young. It was only 8pm, So I decided not to argue, after all, it was a long journey there, so he must've thought I was tired. I retired to my bedroom, well, my dad's old bedroom and binged a new anime.

I decided to at around 12am that I should get to sleep. It was pretty late and I'm sure gramps wouldn't appreciate a groggy, sleep-deprived teen. I opened the door to quickly go down and grab some water, and I realised gramps was still awake, as his room's light was still on. I tiptoed down and drank my thirst away. Whilst heading back up, I spotted gramps at the base of the stairs and gave my best tired look, acting like I had woken up in the middle of the night, parched. He stared at me hard and then smiled.

I would've cringed if I wasn't forcefully squinting to keep up my act.

His teeth were a tad bit too many, and a white whiter than white. I followed him up the stairs. This wasn't gramps. The way the thing walked was as if it weren't in it's own skin, like a puppet without strings. Odd movements as if his knees were giving way. At the top of the stairs I caught a glimpse of his nails.

And fuck. Fuck me.

They were terrifying. Long and stretched out, sharp like talons and painted with a crimson shade, still practically dripping. And I knew damn well who's blood that was. He waited at the top of the stairs.

"Isaiah? ya comin'?"

I practically jumped. I said "Yeah, just tired, I think I need to go to the bathroom". Then he smiled that horrid smile of his, and asked me to come in. I'm so stupid, so fucking stupid. There was no downstairs bathroom, I was thinking of my parents' house. The only bathroom, was... in there, with that creature.

I messed up, big time. I stepped forward, panting as if I had ran a marathon, like each step I took was a step towards impending death; which it was. I couldn't draw attention to myself. I reached to the top of the stairs, and gramps had already retreated to the opening of his room, at the opposite end of the corridor. I saw something I'll never forget.

An eyeball rolled out the room.

I knew it, I knew this fucking monster killed gramps. However, the creature didn't pursue. Instead it flipped the light switch to the room and I vomited. In the corner of the room lay a bloody mess of intestines and stomach and whatever else it dug out of gramps. Upon the ceiling fan was the clean outline of a human body. But just the body, no skin, no organs.

I ran, and I swear I heard the squelch of gramps' eyeball being crushed underfoot as the creature made chase. I ran downstairs and was never more grateful for having the front door next to the staircase. Ever. I threw the door open and slammed it shut behind me. I ran to the neighbours which I knew was somewhat a risk, but there's no risk greater than the shit I just witnessed. What else could I fear beyond being skinned alive and ripped apart?

I told them gramps had died whilst my face was ridden with snot and tears, and I didn't want to stay in that house with his body. Then when I went to call my mum I realised I had 11 missed calls from my mum. Double fuck. I sold her the same story, gramps had died, and I was in the neighbours' house. They said they were coming as soon as possible, but as soon as possible isnt soon enough. I'm currently writing this out to you, and the police have just arrived, and fucking hell I'm a mess again.

Please help me, I'm scared.
