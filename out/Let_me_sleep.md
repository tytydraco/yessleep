My family is deeply religious, *unshakably* so. Heaven, hell, spirits… for them, these things aren’t beliefs, they’re reality.
Me? I never truly bought into any of it. I was the skeptic of the family.

But over time, strange things happened. Things I couldn’t explain.

When my aunt died from leukemia, her manual car, one that needed a key and clutch would turn on by itself. We’d wake up to the engine rumbling in the driveway with no one inside. And when my grandmother passed, her room became… wrong. Soft footsteps, faint whispers, the sound of someone gently breathing, even though the room stayed locked.

But all of those were nothing compared to what came next.


When I was ten, my sister was my closest friend, my partner in crime. We were chaotic together: playing, arguing, laughing over stupid things. And no matter how late I stayed up, she always guided me.

Every night, in that gentle, warm voice of hers, she would tell me:

“Go sleep.”

It always felt comforting like a lullaby whispered only for me.

Then one day, she was gone.

She died quietly from diabetes, a secret she kept from everyone. No warnings. No signs. One day she was there, the next day the world just… felt emptier.

For weeks I couldn’t sleep. Nights became long, hollow stretches of silence broken only by my quiet crying. I felt as if a part of the house and a part of me had died with her.

One night, around 11 p.m., I sat on the top bunk, my back pressed against the cold wall, staring at nothing. Eventually, exhaustion dragged me into sleep.

When I opened my eyes again, everything felt heavy. Blurry. My eyelashes were still wet.

My gaze drifted toward the doorway.

Someone was standing there.

At first, my heart leaped because it looked like my sister. But as my vision cleared, the shape became wrong.

Too tall.
Too thin.
Its limbs were long in a way a human’s shouldn’t be, as if someone had stretched her body like soft clay. And its head tilted at an unnatural angle.

Then I saw the eyes.

Huge.
Hollow.
Pitch black, like two holes carved into her skull.

No life. No light. Just void.

When it took a slow step toward me, the floor didn’t creak. It didn’t breathe. It didn’t blink.

My scream tore out of me so violently that my throat felt raw. I covered my eyes, my ears anything to shut the world out. My parents rushed in. I told them what I saw, voice shaking, but they brushed it off gently:

“Maybe your sister is just visiting.”

But deep down, I knew it. That thing wasn’t my sister. Whatever it was, it was wearing her shape like a mask.

I begged to sleep with them, and they agreed.


At around 12:30 a.m., I woke up again.
But I wasn’t lying down. I wasn’t in my body.

I was standing beside the bed… staring at myself sleeping between my parents.

My body on the bed looked peaceful. Mine the one outside the body felt cold and weightless, like I wasn’t fully alive.

I turned my head slowly toward the door.

She was there.

The same stretched figure. Those same empty, bottomless eyes.

And this time… it smiled.

A smile too wide, too sharp, like its skin was tearing to make the expression.

I slammed back into my body, my eyes shooting open, crying so hard that my chest hurt. My parents woke up again, exhausted, telling me it was just a nightmare.

But nightmares don’t follow you into waking.

I tried to steady my breathing and close my eyes.

And then. . .

Right beside my ear, so close I could feel the cold breath sliding across my skin, I heard the voice I knew so well.

Soft.
Gentle.
Familiar.

“Go sleep.”

But it didn’t sound comforting anymore.

It sounded hungry.
