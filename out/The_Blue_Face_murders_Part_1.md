Listen I’m not really supposed to share these files, but my uncle recently passed away in what they told me was a hit and run, and I don’t buy it.

He was working on a case involving a series of weird killings in our county and its surrounding area, and judging by what he told me and what is written in these documents, something big and bad is going on around these parts.

I understand why they are trying to cover up his death, he was a renown member of our community and the force, and if the details of his investigation would go public, people will go mad if they realize he was assassinated, but this is becoming too big of a threat to leave people in the dark like this

These are all of my uncles notes regarding his investigations, hopefully somebody more competent than me can crack the case and get these bastard the justice they deserve

I’ll upload these as fast as I can since the feds are taking on his case and all his stuff with it.

Detective Bruce Portland

We received a call from Saint Jonah hospital between Brown and Rock county, an adult man was brought in by his brother who claimed he was victim of an assault during a break in.

The victim is Mitch Curley, 35, currently homeless and without any stable occupation, no trace of any criminal records.

The victim’s kidneys were surgically removed during his sleep, both him and his brother Edwyn, claim that they never heard any sort of commotion during the night, Mitch only felt the pain after he woke up at 6 A.M., after realizing what has happened they immediately called 911.

After a couple of question he was rushed in for an emergency transplant, so I’m going to have to interview his brother instead.

Edwyn Curley, 38, appears to be the exact opposite of his brother, a model citizen and a member of the city council with a stable job as an history teacher and a nice home in the suburbs of the city of Basset.

B.Portland- Good evening Mr. Curley, my name is Bruce Portland, I’m the detective in charge on your brother’s case. I know this might be difficult for you to talk about what happened to your brother, but I need someone to testify in his absence.

E.Curley- Y-yes, I understand….

B.Portland- Very well, let me know if it’s too much for you, remembering certain events can take a toll on someone.

E.Curley- O-ok….

B.Portland- First question: where were you between 3.AM and 6.AM last night 

E.Curley- I-I was in t-the living room, I-I fell asleep w-watching a documentary, I-I didn’t hear a thing, the TV was still on when I woke up…. I didn’t hear a thing…..

B.Portland- Stay with me Mr. Curley, the more information you give the higher the chances of catching this guy, ok?

E.Curley- Okay! Okay…. Yes I-I can do this, p-please detective, continue

B.Portland- Alright then, second question: did your brother started to rub shoulders with some shady individuals lately?

E.Curley- Not that I know of, we haven’t seen each other’s in almost a decade, d-don’t get me wrong there’s no bad blood between us, it’s just that, you know, he went to live down in Furnas and I stayed behind in Rock, the distance itself did most of the work, we tried to stay in touch, but eventually life got in the way….

B.Portland- So I presume that you don’t know of any enemies he might have had either.

E.Curley- Well not entirely, Mitch was always kind of an hothead, especially when drunk.
His bluntness always got him in trouble, and he even got into a couple of fistfights, but none of those people he might have antagonized could do something….something so cruel….

B.Portland- Stay focused Edwyn, you’re doing great, let me just ask you one final question.
Have you seen anything strange around or in your house in the last couple of days, or this morning?

E.Curley- W-well I…. Uhh…. Oh! Yes, I-I remember something! Yesterday Mitch told me he heard tapping on the window…. we just shrugged it off assuming it was just some wild animal, a ra-raccoon or a deer or…..

B.Portland- Alright Edwyn, you’ve done more than enough, thank you for your cooperation.
You can’t really stay at you house today as it’s considered a crime scene, besides your brother needs you here now, I’m sure the hospital will arrange some form of accommodation, in the meantime, if you or your brother can remember anything else, my number is [REDACTED]

E.Curley- Th-thank you detective, I-I’ll let you know when my brother wakes up, I promise.

After Edwyn Curley’s interview I went directly to the scene of the crime, the only thing of notice was an open window in the guest room where the victim was staying, no sign of fingerprints or footprints, there is very little blood on the mattress where the operation took place, whoever did this clearly has advanced medical experience.

By the looks of it the perpetrator is a skilled professional, probably associated with an organ trafficking organization, yet something here doesn’t match with the usual modus operandi

Organ traffickers usually harvest from illegal immigrants, homeless people or other vulnerable targets, they don’t put themselves in such a high risk, breaking into a house and stealing a pair of kidneys outside of a proper operating room.

I’m afraid this won’t be the last of the perp’s victims, the profile has all the signs of the work of a serial killer, bizarre, meticulous and extremely complex to pull off.
Luckily these freaks love the attention, if we spread the news throughout the county, they’ll get their kicks off and get more cocky, meanwhile people will start getting more cautious.

I’ll ask the captain to lend me a squad to search the near the house as well, the guy can’t have cleaned all the traces of their work, if they spied on this place before acting he might have set up camp somewhere around  the perimeter

Detective Bruce Portland

The chief gave me permission to check the house’s surroundings with a team of 4, but denied my proposition to share the news with the media until we are 100% sure of the serial killer hypothesis.
I don’t blame him, people tend to act irrationally during emergency scenarios, but this guy is a serious threat to the county.

I’ve looked at some other cases in the area around Basset, there have been 3 suspicious death of pets that match our perp’s method, various organs meticulously harvested and the wound sown back up.

There’s something odd with the fiber’s used for the sewing, the guys at the lab claim it’s organic, similar to an Optic nerve, yet it shares some of the properties of cotton.

I don’t really know what to make of this, but it’s clear this guy isn’t going to stop

There’s seems to be a theme though, similar to many of these cases.

All of the current victims were inside when they were attacked, and refuses to attack them when they’re outside.

Maybe the perp is recreating a scenario, a traumatic break in during their childhood?

The guy never left anything apart from the fiber used to saw back their victim, and the anesthetic inside their victim’s blood.

The lab is still trying to identify it, seems to be some exotic venom, similar to that of some geckos.

I assume our suspect was once involved in trafficking of some sort in order to be able to use such rare materials to fulfill their sick perversions, but without any other evidence this is just speculation

Mitch Curley this Sunday should be released from the hospital in a couple of days, maybe he saw his assailant at some point.

Meanwhile I’ll check for more suspicious crimes around the entirety of Rock county.

Report 3

02/17/2024

Detective Bruce Portland

Edwyn Curley is dead, we found him in his house, he…. he called before being killed, he said he found something that could help the investigation.

I’ll transcribe the call we had before his murder
The information he gave before being attacked might shine some light onto this case.

B.Portland- Hello, This is detective Portland speaking…

E.Curley- Mr Portland, I-I mean detective Portland, it’s me Edwyn, E-Edwyn Curley, I’m at my house right now, I need to speak with you immediately 

B.Portland- What?! Edwyn you can’t be there that’s a crime scene, how did you even….

E.Curley- There’s no time! I think I found something that might….

(A low tapping is heard somewhere in the house)

E.Curley- Oh no! No! It’s here it came back!

B.Portland- Shit! Edwyn calm down, I need you to stay focused and listen to me!

E.Curley- O-Okay, Okay I will

(The tapping gets closer)

B.Portland- Is there a bathroom or a closet near you?!

E.Curley- N-No I’m in the attic right now, th-there’s just boxes in here!

B.Portland-Ok than try a window, some way to get out of the house!

E.Curley-A window, a window, ok, a window….

B.Portland- Edwyn calm down, listen to my voice…

(The tapping gets closer)

E.Curley- Oh…dear God….

B.Portland- Edwyn? Edwyn are you still there?!
I’m coming towards you just hold on! Edwyn?!

(I hear a heavy thud, then the call cuts)

I arrive 10 minutes later at the crime scene, the guarding officer David Parch, was at his post circling the house, I reported to him the situation and we burst inside.

the trapdoor to the attic was wide open, leading up to a dusty dark void.
The torch of a phone fallen on the floor lighted part of the room.

Beside it I could faintly see the silhouette of a hand.

Me and officer Parch got up the stairs and used our own phones to light up the attic

The fresh corpse of Edwyn Curley stood before us, cut opened like a frog in a science class experiment.

There was no way the killer could have slipped out of there without us noticing, there were no windows in the attic, the room was a box.

Edwyn Curley was trapped there with them, and now they were trapped in there with us.

We called out into the dark ordering them to surrender and come to the station.

Nobody answered

I moved closer as I ordered officer Parch to stand near the exit, he’s an inexperienced cop, fresh out of the Academy, if there’s someone that had to face this monster head on it should be me.

As I stood there in the dark I heard it again, that light tap on the wooden floor

We both darted our phones towards the source of the noise but there was nobody.

We heard them moving in the dark, rushing towards the trap door.

Officer Parch fired three shots towards the perpetrator , all of them missed, but the light of the gunshot gave me somewhat of a clear image of the suspect

He stood around 6.3 feet wearing all black and a dark blue mask.

I can’t say more than this, as officer Parch was overpowered and fell down the trapdoor alongside the suspect.

He had a major concussion but nothing lethal fortunately.

The suspect on the other hand seemed to have gotten out of the house with relative ease, using the same window he used during its previous attack

Searching for fingerprints shows that Edwyn Curley used that same window to get in, it’s not difficult to assume that he was followed by his killer.

Though this doesn’t make sense with the previous MO.

As proven by their attire they are a nocturnal hunter, who doesn’t like to strike twice in the same area, why going out of his way to kill Edwyn Curley? Was it because of what he found?

It couldn’t have been in the house as the forensic crew was scrupulous in their search, and the surrounding area was searched for two days straight by myself and other 4 officers.

There’s another note I should add in this report, the suspect must be in peak physical form to be able to move this fast, maybe someone in the army or a professional athlete.

The war veteran hypothesis seems to be the more plausible as of now, not many people would have the guts to rush an armed man shooting at you, and have enough lucidity to perform a transplant.

But what’s the tapping about?

Curley was holding a book in their hand:
Native American myths and legends

If the answer is in this book, why didn’t the perp burn it or destroy it?

-Report 4

02/18/2024

Detective Bruce Portland

Officer Parch recuperated well enough from yesterday’s scuffle with our killer and insisted to take part in the investigation.

Normally I would be against assigning a rookie to such a serious case, but I understand his reasoning.

The idea that if you acted differently, if you were quick enough or if you didn’t miss a shot, maybe you could have saved someone.

That someone for officer Parch was Edwin Curley, for me, well the list is much longer unfortunately.

This stuff can eat away at you sometimes and negating him this opportunity will only make him act recklessly, so I decided to take him under my wing.

I’ve left him at the station analyzing the book that the victim wanted to show me, while I made my way to the hospital to talk to the victim’s brother

Here’s a transcription of the interview with Mitch Curley

B.Portland- Hey Mitch, I’m detective Bruce Portland….

M.Curley- He’s dead isn’t he? My brother, he killed him didn’t he?

B.Portland- Yes, your brother has been killed, he wanted to help us in the investigation….

M.Curley- Typical, he always got up into people’s business you know, always the Good Samaritan…… Fuck! Godamnit, Fuck! 

B.Portland- Mitch, I need you to calm down ok, we got a close encounter with the killer and your brother gave us a lead before he died, but I still need your help, have you noticed or seen anything…..

M.Curley- Wait, you saw the fucker?! Why are you here?! Why didn’t you catch him?!

B.Portland- Mitch calm down, ok! This isn’t a horror movie villain, this guy is a REAL professional! An officer almost got killed in the fight and I need to stop this freak before he hurts somebody else! Now tell me if you saw anything before the assault….

M.Curley-Okay! Okay…. okay.
Ehm, let me think for a moment….. so I heard a… tapping of sorts around the house

B.Portland- Was it during the night?

M.Curley- No, sometimes during the day too, but I didn’t bother checking…..

B.Portland- Ok, yes the tapping, let’s talk about that, they did the same thing when we confronted him in the attic, where were you when you heard it?

M.Curley- in the guest room and in the living room mostly, eeeeh…. maybe in the kitchen?
It was usually near the windows….

B.Portland- Ok good, now as far as we could tell the killer was wearing a dark blue mask does this say anything to you

M.Curley- Not really, I… I don’t know…..

B.Portland- it’s okay Mitch, that’s everything I needed from you, once where done clearing the crime scene you can go back home if you want to….

M.Curley- Did he suffer? Did it hurt or….

B.Portland- No, he received a huge dose of sedatives before his death, he died from blood loss, he wasn’t even able to feel the pain

M.Curley- Good, good, t-thank you detective

This story is about to blow up like a nuke, I’m certain of it, Edwin Curley was one of the most well known figure of that town, after his death the local media will flock to his corpse like vultures.

One thing is certain though, our killer doesn’t like the attention, an odd case for a serial killer, but a possible one nonetheless, and with all the journalists flocking over at Basset, it’s only a matter of time before another nosy motherfucker gets himself killed.

And I’m afraid that includes us cops as well
