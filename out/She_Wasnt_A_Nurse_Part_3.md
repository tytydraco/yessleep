[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i0pndf/she_wasnt_a_nurse_part_2/)

My internal alarm didn’t go off until eleven. By then dad had already left. Leaving me and mom alone. I had planned to ask dad for some help with approaching the girl from the gas station. But alas it seemed he wouldn’t be able to help.

 

“Good morning sweetie.” Mom stood in the hallway looking like she was going to film a nature documentary. I scratched the skin underneath my bellybutton.

“Good morning, I was just going to take a shower.” I gestured towards the bathroom on the other side of the hallway.

 

“Yes of cause. Feel free to use any of your dads underwear, I’ll grab you a towel. Go right ahead.” She turned and went to their bedroom. I continued across the hallway.

 

Although dad wasn’t here I knew that looking good would be important. Stepping into the bathroom I caught a look of myself in the mirror. I turned slowly admiring my body. I had been pushing myself at the gym. I thought it visable. I felt confident. Above the mirror mom had her skin products and dad his razor. I looked at all of it, and rubbed a hand along my jaw. Returning my gaze to the mirror I leaned in closer. I didn’t remember if women liked beards or not. I’m sure I have heard something about it before. I thought I would leave myself unshaven. I liked it, and so would anyone interested in a real man.

Looking back up at my mothers skin care products I committed to asking her what I should use. Then came a knock at the bathroom door.

 

“Yes.” She opened it slowly. As soon as the crack in the door allowed for it, she stuck in a hand holding a purple towel.

 “Here honey.” She waved it up and down slightly.

 

“Thank you mom.” I grabbed the towel.

“Can I ask you about some of your.. something for my face? To moisturise.”

 

“Sure. Can I come in?”

 

“Yesyes.” She opened the door fully. Looking intensely at my nose and cheeks. She smiled.

 

“You are welcome to use your dads razor too.”

 

“Thank you.” She crossed her arms and leaned against the door frame. Returning her eyes to the line of products she had.

 

“it’s important not to look greasy. But you don’t want to be completely dry.” She paused then took a step forward. When she reached the sink she took one hand on the rim of it and got on her tippy toes reaching for a small opaque glass bottle.

 

“This one.” She put it down next the hand soap.

“It’s almond oil. Very neutral. You take out the top here.” She unscrewed the lid and revealed a small pipet. She demonstrated a movement.

“Just four drops. Cheek, nose, cheek and forehead.” She always overcomplicated everything. I needed dad.

 

“Thanks mom. Anything else?” I gave her a look of exhaustion. She screwed the lid back on the bottle.

 

“Yes just one small thing.” She put the bottle down and leaned closer kissing my cheek. I winced.

“Love you.” She turned and left, closing the door behind her.

 

I hung the towel on the rack and stepped into the shower, pulling the sliding door shut.

 

I took a cold shower. Too make sure my face wasn’t bloated. I couldn’t think of much when the water was on. But while I rubbed in the soap and the condittioner I thought about how to go about this second interaction, with what could be my future wife.

 

 

I was supposed to be confident, I knew that. I only ever felt confident when I was alone or wearing a button up shirt. I have heard you need to be memorable. That would be hard to be in a button up. I needed to look strange but cool. The big thing was supposed to be humor. I didn’t want to risk saying something wrong. So I needed my clothing to convey that too. More over I needed to make sure she saw me as a man as well. Making all this happen at once felt difficult. When I finished the shower I had found the perfect solution.

 

I put on the oil like mom had shown, and went to their room. I looked for a tie that would contrast one of dads old hawaii shirts. Happy with myself and my solution.

 

Mom had put some food on the kitchen table for me. I glanced out the patio door. She was doing some work in the garden. Cutting the bushes and trees. Maintaining the home. I brought the food into the livingroom, and went looking in dad’s office for a pen and some paper. I was going to workshop some openers.

 

I wanted to sound dominant. Show her I was an alpha that could protect her. I came up with some good stuff. I stood up in the living room and tried to act out the scenario. Trying to say the different openers out loud. None of it felt like me. I realised that I would become nervous if I said stuff that wasn’t me. So all my sports talk openers where discarded. I found it much harder to write when I wasn’t playing a character. I slowly became anxious about the interaction. I had a lot riding on this. She already spoke to me. I just needed a little more and I was in there.

 

Mom was putting sticks in a wheelbarrow outside. She put her hands on her hips and leaned back looking at me through the window. She made a small wave with her hand. Beckoning me  
outside too help her. I ignored the request and continued Working on my future. She walked up and opened the door.

 

“I could really use someone strong out here.” It was infuriating to have such a childish motivation work on me. Furthermore it told me that I was no more than a large five year old to her.

 

“What are you doing mom.” I scorened. She was unwavering which was even more infuriating.

 

“Well I’m trying and failling to move all the dead branches. I could really use a hand.” I turned back to my paper. The frustrations pilling up. I couldn’t figure out what to say. Neither to mom nor to the woman of my future.

 

She walked in and picked up one of my discarded openers, unfolding it. She laughed. It was degrading. Female laughter always was.

 

“One liners, huh?” the way she said it hurt. Like it was some common trope. Unknowing of the fact these papers would one day be spoken of as the first step in leading to her grandchildren. I deserved the love that was coming to me and she didn’t understand it.

 

“Any complaints mom.” She looked at me in confusion over my anger.

 

“No. This is good. I just wanted to help.” I don’t think she wanted to help. I think she wanted to correct my course.

 

“I’m stuck.” I relented. Throwing down my pen and paper.

 

“Don’t overthink it honey.” She put a hand on my shoulder.

“If she likes you, she will be glad you even came back to talk with her.” This helped. It eased the pressure. I put my hand on hers.

 

“I just want to do it right… I just don’t want to give her a reason to say no.” My mother took her hand off my shoulder and away from my grasp.

 

“How do you feel about her?”

 

“I think she’s great.”

 

“Well maybe you are assuming she is great.” Mom waited for a reply but her indecency didn’t warrant one.

 

Then she said the most useful thing she ever had.

 

“If you want a one liner honey, you should keep it short. And make it something she would want to hear.” My hatred evaporated. Her helpfulness bringing me back from my mind fog.

 

“Try something playful. How about: *Hey where did you think you knew me from? Cause I don’t think I would ever forget someone like you.*” That line was perfect.

 

“oh my god, mom say that again!” I picked up the pencil and waited anxiously for her to repeat it.

 

“Oh honey I don’t know for sure, I just said something.” I started writing what I remembered of it.

 

“But I can..” I cut her off

 

“SHUSH MOM.” She turned and walked out the door. Closing it after her. I wrote down “I will never forget you” on the paper.

 

When I left for the gas station it had been after arguing with my father. He hadn’t helped me with figuring out what to say. Instead he had scolded me for mistreating my mother. If I could have taken him back to his youth he would have understood. The woman of your dreams was nothing to let go off easily. I had already went through the scenario so many times in my head.

I would walk in there. She would see me. Just as she did last time. I would wink at her. She would blush. I would walk up to the register and say. Because of yesterday I will never be able to forget you. She would say are you thinking of me when you dream. I would say that I didn’t have to anymore. And we would kiss.

 

It was dark. My headlights illuminated the road and I felt unstoppable. I was the light of the world. I thought about how I would look from outside my car. Maybe I would be invisible in the dark. Maybe my feelings where reality, and my skin would be outshining even the headlights of my car, illuminating me as a beacon. A beacon powered by the hope I felt brewing in my stomach.

Looking out over the forest in the darkness I didn’t think about hiking. Instead this time I thought about camping. How she and I would be curled up with each other. And how she in the dead of night would crawl into my sleeping bag. I sped up the car.

 

Reaching the gas station I corrected my tie. Looking in through the windows I saw her. She stood there like an angel. Bathed in the store lights. Her illumination seemed ordained by higher powers. Looking at her gave me goosebumps. Sitting alone in that car I was smitten. I thought about if I should have masturbated before I went to see her. Maybe it was best that I was ready after we kissed.

 

Stepping out the car I made sure to ready my body posture. Shoulders back, head raised, mewing. Walking in I went straight to the register.

 

“Oh hey again.” This time she looked me directly in the eyes. This was it. This was my future made manifest. I waited, not saying anything until I was close enough to her, that I could say my winning line.

 

I Took my eyes to her breasts. And read the name I was going to whisper in her ear forever. Of cause she was named Michelle. The name just fit perfectly to her voice. I felt that the two had such a strong connection too each other, it couldn’t be a coincidence. It was like I had been primed to correlate the two. Maybe we did know each other.

 

Putting my hands on the counter I made myself ready to lean in for the coming kiss.

 

“It would be impossible for me to ever forget about you again.” She looked stunned. I had expected her to feel my dominance but I’d had no idea I would play the part so perfectly.

 

“What?” She had a look of surprise on her face, and I used the opportunity to hammer home the victory.

 

“Michelle we are meant for each other.” She took a step back. What was she doing? Why wasn’t she smiling?

 

“Sorry but I don’t know what the hell you think you are doing!” She had both hands up in front of her chest one visibly hiding her name tag, the other staving me off like she was conjuring a forcefield.

“Please leave.” She pleaded with her frantic eyes. I was baffled. Frozen.

“Leave or, I’m calling the police!” The second part had way more force behind it. I put myself back in control, a reaction to my fight or flight.

 

“What the fuck did you just say to me?!” What an ungrateful bitch. How the hell did she dare do this to me? I had been so vulnerable. I had spent so much time on her. How did she find herself worthy of turning down my love?!

 

“LEAVE!” She half hissed half cried. I huffed at her. Turning around I thought of the idiots and rapists she would come too spread her whore legs for. I pushed over a rack of chocolate bars on my way out. Smearing the floor in loves edibles.
