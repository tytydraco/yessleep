For as long as I can remember, I have always had extremely vivid dreams. They heavily affect my day to day life and feel like memories if anything. 

If my dreams are stressful or deeply emotional, I’ll have a difficult time getting through the day and sometimes it’s completely ruined. I’ve even called out of work because I just couldn’t adjust to reality in time. Is this frustrating? Yes. But the consistency in which I have my odd dreams gives me something to look forward to. The anticipation of visiting another world for even just a few hours is tantalizing to say the least. Everyone has woken up suddenly to then try to fall back into the same dream before, right?

On Monday night I had just come home from a double shift at work, I was exhausted. I followed the same ritual as I always had for the last few years. I scrounge for some kind of food, take some drug store melatonin, and listen to music as I quickly slip into my dreams. 

Now I’ve had some weird dreams in my life, I’ve had dreams where I was married with kids, fought myself in a boxing ring, even visited countries that don’t exist. But that night I had a dream that felt more grounded than ever before, more than lucid. 

I was on my back, staring at a cloudy sky, I couldn’t move, not even my eyes. All I could see was what was directly in front of me and what was in my peripheral vision. I was on the floor of a small wooden boat, or something similar. Although I couldn’t sense anything physically, I felt remarkably claustrophobic. 

Rain was pelting my face, the drops of water hitting my eyes blurred my vision, and the boat was audibly crashing against the waves. It took me far too long to make out the shape of something else in the boat with me.

As the rain lightened up, I began to make out the sound of labored breathing. A strong wave  managed to roll my body against the side of the boat, forcing my head to crane down in the direction of this breathing thing. It was wearing a hooded brown robe that covered its whole backside, weathered from the elements.

It genuinely felt like an hour had passed in my paralysis. In my other dreams I could feel myself slowly fading away from the world I was visiting, but here it only became more real, almost like waking up completely. Even my most lucid dreams had their limit, I could always force myself to wake up. 

I could sense the wood against my fingers, the rain was cold and it stung my face. I was able to completely turn my face away from the rain, control of my eyes came slowly after. That’s when I felt it, badly. My insides twisted horribly, I must have puked a gallon of water, maybe more. 

That’s when it turned around.

My paralysis was gone, now I was simply frozen in terror. I’m no stranger to aliens, demons, and strange creatures in my dreams, but this was no longer a dream to me. I was in this boat with a real monster that I will never forget. Its head was fleshy, and its face had vertical slits, like a vent. It was breathing hard, air was visibly puffing out of its slits. 

No words needed to be exchanged to tell in that moment it wasn’t expecting me to move. It began to turn its whole body towards me as I was pulling myself over the edge of the boat to see the water, it was nearly black. I leaned closer to dip my hand when it grabbed my arm hard. I looked down and froze once again, a grotesque, three-fingered hand was wrapped around my arm like I was a lost child. My stomach turned. I couldn’t breathe. Its skin was pale grey, and looked aged. 

It moved its giant hand to my chest and pushed me down against the floor of the boat, it took one last look at me as it heaved itself back over the seat it rested on, breathing even harder as a result.

I faced the sky once again and as if I was instantaneously transported between blinks, I was back on my bed. I started to write down everything I could before I forgot, as it was definitely beyond any dream I had and I wanted to remember, and that was all. However, I wouldn’t rush to the internet just to write about something like this.

But last night, I had the *same* dream. 

While recurring dreams aren't irregular for me, it’s never exactly the same. I was back on the same exact boat, staring at the exact same cloudy sky.

This time however, I wasn’t frozen, and I was able to sit up almost immediately. I was met with the same monster, still rowing the boat. Now that I was back, I took more time to analyze my surroundings. I hadn’t even realized until then how giant my “captain” was, it was definitely taller than anyone I had ever seen. 

I looked over its shoulder to the direction we were headed. On the horizon between the grey sky and black ocean I could just barely make out a thin, flat strip of land incredibly far away.

I turned to look back from where we came and saw nothing but the sky and large swells of the inky ocean. I glanced at the creature to see if it had noticed my consciousness, and then quickly dipped my hand into the water, it was warm and oily. My hand was stained black. 

As my arm began to dry in the wind, I saw that my pajamas were also stained in the same fashion, like I had been soaked in the same black goop. It must have been raining the same stuff. 

The creature snapped its head towards me, its body language felt aggressive, or maybe annoyed? I pushed myself back as close as I could against the edge of the boat and pulled my knees against my chest, hugging them tightly. 

It had no eyes, so I just stared into the cuts on its face. The flesh of his head looked wet and squishy, sort of brain-like. It swung its legs over the seat and fully focused its attention on me, I could see that under the coat, its feet were just as alien. It positioned its hands to continue rowing while facing me. After many silent hours, the thin stretch of land came no closer into view.

Just like before, I was suddenly awake, with my legs against my chest. I don’t know if I can even call this a dream anymore, it feels like I’ve only changed locations. I’ll write again if anything else strange happens, thanks for reading.
