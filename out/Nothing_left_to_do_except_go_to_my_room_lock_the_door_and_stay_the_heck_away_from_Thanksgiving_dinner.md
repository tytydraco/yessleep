Mom wanted us to say what we're thankful for in that half-joking, half-serious kind of way. She's traditional like that. You can't just have a meal, right? You need the meaning behind it; or at least, the meaning we're giving to it.

Dad answered first, grunting something about family and good food as he slapped a large slice of ham onto my plate and gave me the "your turn" nod.

"I don't eat meat."

A statement that won't win you any popularity at our Thanksgiving dinners, believe me. Dad answered with a sizable scoop of dressing -- accompanied by no small amount of turkey, of course, and the usual stance about how we "don't got the money to be picky." Dad's not a mean or hateful guy. It's not like that. He's just a little stuck in his past, same as most people, and doesn't always see the view from my end.

He tried to understand at first. Even took me out to his garden. "Gotta be something here you'll eat." We weren't the only ones with eyes on those vegetables though -- there was a rabbit, a cute, fluffy little thing, sneaking his way up from behind the trees, no-doubt hoping for a nice meal of his own. He made his way all the way to the edge of Dad's garden, and I held as still as I could, because I always liked rabbits, and I thought I could get a good picture if he got close enough.

Dad shot him through the head with a .22 rifle.

I looked down at the poor, dead rabbit, and the head of cabbage that'd been stained by a splatter of his blood. Dad said "that'll wash out" and gave me a pat on the back before carrying off the corpse to be skinned. We had rabbit and cabbage that night. I wasn't hungry. "Tried to do it your way," Dad said, and I knew right then he wouldn't try to accommodate any further.

So, Dad and I see things differently.

Now, my Grandpa, there's a man who can hate. He's had a lifetime of practice. And Grandpa *hates* vegans. Vegetarians too, but he hates vegans most of all. Grandpa used to own a farm the next state over, before he left it to my uncle and moved in with us. Way he sees it, a stance against meat, or much of anything else that comes from an animal, is a stance against him, personally. An attack on the way of life he’s always known, the life our family depends on for its very existence. When Grandpa heard me say I didn’t eat meat, same as every other time he’s heard me say it, he looked at me with *disgust.* If that man could lose his appetite, he probably would have.

Mom’s clever. Whatever she might hate, she does it quietly and subtly. Guilt is her weapon of choice. “I went through all the trouble of making this meal and you’re not even going to try it? Well, if that’s what you want…”

Anyway, I played along. It seemed like the best way to avoid any conflict. I said I’m thankful for my family, and for the meal they provided, which is much more than some people get, even if still not *quite* enough for us to be picky.

And on with the meal.

One thing about my family -- these people can eat. You wouldn’t believe it. I’m talking *mouthfuls* of ham, its juices constantly running down their chins. The chicken and the turkey, gravy and dressing and deviled eggs. Forks and knives move with a velocity that could surely kill if everything in their path wasn’t already so very dead. Thanksgiving makes for such a variety of dead things.

It was Mom who finally found a second between bites, pointing her fork directly at my face, to sneak in, “you’ve got to try the ham.” She looked so happy, tearing into that ham. Must be one heck of a pig, I thought. Dad and Grandpa were quick to confirm, doing their best to spit out compliments through whatever they were stuffing in their mouths next.

“I don’t want any ham,” I said.

“The turkey, you need some of this turkey, it’s *delicious.*”

“These deviled eggs, I’m telling you, just try one.”

“Ham. Amazing. Best ham.”

The more they ate, the happier they got, the more welcoming they became. It was so much worse than usual. Disturbing, even. It’s like they couldn’t control themselves.

Grandpa’s head fell forward and slammed against his plate with surprising force. Chunks of half-chewed food flew a couple feet in each direction, but Mom and Dad didn’t seem to mind. They didn’t even look at him. Too focused on their food. “You need to eat this,” they kept saying, almost talking to themselves at that point. Grandpa kept his head down for a while, licking gravy and juices off his plate like a dog, before sitting up straight with a chunk of turkey hanging from his mouth and a big smile on his face like nothing had even happened.

I didn’t eat a bite. Lost my appetite, I guess. Left the table altogether after a while. It’s not like anyone noticed. I could hear them in there all day, even into the night. I went to check on them the next morning, thinking the food must be gone by now. It wasn’t. They weren’t really eating the meal at all anymore – at least, not anything that hadn’t already been in their mouths. I saw Dad take a drink of gravy straight from the bowl, just to open his mouth, let it drip back out, and go for it again right after. Grandpa had clearly vomited on his plate, and made use of the resulting mess as another helping. Mom stabbed away at a turkey bone that had nothing else to give, occasionally spitting on the broken pieces and eating them too. When I tried to speak their eyes all shot at me in unison, seemingly independent of their other movements. It felt wrong. Like I was prey, almost. I felt like the rabbit.

Then they went right back to that same old act.

“Gotta try this ham.”

“The turkey. Eat the turkey.”

A year ago we gathered around the table for a Thanksgiving dinner. Now, one year later, the night before Thanksgiving, it still hasn’t stopped.

I tried to help at first. I brought them water, even poured it into their mouths myself. Tried offering them other foods, medicine, anything else I could think of. I even tried dragging them away from the table. They wouldn’t budge. It’s like the whole thing, the table and the chairs and the food, the meal, was part of them now – or they were part of it.

“Eat the ham. The turkey, try this turkey.”

Even as their bodies gave in, they just kept going. In a few months time, our electricity and water had been shut off. We’d stocked up on bottled water, thank God, but the whole thing didn’t seem to bother anyone else here. Their teeth would fall and their hair would follow. Nothing made a difference.

Thanksgiving keeps going. Straight through the new year, past winter and into spring. Everyone around the table.

“Have to eat this ham.”

More than six months in, I couldn’t keep it apart anymore, the way they *melted* into the table. I didn’t know where they stopped and the old “food” began. It was all the same to me. Just a mess. A really big mess.

“This turkey is delicious.”

They’d scream it, skinless, their jaws hanging on by a thread, while I tried to put their pieces back together. As the year went on, mistakes were made. I’m not perfect. It’s so hard to keep it all separate. Mom might have turkey parts now. I don’t know. I did my best.

The bread molded a long time ago. Dad’s garden is dead now -- not even a curiosity for little critters to happen upon. Not that I know how to use a gun anyway. Not that I even *would.*

I’m just hungry. The canned goods, the peanut butter and all the rest, it’s all gone now. God help me, the more I hear them yelling from around that table about the ham and the turkey, it almost starts to sound tempting.

I don't know how this happened. I certainly don’t *why* this happened. Did we not pray before sitting down to eat last year? We usually do. Maybe we didn’t. Should I have just eaten the food? Can’t be. I’d be in the same spot they are, wouldn’t I? Around the table with everyone else. Was I not *thankful* enough?

They’ve been getting louder. That’s something I do know. Every day, for the last month or so at least, their voices get a little bit louder. I hear them everywhere now.

“The turkey. Please just eat the turkey. You *have* to try the ham.”

It’s building to something. Tomorrow is my guess -- Thanksgiving Day. That’s when this needs to come to some kind of ending. I don’t know what’s going to happen.

And for the love of God -- I still don’t want any ham.
