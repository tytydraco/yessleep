When I bought the cabin, everyone in town told me I was crazy. It was old, sure, and a little isolated, but that’s what I wanted. A place to escape, to write, to think. I ignored their warnings about the woods. “People don’t go up there anymore,” they said. “Not since the stories started.”

I didn’t believe in stories.

The first week was peaceful. I spent my mornings hiking the trails and my nights by the fireplace, trying to finish a novel that had been half-written for years. The quiet was exactly what I needed.

Then, one night, I heard it.

A whistle.

At first, I thought it was the wind slipping through the trees. It was faint, almost melodic, carrying just enough rhythm to make me stop and listen. I stepped outside onto the porch, letting the cool night air wrap around me. The forest was dark, the moon barely strong enough to outline the tops of the trees.

The whistle came again. It was closer now, a slow and deliberate tune. It sounded like someone was trying to get my attention.

“Hello?” I called out, but my voice felt small against the vastness of the woods.

The whistling stopped.

I stood there for a while, waiting for something—an answer, a movement, anything—but the forest remained still. Eventually, I convinced myself it was nothing and went back inside.

The next morning, I found footprints in the dirt just below the porch. They weren’t boot prints. They were bare feet, long and narrow, like whoever had been standing there had no business walking barefoot in the cold.

I told myself it was just some drifter passing through, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that those footprints were waiting for me to notice them.

That night, the whistling returned. It started earlier, just after sunset, and it was louder. I could hear it clearly now, the notes rising and falling like a song. I tried to ignore it, but as the hours passed, it crept closer, until it seemed to be just outside the window.

I didn’t go to the door this time. Instead, I stayed by the fireplace, clutching the iron poker.

The whistle stopped again.

I stayed awake all night, staring at the windows and doors, convinced that at any moment, someone—or something—would come through. But nothing happened.

The next morning, the footprints were there again, this time circling the cabin. They weren’t alone. A second set, smaller, had joined them.

I packed my things. Whatever was out there, I didn’t want to find out.

As I loaded the car, I felt the air shift. The forest seemed heavier, the light dimmer, as though the trees themselves were watching me. Then, I heard it closer than ever.

The whistle.

It wasn’t coming from the woods anymore. It was behind me.

I turned slowly, heart pounding in my chest. The cabin door stood wide open, swinging gently in the breeze.

The whistle came again, low and deliberate, from inside the house.

I quickly ran out as fast as I could, tears rolling down my eyes. I soon made it into my car and quickly rode off into the musky morning. Even weeks later I still can’t forget what happened. I don’t think I ever will.
