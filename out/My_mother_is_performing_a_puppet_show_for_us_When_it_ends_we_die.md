  
"And the wolf was so hungry, that he slit open the princess,"  
  
She moved around the puppets she'd made for us when I was six. The ones that were all dusty and ripped. Nobody had touched them in years.  
  
"But the princess was strong and wouldn't die so the wolf tried to run-"   
  
My little sister Abby was enjoying all of it, she had no clue that Mum was going through something that seemed like an intense manic episode.  
  
"Make the wolf come back!" Abby shouted and Mum smiled.   
  
"Mum-," I started but my voice broke off.  
  
She kept moving the dolls and I stopped listening to what she was saying. We'd been inside the basement for hours watching the puppets and listening to my mother changing her voice. Somehow I couldn't move. And I didn't dare to. Behind the self-made puppet theatre, my mother had a large kitchen knife. I thought of ways to trick her or overpower her but it simultaneously pained me too much to see her this way.   
  
So, I sat there frozen, watching her slowly lose her mind.

Mum and I had built the stage for the puppet show when I was little with the help of my grandpa. We used wood that grandpa cut into fitting pieces and then Mum and I painted them. We even added a curtain with parts of an old red dress my Mum owned.   
  
The puppet show became my biggest obsession, we'd spend every weekend creating new puppets and decorations. It was all self-made, we didn't buy a single one. For their hair, we used strains from old dolls or cut strips of cloth. Mum made all their dresses herself with her sewing machine.  
  
When I look back at my childhood, those are some of my sweetest memories.   
  
But as I got older, we stopped using the puppet show. When my sister Abby was born many years later, puppets weren't really in fashion anymore so the whole ensemble moved to our basement.  
  
I’d moved out of my childhood home years ago but still regularly visit my family. Today was one of those random visits. I still had my key so I let myself in, after closing the door shut and shouting hello, I waited for a response but the house was eerily quiet. My Mum had said she’d be home all day.  
  
"Hello? I'm home," I shouted again, this time louder, and then I heard my sister calling me from the basement.  
  
I took off my coat and then walked down the narrow steps to the basement. Our basement was only one room, filled with boxes and a bit of old furniture. When I saw that my mother was presenting a show with our old puppet set for my sister, I couldn’t help but grin. This was the last thing I was expecting to see.  
  
Abby was wearing a cute little dress and a crown and kept giggling.   
  
"What's going on here?" I said in my best older brother's voice. Abby was 13 years younger than me, so we always had a very playful relationship.  
  
"A puppet show!" Abby answered excitedly.   
  
"I always thought she didn't like this thing," I said towards my Mum who was crouching behind the wooden box that was our puppet theatre.   
  
I took a seat on the carpet next to Abby and saw that my mother was holding a jester puppet in her hand, one of the first ones we had made back then.  
  
"The princess demanded a show, who am I to resist?" She said in a deep voice and Abby looked at me and nodded.   
  
The nostalgia immediately hit me and I stayed there, watching the little show my mother put up for us. It took me a little while, however, to realize some of the stories were specifically directed at me.  
  
She switched the jester with a witch and changed her voice again to make it sound more rusty and creaky.  
  
"The prince is here and he thinks he can simply join us after he just left this home. He doesn't belong here anymore!"  
  
The prince was the puppet my mother had specially made for me back then.   
  
The wooden theatre was big enough that my mother could crouch behind it and disappear completely but suddenly I saw her peeking at us from the side. Our eyes met and I felt a knot in my stomach. Something about her seemed off.   
  
I looked at Abby who didn't seem to notice a thing.  
  
Suddenly my mother dropped the puppet of the prince and continued a whole different story as if nothing had happened.   
  
"This is the story of the frog and the witch who could not make a wish. The frog was purple, the witch was orange. Colors are fun, and numbers are two."  
  
I looked at my sister and whispered "Is she running out of ideas?"  
  
Abby giggled.  
  
"I like it."  
  
Abby was five. I think she didn't care what the fairytales were, she just liked looking at the puppets.   
  
I had no idea how long those two had already been in the basement before I arrived so at that point I thought my mother might simply be a little fatigued.  
  
She continued the nonsense story for a while and I sat there and watched. Not because I cared about the tales but because it felt wrong to go upstairs. In a way, I felt glued to that strange show.   
  
This went on for what felt like hours. At times the story and her voice were clear and coherent but then it became odd and dreamlike again. There were moments when I actually thought I wasn't awake.  
  
When the strange story was done, my mother peeked at us from the side again. She disappeared a second later but left a mark on the side of the box. A bloody handprint.  
  
Then she held up the puppet of the jester with one hand, with the other she held a large kitchen knife, making it look like the jester was cutting around in the air.  
  
"Mum?" I nervously asked but she didn't respond. "Mum, are you okay? What's with the knife?"  
  
"We collected lots of props because we thought we might need them!" She said in a high-pitched voice I'd never heard before.   
  
She kept ignoring me and put on a new puppet to continue with a different story.  
  
\---  
  
I can't say how much more time passed. I was feeling sick in my stomach while the rest of my body was in shock. I had never seen my mother like that before and I simply couldn't move.   
  
"The wolf took the clothes of the little girl and went to the forest to-."  
  
After three or four more stories, I decided it was time to end this.  
  
"Hey, Abby. Should we go upstairs and get a snack?" I asked her, trying to find a way to remove her from whatever was going on with our mother.  
  
"No!" My mother shouted. "She put both of her hands on the stage and lifted herself up, showing us her face. Her eyes were twitching and her mouth was formed into a big smile. "The show is not over yet. The princess wants to see the show."  
  
I turned to my sister who started looking a little afraid. She was only five and probably couldn't grasp the odd situation but she was starting to notice that something was off.  
  
"Okay, why don't we take the show upstairs? I can carry the puppet theatre up and we can sit on the sofa?" I suggested.  
  
My mother stayed silent for a while, I slowly got ready to get up until Mum started speaking again.   
  
"I have one more tale to tell. This time it is about a prince," she looked up from the box for a few seconds, staring at us with an intensity I'd never felt before "When the prince was only a kid, he lost his father, the king. The king had been very sick and when he could not live any longer, the prince was very sad. So the queen found many ways to distract him and make him happy. And one day he became better. So did the queen and she found many things to do, though she never found another king. She didn't need one. The two of them had each other."  
  
She stopped for a moment and little Abby started squeezing the fabric on my leg. She turned her face towards me and I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Abby had a cut on her left arm. Had my mother done that to her with that knife?  
  
My breathing became heavier. I thought about jumping up as quickly as possible, grabbing Abby, and running upstairs. My mother wasn't the youngest anymore, I could have overpowered her but she did have a knife. And I didn't want Abby to get in danger. But if I could outrun her..  
  
"But then, one day, there was a princess and she was the sweetest thing she'd ever seen," she continued the story, her voice getting louder.  
  
She let the queen fall and grabbed the jester puppet again.   
  
"The jester said to the prince, 'Be aware. The princess might look sweet and nice. It might feel as if you've known her your whole life.'"  
  
Finally, something clicked inside of me.   
  
"Can I join the show?" I asked as I very slowly got up and moved toward my mother.   
  
She didn't stop me.   
  
I grabbed the puppet of the wolf but I had no idea what to say. Behind the box, I finally saw my mother in full. Her skin had lost all of the color and while Abby had one cut on her arm, my mother's body was full of them. Her clothes were ripped and everything was stained with blood.   
  
I looked down at my own lap. Blood was staining my pants but the pain wasn't registering in my brain.   
  
She kept going on with the show, her voice getting weaker.  
  
"The jester danced around and kept performing. She hoped the prince would not come home because she knew: if the show stopped, the creature would slaughter them both."  
  
I saw her eyes that were filled with fear and regret. She tried her hardest to continue but couldn't help it.  
  
"I'm sorry," she whispered. "She tricked us both." Then she passed out of exhaustion.  
  
"It's okay, Mum." I held back my tears. "You tried your best."  
  
I grabbed the puppet of the jester.
