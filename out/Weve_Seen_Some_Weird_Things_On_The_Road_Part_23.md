Do you know something that is uncomfortable? Pull-ups. I swear to god we had to do like a thousand of them today. My arms still feel like they're on fire. Not to mention the fact they're going to be sore the next day.  Oh well, at least I got my protein shakes to help repair muscle. Carl has been very adamant about us having them. I got some pumpkin spice with mine to get in the Fall spirit.

&#x200B;

As it turns out having your arms and legs chained to a table isn't exactly comfortable either. Neither is having a human skin-covered anthropomorphic former unicorn prince get ready to perform twisted experiments on you. Mostly that latter one especially when said person's sanity has dwindled from years of torture. As my luck would have it, he was about to take all of his frustrations out on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried escaping by pushing some shit over to no avail. It only succeeded in pissing him off. He knocked me out and I woke up shortly later chained to some kind of operating table. Cuffs dug into my ankles and wrists. I tilted my head up to see where he was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was at a far-end table with his back to me. Sensing I was awake he began speaking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's been a long while since I've had company. Hopefully, you'll last a little longer than those before you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The fact I wasn't the first person in his lab didn't shock me. I figured some slaves would have attempted using the catacombs as a means of escape. Although, I imagine they wouldn't have lasted very long on their own. Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place. What surprised and scared me was finding out what his intent was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What are you planning to do with me?" I demanded.

&#x200B;

"For years I've been trying to find a way to rid myself of this condition but all my attempts so far have failed."

&#x200B;

"Then what makes you think this time will turn out any different?"

&#x200B;

"Because I can feel it. Last time my method was off ever so slightly. This time, however, I know it'll work. You and I are going to switch places."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My oh shit meter went up to twelve when I realized what he meant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You can't do that. I thought you consider humans lesser beings?"

&#x200B;

"I do but anything is better than how I am now. Everything hurts all the time. Now I finally have a chance to free myself of this pain. I just need to make a few preparations."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While he gathered tools I pleaded to be let go.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Your plan will never work. Even if you take my body, you'll be killed once you escape."

&#x200B;

"Who said anything about escaping?"

&#x200B;

"Then what are you going to do?"

&#x200B;

"That isn't something you'll need to worry about. Despite what you may think, I am capable of mercy."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took that to mean he intended on killing me after the transfer. How exactly he was going to do all this, I wasn't sure. However, I was about to find out. What he gathered were some glowing metal tubes that were spiked at the end. In addition, he wheeled in a large metal tank that pulsed akin to a beating heart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The center of it contained a window in which I could see green globby liquid moving inside. The way it did makes me think it might've been alive somehow. Whatever it was, judging by those tubes, it was about to go inside of me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You have no idea how long it took to make this, to get it exactly right. All the tests will finally be worth it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I began screaming out a stream of expletives at him. Then he gagged my mouth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Once the transfer is complete, I'll be far stronger than your kind normally is. I might visit your world one day and have a little fun there."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My legal troubles were bad enough already. The last thing that would help them was this psychotic monster wreaking havoc while impersonating me. It's amazing how fast the mind can work during life or death situations. I thought of one thing that might save me. However, it required that he

be able to understand me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I managed to work the gag out of my mouth as he was about to stick the tubes in me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You had a foal...Right?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He paused.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What about her?"

&#x200B;

"What did she look like?"

&#x200B;

"Why are you asking this? If it's to stall, I assure you that won't change your fate."

&#x200B;

"At least do me that favor."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fortunately for me, he granted my request. Luckily, his answer was exactly what I needed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We've met her. She's leading the invaders."

&#x200B;

"That's a low bluff. Mention her again and I'll instead draw your death out for as long as possible."

&#x200B;

"It isn't. Just give me a chance. Do you really want to risk giving up a chance to be reunited with her?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He got closer to me, looking into my eyes, trying to determine if I could be trusted. I hadn't gotten a good look at them until then and man were they the freakiest part of him. For one they almost seemed to be a blend of horse and human eyes. It was as though the eyes of the latter's had taken on the size of the former's.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The way they rolled around in his head as he studied me was super unnerving. Eventually, though, he decided to hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"If what you're saying is true I can't face her looking like this."

&#x200B;

"So if I help you with this, there won't be any swapping bodies or torturing me or anything like that?"

&#x200B;

"I give you my word. However, if you fail meâ€¦"

&#x200B;

"I already know. Trust me. I've been hearing that a lot lately. Anyway, I could get you one of the guard's bodies."

&#x200B;

"I don't like the thought of becoming one of them. Oh well.  I can't afford to be picky."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He led me back to the stairs. Luring a guard was easy enough. I got them to chase me downstairs and the former prince knocked him out. Then he switched bodies with him. The guard's reaction to finding out what he'd become was to scream uncontrollably. He wanted to leave him alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't consider myself a humanitarian but leaving him in that state would've been a pretty fucked up thing to do. Therefore, I ended his misery by slitting his throat. The smell of his blood was so rancid I began seeing double. Once we got far enough away I came back to my senses.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How are you going to explain things to her?"

&#x200B;

"There are several methods I know of that can extract the entire truth from someone. If she doesn't believe me I'll just offer to volunteer for one. Now, where can I find her?"

&#x200B;

"I think she was part of the group that was supposed to poison the royals."

&#x200B;

"I know where that part of the castle is located."

&#x200B;

"How do you know if you've been in the catacombs for so long?"

&#x200B;

"Before they changed me I helped them by giving them all the details of my parents' army and their castle."

&#x200B;

"So that's how they were able to kidnap the princess," I thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The royals' wing of the tower was surprisingly easy to get to because there were no guards on duty. Something had slaughtered them. Their blood and flesh coated the floor and walls. We found the severed heads of several pegasuses, hybrids, and humans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What the hell could've done this to them?"

&#x200B;

"Maybe it was from a battle?"

&#x200B;

"The carnage here is way too intense to have been caused by that. Something way stronger did this. The question I hope to never find the answer to is what?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is the part where I said fuck you to every god and goddess I could think of and to the universe in general. Something wet and heavy was heading towards us. Its steps sounded squishy and the floor quaked with every step it took. What slithered into the room was almost as bad as what I'd seen down in the tunnels.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was a creature infused with the body parts of pegasuses, hybrids, and humans alike. They were a part of some kind of large pink bobby thing. It took notice of us and rose from the ground. Its true height was enough to reach the ceiling far above us. The size of it was frightening enough but what disturbed me more is the familiar voice I heard come from it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Peteâ€¦Help."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And that's all I can stand to type up for now. Sorry, everyone but my arms need their rest. So this is [Pete,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) signing [off.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
