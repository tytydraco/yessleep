**February 25**. As I am writing this, the clock hitting 4 in the morning, I’m in bed next to my girlfriend at her house. She’s sleeping peacefully with her breathing almost unnoticeable. Me on the other side am trying my best to not shake out of fear and wake her up. It is unknown to me if my mind is playing me or if what I have noticed is real.   


My girlfriend and I have been dating for more than a year and things between us have gone serious. We both think have found the one and engagement is on our path. For our anniversary which was a month ago I gave her a little mirror to keep it in her room as she hadn’t one and had to go to other rooms to do her make up. Two days ago we were hanging together like usual and went to her house to chill. We took a nap to recharge before hanging out with friends. When the time was due I got ready faster than her and sat next to her patiently watching her do the make up while chit-chatting.   


Now I am a huge fan of scary stories and while believing into the paranormal it is my judgement that there is a veil separating our worlds. A veil which is not tress-passable unless we in this world try to (witchcraft, etc). So I don’t believe a demon, ghost or something else can disturb you if you don’t try to disturb them in the first place.   

  
Moving on to our story. As we both were chit-chatting I noticed she kept the little mirror on the desk in front of her bed with the mirror facing and reflecting the bed. Jokingly I asked her in what position did she keep the mirror when she went to bed to sleep. She stopped blushing her cheeks and looking confused with a smile on her face she raised an eyebrow as to what did I mean with that question. Not letting me explain my joke she answered immediately after "of course facing the other side of the room as to not have to do with demons." Laughing and glad she got my joke we moved on to other discussions until she got ready and we both went out.    


Later that night when we got back and went to bed right before my sleep got me, I noticed the little mirror in the dark facing towards us. Although dark, I noticed it was facing us because on top of the bed there is a little blue light and that little blue light was being reflected on the mirror. Not making much of it I went to sleep.   


Next morning my girlfriend had waken up before me and was busy making us breakfast when I woke up. The first thing I noticed after clearing my eyes and sight was the mirror in an angle facing the closet and not the bed. Instinctively I thought that is how it was last night too and being in that state half wake half asleep my mind saw it incorrectly. Nothing much happened that day until late that night.   


Along with friends we had decided beforehand to go clubbing. We were getting ready while the time was around eleven o’clock. As per usual I did get ready faster and sat next to her watching her doing the make up which had become a habit of mine.     


As mentioned earlier, the time we were getting ready was around eleven, a time which on other plan-less nights would have found my girlfriend asleep. As I was watching her reflection on the mirror, at the bottom left side of the mirror I caught a glimpse of the reflection of the bed with my girlfriend sleeping in it. Instinctively turned my look to see the bed which unsurprisingly was empty and turned again to see the bottom left of the mirror reflecting the bed which was again unsurprisingly empty. Not having the time to process what I saw, I raised my eyes to see the reflection of my girlfriend face and catching me off-guard she was staring at me while doing her eyeliner.    


She wasn’t giving me that confused stare as to question my sudden move (unconsciously while moving my look to the mirror-bed and then mirror again I moved my whole body.) No, she was giving me that *“I got you red-handed”* stare. Smiling nervously I asked her what? She didn’t answer but continued to stare at me like that for a second then frowned at me and moved her eyes to meet her reflection and continued with her eyeliner.     


All this happened in the span of 5-10 seconds and all while not stopping doing the lines on her eye. I asked again **what**, she stopped moving the eyeliner and looked at me through the reflection of the mirror confused. **"You were staring at me"** I said to which she replied negatively while turning her body towards me with a playful ironical glance on her face, **"How could I've been doing the line so perfectly if I was staring at you instead?"** She was right as I do remember her not stopping the hand holding the brush.   


Concluding that my mind did me a trick and I should stop reading much into paranormal stuff I didn't make much of what happened. Until that night while we were sleeping. Before we went to bed and turning off the lights I did take a last look at the mirror and it was facing the closet and went to sleep. Now, my girlfriend sleeps so peacefully, I notice it because almost every time it is me who goes to sleep last. She almost doesn't move at all, all night, except the times when she gets up to go to the bathroom or to drink water, and every time I wake up because of the moving.   


I know it is her waking up to drink water because I can hear her drinking water, and I know it is her going to the bathroom because I hear the door opening and closing. That night after the strange event occurred, and that I did check and make sure the mirror was facing the closet, she did wake up and woke me up because of the moving. But like any other nights I didn't hear her drinking, nor did I hear the door being opened. I stretched my head to see what was she doing. Almost as she was sleep-walking she moved something on her desk, what it was I couldn't notice in the dark.    


She then turned to the bed and I could see she had her eyes opened although her movement and stare were like she was asleep. Shutting my eyes and pretending I was sleeping while she got into the bed again and proceeded to sleep again, I was praying she didn't noticed me following her movements. After some minutes I couldn't resist the temptation to find out what she had moved. I opened my eyes and to my astonishment I caught the reflection of the blue light that was on the top of the bed. She had moved the mirror so it could reflect the bed.    


A chill went down my spine though I was more confused than scared. Thinking it is all a prank she's playing on me since I made that joke the other day I tried to go back to sleep. But I couldn't. I tried to get my head under the coverts but to no effect. The idea the mirror was facing us was making me nervous. So I got up and moved the angle of the mirror until the reflection of the blue light vanished.   


When I turned back I saw my girlfriend had gotten up, half sitting in bed, watching me. I could notice or more I could feel, she didn't have that half asleep confused look, or that bothered look she would have given me for waking her up with my movements. She was giving me the exact stare she did through the mirror earlier that night. Just staring at me, not saying a word.   


I smiled nervously and asked her **"what is wrong why are you not sleeping, honey?"** and took a step forward to the bed. At that moment I felt as if a hand grabbed my wrist. Terrified I turned back and saw nothing. No hand no other items that could have felt like grabbing me. I mean I was already shook by the sudden movement of my girlfriend and my mind could have easily make me see or feel every other illusion. One thing I couldn't get behind was that it felt like that hand had gotten out of the mirror.   


When I turned back towards the bed right after I checked there was nothing there, I noticed my girlfriend was still sitting in that position, but now she was smiling. A very unsettling smiling. As if she did know what was going through my mind and what had just happened.   


I was trying to gather my strength to ask her why was she smiling like that when she said **"You are bothering me"**, and her smile vanished from her face. **"Bothering you?**" I replied **"with not letting you sleep by making noises with my movements?"** She didn't reply, instead sighed. I said "right?" as to confirm she meant that. **“You are a hindrance”** she talked in a way as if her words were passing through my body and were directed for what was behind me.  


But as I was about to put a stop to this nonsense, half angry for what i thought could have been a prank and half scared for what could be all real, her face features then took a surprised look as to why was I standing there in the middle of the night.   


Not making much of it she said **"come to bed"**, which I did eventually though I am terrified right now. I was scrolling through my phone to take my mind off of these events but to no avail. That is why I am on reddit right now documenting what had happened and will try to document future events, if any occur.
