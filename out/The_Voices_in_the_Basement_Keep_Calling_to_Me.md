I’ve decided to document these recent events in my life due to my suicidal thoughts. It’s an hourly struggle to live with myself, in any capacity. Unfortunately, I don’t know how much longer I can last until my mind ultimately breaks and I’m forced to leave this plane of existence. As a contingency, I found it best to explain myself to my family, friends, and classmates, although said explanation sounds like it comes from the mind of a crazy person (which I am) but every word of what I am about to say, is, in fact, true. So let’s start at the beginning, shall we?



I want to say for the record that I never liked the basement of our new house. I moved here, say, five years ago, just in time for my eleventh birthday. The house was sprawling, 6,000 square feet of guilty luxury. Of course, my child brain paid no mind to how well-off my family was or how big the house was, but it did pay quite a bit of thought to the creepy door. You see, the basement was completely normal, with a movie room, a miniature kitchen, and even a gym. It was everything an impressionable young boy could ever ask for, but I never went down there alone, because of the door to the guest bedroom. It was, for all intents and purposes, a normal door, your standard white-painted american suburban door. But whenever I alone gazed at it, it filled my inner being with such an intense dread that I could hardly move. I seemed to only be able to focus on the door, and everything around me would disappear as only the door remained. But whenever my mom or siblings were there, the door was normal and functioned as such, and opened up to reveal a cutely decorated guest room, used mostly by my grandmother upon frequent visits.



While the door certainly gave me the creeps, it wasn’t until I was sixteen, about three months ago, that things really went to hell. I was away from home at a church camp (and seeing as how I have non-religious friends, I’ll do my best to make this accessible to everyone, as every human has that innate desire to connect to *someone*). Anyways, there were several people there from my church’s youth group that I had never even spoken to, but once I got to know them, they were insanely awesome people. Among them were Nolan (aged 13), Brady (aged 12), Cam (aged 16) and Bronx (aged 14). I had grown inseparable with them over the short period of time we shared and we had exchanged numbers. I had vowed (to myself) that I would talk to them as much as possible whenever we got the chance to interact every Sunday morning.



“Nolan!” I exclaimed one Sunday as he walked through the door. “I had a feeling I’d be seeing your beautiful face this morning!”

	

He smiled, an awkward smile that was half amused and half embarrassed, but he ran towards me and embraced me anyway. I hadn’t seen him in a while, so I wasn’t focused on his new haircut: his long, flowing, and full black hair had been buzzed down. When I noticed, I was shocked beyond belief.



“Dude, what happened?” I asked.

	

“Oh, my hair?” He presumed, his prepubescent voice showing signs of cracking. “My mom made me chop it off for cross-country,” he explained.

“I’m sure that it’ll look fine in a few days,” I replied. “After all, you’ve gotta let something big like that marinate.”



We took our seats in the sanctuary, ready to listen to whatever our senior pastor had to say. Well, I was ready to listen. Nolan had some pretty severe ADHD, likely not helped by the constant presence of short-form content for him to scroll endlessly and satiate his dopamine receptors. I felt bad for him. I constantly had to tell him to pay attention or stop playing a game on his phone. I never did it unlovingly, mind you, I was a friend, not a teacher. After all, I was only three years older than him. 



“Riley, can I sit with you?” Brady asked. 



He had appeared out of nowhere next to our pew, and honestly, he shocked me quite a bit. His voice mimicked his outward appearance: cute. He was very short and lean, but still well put together, especially considering his age. He had a thin babyface that made him look far younger than he actually was, with brilliant blue eyes and fluffy strawberry blonde hair. Pair that with a natural inquisition, and Brady was a fantastic person to hang around. Of course, I accepted his request, and the three of us sat and enjoyed a Sunday service together. We were inseparable, even though we had only known each other for a few weeks. That was the last time I saw my friends as they were.



That evening, after I did my normal routine and logged online to spend another midsummer’s night playing video games with my friends, I began to develop a pounding headache. I apologized to both Nolan and Brady for getting off so soon, explaining that I needed to go to sleep, as I felt sick to my stomach (which was a lie). So I logged off of my console, washed my face, and crawled into my bed. I had to lie on my back as that took the most pain away from my headache, which was safe to call a migraine at that point. I must have fallen asleep at some point, because I woke up to the sound of one word, spoken by an incredibly deep and foreboding voice:



“*Riley.”* 



My eyes shot open, and I tried to sit up, but my body would not let me. I tried moving any muscle at all, but everything was relaxed. Everything was paralyzed; my eyes were the only thing I could move. My eyes were drawn to something in the corner of my room. There was a figure standing by my door, which was wide open. Calling it a “figure” might have been too generous, as it appeared to consist of a mass of whirling shadows with a pair of crimson red eyes. 



“*Riley,”* it said again, “*they are waiting for you.”* 



Suddenly, all control was returned to my body, and I got up and closed my door, beyond shaken from the sudden oncoming of sleep paralysis, which I had not experienced since I moved into this house. *Wait,* I thought. *The door was closed when I went to sleep.* That thing, whatever it was, had opened it.



I tried falling asleep again, this time on my stomach, as it helps prevent sleep paralysis, and personally, I’d rather have a pounding migraine than demonic interaction every day of the week. However, I still could not sleep. I’m sure that if I did, I’d see *it* again, but still, seeing the sun peek through your window at seven AM after a long and boring night still doesn’t feel *good.* I swamped through the entire Monday as tired as could be, and when my mom asked if I stayed up all night playing video games, I felt like I had to lie.



“Yes,” I told her, not yet wanting to divulge the haunting experience I had. 

But nightfall came around sooner than expected, and I felt an impending dread come over me. Then, an idea came to me. I’d close the door again, making sure of it by placing a piece of tape, half over the door and half on the wall, just like they would do at summer camps to keep you locked in. In hindsight, I wish that I would have never investigated further. It ruined my and many other lives.



The tape was secure, and I crawled into bed, intentionally lying flat on my back to try and coax another potentially paranormal experience. I had one, which was slightly different but still the same in many ways. However, the differences present made Monday night much more harrowing. Firstly, the voice calling my name was not demonic in any sense of the word. In fact, it was Brady, his adorable and endearing squeaks ringing in my ears. 



“*Riley, Riley, Riley”* he would say, before becoming more and more enraged, which is not an emotion I ever hear from him. “*Riley, Riley, RILEY! You could never save me. You are better off burning in hell, with me.”* 



At this, my eyes finally shot open. *What the hell?* I thought. *That had to be a dream, something conjured up by my subconscious. It can’t be real.* 



“*It is.”* 



I tried sitting up and looking around the room, but once again, I could only move my eyes, and they were darting around, searching for anything of substance to take in. The door was wide open, and there, closer to me than Sunday, was the Figure. 



*“Riley,”* it said, still overly foreboding and evil, yet calm and collected, like a strategist plotting his next move. “*They are waiting for you.”* 



At the last word, all control was returned to my body, and I leaped out of bed, only to find that there was, indeed, no Figure standing before me. But the door was still wide open, the piece of tape attached to it. I now had evidence of paranormal and supernatural occurrences happening to me, and it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. I was strategizing, thinking of any plan, anything I could do until my blood ran cold when I hear the words:



“*You could never save me.”* 



Brady. Again. While I was fully conscious. I was so horrified, I could barely move. My eyes looked to my bathroom mirror, tears of dread streaming down my face. I knew, some way, some*how,* that this was connected to the door. That dreaded stupid awful putrid guest bedroom door. And there was only one thing that I could do. So I mustered up the courage, every step more tantalizing than the last, my warm breath and pounding heart the only discernible sounds in that large, empty house. I opened the basement door, only to hear more mocking from Brady coming from the darkness. A cackle, a maniacal laugh rang out throughout the whole house, and yet my family never stirred. I wanted to turn back, I wanted to forget, but nothing could stop me from getting the answers that I so desperately deserved, that I so desperately *wanted.* It took me an hour to walk down those stairs. In that time, my brain was raging with so many thoughts, and none of them were glamorous. But my quest for knowledge was my only motivation.



At long last, I reached the bottom of the staircase, and perpendicular to me was the guest bedroom door. The door now looked more evil than it ever had, the pitch black room highlighting the sinister door, which, in all honesty, looked completely normal. This, in and of itself, was abnormal. Usually, the door seemed to be in a state of disrepair. Sometimes shadows would crawl across the door in a seemingly random fashion, ignoring all known laws of physics. But now, it was scarily and unnaturally… natural. Like it belonged, like it had always been there.



It drew me to it. I walked, entranced, towards the door, the twisted voices of my friends calling out to me, in english that morphed into latin and other languages, but still the voices of Nolan, Brady, Cam, and Bronx. I put my hand on the doorknob. It was frigid. I turned it slowly, and flung the door open, ready to see a guest bedroom and disprove my own baseless assumptions. Instead, what was inside that door would change my life forever.



There was no longer a guest bedroom, instead, it had been replaced by a space that could never fit into the confines of my house: whatever this place was, it *was* real and it was most certainly not of this earth. However, it appeared to be a large, open-air arena, with a sandy floor. It looked like an ancient Roman colosseum. Everything was barely visible in the pitch blackness of the night, but what I could make out was harrowing and shook me to my core. In the center of the arena, there were four metal poles, each twenty meters tall, with a chain coming down from the top that bound prisoners to each other, preventing them from going anywhere. To my abject horror, said prisoners were Nolan, Brady, Cam, and Bronx. 



I vomited, the existential dread of recent events finally catching up to me. Brady’s young voice called out in the middle of the cold midnight air, but this time, his voice wasn’t demonic or malicious. It was hurt. It was a deep sadness and agony, one that a 12 year old should never experience. He was crying, weeping at the top of his lungs. I approached him, examining the chains around his hands and feet. They were bound tightly, giving him no more than 2 feet of mobility. I saw the source of his pain: a crown made of thorns was placed atop his head.



“Brady?” I called out. “What have they done to you?” My voice broke and I began to cry. “What have they done to all of you? What the *hell*?”



I ran up to his pole, holding his hands and shaking his chains.



“Brady, I promise I’ll get you out of here. I’ll get all of you out of here!” I declared, my voice piercing through the deep night.



“Who- who are you?” He asked me, crying in fear. I paid no attention to this, focused only on freeing my friends. After a few seconds, I stopped. 



“What? You know me Brady, it’s me, Riley!” I pleaded. “Now, let’s get the hell out of here!” I said, removing his crown and attempting to unbind him. He just looked at me, like i was a stranger, like I was the product of his torture. 



“I’m afraid that they are going nowhere.” I spun around, and the Figure was standing behind me. “They are under my possession.” 



“No, this isn’t real. These aren’t my friends!”

“I’m quite certain they are. After all, I am the one who ripped them out of reality.” 



“What do you mean, ‘ripped them out of reality’?” I asked, humoring his statement.



“The four friends you know now are not your friends. Six months ago, I stole them from reality and placed them in this chamber. The ones you now know as Bronx, Cam, Brady, and Nolan are simply demonic doppelgangers, who will do irreparable damage to the world. I now have a choice for you.”



I had no choice but to believe what he said. All of this was very real, whether I liked it or not.



“It’s quite simple,” he said, tossing me a loaded pistol. “You can either kill the demonic quartet as they sleep right now, or you can kill this quartet in front of you. If you choose to leave the demons alive, no harm will come to you or your immediate family. I can’t promise anything else. If you choose to kill the demons, you will, unfortunately, become immortal until judgement. You will live through the rest of the days of humanity until the second coming. Who knows how long that will be? But I can assure you this: you will never feel loved.”



I listened to his speech, considering my options. I walked out of that arena with four dead friends, knowing I was making the wrong choice, but still doing it anyway. I’m leaving now. Whether my fate is eternal damnation or eternal nothingness or anything else- I deserve what’s coming to me, as God could certainly be no farther than he is right now. Goodbye.
