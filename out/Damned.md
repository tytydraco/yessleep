"Sorry guys, I don't want to be saved," I said, before they could speak.

Two men in black robes were standing on my front porch. I had never heard of a church where people wore black robes, but I assumed they were here to convert me.

I'm not particularly religious, so I was trying to politely tell them off before they wasted their time.

I began to close the door.

"Do you want to be damned?" one of them asked suddenly. It was hard to see either of their faces under the shadowed hoods, so I couldn't tell who was speaking.

I stopped closing the door.

Why would they ask me if I wanted to be damned? I wasn't sure how this was supposed to convince me of anything. Still, it was interesting enough to give them a chance to explain.

"What did you hope to accomplish by asking that?" I asked curiously. "Would I be 'saved' if I listened to you?"

Neither of them had visibly reacted to my words. It was like talking to overly dressed mannequins.

"No," they replied. "We're not here to save you." They asked again, "Do you want to be damned?"

Alright, I was invested now. I had to know which religion they were trying to sell here. I fully opened the door.

"Why would I want to be damned?" I asked. "It feels like I'm reasonably damned as it is—you should see my paychecks."

They didn't laugh. To be fair, I guess I didn't laugh at my paychecks either.

"Look inside," one of them said, moving for the first time to hand me a large envelope.

This was getting weird. I opened the envelope in front of them while they waited patiently.

*No way,* I thought. The contents rendered me speechless.

An obscene amount of cash was in the envelope. Enough to pay for an entire year of rent, easily. What the hell was going on?

Before I could say anything, one of them said, "This is one-tenth of what you will receive if you are damned."

Now I was truly shocked. People who win the lottery might not get that kind of cash. There had to be a catch here. Was the money fake?

I shamelessly pulled a hundred-dollar bill from the envelope to feel its texture and look for the watermark.

There was no reaction from the hooded men.

It was real. I put it back in the envelope and gave them my full attention. I could feel my heartbeat pounding as my thoughts raced wildly.

"What's the catch?" I asked. "Where would I go? A dark alley where you harvest my organs or something?"

"There is no catch," they said. "You will go to our church. It will take only an hour of your time. No harm will come to you."

Their hidden faces and weird speech patterns were starting to creep me out. I still couldn't tell who was talking.

It was an incredible amount of money they were promising, but I had a feeling I was going to disappear if I went to their "church".

"Will I be 'damned' there?" I asked. "What does that even mean?"

"You will be damned there," they confirmed.

I waited for them to continue.

They didn't continue.

One of the robed men held out a hand—the same one who had passed me the envelope.

I sighed with regret and handed it over. Of course it wouldn't be that easy.

They took the envelope and handed me a small piece of paper. An address was printed on it.

"Come to our church," they said, as they abruptly turned around and left.

I eventually closed the door, lost in thought.

For about thirty minutes, I considered the robed men's offer and wondered if I should go. It was a lot of money they were promising, after all.

Even though I knew it was probably a scam, I gave in. It was worth wasting an hour of my time to follow up on this.

The address they gave me came back as an empty lot in a poorer part of town when I searched for it online. Definitely shady. I would have to go there and check it out from a distance.

When I drove over to scout the location, I was surprised to discover that the robed men had not been lying; there was, in fact, a church.

It was an inconspicuous black, one-story-high building with white trim. A modest steeple topped the building. There were no religious symbols anywhere on it, and no signs or any indication as to what they called themselves or what they worshipped. Oddly, it seemed to have no windows.

They had to be a cult. Those robed men were dressed like cultists and acted like them as well; this building was essentially my confirmation.

No one was outside, there was no parking lot, and there were no cars parked on the road nearby. Was it empty?

Nothing had happened thirty minutes later, so I decided to go for it.

Knowing how dangerous this could be, I took some basic precautions. I texted my friends and a few family members exactly where I was, and told them to call the police if I didn't message them within two hours.

When I pulled up to the church, I parked near the entrance, just in case. If I had to run, I could quickly get to my car.

It was time. I stood in front of the large double doors of the church.

Steeling myself, I pushed one open and started to enter.

I almost immediately screamed, because a cultist was standing directly inside the door, facing me. How long had he been waiting there? There were no windows on the church; he couldn't have seen me outside.

"We've been expecting you," the cultist said in a monotone. "Please, come in." He waved me through the doorway.

It took me a second to find my voice as I stepped in. "How did you know I was outside?" I asked, pretending he hadn't just scared the hell out of me. My hands were still shaking.

"Are you ready to be damned?" he asked, completely ignoring my question.

I had made my preparations before I came in, and they wouldn't spook me away that easily. Not with so much cash on the line.

"Yes," I said, trying to sound confident for whatever this was. "As long as you have the money."

He grabbed a briefcase next to the door and unlatched it so I could see inside.

It took every ounce of willpower not to grab it then and there. I had never seen so many hundred-dollar bills in my life. If I took this briefcase home, I could shower in cash as easily as in water.

He latched the briefcase—dampening my barely restrained avarice—and closed the entrance door.

Darkness and shadow enveloped me as the door closed, and I took in my surroundings for the first time.

Immediately, I realized that the entire building was a hollow shell; containing one vast, featureless room.

Its walls, ceiling, and floor were solid stone. The only lights were functionally placed candelabras—of course it would be candles—and I could barely see in the gloom.

The cultist was facing me again. He gestured to the center of the room. "You will walk to the center of the room," he said. "A chair is waiting for you. You will sit on the chair."

In the center of that ominous chamber was a chair—or perhaps more accurately, a throne—made of black rock. It looked like it was roughly chiseled from a boulder. Its back rose to my shoulders, and the seat was unpadded; I would be sitting on hard stone.

The cultist's hand was still gesturing, seemingly frozen in the air, as he continued, "You will not look behind you. You will not move from the chair. When you are damned, you may leave." He lowered his hand.

These people were crazy. Fortunately, I was willing to overlook all of this as long as I left with the briefcase.

"May I inspect the chair?" I asked. There were a lot of red flags here I could ignore, but sitting on some kind of torture device was not one of them.

"Yes," he confirmed, turning away from me.

Now I saw that around the chair, and scattered across the room, were a significant number of cultists; I couldn't count all of them. There may have been dozens. All of them wore the exact same black robe with hoods that veiled their faces in deep shadow.

"Inspect the chair," one of the cultists said. I had already lost track of which cultist had led me in, so I didn't know who said it. They all had the same voice; it sounded like a middle-aged man who had smoked a pack a day since he could walk.

I examined the stone chair carefully. Its black surface was flush with the floor. Nothing was hidden or implanted on it that I could see. It seemed completely harmless. I walked around it to check the back.

Behind the chair, about ten feet away, was a freestanding door. It was made of black metal and had a bone-white handle. There was nothing supporting it and it wasn't set against a wall; it simply stood there, uselessly. You could easily walk around it.

"What's with the metal door?" I asked, pointing at it.

Silence. It was scarier when there were more of them. They were all standing still, staring at me.

I was getting freaked out, so I broke the silence quickly. "The chair looks fine," I said, walking back to it. "Do I just sit now?"

"Sit," a cultist said.

I walked around the chair and took a seat. It was cold and a bit uncomfortable, but nothing unusual happened to me. I began to relax. I could do this.

All of the cultists moved at the same time and immediately began to encircle me. They weren't that close, but regardless, I almost jumped from my chair. Apparently, they were giving me no warning.

It was time to be "damned".

When the cultists finished encircling me, they went to their knees, put their hands on the floor, and bowed their heads toward the ground.

Silence. None of them moved.

I was sitting nervously in the stone chair as they presumably "damned" me, trying to remember and follow the rules I was told.

*Don't look behind me.*

*Don't move from the chair.*

*When I am 'damned' I can leave.*

All of these things could easily be accomplished by simply doing nothing. I just had to be patient.

I was interrupted from my thoughts by the sound of a handle turning.

They were opening the door behind me.

*What kind of bizarre ritual is this?* I kept still.

A faint metallic creak was audible as the door opened.

I knew something was wrong immediately.

All of the candles blew out, plunging everything into complete, pitch-black darkness.

Then, as the door opened behind me, my vision was restored as a faint light began to creep into the room.

A breeze stirred, carrying fine, white dust. It smelled like ash, and I tried not to sneeze.

As it started to obscure the room in a murky haze, I realized it wasn't dust at all; it WAS ash. There had been no ash in the room earlier; I would have seen it on the ground. Where did it come from?

Ash began to flow faster through the air and circle the room, orbiting the door. Since the door was so close to where I sat, it seemed like an ash tornado was revolving around my chair.

Then, I heard the whispers.

They were faint, but it sounded like there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people talking in hushed voices behind me. I couldn't make out what they were whispering.

Something touched my shoulder.

That was too much. I was about to turn around and get up when everything stopped.

The ash settled, I felt nothing on my shoulder, and the whispering faded away.

A clicking noise came as the door behind me closed.

Candles flared back to life, relighting the room.

The cultists stood up at the same time and one of them approached me.

"It is done," he said. "You are damned."

That was it? I had only been there for around twenty minutes. What did they get out of this?

The cultist led me out the front door and handed me the briefcase.

I had to make sure they didn't switch it out on me. Popping the latches, I peeked inside.

The bank notes peeked back.

*Is this actually happening?* I thought, as my heart thundered in my chest.

"Well," I said, trying not to pass out, "that was easy." I managed to latch up the briefcase. "Do I just go now?"

"Yes," the cultist said, simply, dismissing me with a wave of his hand.

He watched me stumble away. As I opened my car door—with trembling fingers—to get in, he said one last thing.

"We'll see you soon," the cultist promised, his expression hidden in the darkness under his hood.

*Not likely,* I thought, as I entered my car. It was time to quit my job. This was the best day of my life.

I was suddenly rich beyond my wildest dreams, and I could do anything I wanted.

After I quit my job, I let myself relax and enjoy the beginning of my new, stress-free life. Soon, I would start planning on how to spend my money.

It took about a week for it to begin.

I was walking through the park one evening when a lady with no eyes jogged past me.

*What the hell?* I jumped, startled, and turned to look at her. She was now too far away to see her face. I thought maybe I had imagined it and headed home.

The next day, I entered a convenience store to buy some milk. I glanced at the cashier and casually noticed that he had no eyes or nose; just smooth skin where they should have been, as if he never had them.

I made it about five steps into the store before I stopped. Realization of what I had just seen sank in. I started shaking.

*I imagined it.*

Taking a deep breath, I turned around.

"Need help with anything?" the cashier asked, with his mouth.

He had a very normal mouth. Skin covered the rest of his face.

I screamed and ran to my car.

It took me a week before I had the courage to leave the house again.

Going out my front door, I began walking to the park to see if I could catch glimpses of people from far away. I had to know if their faces were human.

Halfway there, I turned a corner and almost bumped into someone walking in the opposite direction.

"*oH, sOrRy!*" he chittered, his gaping, vertical maw bristling with razor-sharp teeth.

I couldn't even react; my heart had frozen in my chest. My breathing stopped.

This hideous monster stood still for a few moments, overwhelming me with terror, before shrugging and continuing past me.

It took me another few days to calm down and try to rationalize what was happening.

People still seemed to be normal; they just looked different to me, specifically. Was there something wrong with my eyes?

Doctors couldn't find anything wrong. I struggled to remain calm as the horrific abominations examined me.

I started to have the same nightmare every night. In it, a madness sweeps over Earth, an apocalypse leaving only ruin and ash in its wake.

After a few of these dreams, the whispers came back. They've been getting louder recently.

I drove by the church, knowing they had something to do with this, but it had vanished. Only an empty lot remained.

Yesterday, I went to buy groceries. As I was walking through the parking lot, a few of the demons started screeching—their horrific jaws yawning open—and pointing at me.

Consumed by fear, I sprinted to my car and drove away.

When I arrived home, I looked into my bathroom mirror and saw my vertical mouth. It split my face open when I cried out in terror.

This morning, I found a plain cardboard box on my front porch. I have the box open in front of me right now; there are two things inside.

On top is a small, pitch-black card.

An address is on one side. The address of the church.

Flipping to the other side reveals three words, printed in bone-white letters:

---

**YOU ARE**

**DAMNED**

---

A black robe fills the rest of the box.
