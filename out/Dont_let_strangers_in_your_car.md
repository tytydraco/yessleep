It was a hot summer night in July, and I was driving home from a friend's barbecue. The windows were down, and the warm breeze was blowing through my hair. I was feeling relaxed and happy, enjoying the freedom of the open road.
As I turned onto the highway, I noticed 

that the sky was starting to darken. I thought it was strange, since it was only 8 PM, but I didn't think much of it. I turned on the radio, and the first thing I heard was a warning about a severe thunderstorm coming our way.
I rolled up the windows and turned on my headlights. The rain started to come 

down in sheets, and the wind was howling through the trees. I could barely see the road ahead of me, but I knew I had to keep going.
As I drove down a deserted stretch of road, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a woman standing on the side of the road, drenched from the rain. I felt a pang of sympathy for her and pulled over to offer her a ride.

As she climbed into my car, I noticed something was off about her. Her eyes were wide and fearful, and she seemed to be shaking with fear. I asked her if she was okay, but she didn't respond.
As we drove on, the storm grew worse, and the wind howled louder. Suddenly, the woman began to scream, and I swerved

 to avoid hitting something in the road. When I looked back to see what it was, I saw a ghostly figure standing in the middle of the road.
I slammed on the brakes, and my car screeched to a halt. The woman in my car was now sobbing uncontrollably, and I could see that she was terrified. I tried to calm her down, but she just kept crying and shaking.


Then, I heard a tapping on the car window. It was the ghostly figure, and it was now trying to get into the car. I could see its face pressed against the glass, its eyes glowing with a sinister red light.

I tried to start the car, but the engine wouldn't turn over. The ghostly figure continued to tap on the window, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I knew I had to get out of there, but I didn't know how.
Suddenly, the woman in my car stopped crying and turned to face me. Her eyes were now glowing with the same red light as the ghostly figure outside. 

She opened her eyes. I was in a state of shock, though I knew I had to get away I broke the window and ran out of the door to a gas station, I completely deserted my car. I went to bed that night and it was hard to sleep. When I went to where my car was the night before it was gone; it was in my drive way. Itâ€™s almost like none of this happened.
