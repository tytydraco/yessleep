Hello? Can you hear me?

This is Free Athens— Free Athens calling.

I will be as quick as I can.

Brothers—



The greatest foe we have ever faced has arrived on our doorstep. The outskirts of Athens have been overtaken by their fire, and I fear soon will I.

But we are a strong race, we are a defiant people. We have fought to the death against the Persians, the Ottomans, the Italians, and with God as my witness we will do it again.

In the ever nearing future this station will no longer be Greek. When it is, it will speak only lies. Do not listen.



Resist!



Heed my warning. The message I speak will ring in the halls of eternity. It will be heard now and when now comes again, and again, and again, to the end of the universe, and into the next.

Time… time is one of humanity’s greatest misunderstandings



By their own will or the will of others all we have heard on time has been a lie. From the teacher, from the preacher, from the man of science, let it be disregarded.

Time is not a line, nor does it move forward. Time is a ring, a cycle.

A perfectly circular road on which everything occurs.

One runner on this road earth.

The other is heaven.

They race and race forever and ever.



Earth is simple. It moves at a constant rate, one step at a time. One second in Athens, is one second in Thessaloniki, is one second in London.

Heaven is sporadic. It falls behind then leaps ahead. You never know if they are at the beginning, end or everything between.

But at the dawn of June 14, 1940. The runners—



The runners met.



When bleeding hands clasp one another to whisper a silent prayer.

When death and decay fuses to the pillars which hold the world.

When blood is spilled at a rate it never has been and never again will,

Heaven listens.



And when the runners are racing next to one another,

Things… slip through the gaps made by echoing prayer.

The death of our people and the people of all races deemed unworthy of life attracted them like flies to rotting meat.

The men of science, the German madmen—they wedged a crowbar into the gaps and pried with all their might.

They tore away at the thin veil with machines man should have never made. With ancient rituals long forgotten. With a sadistic cruelty only they could muster, and with growing strength, knocked on the other world’s door.



And something answered.



And the War for Heaven began again. As it has before. As it always will.

But this time it was not as a story.

It melted like juices of a decaying beast through a stone paved road, seeping the other side. Through the cracks in time they came. Through our bombs, through our bullets, through our actions which all of us have contributed.



They—the Germans—thought they could issue orders to beings that they cannot understand, who have fallen and who no longer allow themselves to be controlled by any chain.

But these beings do not serve a mortal.

Fallen or not.



Those who seek to enslave our people are no longer men, are no longer natural.

They have wings within wings made of rust and tar. Eyes without lids who look through you. Rows of teeth made of the very essence of darkness. When they step onto sacred ground they leave not prints, but scorches on time itself.

I can hear them now—



I wish not to have what has been done to them be done onto me. It would be the greatest injustice in the world. I would be no more than a serf plowing the fields of a long dead master. To be honest it terrifies me, losing myself, existing but for all true purposes being dead.

But I refuse to stop resisting.

Greece, oh great home of the Hellenes—

The womb of the world sent to face its end. The bosom of life known only to death.

I know not of the millennium in which this will reach its final resting place.

In which worlds it may caress.

Or in which medium it will be let die.

But when you hear this—

in this life or the next—



Fight!



Do not lose grasp on who you are… Who we are.

Remember our history. We have fought and bled and died for thousands of years thousands of times.

Remember how we held at Thermopylae.

Remember how we fought until the final lights of Constantinople had been killed.

What is an Emperor without an Empire? What are Greeks without Greece?

We fight not like heroes, heroes fight like us!

We have never been alone in this race.

God stands with us, and he weeps as he watches us.



Brothers—sisters—keep heads held high.



The fight will never be over.



Long live the ever beating heart of Greece.



Long live the eternal flame in its soul.



Greece is not yet lost!



Ζήτω η Ελλάδα!



Caution…



The broadcast… in moments…



…will be correct.



Listen not to heresy.



Strength is through unity.



Yavans!



Do not turn the dial. We are the one true station, all others are lies.

There is nothing else.

We are your only voice.

Anyone otherwise is a traitor.

Do not let yourself be overcome with what they falsely promise.

Do not move from your current locations.



Athens is and will be ok.



Peace is a promise which will be paid out.

The War for Heaven will be won.

We haven’t succeeded yet but not even God could stop us.



The flame will be put out.

Our shining beacon of truth and reason will continue to shine forever.



Long live the Yavan State!
