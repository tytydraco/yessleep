I’ve been a counselor for twenty-six years.

One of the first things I learned is that people trust counselors even when we don’t deserve it.

They trust us with everything — their experiences, emotions, past, pain, fears, hopes. Above all, people trust us with their stories.

Everyone loves stories.

Don’t get me wrong. Everyone doesn’t love books. Everyone doesn’t love movies. Everyone doesn’t love TV or plays or operas or musicals. But everyone loves the heart of the book and the movie and the TV show and theater.

That heart is the story.

We love stories because they always have meaning. People crave meaning. We need it. If we don’t have it, we create it. The easiest things to create meaning with, of, and for ourselves are stories.

One of my greatest privileges is helping people weave their experiences, emotions, pasts, pain, and hopes into something with meaning. To see that their lives have a purpose. That there’s always a reason.

That there’s a point.

I’ve been trying to find the point of what I’m about to share for a very long time. No matter what I do, I can’t.

When I was seven, my parents disowned my big brother Matt.

Overnight, he vanished from my home, my family, and my life. From everything but my memory. I wasn’t even allowed to say his name.

My parents didn’t tell me why. They didn’t need to. I trusted them. I trusted that there was purpose in everything they did. I trusted that there was a reason I no longer had a brother.

I trusted that there was a point.

Let’s skip ahead eight years.

A whole lifetime for me. In that lifetime, I’ve gained three little brothers and baby sister who Matt never even met. I’ve lived more years without Matt than with him. It’s been so long I barely think about him.

One night before dinner, the phone rings.

We aren’t the kind of family that answers the phone during mealtimes, but I’m expecting a call from a girl I like. Besides, dinner hasn’t officially started. So I dodge my dad and answer.

“Hello,” I say.

“Is this Mark?”

It’s not the girl from church. It’s someone who sounds nervous, tired, and horrifically sad. That sadness terrifies me. I want to hang up. I almost do.

Instead I say, “Who’s this?”

“My name is Jacob. I’m Matt’s friend. Do you remember Matt?”

“Of course,” I say, even though that’s mostly a lie now.

“Good. That’s good. I’m calling on his behalf.”

“Why isn’t he calling himself?” I asked, even though I knew he wasn’t allowed to.

“Because he’s sick. I don’t want to scare you, but he’s very sick. Are your parents there?”

I glance at my dad. There’s no way I look at him for more than a second, but it feels like a year. “Yeah.”

“Can I talk to them? Please?”

The grief in that voice pours through the phone and soaks me where I stand. I don’t want to talk to that voice. I don’t want my dad to talk to it, either.

I hand him the phone anyway.

And over the course of the next two minutes, maybe less, I watch my dad drown.

Matt was dying.

Technically of pneumonia, nontechnically of AIDS. He’d lived on the streets for a few years after we abandoned him. He pulled himself out of homelessness and gotten his life on track just in time to get that diagnosis. By then, the disease was too advanced to treat.

And now he was dying.

He wasn’t even in a hospital. He was in a hospice house because he had a couple of weeks to live if he was lucky, a couple of days if he wasn’t. That’s why Jacob called — because Matt wanted to see us before he died. That was his final wish:

To see the family who had cast him out.

We flew out that night. And on the way to the airport, my sobbing father finally revealed why we disowned him:

Because he’d caught Matt with a boyfriend.

That was it. That was the reason. That was the point of getting rid of their son:

To punish him for being gay.

I don’t think I had one coherent thought between that disclosure and the moment we pulled up to the hospice house.

It was a Catholic hospice. Most of the nurses were nuns, and the administrator was a priest who directed us to the waiting room. We sat there for a long time, just another sad family in a small sea of sad families. The man across from us looked saddest of all. Sadder than anyone I’ve ever seen. So sad I wanted to hug him.

Finally, the nurse called us back.

She made us wait in the hall while she gave us the most depressing rundown I’ve ever heard: \*He’s out of it because of painkillers. He won’t be awake for long. His skin integrity is failing, so he’s bleeding a lot, so you’re not allowed to touch him. Even if he asks, even if he cries, you’re not allowed to touch him.\*

When we finally got to see him, my mom burst into tears and I came close.

He looked like a nightmare.

Sallow, emaciated, covered in raw bruises and bandages. White bandages stained with red blood, like a visual encapsulation of corruption. He scared me so badly…

Until he smiled.

His smile was beyond beautiful.

It was radiant, absolutely radiant, with love. Love for us, his abandoners, his abusers, his betrayers. After everything we did to him and everything we stole from him, he still somehow loved us enough to smile like that.

The nurse looked at Matt with that same radiant love. Every time she glanced at my parents, though, her expression turned to pure loathing.

I was glad. Loathing is what we deserved, not love.

What followed was kind of a blur. I wish it wasn’t, but it is. Lots of smiling, more crying, endless apologies.

I felt so apart from it all.

Like I was on the outside looking in, but beyond that. Like it wasn’t real at all. Like it wasn’t really happening, wasn’t part of my real life, wasn’t part of my story.

Matt got tired really fast, just like the nurse warned us. Before he faded, he called for the priest who asked us all to bow our heads and led us in prayer. It was all supposed to be beautiful and meaningful.

But it wasn’t.

It had no meaning at all.

None.

\*That’s\* why none of this — not my family’s change of heart, not our reunion, not even my brother dying before my eyes — felt real to me. Why I felt like it wasn’t part of my life or my story:

Because it had no point.

There we were, crying and loving and being a family. If we were doing it now, we could have been doing it all along.

So why didn’t we?

Why did we abandon Matt in the first place? Why did we vanish him? Why did we make sure we lost him?

\*What had been the point?\*

All those years — that entire lifetime — were gone. Matt’s life was over. The lost time could never be found, our relationship could never be repaired, our abandonment could be undone or overcome or fixed.

And there had never even been a point.

I stood up mid-prayer and stumbled out of Matt’s room, down the long liminal hall, and into the reception room. I collapsed into the same chair, the one across from the saddest man I’d ever seen.

And just like that, I knew.

“Are you Matt’s boyfriend?” I blurted.

He nodded. “Mark?” His voice was husky and small and even sadder than I remembered.

“Yeah.”

He put on a smile that was somehow even sadder than his voice. “It’s good to meet you.”

I tried to smile back, but my face fell apart instead. “Did your parents kick you out too?”

He shook his head. “My parents and I are close.”

“Did…did they like Matt?” I started to cry.

So did he. He reached over and took my hands. “Very much,” he said.“They come visit every day.”

I’m not sure how it happened or what I was thinking, but I tightened my hands around his, stood up, and dragged him into Matt’s room.

When they saw each other, the love between them was palpable. Radiance that was more than radiance.

I took comfort in that.

I took comfort in the nurse, too. The one that looked at my parents with cold hatred but shone with light when she looked at Matt. Compared to her, my parents looked dull and dead. I knew I did, too.

I didn’t want that.

Not then, not now, not ever. I wanted to be bright. I wanted to be radiant, to shine on everyone I met until they felt loved.

I’ve been trying to do that ever since.

Let’s skip forward again.

My relationship with my parents never recovered. I tried and they tried, but trying wasn’t enough. In fact, trying just made everything worse, and it didn’t take long to accept there was no point trying anymore.

When I graduated, I ran away. Then I ran some more, then ran even farther than that. I ran until I found something that felt like it had a point.

That turned out to be the hospice house where Matt died.

I’d never come across anything like it.

It was run by a Catholic order. Whatever you’re thinking about the Catholic Church is valid — trust me, I know — but none of it applied to that hospice. It was everything the Church is supposed to be.

I loved it.

From there, I got involved in the parish. The priest, an elderly Filipino named Tadeo, welcomed me with open arms and put me straight to work, which quickly put me in touch with dozens of other charity providers in the city.

That was when everything fell into place. When believed there was meaning.

When I finally felt like I’d found the point.

I dived in deep.

Before I knew it, I was spending every waking hour helping whoever I could. It was bad enough that Father Tadeo cut me off for a while. “Rest,” he said. “You need to rest.”

I didn’t want to rest.

I wanted to double down, so I did. I spent my days off cooking meals in my tiny kitchen and buying supplies for care packages that I distributed myself. I even installed my own phone line and gave the number to everyone I met so that they could reach me if they needed help.

In hindsight, my behavior was pathological, and it wasn’t selfless. It was penance for Matt. If I helped enough people, then maybe one day the good would outweigh what I’d done to my brother.

So I did all the good I could.

And that was my life.

Shelter work, street outreach, meals on wheels, soup kitchens, back alleys and highway overpasses, abandoned buildings and the dark corners of city parks — wherever forgotten people go, I went.

They didn’t want me there at first.

Earning their trust was a long road. People who have been kicked aside and forgotten don’t trust easily. They can’t afford to. I knew that, so I worked triple time to prove myself trustworthy.

I finally made headway with an old guy named Caleb. For a couple of months, I met him every other day with food and cigarettes while I shilled my services — connections to charities, shelters, food banks, free clinics, transportation, the hot meals I cooked myself. He barely spoke. He just smiled and smoked and made jokes. I didn’t mind. I knew this was his way of vetting me.

And one afternoon, he smacked my back and said, “You need to meet my friend Charise.”

“Who’s Charise?”

“The one you need. She’s the girl everybody trusts. If she trusts you, everyone else will too. Don’t you actually call her Charise, though. If you call her anything but Reese, she’ll kick your ass to Arkansas. You don’t want Reese to kick your ass anywhere, especially Arkansas.”

He led me to a daisy-choked overpass beneath a bridge that spanned the river gorge. There, chilling out with a book and a ziplock bag of cookies, was Reese.

Reese was something.

She was over six feet tall and built like an MMA fighter, with a temper to match. But she had the saddest eyes. Like a scared kid staring out of a grownup face.

And behind those eyes and under that temper was the most selfless person I’ve ever met.

Caleb hadn’t lied — everyone on the streets trusted Reese.

She was almost a celebrity. It didn’t matter where we went. All she had to do was don her trademark white sweatshirt and sit on a bench or a sidewalk somewhere, and people would start creeping up. People who were homeless, or mentally ill, or suffering addiction, or who’d had to run away from home just to survive. People who had been taught in the cruelest ways to trust no one.

And Reese — this glowering, foul-mouthed giant who could smash your head in with one wrong move — had earned the trust of every last one of them.

And no wonder.

She was great with everyone, but kids especially. When you’re forced to live the lives these kids had, you learn to recognize safety. That’s why they trusted Reese — they knew she was safe. They knew she’d protect them. They knew she’d love them.

That’s actually the first time I came to terms with my own hubris.

The savior complex is the charity worker’s curse, and by God, I was cursed. Until I met Reese, part of me believed I was the only man to ever to shine the light of compassion and kindness upon the poor homeless folk. But here was Reese, who’d been spreading light so bright it burned through everything. Reese, who’d been giving everything she had to these kids for years.

Reese loved all of them, but her favorite was CJ.

CJ was fifteen. She wore sandals year-round to show off her neon-green home pedicure. She had crazy curly hair that she kept tied up in the highest, tightest bun. Her laugh was the best thing in the world, goofy and hiccupy and so loud it drew stares. She had an ancient dog named Eeyore who walked with a limp and had cataracts. CJ loved Eeyore. She loved Eeyore the way God loves His children.

CJ also had a terrible temper, severe mental instability, and really bad addiction trouble. By the time I met her, she was horrifically thin. Her little body reminded me of Matt. Withered and terribly old, but far too young at the same time.

She was alive despite it, though. Wildly, wonderfully alive.

I didn’t know the story behind her friendship with Reese. I just know it involved Reese shooting a pimp. That was enough for me.

Anyway, CJ worshipped Reese. Once she got to know me, she tagged along with us on our charity routes just to be near Reese. Reese was her best friend. Her protector. Her savior.

Right up until CJ got swept up in Reverend More’s congregation.

But I’ll get to that.

Once Reese vouched for me, the people who trusted her learned to trust me too. The more they trusted me, the more \*Reese\* trusted me. It was a positive feedback loop that fostered a genuine friendship.

As that friendship blossomed, she began to confide in me.

Everything she told me was tragic, made all the more so by the matter-of-fact way she recited it all. It started bad, got worse, then much worse, then unimaginably bad, before ending with the disclosure that she was dying. Stomach cancer, metastasized to her lungs and liver. Twenty-six years old, and dying of cancer.

Talk about pointlessness.

Reese actually \*did\* talk about pointlessness a lot. She was consumed with the concept of it, just like me. She said \*I’m pointless\* even more often than I thought it.

“That’s not true,” I said one day. “You’ve got CJ.”

“For now,” she answered. “But that won’t last. I love that girl. I’d die for her. I’d kill for her again. But someday she’s going to end up right where she was before, and I can’t do anything about it.”

“She’s still a point.”

“She’s a point about as much as Chellie’s a point.”

“Who’s Chellie?”

“My girlfriend.”

I won’t lie — that stung. That stung bad. “I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.”

“The way she treats me, I barely know I have a girlfriend, either. See? No point. Well, except maybe these.” She pulled a ragged plastic baggie out of her backpack. It was filled with something crumbled and pale.

“What the hell are those?”

“Cookies. She makes them for me every week. Want one?”

“No.”

“Good call.” She popped one into her mouth.

“I mean it, Reese. Your life’s not pointless.”

“It is,” she said thickly.

“What about me? And all the good work we do?”

“The work is your point,” she said. “Not mine.”

“You could make it your point.”

For some reason, this made her laugh. That made me feel really good, right up until her laugh turned into a coughing fit. 

You would never even know Reese was sick if it weren't for her cough.

It was terrible, this thick, phlegmy, bloody cough. When she had a bad fit, it got everywhere and stained her sweatshirt. Red eating up the white.

But that was the only sign. Otherwise, she looked and acted so healthy it was easy to forget she was sick. Lots of people did. I definitely did.

That’s why I roped her in to all my charity routes. And we were a great team. Everything I once did alone, we now did together. Shelter work, street outreach, meals on wheels, soup kitchens — wherever forgotten people go, we went.

And we weren’t the only ones.

We were working side by side with people from all kinds of programs. We’re talking state, county, city, big churches, little churches, and everything in between and beyond. A lot of them truly wanted to help.

But not all of them.

You have to understand that marginalized people are targets. Socially, politically, religiously, economically, even personally — everyone wants something from the marginalized individual, even if that something is as simple as \*Go away\*. Thankfully, none of the outreach places wanted that.

Unfortunately, a lot of them wanted much more.

Charity is the perfect sheep costume for a hungry wolf, and there were a lot of wolves running around back then. The weirdest of these wolves was a faith healer called Reverend More.

Reverend More was an old televangelist who stayed and set up shop after stopping in during the election season. He’d been in town for about a year at that point, and worked out of a community building funded by a local philanthropist. He aimed his ministry at marginalized people.

It was a startlingly big ministry.

In addition to his church, he ran a halfway house that was so successful that every participant went on to bigger and better things. Some got jobs at his church. A few got shipped off to his headquarters back east. Some integrated into the community, and a bizarrely high number left the area for better opportunities.

The city government was thrilled. Any solution to visible signs of homelessness and poverty was welcome, and Reverend More was clearly very good at erasing visible signs.

But I was suspicious.

I’d never seen any program with a perfect cure rate for addiction and mental illness, so I was skeptical. Scared, too. Some of the people who entered his programs and moved on were people I knew. People I cared for. People I actually loved. To see them vanish in droves frightened me.

But there was nothing to do. Politicians adored Reverend More. The homeowners cheered him on. Both political parties endorsed him.

And the disadvantaged populations liked him, too.

Even I couldn’t find anything wrong with him. I mean, come on — he was running successful charities, productive treatment centers, a popular church, and a street-based ministry that helped people even Reese couldn’t reach.

He didn’t even take anything from them. All his donations came from the wealthy. Unlike every other hardline preacher, Reverend More accepted no tithes, asked for no money, and in fact took nothing from any congregant who passed his donated threshold.

I crossed that donated threshold myself several times, just to see what he was about.

I never liked what I saw.

The chapel was always full to bursting. The worshippers watched, enraptured, as the reverend preached the strangest version of hellfire and salvation I’ve ever heard. Every few minutes, he’d call on someone from the audience, which was the most mismatched crowd you could imagine. Local celebrities and rich folks were rubbing shoulders with people society threw away. Animals wound through the crowd, too. Cats and dogs mostly, but chickens too, and goats, iguanas, parrots, even a pony sometimes. It was like someone had freed a petting zoo in the building. It took a couple of services for me to figure out that was because the reverend offered healing services to animals as well as people.

He wasn’t even the healer.

That honor went to a young woman named Rochelle. The congregation adored her almost as much as they adored him, and it was easy to see why. She was beautiful, exceptionally so, with long black hair and a face like a porcelain doll. During the services, she always wore a flowing white dress and a thick red blindfold.

She was also the subject of the most impressive special effects I’ve ever seen in a church service.

First, they did something with her blindfold that made it look like her eyes were shining through the fabric. Like she had stars instead of eyes.

Second — and more impressively — whenever she laid hands on a worshipper, light rose from their skin like glittering steam. When that light touched her, it coalesced into these shining ribbons that snaked up her wrist like living creatures. When she finally removed her hands, she’d take those ribbons and somehow weave them into these big, shining rings of light.

From what I could tell, these rings of light represented the worshippers’ ailments. The physical embodiment of their illnesses, vices, injuries — whatever they needed to be healed from, Rochelle apparently pulled them all out and wove them into rings of pure light.

Once she wove a ring, she presented it to Reverend More, who made a huge production of blessing it before throwing it into a ceramic trash can etched with bizarre symbols.

The crowd loved it. They loved her. They loved \*him\*. I’ve never seen anyone or anything — not any other preacher, not a musician, not a celebrity, not God himself — inspire half the adoration as Reverend More.

But something about him felt incredibly wrong to me. I’ve never seen or felt anything that unsettled my spirit so thoroughly. I felt not only frightened but \*corrupt\* just by being close to him.

But as far as I could tell, I was the only one.

Like I said, people adored Reverend More, especially the people I worked with. \*My\* people. I didn’t understand it. It had taken me months to earn their trust, and for good reason. Like I said, charities are rife with wolves, and anyone with half a brain will treat you like a wolf until you prove you’re a lamb.

I was jealous that no one applied that same standard to Reverend More. Jealous, and bitter too.

My only solace was that Reese hated him as much as I did. After CJ joined his church, she hated him even more.

Reese was furious about that.

She was so mad that she even refused to see CJ for a while. It went so long and got so bad that CJ finally sent someone to intercede on her behalf.

The intercessor came one evening while Reese and I were eating burgers in the daisy patch by the bridge where we’d first met. It was nice, smelling flowers while the sun set and the river rushed nearby.

Not to sound like a creep, but the intercessor was even nicer.

She was beautiful, with dark eyes, long black hair and a face like a porcelain doll. It took a second, but I recognized her:

Reverend More’s pretty healer.

“Chellie,” Reese said. “Pardon me, darling, but where the fuck have you been?”

I choked on my burger. \*This\* was Chellie? \*Reverend More’s assistant\* was Reese’s girlfriend? Reese’s \*girlfriend? Reese’s\* girlfriend?

Chellie tossed a ziplock bag at Reese — more of those cookies, from what I could see — then plopped down on the grass between us. “Don’t be a jerk. CJ misses you. So do I.”

“Then get out of that fucking church.”

“You know I can’t.”

Something passed between them, heavy and awful and much too strange to interpret.

Then Chellie put her hand on my shoulder. “What’s so bad about churches? He’s with a church, and you like him fine.”

“He’s with all the churches,” Reese said. “So it doesn’t count.”

“He’s not with my church.”

“I know. That’s why he and I get along.”

Chellie frowned. “Come on.”

“Come on, what?”

“Why do you hate it so much?”

“Because when people like me go into that church, we don’t always come out again.”

“It was your church too.”

“Yeah, for like twelve seconds.”

“Stop ignoring CJ. And stop pretending I don’t exist.”

“Then stop with your religious bullshit.”

What followed was a fight.

That fight ended in laughter for them, and a whole lot of very difficult feelings for me.

As time passed and I got to know Chellie better, those feelings just got harder.

A real and very strong friendship blossomed between us very fast. Our friendship strengthened what I had with Reese, and I grew to love both of them so much. I’m not sure I ever loved anyone more.

I will say they definitely loved each other more than either of them loved me.

I know Reese called Chellie her girlfriend, but I’m not sure about that. The nature of their relationship confused me. It still kind of does. Frankly, I think it confused them.

But whatever it was, it was beautiful. So beautiful it hurt to see. So beautiful it hurt to be on the outside of it.

In hindsight, I was in love with Reese, just too stupid to know it. But I wasn’t too stupid to know I was falling for Chellie.

Even if you set her involvement with Reverend More aside, Chellie wasn’t entirely great. She was mean, she was kind of dishonest, and she wasn’t all there. None of those things were a problem for me, if I’m being honest. But I pretended otherwise.

She was smart too, and charming, and perceptive. Most importantly she cared as deeply as Reese. She loved CJ and all the other kids who chased Reese around the city like ducklings. She loved all the older ducks too. In so many ways, she was great.

I had a really hard time reconciling that greatness with Reverend More.

I finally asked her about it one day, kind of expecting her to get mad.

Instead she smiled at me, big and bright. “Hasn’t Reese told you?”

“Reese doesn’t talk about you much, if I’m being honest.”

Her face fell. “She used to, but I guess I ruined that.”

“Because of Reverend More?”

“No, but he didn’t exactly help.”

“Do you believe what he preaches?”

She snorted. “Have you heard what he preaches? Seriously, have you ever actually listened?”

“Of course.” Although that wasn't true. Now that I was thinking about it, I realized I couldn’t recall a single one of his sermons. “So why are you involved with him?”

“Because there's something in it for me.”

“Which is…?”

“My world.” Her smile grew blissful. “My whole entire world.”

“You want to tell me what that means?”

“No. Maybe later, when I like you better.” She took my hand in hers and pulled me close. “Now look, you don’t have to like Reverend More. I don’t. But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s my savior. And no matter what she says, he’s Reese’s savior, too.”

On that enigmatic note, she flounced off.

But she flounced right back in no time.

I saw a lot of her over the next few weeks. She and Reese spent a lot of time with me, first on my volunteer routes, and later at my apartment. We got really close really fast. Or at least, I felt like I got really close to her really fast.

One afternoon, that closeness reached critical mass. I kind of lost myself, and kissed her. She kissed me back. Not for long, but long enough.

About five seconds after she pulled away, Reese came in. “Isn’t it time for you to skip off to church like a good girl?” she asked Chellie.

“It is. See you soon.” Chellie smiled her big, bright smile, then took off into the night.

When she was gone, Reese said, “Mark, you and I need to talk.”

I blushed, but made my voice as hearty and carefree as possible. “About what?”

“Chellie.”

“I’m sorry,” I said. “We just—”

“I don’t care about that,” she interrupted. “I’m actually kind of glad. It’s good knowing someone will be here to take care of her when I’m gone."

I couldn’t quite meet her eyes. “Still, I’m sorry.”

“Yeah, whatever. Take a seat.”

I took a seat.

“Now listen. Someday, probably soon — based on tonight, \*very\* soon — Chellie’s going to ask you to help me.”

“I’ll always help you, Reese. You know that.”

“The problem is, nothing she asks will actually help me.” She fixed me with a stare that bored through my very core. “She’s going to ask you all kinds of shit. Some of it won’t make sense, but some of it will. It doesn’t matter. You have to tell her no.”

“What exactly do you think she’s going to ask me?”

She settled back and bit into one of her cookies. “I love Chellie,” she said. “More than I've ever loved anything. Even when she’s being a bitch, Chellie makes me happy, and she’s the only thing on earth that makes me feel safe. Like, my life has no point. Never has, never will. Chellie is what I have instead of a point. She’s all I’ve got, and that's okay because she’s a lot more than most people get.”

“I know,” I said. “And so are you.”

She waved me off. “Just remember that before you get mad about what I tell you next.”

“I’ll remember.”

She took another bite. “Chellie isn’t sane.”

“She seems pretty sane to me.”

“That’s because she’s hot, charming, and reads emotions like we read street signs. Think of it this way: She’s wearing a sanity uniform, but it doesn’t fit quite right and it's cheap besides. Pay attention next time you talk to her. You’ll see exactly what I mean.”

“What about her isn’t sane?”

“For one thing, she thinks she’s possessed.”

“By what?”

“A demon, dipshit. A demon named Star Eyes. That’s why she’s attached to Reverend More. He convinced her he can help her control it. And—”

She cut off.

“And?” I prompted.

She smiled. “Now you’re going to think \*I’m\* crazy.”

“You probably are. I bet it’s why the two of you are a match.”

Her face darkened so abruptly I got chills.

“Sorry,” I said. “I was just—”

“Don’t worry. You didn’t say anything wrong. I just hate that word.”

“What, match?”

“Yeah. Match.” She popped another cookie into her mouth. “All right. So years ago, Chellie accidentally did an exorcism on her mom.”

“How did she do an accidental exorcism?”

“That’s exactly the question I wanted you to ask. Chellie’s crazy, and she’s wrong about almost everything, but she’s very special. Not just because she’s pretty and charming and full of love for idiots like me and thee, either. She’s basically got magic powers.”

“What kind of powers?”

“She’s a miracle worker. She heals people.”

“So she’s \*actually\* a faith healer? Like at More’s church?”

“No. Whatever Reverend More has her doing in that church is fake.”

“Okay, but…if she \*can\* heal people, then why would the church-healing be fake?”

“Because I’ve seen her heal people, and I know for a fact that it hurts her.”

“What do you mean?”

“Let’s say you break your finger. I take you to Chellie and ask for help. She says, ‘Oh, of course I’ll help you, Mark, you don’t even have to ask. I’ll do anything for you because I love you so much. Come here.’ She takes your broken finger, holds it for ten seconds, and abracadabra, alakazam, it’s fixed. But Chellie’s finger is broken now. Or maybe it’s her toe. Or her nose is bleeding, or her left eye can’t see so well anymore. Do you understand?”

“I think so, yeah.”

“Okay. Well, Chellie’s mom was a basket case. The kind of lady who makes Chellie look sane. A doctor diagnosed her with some mental illness. When Chellie heard that, she decided to heal her. To fix her mom’s sickness, even if it meant making herself sick. And that’s exactly what happened. She fixed her mama, which broke her mind so badly she convinced herself her mama wasn’t sick at all. That her mom had a demon inside, and now that demon was inside Chellie instead.”

“How do you know all this?” I asked.

“Some of it she told me, some of it I’ve seen. I’ve seen her fix people, Mark, and I’ve seen it hurt her. I’ve seen it nearly kill her. That’s how I know that whatever she’s doing for Reverend More is fake.”

I frowned. “So she’s really just with him because she thinks she’s possessed?”

She heaved a sigh, then ate another cookie. “Kind of. There’s a little more to it. So basically, she thinks Reverend More can teach her how to use Star-Eyes to cure my cancer. But he’ll only teach her if she gives him something in return. She won’t tell me what that is. But she might tell you when she comes to you for help.”

“If she does,” I said.

“\*If\* she does. And i\*f\* she does, you tell her no. No matter what. I don't want help from her, I don’t want help from fake demons or real ones, and I don’t want help from Reverend More.”

That conversation should have done something to diminish my feelings for Chellie, but it just ramped them up. For her \*and\* for Reese.

And in some ways, I didn’t think Chellie was all that crazy.

I actually understood where she was coming from. Don’t get me wrong — magical thinking is bad. Delusional thinking is worse. Stress and trauma increase both, often to catastrophic levels.

And Chellie and Reese were so in love.

They loved with love that was more than love. With Reese’s death imminent, it didn’t surprise me that Chellie went off the deep end. If I was losing what they had, I’d go off the deep end too.

That’s why I was so shocked when Chellie broke it off.

That’s the first time I ever saw Reese cry.

She cried until she coughed up blood, then coughed until her white sweatshirt was spattered with blood, and just kept on crying.

I took her to my apartment and sat with her all night while she cried herself half to death.

Up until that point, I hadn’t seen much evidence of Reese’s illness. I knew intellectually that she was terminal, but I couldn’t reconcile it into reality because she always looked so healthy and strong.

That changed when Chellie left.

Without her, Reese faded fast. We’re not talking months or even weeks. We’re talking days. She went so fast I was sure I’d wake up any day to find her dead. She refused to go to the hospital. She even refused to let me help her. She refused to do everything but fade.

It was my worst nightmare come true, and I didn’t know what to do.

I was terrified, heartbroken, and above all jealous. It’s sick, but true. I was \*jealous\* that I wasn’t enough for Reese. That she didn’t love me enough or even like me enough to consider, just for a second, that I could make her life worth living.

And I guess she was right. I couldn’t do that for her. Only Chellie could.

But Chellie was gone.

One morning, I stood in my bedroom doorway looking at Reese as she lay wheezing in my bed.  She’d been coughing all night. Trickles of dried blood stained her face. She’d lost so much weight in such a short amount of time that she looked cadaverous.

I knew that she was going to die.

And out of nowhere, I thought of my brother Matt.

I remembered the night in the hospice house. How the reality of his death finally brought my parents around to a semblance of humanity.

Maybe the reality of Reese’s death would bring Chellie around.

So I swallowed my pride, and that Sunday, I struck out for Reverend More’s church. I left an hour early because I hoped to talk to her before the service started.

Even though I arrived early, the makeshift chapel was already bursting with people and animals. I scanned the crowd for Chellie, hoping against hope to see her, but she wasn’t there.

The vast majority of the worshippers around me were visibly homeless or struggling, and I recognized most of them. But here and there I saw well-dressed people too, stiff and out of place, grimacing whenever someone brushed against them.

Before I could get too angry about it, the lights dimmed and the crowd fell silent as booming footsteps echoed across the stage.

I saw his smile before I saw anything else: big and bright in the shadows, shining like a Cheshire cat from hell. Then I saw his eyes, dark as pits and indescribably cold.

Those eyes found mine, and his smile widened.

I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t move at all. I couldn't even think. I was just a lamb frozen in fright before a hungry wolf.

Finally, he raised his arms.

“Welcome!” His voiced boomed, rich and resonant and horribly comforting. “Fear not, God is here and we will prove that tonight!”

The cheers that followed were deafening. I covered my ears as frightened animals went scurrying for cover.

Then Chellie drifted onto the stage, wearing her white dress and red blindfold.

Something about how the lights hit her turned her hair to dark fire and made it look like her eyes were shining through her blindfold, bright as tiny stars.

“You all know the drill!” Reverend More intoned. “And those who don’t soon will! Now, who got First Promise at our last service?”

A knot of people clustered around the stage. For a terrible instant I thought they were going to stampede each other. They might have if one of those rich, well-dressed interlopers hadn’t helped a teenage girl onto the stage. A girl with a neon green pedicure, hair tied in a high bun, and an ancient dog in her arms.

CJ.

CJ and Eeyore of the white face and cataracts.

The reverend made a joke I couldn’t hear over the clamor of the crowd. As they roared with laughter, Chellie tugged his sleeve. He looked down at her, smile faltering briefly, then leaned down. She whispered in his ear. His smile faltered again. Then he reached into his pocket, pulled something out, and slid it over her finger. A ring. A ring that looked for all the world like it was made of light.

Then Chellie placed both her hands on Eeyore

As I watched, light appeared. A narrow column of eerie, living light twined along her fingers,

But it was different.

At all the other services I’d seen, light rose off the body and formed a ring. This time, the ring of light broke apart, drifting down from Chellie’s hand and raining down on Eeyore.

When the last spark faded, Eeyore looked up, tail thumping. His face wasn’t white anymore, and his cataracts were gone.

When he jumped, yipping happily, the congregation went feral.

They went even more feral when Reverend More started inviting worshippers onstage.

Chellie laid hands on them one by one. Every time, light rose from their bodies like steam and coalesced into rings that Reverend More blessed before tossing away.

But \*why\*?

If a ring of light had visibly healed Eeyore, then the light was the source of the healing.

So why was he pulling light \*out\* of people instead of putting it \*in\*?

And why didn’t anyone seem to \*notice\*?

Reverend More must have called fifty people to that stage, maybe more. Enough that I lost count. Enough that even I got swept away in the wild joy of the congregation. It felt like I was in a dream. Like nothing was real, and never had been.

Finally, he announced, “We are nearly at our end! We have time for a final supplicant before First Promise! Who shall it be?”

The worshippers went insane.

Dogs howled, birds screeched, people roared and cheered and screamed. The chapel transformed into a living mural of sweat-drenched bodies and foul smells, of shining faces and madly rolling eyes as everyone clamored for Reverend More’s attention.

His smile spread as his eyes swept the crowd and caught mine.

Somehow that smile got even bigger.

Inhumanly big. Like a crocodile, or a shark, or a starving wolf.

He pointed at me.

Every head turned, eyes glittering like dull stones at the bottom of a river. Then they reached out, nearly as one, and swept me forward like a human current as terror tore through me.

And just like that, I was onstage.
