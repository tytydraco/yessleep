“It’s not blood,” laughed my colleague Stu when I showed him [this picture](https://www.reddit.com/user/disco-dingus/comments/184fmsv/what_started_it_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which I took on my walk to work that morning. The “K” in Park Road was clearly underlined with blood. What made it worse is my name is Karl, and my paranoia was getting the better of me.

“What is it then?” I asked.

He shrugged. “I dunno; red marker? Didn’t you ever deface public property when you were a kid?”

I sighed and took my phone back. “But why *that* letter?”

“Maybe they’re out to get you, *Karl*,” he said dramatically, laughing to himself.

“Not funny,” I said, sitting at my desk. I stared at the computer screen but my mind was elsewhere.

“You’re really bothered about it, aren’t you?” asked Stu, snapping me out of a daze.

I nodded. “A little.”

“You need to lay off the horror movies, mate.”

“When have you ever known me to watch a horror movie?” I said. “I couldn’t think of anything worse.”

“Apart from finding your initial underlined with blood,” he winked. I gave him the finger and checked my emails.

When my girlfriend Jess came over that night, she stared at me blankly when I showed her the picture and explained my thoughts.

“Oh, you’re serious?” she said. “I don’t know what to say.”

“Do you think it looks like blood at least?” I asked.

She looked at the picture again. “I guess? But don't worry about it.”

“I don’t know, Jess. It makes me feel uneasy. I really want to know why someone did that.”

She rubbed my arm. “You’re probably never gonna know, Karl. It’s just a random thing. Anyway, let’s take your mind off it. What are we watching?”

“Something lighthearted please,” I said, resting my head on her shoulder. I mean, it was almost always something lighthearted due to my dislike for anything remotely creepy, disturbing, or gross. Jess always indulged me though, even though she loves anything horror related. She has a group of uni friends who she watches those things with.

Jess is studying a masters in civil engineering. She’s so smart, runs circles around me. But she never makes me feel stupid, even though I hardly ever understand the things she talks about regarding her studies.

The next morning I woke up with a headache for the second time in a few days. I didn’t need something else to obsess over so I didn’t mention it to Jess. She was scrambling eggs when I shuffled into the kitchen.

“You’ll make a fine housewife one day,” I joked, kissing her cheek. She raised an eyebrow over the frame of her glasses.

“Don’t make me whack you,” she said, holding up the wooden spoon.

“We both know you’d be the breadwinner,” I said as I poured coffee. “I can’t wait to be a kept man.”

We ate breakfast together before she left for uni.

“Pay no attention to that sign today,” she said in the hallway of my building. “I know what you’re like.”

“I won’t,” I lied.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” She pulled out some banknotes from her bag and handed them to me. “From Jacob, with thanks.”

Jacob was one of her uni friends who had bought a winter jacket of mine that I had worn once for a trip to Iceland. It wasn’t cheap so I was glad to get something for it, having no intention of wearing it again.

“Tell him thank you,” I said.

“Buy yourself something pretty, sweetheart,” she said, slapping my butt as she left the building.

I jumped in the shower. When I started washing my feet there was a stinging sensation between two of my toes. When the suds cleared I could see a small red sore.

“What now?” I yelled out. “Jesus Christ, I’m falling apart.”

On my walk to work I stared at the street sign, my eyes drawn to the dark crimson under the letter K. I took a tumble. You know that feeling you get when you’re falling asleep, and there’s a sudden jolt through your body like you’ve fallen? It was like that. My legs just gave way and I ended up sprawled out on the pavement, my heart racing.

“Are you alright mate?” I heard a voice say from behind me. A man had stopped in his car, window down. I felt my face heat up with embarrassment.

“I’m fine,” I said with a little laugh. “Uneven path!”

“You oughta get on to the council,” he said. “What with that and the bloody potholes around here. It’s a nightmare!”

I nodded as I brushed myself off, grateful it wasn’t raining. “Thanks for checking on me, mate.” I took one more glance at the sign as I continued walking, a shiver down my spine.

When I got to work there was a post-it note on my desk:

*Karl, In a meeting all morning, Stu*

He’d underlined the K in red biro, the tosser! I screwed it up and threw it in the bin. Just after 11 Stu made his way over with Derek, another tosser from a few desks down. They both had wide grins plastered to their stupid faces.

“Did you get my note?” asked Stu.

“Up yours,” I said.

“Stu tells me you’ve got a target on your head,” said Derek.

“Show him the picture,” said Stu.

I sighed and pulled out my phone, showing Derek. “I mean, I don’t really think it’s for me or anything, but you’ve gotta admit it’s weird.”

Derek took a closer look, nodding. “Looks like blood to me. Watch your back, Karl.” He sat on the edge of Stu’s desk. Stu ran a finger across his neck and imitated someone bleeding out. Derek was doubled over. I can take a joke but I really wasn’t in the mood that morning. I got up and headed to the staff kitchen.

“Come on, mate!” Stu called after me. When I got to the kitchen I put the kettle on, my stomach in knots.

“Sorry,” said Stu, making me jump as he made an appearance. “Sit down, I’ll finish your cuppa.”

“You don’t have to do that,” I said.

“I insist,” he said, guiding me to the table by my shoulders. “You know I’m just being a dick. Honestly, if it was the other way around I’d probably be bricking it.”

“I know it’s stupid,” I said. “Jess doesn’t think it’s anything to worry about either.”

“I’d listen to her,” he said. “She’s a smart cookie!”

He put the mug of tea down in front of me.

“Strong and sweet,” he said. “Just how I like my men.”

I chuckled. “Speaking of which, have you made any progress with Dylan?”

Dylan was in accounting, and Stu had a total schoolboy crush. “Every time I try to talk to him I crease up and run away.”

“Want me to talk to him for you?” I asked. “My friend Stu *really* likes you.”

“Don’t you dare!” he laughed. “I promise I won’t mention the blood thing again if you promise not to do that.”

He left the kitchen with a mug of his own. I took a sip of tea and almost threw the mug across the room as I put it down, spilling some in the process. For a moment it looked like the mug was filled with blood, but it was just regular strong tea.

“Pull yourself together,” I said under my breath, then cleaned up the mess I had made before going back to work.

Jess came over again that evening.

“You know me,” I said. “I’m a worrier.”

“You’ve been thinking about that sign, haven’t you?”

“No! Well, yeah a little. But it’s something else.” I pulled off my sock and showed her my foot.

“Whoa!” she said. “Yes, your feet smell Karl. You’ll live. I might not.”

“Shut up!” I laughed. “Look at this. I noticed it in the shower.”

I showed her the sore between my toes. She moved a bit closer and lifted her glasses slightly.

“It looks like athlete’s foot,” she said. “Which is highly contagious, so I guess I could have it too. Yay!”

“Gross!” I said. “How the hell have I got athlete’s foot? The only sport I play is FIFA on the PS5.”

She laughed. “Oh, I love you Karl.”

After dinner she poured us some wine and we sat down for more easy watching. We had started The Bear the night before so we continued with that. By the time it got to around 10 I could barely keep my eyes open.

“That wine has gone straight to my head,” I said.

“Lightweight,” she chuckled.

“I’m gonna head to bed. You can watch a bit more if you want.”

“No, I’ll join you,” she said. I was sound asleep before my head hit the pillow!

Once again I woke up with a headache. It felt a bit like a hangover, but I’d only had one glass of wine. I felt like I could sleep for another 10 hours! Ever the hypochondriac, I made a mental note to talk to my GP if it kept occurring. Again, I didn’t mention it to Jess. As she left she reminded me to pick up some cream for my gross foot condition. It really was quite sore.

That evening I was at Stu’s for gaming night. Us and a couple other guys from work met once a week and alternated who hosted. When I got home it was dark. I’ve lived in my building for almost five years now. There are six flats between three floors, and I’m on the middle floor. Thanks to good ol’ muscle memory I don’t need light to find my way.

When I got in my flat I went straight to the bathroom to pee. I had a bit of a shock when I saw a red smudge on my jeans. My hands were smeared with blood, and they immediately started shaking. I frantically looked for a wound but couldn't find one. I backtracked to my door. There was a small amount of blood around the lock, and with a moment's hesitation I opened it. What I found knocked me back.

There was a large blood-red “K” crudely smeared on my door. I fought the vomit my body tried to expel and ran back to the bathroom, scrubbing my trembling hands under painfully hot water. I crept back to the door, a part of me hoping it had all been in my head. The glistening blood was still there. My body jolted again, legs collapsing beneath me. I slid down my door frame as my heart exploded. I couldn't take my eyes off the letter K.

“I was right,” I said to myself. “I was fucking right.”

I noticed my neighbour’s door directly across from me was ajar, a sliver of light down one edge of the frame. I pulled myself up.

“Mr. Harris,” I called out as calmly as possible, knocking on his door. It swung inwards a little and I poked my head inside. “Your door was open.”

He was the oldest resident in our building and had been living there since the 80s. The smell of stale tobacco hit me as I entered.

“Mr. Harris, it’s Karl from across the hall. Are you home?”

When I reached his living room I saw the back of his thinning grey hair in an armchair, a cloud of smoke around him.

“Mr. Harris?” I started to approach him. He was old, but had never shown signs of being hard of hearing. “Did you see or hear anything strange this evening? Someone has…”

He held his pipe with a trembling hand, barely able to meet his lips. I put a hand on his shoulder. “Are you alright Mr. Harris?”

He turned to me with wide eyes and gripped my arm. It made me gasp.

“I…” he stuttered. “I saw… *evil*.”

I called the police. The woman I spoke to told me to slow down as I blurted out what had happened. Within half an hour two detectives turned up. I mentioned the street sign too and one of them left to check it out. The other spoke to Mr. Harris who was pretty shaken up. He said he’d seen a demon painting the blood on my door. Something walked over my grave. My head started spinning and I felt close to a panic attack.

“Calm down,” the detective said to me. “It’s likely whoever did this was wearing a disguise of some kind. Do you know of anyone that could have any reason to target you in this way?”

I shook my head. “No! I… I’m a good person! I get on with everyone. I’d be mortified if I thought I’d upset anyone.”

She did detective things; I assume dusting for fingerprints, and also took photos and blood samples. She also took mine and Mr. Harris’ fingerprints, and said she’d be back at a more suitable hour to talk to the other residents. Saying that my nosy neighbour from downstairs, Pauline, had already made an appearance and had a breakdown on the stairwell. She said she’d pray for me.

“Will someone come to clean this up?” I asked as the detective left.

She shook her head. “Unfortunately that’s your responsibility. We’ll be in touch.”

It was late, but I had to call Jess. When I explained what had happened she thought I was joking until I sent her an image. She insisted on coming over. Her hand covered her mouth when she saw it for herself.

“Oh God,” she said quietly.

“Jess,” I said, close to tears. “I’m scared.”

She pulled me into a tight hug. “I won’t let anyone hurt you.”

She took control of the situation like I knew she would. I was useless without her to guide me. She used an old wash bowl and filled it with warm water and bleach, then she helped me scrub my door. She made mint tea and ran a bath which we shared. I put my arms around her as we laid back.

“I don’t know what I'd do without you,” I said, kissing the top of her head. The warm water and her company helped me relax somewhat. Before I knew it my eyes were getting heavy. She helped me dry off and put me to bed.

When I woke up I felt awful. My head and joints ached. I crawled out of bed and was taken aback by my appearance in the bedroom mirror. My skin was pale bordering on grey.

“Oh fuck,” I said to myself. There was no way I was going to work. I probably wouldn’t have gone regardless after what happened the night before. When I checked my phone it had gone 11. I was shocked, having never slept that late ever. There were several missed calls from work and from Jess, who I assumed had already left.

I called work to apologise and explain how I felt. I have a decent attendance record and my boss was genuinely concerned, telling me to take all the time I needed. There was a Whatsapp message from Jess too explaining she had to leave as she couldn’t miss uni, and to call her ASAP.

“I felt bad,” she said over the phone. “But you were sound asleep. I figured you could do with the extra time.”

“You were right,” I said. “I feel like death.”

“Do you want me to come over? I can get out of…”

“No! Thank you, but I’ll be fine. Your studies are more important.”

“Debatable,” she chuckled.

“Honestly Jess, I’m just gonna take it easy.”

I got a message from Stu asking if I was still alive. I replied Barely with a zombie emoji. He offered to stop by later if I needed sick day supplies or wanted company. I put some of the anti-fungal cream I’d bought the day before on my foot, feeling icky. Then I shuffled over to Mr. Harris’ in my dressing gown.

“You look like shit,” he said when he opened the door.

“Gee, thanks Mr. Harris!”

He turned back leaving his door open. I followed him through his flat and he sat in his armchair facing the television, which was displaying some crappy bargain hunt / car boot type show. The curtains were closed.

“I just wanted to check if you were okay,” I said.

He shrugged. “I suppose.”

“Do you feel up to talking about last night?”

“They think I’m senile,” he said.

“I wouldn’t say that…”

“They do!”

I sighed. “Look, it was dark. The detective just thinks whoever did this was wearing a costume or something. Anyone could have made the same mistake.”

He started laughing which turned into an aggressive chesty cough. I went to him but he waved me away.

“Sit down, boy,” he said once he was composed. “You don’t look like you’ve any place to be. Hell, you don’t look fit for any place. I’ll bet you look worse than me right now.”

“You rude old bastard,” I said with a laugh, sitting on a two-seat sofa that didn’t look like it got much use. Mr. Harris chuckled and muted the television.

“Let me tell you a story. I was around your age give or take, and in love. Yeah, that’s right. This rude, miserable old bastard did have a heart once upon a time. Debra was her name, sweet as sweet can be. We courted for years. Anyway, she fell pregnant. Back then it was quite the scandal to fall pregnant outside of marriage, not like these days. I knew my parents would disapprove, and her parents *definitely* would have disapproved. I was always going to marry her, but we decided on a shotgun wedding to somewhat ease the situation. It wasn’t the wedding we dreamt of but it didn’t really matter after all. We were happy.

“We spent a few days in the lakes to celebrate, just Debra and I. Stayed in a B&B outside of the Grizedale Forest. When the landlady found out we were newlyweds she kindly prepared a picnic for us, and gave us directions to a secluded romantic spot. It was a clearing in the forest by a stream. It really was beautiful, otherworldly. We laid on a blanket in the sun and I stroked her belly as we discussed names for our baby. Then we were interrupted.”

His eyes looked glassy as his face was briefly illuminated by a struck match, lighting his pipe.

“This man casually walks out of the trees. Just an ordinary looking man around 30 years old, wearing practical walking attire. ‘Good day,’ he says. We don’t think anything of it, politely indulging in light conversation. He congratulated us on our marriage. It was all fine until he started to say some inappropriate things about Debra. It made my blood boil and, sensing trouble, Debra suggested it was time for us to leave. ‘Oh, but you can’t leave,’ he says. ‘Not without a fight.’

“I was ready to explode, getting to my feet and preparing to knock him flat despite Debra’s protests. ‘Winner gets the girl,’ he says. I’m taken aback. I can’t believe what I’m hearing. Debra looks scared. I’m scared too, but I’m also angry. At that moment I wanted to do more than knock him out, and given the chance I might well have done. But something happened; I froze. Not from fear, not from any emotional response on my part. It came from him. He paralyzed me. He lifted a hand and stopped me without even touching me.”

My heart was racing as I gave Mr. Harris my full attention. He paused, looking away for a moment. I could see his hands trembling again.

“Mr. Harris, you don’t have to…”

“I couldn’t move,” he continued. “I couldn’t speak! Inside I was screaming. Inside I was raging. The man laughed. Debra didn’t know what was happening, I couldn’t physically tell her. She was confused. She kept yelling my name, yelling for me to do something. ‘Guess I win,’ he says, and he approaches Debra. She screams for me to help her. My veins feel like they’re going to burst from straining to move. He strikes her head with a fist. She falls to the ground. He picks her up and carries her back towards the trees. I can still remember the way Debra looked cradled in his arms, her blue dress flowing from her body. A sleeping angel.

“It takes all I have but I manage to say two words. It felt like I’d climbed Everest, every sap of energy taken from me. But I got two words out; ‘She’s pregnant.’ He stopped and turned, momentarily stunned. He looked down at her and then back to me. I was hopeful he’d show mercy. But he smiled. His eyes… they turned *black*. ‘Even better,’ he says. Then he disappears into the forest with Debra.

“It takes me hours, but I’m finally able to move. I spent the whole night in that forest searching and screaming for Debra. I made my way back to the B&B in the early hours, calling the police. I spent weeks helping with the investigation after initially being treated as a suspect. Eventually I had to go home. Debra’s parents were adamant I was responsible, saying they’d never trusted me. I spent every possible moment in Grizedale searching for her. Almost a year had gone by when I received the call.

“They’d found her dress and some human remains, specifically teeth and fingernails. They still had remnants of the pink nail polish she wore. As far as closure goes, that’s all I got.”

I let out the breath I realised I’d been holding in, the hairs on my arms standing up.

“I’m so sorry Mr. Harris. That’s just… I can’t even…”

“I didn’t tell you for sympathy,” he said. “I know I’m an old man and we often get discredited as eccentric or senile. I probably will be someday, but right now I am of sound mind. I know what I saw at your door last night. When I tell you I saw evil, I *mean* I saw evil. Do you understand?”

I could feel my bottom lip trembling as I nodded. When I got up to leave he grabbed my wrist.

“Be careful, boy. And look after that girl of yours too.”

Before I went back inside my flat I stared at my door. I could still see the bloody K in my head. If Mr. Harris was right, why was someone or something like that targeting me? I ate lunch, trying to restore some energy. I still felt like I’d been hit by a truck. After considering going back to bed my phone rang. It was one of the detectives.

“We ran tests,” she said. “The blood samples from the street sign and your door are a match. It’s of human origin.”

It dawned on me that I hadn’t even questioned the source of the blood. Finding out it was human made it worse.

“Oh my God,” I said. “This is a nightmare! Do you have any idea who’s responsible?”

“Not yet,” she said. “But there’s more. We ran the samples through our database. Your medical records came up.”

“I don’t understand,” I said, feeling faint.

“It’s an exact match,” she said. “It’s your [blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoBloodbath/)."
