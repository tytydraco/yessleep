As I got older, my parents told me that I was becoming a young adult and should leave Chuck E Cheese behind. They weren't wrong, the place wasn't what it used to be and a majority of the arcade games were being thinned out for machines that felt like they were games of chance. 

It was sad to see something devolve so much, but I moved on quite easily when I spotted an advertisement that read.

"Coming soon, Zag's Theater."

At first, I thought it was a movie theater chain until I googled the name and learned how people could pay for a LARPing experience. 

This was amazing to me because I never participated in such a thing and I always loved watching videos of people role playing. I was even a part of a play by post forum that has since died out.

On its website, Zag's was advertised as an event for all ages with quests that matured as the participant got older, so it wasn't like I was attending something for children.

Months passed as I awaited the grand opening in which I passed time by finishing a backlog of games until the doors swung open.

I waited for school to end while trying to contain my excitement and when that bell rang, I burst out of the class and into the streets as I made my way to the establishment. It was located in a walkable Outlet Mall where a bunch of people were waiting in line outside. 

A banner with the words "Grand Opening" along with the Zag character hung above the doors. He resembled a sprite, wore a purple tunic, had a purple pointy hat with hair sticking out, and he donned a big set of shoes. 

I later learned that Zag was actually a different type of kobold and not the short dragon kind that a lot of people were used to seeing.

After a bit of waiting, it was finally my turn as I approached the front desk. The lobby had several doors. One lead to a big hallway that took you to the waiting room and one lead to a souvenir store that sold merchandise of the various characters. 

Unfortunately, I don't own any of the merchandise which would of helped in proving the places existence, but at the time, I thought I didn't need any of it.

I paid and was handed a helmet which when worn would display my statuses in game. They were simplified to things like strength, speed, constitution, and intelligence. You could raise them upon each level up. 

Experience points weren't locked behind just slaying monsters but also for solving puzzles or helping the various "NPC's."

Wearing the helmet was also the only way to see any of the monsters as they would otherwise by invisible. The only people not invisible were the actors who dressed up as important characters such as a witch, bard, and a kings steward who returned frequently in the following quests.

There were a total of four different classes. The knight, thief, wizard, and cleric. It was all typical of the medieval fantasy setting, but I decided on the thief as I was rushed by the receptionist. As I was escorted to the waiting room, I was told a set of rules. The two I remembered the most were the following.

1. Cooperative mode was restricted to only friends due to several incidents involving strangers attacking each other over disagreements.

2. Under no circumstances was the helmet to be removed during sessions. It made sense as taking it off would kill all immersion.

3. To accommodate for everyone getting a chance, visits were limited to once a day.

Violations of these rules would lead to a week ban.

I also learned there were three different kinds of tiers. Things would start easy, but they would get harder as you advanced in the levels. This meant that the enemies would start generic such as goblins, orcs, and skeletons. There was a chance of running into something interesting like centaurs or manticores, but they were rare encounters.

I was taken to the waiting room where I waited nearly an hour before I was finally called. To be fair, it was the grand opening.

Each room I entered either had me fighting a monster in turn based tradition, solving a puzzle, or interacting with an NPC to try to gather clues. I remember my first objective was to find the nest of a magpie that had stolen an emerald ring off the fingers of a maiden.

At one point, I got so cocky and my health depleted. However, by spending a bit of money, I was able to revive myself and proceed. 

Sigh... Microtransactions at their finest.

Some rooms could be solved by making use of class abilities. One example is that I could sneak past some of the monsters or pick the lock on a door as the thief to bypass a fight or puzzle. There would be consequences for failing, but it was usually a effect that wasn't severe.

After finally locating the emerald ring that was stolen, I made my way to the next room to be rewarded with experience points and gold. I "leveled" up a couple of times and learned that the gold could be used to upgrade equipment. I decided to save it for things that I felt would be needed and was mostly stingy on the first tier.

Upon receiving my reward, everything would carry over into the following sessions (thanks to a card handed to me) and the following door would deposit participants outside the building. 

The first few months of visiting Zag's was uneventful. It was just typical quests that you would find in any role playing game, but it was all in good fun. Sometimes, a rare event would play out where you could run into Zag the Kobold. I didn't know about this until my first encounter with him.

Sometimes, you had to catch him, sometimes he would just help out. 

Either way, he would do one of four things.

He could restore the players health, give some extra gold, grant experience points, or on the rare occasion, he would give you a magical item if he felt like you were falling behind.

On the following weeks, I spoke with a couple of students about Zag's Theater. They kept talking about going back again and again, but as months passed, their opinion on the place changed.

"I don't wanna talk about Zag's anymore. Some of the characters and monsters frighten me..."

I tried to pressure for details, but the two siblings walked off and I never saw them again. To be fair, the killer clown or werewolf encounters may have been a little too much, but I also believed (at the time) that they were simply exaggerating things

I returned to the doors of Zag's Theater and learned that I had reached 2nd tier as my character. 

The quests and enemies would be trickier, but again, I was determined to see how far I would get. I also wanted to get to 3rd tier because my peers were envious of those who reached it and I wanted to be that cool guy that people talked about.

This time, I noticed that the lines had dwindled a bit which confirmed that for some people, the novelty was beginning to wear off. For me, it meant having less of a wait time. 

I was surprised by how dark some of these new objectives were. One of the quests was to use stealth to murder a child who had been infected with a dangerous incurable disease. Their parents told me that I had to do the deed as there wasn't any medicine that could help.

There was also a room where animal bones laid scattered about. The flowers beneath them were white as they drained all remaining blood from their kills. Stepping into any of them would drain your health, so I had to navigate around the killer plants. I assumed that this encounter was what unsettled the siblings in my school.

In the weeks to follow, I had decked myself out in powerful equipment which was thanks to my unwillingness to spend on the first tier. I was killing the encounters left to right and thought nothing could triumph over me until I ran into The Psychic.

The Psychic who was called just that, The Psychic, was the very first digital NPC to frighten me. They wore these dark orange robes that concealed their face. They didn't have any real gender as their only distinguishable features were their long hands and sharp nose that poked from beneath the hood.

I was asked several questions about myself from The Psychic which I answered truthfully. This was a huge mistake as upon finishing, they began talking about all of the sins and embarrassing acts that I had committed throughout my life. They weren't referring to my character, they were talking to me, the person who was playing the character.

For the first time, I started shaking as they continued to accurately list out my flaws. I fled the room while panicking and took a small break to collect my thoughts on what just happened. Afterwards, I completed the objective and quickly left that day.

I later learned from someone (willing to talk about it) that The Psychic would only do this if you answered every question truthfully. If you lied to them, they would explain that they couldn't get a good reading on you before the door to the next room opened.

I still ask myself something to this day.

"How the fuck was this NPC able to accomplish any of this?"

I took a break from the Theater for a few weeks before I kept telling myself that The Psychic's foresight must have been a coincidence.

I showed up once more, but unlike before, there were only a few people left. A total of six recurring guests. Nothing else really happened and I was able to get through the following quests that were still morbid, but they were still nothing compared to the character that I had previously encountered.  

I made it to tier 3 after a few more sessions which started at level 60 and onward. It felt like a accomplishment making it this far with all the epic equipment in my arsenal. I also had plenty of gold left over and was probably one of the strongest solo players there. However, despite feeling like I was prepared, I wasn't. It would be the last time I ever set foot inside.

On that day, I was escorted by the receptionist, ready to do my first tier 3 quest. She told me that I was one of the few to get this far and that I was about to face my hardest challenge. She also explained how I would receive a grand prize if I reached the end.

My final quest was to locate a dog that was suspected in the death of their owners. 

The dragons, chimera's, giants, and other horrors awaited me as I kept my cool. There were two rooms that stood out to me in this tier.

The first noticeable room had Zag, but he wasn't the happy or cheerful kobold from before. He saw my entry into the room and sat on this stump around the other trees. As I got closer, he left his spot and looked me into the eyes. His expression was a serious one.

"Listen. This place is dangerous. You need to leave right away."

I tried to ask what he meant by this as if this was some secret quest.

"I'm serious. They've gone too far..."

As Zag was about to finish that sentence, he suddenly disappeared without warning. It was almost as if what happened was some kind of glitch. I continued my advancement until I found the fated room that changed every feeling I had towards the theater.

In the final room before that grand prize was a field with a cottage in the back. Next to the cottage and blocking the door was a lone dog. It didn't take long to identify it as a German shepherd, but the thing that was off was that it was panting, but its tongue wasn't sticking out. That was when I remembered the objective. To find a dog.

As I stared at this thing, I noticed that littering the floors were several bones. They emitted a stench and it was the kind of smell that you would try blocking out if you were driving or walking past a dead animal on the road. As I got closer, that stench got worse.

Right around the shepherd were decaying bodies and upon getting a good enough of a distance, I noticed it was slowly feasting on these remains. This startled me enough that it finally noticed my presence. It turned its head slowly and began to depart from where it was sitting.

I kept my guard up and raised my magical short sword. It continued itsapproach and as it did, its appearance changed. Its front and hind legs began warping as its chest burst open to reveal a set of teeth. Each of its paws burst to reveal a bladed scythe at the end as its body expanded, changing it into an unrecognizable fleshy mass.

I am afraid of parasites, they have given me frequent nightmares where they always find a way into my body and infect me. This phobia is what caused me to finally take off my helmet without caring about a suspension and as I did so, the monster continued its approach.

The bones, bodies, and that aberration should have been contained inside the helmet, but that thing was still in the room. What I thought was a 3d rendered creation, began to let out a distorted cry.

I turned around and sprinted. I kept calling out for help as I turned to see the thing slowly giving chase from behind. I rushed through each of the previous rooms until I found myself at the lobby. It was completely empty. No receptionist, and no participants.

The double glass doors were locked and I could still hear the parasite gaining on me as it let out another screeching roar. 

I was thankful that thing wasn't fast and also thankful for the chairs. I took one off the floor and used it at the door repeatedly until the glass finally shattered. A alarm sounded as I bolted out of there.

For a while, I didn't even go near Zag's Theater until I eventually returned with some friends. We walked by to see that the place had closed down on the following month. 

Thinking back on it, I believe that place was involved with the missing people reports that frequently popped up around the time of Zag's grand opening.  A part of me was happy that it was over. Whatever did happen, Zag's was no more.

I could also no longer find anything about it online. Again, whatever happened, the authorities and google were keeping knowledge of the business under wraps. I only told my non LARP friends about what happened on my visit and the fact that they found it hard to believe was a hint that I should keep quiet about it and move on with my life. 

It also didn't help that the people who went there would tell me that they were no longer allowed to talk about it.

A lot of people have come forward about the supernatural at this place and have even gone into discussions about the oddities in their life, so I want to ask a single question.

Has anyone visited Zag's Theater? If so, what was it like?
