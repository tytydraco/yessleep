I don’t know how it happened or even what happened, so I’ll start from the beginning.
Just for your information, I am a 5’1 25yo single woman around 110-115 pounds who lives alone and my only workout routine consists of short walks, So i’m not exactly the type to be able to survive in the wilderness.

I was coming home from work on a Friday night, The sun just setting, and I went to bed. When I woke up, the sun hadn’t risen. I wasn’t panicked about it since I usually get up early on those days to take a 20 minute walk so I can wake up, the sun usually rising during that timeframe.

I live in Mesa, Arizona so you know, and I live in the suburbs.

I changed into some cute workout gear I bought a bit before and grabbed my water bottle before heading out for my walk. Sadly, I got caught on a branch and had to spend an extra 10 minutes freeing myself. I continued on my walk nonetheless and once back to my house, I realized something.

The sun still hadn’t risen.

I checked the time. 6:52.

It’s summer.

The sun should have risen by now.

I reluctantly ignored it, heading to the living room and I turned on the lights to help my unease before turning on one of my many comfort shows, I can’t remember which one. I closed the blinds too, my slight discomfort worsening when I looked out.

What felt like 15 minutes later, I looked outside again to see that the light which usually peeked out from the sides of the blinds was still gone.

I checked the time. 7:37. The sun should definitely have risen by now.

I quickly flipped to the news channel. A “No Signal” screen was displayed on the tv. 

I moved one of the blinds to look outside. Dead darkness.

Fun fact: moonlight is reflected sunlight. The sun is gone right now, so the moonlight isn’t exactly a light source.

I rushed to my kitchen, looking through the many junk drawers for anything I could use. A bulky black flashlight with half-empty batteries and a few extras to be sure. Good enough, I’d say?

I went back to the window and peeled back the blinds, I opened the window and switched on the flashlight to see outside. 

Something to note, when I said I live in the suburbs, I mean that I live in very rural suburbs, not Miles-Away-From-Your-Nearest-Neighbor rural, but there was a good half-mile in between each house and 50 to 55 or so miles away from the nearest city, lots of said houses were set a good 2 minute walk into the woods. My house was one of them. So when I looked out of my window with the flashlight in hand, all I saw was thin trees and dead grass as well as something small like a mouse scurrying away.

Unsettled by this, I started my first attempt at contacting other people. Texting my college friend, Alex, the only person I know who isn’t related to me. A win for loneliness.

I got my phone from my pocket and tapped on his contact, furiously typing out message after message.

Me: Alex!

Me: do you see what’s going on??

Me: what’s happening???

Me: are you okay?

Me: Alex fucking answer me!!!

I call him, it goes to voicemail. 

Me: Alex pick the fuck up!

I called him over and over and over, typing desperate messages every once in a while when finally—

RING! 

I picked up on the first ring and slammed the phone to my ear, “What the hell, man!?” I yelled into the device, anger and desperation too painfully obvious to be mistaken.

“I’m sorry, I was sleeping!” He said, “Why are you calling me this early?” His voice was scratchy from ‘morning voice’ or whatever he called it and he sounded a mix of tired and irritated. “Look outside and then look at the time.” I told him simply. There was a rustle of clothes as he got up and the shrk of blinds being pulled up. “Just looks dead black to me.” He said. “Check the time!” I repeated, he tapped his phone for a second. 

“It’s.. 7:48?” He asked— Finally! “Yeah, the sun should be up by now, right? Please tell me i’m not crazy!” I asked him, “it should be up!” He called back. I talked to him for a few more minutes about it and we agreed to meet up in another city 1200miles away to figure stuff out, before you ask, he lives around 1000 miles away from that city and it’s the closest thing to a halfway point we have right now.

I gathered as many batteries and glow sticks as i could find and grabbed two extra flashlights just in case, then I picked up as much compact food that would last a while and gathered it in a mini-cooler my dad got me a year back and finally the biggest water bottle I could find that could fit 2 and a half liters of any liquid. I filled it with water, obviously.

Before I left, I put on my biggest coat and filled a small suitcase with clothes, then I grabbed some matches, hand sanitizer, a pack of band aids, a pocket knife and a bottle of Advil all placed in a small bag.

I packed everything into my 2003 blue chevy Silverado along with a blanket just in case and headed off into the road. I’m still driving, i’ve been driving for around an hour and I think I’ll get there in two days by now, I’ll update you soon though. Wish me luck.
