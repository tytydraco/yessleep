I was on the force for twenty-nine years. Retired now. It's a small department, located in central California. It's a desert town, basically. My whole career I only had to pull my service weapon twice. I'll tell you about the third.

It was an ugly nighttime domestic. A woman called into dispatch screaming that her Ex was trying to break into her house. But she wasn't just scared, she was completely and utterly confused. She had a hard time catching her breath, but she kept repeating that her husband even being there was impossible.

We found out later her husband had died the year before. They had a funeral and everything. No casket. No body. Just a service. It seems he was Coast Guard. And he drowned in the Pacific Ocean, just outside the coast of Mexico, in some kelp bed. A weird accident. Seems their Patrol Cutter was working with an ecological crew from the university. They were following schools of some new kinda nocturnal fish. The report said some cables got sideways, and he got tangled up and went overboard. They searched for forty-eight hours but came up nothing. Anyways, I was first on scene.

When I pulled up, I saw them right away. The woman was there on the lawn, struggling, gasping, and the Ex  had her by the throat, with his mouth on hers. His head was throbbing, like he was vomiting in her mouth or something. At that second, I couldn't get a good look at him, but I announced, and he bolted. I was able to keep up, but he was damn fast, twisting like a fish through bushes and weeds. It was so damn dark, but I never let up. Chased him all the way to the river. He'd stopped on the sand and seemed to be catching his breath, cause I saw his chest heaving in some weird way. He took a big huffy gasp of air and turned round. And that's when I'd seen him.

I didn't put this in my report, but he had a face like some sorta thing. Wet. Scaly. With these fat, black eyes closer to his ears than his nose. They rolled in their sockets at me, like oil-covered eight-balls on a pool table. His teeth were long and the bottom two even came up through his cheek like nails. Like big white shank nails. His mouth did this kinda snapping thing, like a warning. Sounded like a wet rag slapped on a boulder. Whatever he was, he looked like he wanted to kill me, for sure. I pulled my revolver and took my stance, as scared as I'd ever been. Neither of us moved for a second. Then, he did like a little hiss, spun round, and dove into that big, black river. I don't think I holstered my weapon for a full minute. Then, I called it in and waited. But he never came back up.

The woman survived, but EMTs said they had to treat her like a drowning victim. Her lungs were filled with water. But not just any water. Seawater. Never understood that. The ocean's at least four hours from here, as the crow flies.

I ain't never told no one what I saw that night til now.

I later found out that river he dove into flowed all the way to the Pacific. He musta really wanted to get her.

Like I said, an ugly domestic.
