When I left my neighborhood for the first time at the unripe age of 11, I knew my nerves were getting the best of me. I also knew that the best way to feel safe was to look the drivers in the eyes when crossing the street. 

This might've caused the accident. 

Right before I crossed, I felt uneasy looking at one specific spot on the crosswalk. No cars were close, but I felt it. Only later did I learn the word for it. A premonition. Something bad was going to happen.

"You're just nervous," I told myself. No big deal.

Turns out, that's exactly where the car hit me, leading to the next 10 minutes missing from my life. 10 minutes that, I was later told, included me saying, "help me" as I laid on the asphalt. 

I guess I took too long crossing because I wanted to see all their faces, to know that they noticed me. I guess I missed a face. But how could I have known the driver had decided I took too long? How could I have known they couldn't see me behind another car and then went into the empty lane I was crossing, speeding at 35 miles an hour? 

And why didn't I feel the impact? I should've felt it. I should've walked away with more than scratches and a concussion. 

It was years later that I realized that I saw the sky tumbling about me when I rolled. I was not me. I was like a...bird? I was at peace.

Then I was back. I remember the ambulance ride, when they put a brace on my neck "to be careful."  Then I was gone again. Then I was back under flashing lights--the hospital lights in a hallway. Flash, flash, flash.They were rushing me. Then I was on a table with a bright light. Gone, back, gone, back. Pieces strung together, gaps filled by the accounts of people around me.

I think they told me what they were about to do. I don't remember. But it was like the Twilight Zone, and I couldn't see the faces of the people cutting the clothes off my body. They could have been anyone. An adult seeing my body for the first time. I was reminded of stories about aliens dissecting humans. The tingle of cold air on skin I never consented to show made it worse.

No food. Nothing. When I was present again, I cracked jokes until I was left alone. While they were laughing, I was safe. I remember the clock. It was almost 9pm. Where did the time go? Who cut off my clothes? 

Then I was in a pitch black room. Just another type of elsewhere without any clear direction, or hint of how time was passing. I guess I was not an urgent case. I became aware of an IV in my arm and a man who I believed was my dad sitting in the room. I heard breathing, sighs, and someone focused on me and me alone.

I was scared of needles, so I knew I wasn't "there" when they stuck me.

I will never know what happened in the between moments. Maybe I was not really there when I tumbled from impact. Maybe I was somewhere beyond. Maybe I said "help me" because of the scrapes on my body and the concussion I developed. 

Maybe it was something else. 

Who cut off my clothes?
