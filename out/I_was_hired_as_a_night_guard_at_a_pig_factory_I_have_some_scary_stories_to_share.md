For the past few years, I've worked as a night guard at a large pork factory in Iowa. And I can't take it anymore. I have to tell someone about the strange, and sometimes terrifying things I've witnessed when the sun goes down and all the people go home. There is something very wrong about this place, something very wrong indeed. Please be warned that there are some descriptions of animal abuse towards pigs. As can be expected at factory farms.

As you might be aware of if you've ever watched a documentary about the living conditions of animals in factory farms, the animals are all crammed together with barely room to breathe. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen a pig lose an eye because his face was squeezed against the metal bars of his cage at the wrong spot. Keeping this in mind, I thought nothing of it when I first saw a pig that looked like it was two pigs merged into one, joined together by their faces while the rest of their body was still separate. I assumed it was just two pigs squeezed together, but I kept seeing this same pig with its two faces practically glued together, and it was disturbing me, so I took a closer look one time. I tried prodding the faces to see if they would move, but they didn't. I was so disgusted that I showed the pig to my co-worker, another night guard, and he laughed and said he'd seen that happen before. "It's a double whopper," he said, and I hope he was joking. The next day, my boss asked me not to speak about what I'd seen. He also advised me not to look too closely at the pigs, or I might see things that would stain my soul.

Only, the thing is, what am I supposed to look at if not the pigs? The dark corridor behind and in front of me? Sometimes, I find myself just looking at the ground. When it rains, the worms come out like they do everywhere else, only here, they have red veins covering their bodies. I'd never seen anything like it. And when the ground is extra soggy due to the rain, my boots sink into it, and they come up reddish. What the hell? Is there some kind of mineral in the ground that turns things red? This can't be blood, right? I mean, I know this is a slaughterhouse, but still. Maybe I shouldn't be so surprised. Did you know every day, 23 million land animals are butchered on factory farms - around 266 per second?

Invariably, I turn to look back at the pigs. Most of them look normal. Yet the longer I'm here, the stranger cases can be found of off-brand pigs. Besides pigs with merged faces, I've seen a pig with an eyeball on his tongue. It doesn't look like a pig's eye, though, it was big and yellow and would be too large even on a person's face. It closed shut when the pig ate food. Another pig had fangs instead of normal pig teeth. We found out when he had murdered all the other pigs in his pen. I remember the awful squealing we'd heard in the hour leading up to our stumbling upon the bloodbath. We ignored it, because these pigs are always squealing. That day was worse, I still hear the screams in my dreams sometimes. When we found the pig, he looked up at us with a contented look in his eyes as he chewed the remnants of one of the pigs, his fangs glistening in the dark, blood covering his jaw. Finally, little piggy had space. I shot him dead.

There was another case where a mother pig gave birth to a pig with no face. The piglet wriggled on the ground for hours before dying. There are so many mutations in these pigs by now that some of my colleagues don't even get disturbed by them anymore. Not me, though. Every time I think I've seen it all, something more disturbing happens and I wonder why I work here. The others say that the reason the pigs occasionally get mutated is because of the excessive use of antibiotics in factory farming. This kind of problem doesn't happen on organic farms, it's only these factory farms that gets the twisted animals. I did some studies and found out that 84% of antibiotics administered on factory farms are not used to treat sick animals but instead are given to healthy animals to prevent disease and ensure productivity in the cramped spaces we keep them in. And you're a fool if you think this doesn't affect humans, according to a report, people who eat factory farming meat are more likely to have negative health consequences. This type of food is linked to 975,000 human deaths and 35 million human illnesses in just 2019, more deaths than are caused by cancer, AIDS, or malaria in a single year...buddy, look it up outside of this website and you'll see what I mean.

Usually, it just me and one other night guard working. Sometimes we have as many as six guards, but sometimes, it's just me. One of the times where I was alone, I heard someone groaning. Taking out my gun in case there was trouble, I approached the source of the groaning, which was coming outside, actually. Now, the place I work at is surrounded by miles of cornfield in all sides, the only times where people are just mulling about outside is during the daytime when people are working. Stepping into the cool night outside, I saw a rather obese man wearing a red baseball cap and carrying a spatula. He was smiling and rubbing his belly as he groaned. I asked him if everything was okay, and I told him he was trespassing on corporate property. He just groaned, louder than I would think any human can groan, and said, "I just wanna grill, man!" I asked him to leave, but he just repeated that same line again and again. There was something off about the way his skin seemed to glisten in the light of the nearby lampposts. I was unnerved, so I went inside the building with the pigs and called 9-11. After my phone call was over, I went outside and found the man was gone.

The police arrived shortly and were unable to locate him, but even worse, they say there were no footprints...instead, there was a singular path as if someone or something had been dragged along the grass and cornstalks, or like if a car with only one wheel drove through. The path vanished two miles away from the meat farm when it came to the highway. Strangely, the path did not continue on the other side of the highway. I asked my boss the next day if we could look into the security cameras and see if we could learn anything else about the man in the red cap. The boss flatly denied my request and told me that he'd already shared the footage with the police and that was enough.

Sometimes, I fall asleep on the job. I know, I know, I shouldn't do this. But it happens, usually not for more than half an hour in a row. It happens when I'm in my little entry office taking a break, just sitting down and maybe playing some Xbox. When I dream, often it's no different than when I dream at home. But sometimes, I have this recurring dream where I'm walking through a field of tall grass and vibrant flowers. Suburban homes can be seen on the other side of a lake, including one that I know is mine. Rummaging through the grass are pigs and chickens, and ducks, and they all look healthy. Morning dew glistens on the tips of grass blades and dragonflies skim over the lake. A church bell rings in the distance, and I see the steeple at the top of the hill. I wake up from those dreams relaxed. It's maybe the only thing that has ever happened to me while I'm here. I can't explain why I keep having this dream, maybe it's my Angel telling me to leave this place and move to somewhere wholesome?

Conversely, I also have a recurring nightmare, though this doesn't happen as much as the good dream, thank God. In this nightmare, everything is burning hot and I'm standing here, in the pig factory. I stumble to escape but the fire escapes with me and I see it spread throughout the whole Earth. Everyone and everything are dying painfully, their squeals threaten to burst my eardrums and She is dead. That's when I know all hope is lost and I wake, screaming in fear. But who is She that is dead? I wish I knew. One time I ran smack into the tv, tripping my Xbox out of fright as I woke from the dream. Hot tip, guys, don't tip your Xbox when it's scanning a disk. You'll just ruin the disk and it'll be unplayable!

I've saved the weirdest one for last.  It's something else and I didn't used to believe it existed at all, I thought the guys were pulling my leg. To try and explain the weirdness of the encounter I'm about to describe, I have to tell you a little more about the pig factory itself. This factory, like most pig factories, is long, shaped like a storage shed and will take you several minutes to walk from one to the other end. There are times, or so the urban legend goes, where on your patrol, you reach the far side of the building. Your back is turned to the pigs, you could walk out the door if there was one on the far end. Then the pigs go silent. I mean, completely silent. That's never supposed to happen in a factory farm, even at night, hundreds of them are snorting and squealing and rooting around. If this happens, the guys say you need to pretend everything is normal. Do not in any way acknowledge the weirdness of the pigs going silent. Don't look to the left or the right, just turn around and keep walking. Look forward, but do not focus on what may or may not be on the other side of the pig factory, the side with the entry door. You might think you see the silhouette of a large pig, outside, peaking its head inside. But don't train your eyes on it, if you must, blur it in your vision and look at the ceiling or the floor. Don't be afraid. Just keep walking forward. Turn around when you reach the other end and keep doing this until the pigs go back to normal.

I thought this was a joke when the guys told me this. But sure enough, the pigs went silent one day when I was all alone. I turned and saw the pig looking inside. Somehow, I could see it much clearer than I could see the pigs who were just a few feet to my left and right. It looked like it was smiling. As I got closer, its smile seemed to widen. I started freaking out and I paused when I was halfway there, pulled out my phone, and called Steve my co-worker who was in the building nearby. The WiFi went out. (Porkchops is the password, if you're curious.) I cursed and suddenly the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I put down the phone as a feeling of terror unlike anything I've ever felt went through my body. I crouched against the cages to my left and found myself praying, the pig next to me had two faces but I didn't mind, he seemed just as frightened as I was. But I didn't know what I was frightened of. The large pig was gone, vanished in the blink of an eye. But I was too scared to stand, I felt I was going to have a panic attack or faint. What was going on? Then a black shape with red eyes and four legs pranced across the building, and it was coming from behind me - not from where the pig was. It looked like some kind of wolf and its eyes were narrowed with what I can only describe as hate. Then it was gone, vanishing out the factory farm, and the strange terror left and the pigs - the latter of whom went on squealing as if nothing had happened. I told the boss about this the next day. He smiled and then told me to stop doing drugs...dude, I never do drugs.

And that's all the strangest stuff that has happened to me so far. You know something? Once there was a progressive march in our town against the factory farms, and a very cute brown-eyed activist with dyed blue hair was lecturing about how she only eats organically certified food and how factory farms shouldn't exist; to all my buddies who don't work at the farm she was a ranting loon, but as for me, I found myself privately nodding along to her words and wondering if she knew how right she was, like that meme, how if only you know how bad things really are....anyway, that's all. Does anyone here work at factory farms? Tell me if you've had similar experiences, I'm sure I can't be the only one whose seen this stuff.
