I used to know his last name.  
I know that sounds stupid, but it matters—because when four of us entered Black Hollow Forest, I could still remember it.

Hi Reddit,

I don’t know if this is something I should share, and probably no one will believe me.  
The truth is… I don’t know if I did the right thing, and that’s what haunts me. I started writing this before the details slipped away completely. Some things are already blurry, but enough to know that everything changed from that trip.

We were four: my best friend, Mathew, Hellen, and Sarah.

Mathew and I… well, we were almost like brothers. He had this stupid habit of tapping his fingers when he was thinking, like he was counting something only he could see.

I remember that clearly. At least… I think I do now.

We grew up together, fought, annoyed each other, looked out for each other. I always thought he was there for me, and I for him, no matter what.

We planned a camping trip to Black Hollow Forest. A week to get away from everything, to drink, swim, hike, and just exist without responsibilities. That afternoon, a light mist always seemed to float between the trees, as if the forest breathed on its own, indifferent to our presence.

The first evening we set up the tents near the lake. Hellen brought food and blankets; Sarah just watched quietly, keeping an eye on what we did. Mathew, as always, was excited, talking about routes, maps, trails he had explored as a kid. I went along; I trusted him.

The first days were perfect. We woke up with the sun, had breakfast by the lake, walked short trails, and drank a little beer while planning the day’s hike. Sarah kept somewhat to herself, but every now and then joined in. Hellen and I laughed at dumb things, dipped our feet in the water, told stories. Everything seemed normal.

Then Mathew showed up with a map.

It was old, folded, with trails not on any official maps. There was a red circle marked at a point none of us had seen. When he spread it over the makeshift table, Sarah leaned closer than necessary to look at it. Her fingers brushed the paper and pulled back immediately, as if it were hot.

“Just a long hike,” Mathew said, with that certainty he always carries.  
“This isn’t on the ranger maps,” I replied, looking at the trails vanishing into the forest.  
“No problem. Nothing can happen to us if we follow the route,” Hellen added, trying to reassure me.  
“I think we should stay near the lake,” I said, though I didn’t insist.

Sarah said nothing. She never asked where we were going.  
Not once.

She just stared at the map, then looked at me with an intensity I couldn’t read. For a moment, I felt like the trip had already been decided—long before any of us spoke. Mathew smiled, and, as always, got us to agree. It wasn’t a threat, not force. Just his quiet conviction. And I gave in.

We broke camp. Packed the tents, took what we needed for a couple of hours’ walk to where the map marked. The sense of adventure was strong; no one said anything, but something in the air felt different. It wasn’t exactly fear… just a weight I couldn’t name.

During the hike, we saw the first cabins. Small, dusty, windows boarded up with planks that creaked if you touched them. It felt odd at first, but Mathew said something like:

“Probably no one’s lived here in years.”

We kept walking. Hours later, we saw another cabin, identical to the first, but with a broken window and moss growing at the base. I tried to point it out, but no one responded. Mathew looked toward the horizon and said something about “forest perspective.” Hellen smiled a little, but her eyes didn’t hide the unease. Sarah… Sarah just stared at the ground, counting steps in a barely audible whisper.

The compasses began to go haywire. They spun strangely, changing direction when you least expected. Sarah kept her gaze fixed on some point in the forest, as if listening to something we couldn’t hear. Mathew frowned, trying to make sense of it:

“It must be the magnetic field.”

But his voice didn’t fully convince me. I broke out in a cold sweat. It wasn’t fear, but… something wasn’t right.

We passed more cabins. Each one seemed to repeat without logic. Trails split and crossed others we had already walked. We walked and argued in silence, each absorbed in our own thoughts. I thought about turning back, returning to the lake, but the weight of the decision was on us. We had agreed to follow Mathew, and that made us complicit in our own disorder.

Then we came across a path. Something about it made me stop. It didn’t belong to the forest, didn’t match the natural trails, it felt… different. The ground was too smooth, too firm beneath our feet. But Mathew smiled, and Sarah followed without hesitation, without even looking back. Hellen looked at me and nodded slightly. I took a deep breath and continued.

I’ll never forget how that moment felt: walking among enormous trees, sunlight barely filtering through, leaves crunching underfoot, and a silence that was no longer comfortable, but expectant. Something was about to happen. I felt it in every muscle.

But we still didn’t know what.

After that path, everything started to feel different. The forest, the trees, even the ground seemed to shift as we went. Each step took us further from any safe memory.

Soon we saw another cabin. Identical to the previous ones, as if someone had copied the exact design and placed it miles away. I pointed:

“See that?” I asked, waiting for a reply.

Mathew just frowned.  
“Nothing, just perspective,” he said, without looking back. “It’s normal.”

Hellen smiled nervously, but her eyes darted, measuring every shadow. Sarah… Sarah said nothing. She just walked, head down, fingers nervously playing with her backpack strap. For a moment, she looked up and I swear she smiled just a little, as if recognizing something we couldn’t.

The compasses kept failing. Now they weren’t turning slowly; they twisted, moved uncontrollably, pointing to impossible places.

“We’re in Black Hollow Forest, this is normal,” Mathew said.

But his voice sounded too firm, like he needed to convince himself more than us. I felt a chill down my spine. Hellen muttered something about turning back, but I didn’t want to argue. Sarah quietly pocketed her compass, not even looking at me.

As we continued, the cabins reappeared, identical. We passed massive trees, roots that twisted as if trying to trap us, trails splitting and crossing again. Logic ceased to matter. Things didn’t feel lost. They felt misplaced.

Each step felt like repeating a mistake we couldn’t fix. I wanted to stop, to turn, but no one said it aloud. We had chosen this, and every step reminded us.

After hours of walking, we found a cobbled path, perfect and ancient. It cut through the trees as if someone had built a private road to lead us somewhere. Mathew stopped in front of it, smiling as always, but this time his smile seemed fixed, tense. Sarah followed without hesitation. Hellen looked at me, and in her eyes I saw a silent, resigned nod. I took a deep breath and stepped forward.

The path led to the house. I saw it before the others and even now, recalling it, I feel breathless. It was enormous, out of time, with towers twisting like fingers and windows reflecting shadows that shouldn’t exist there. The walls, blackened and cracked, creaked even without wind, and a padlock covered the front door, rusty and fragile as if the house itself had decided to let it break. Every detail seemed to watch us, aware of our presence.

Mathew’s face lit up; this was what he had been searching for. My hands started sweating, a chill ran down my spine.  
“We’ll go in,” Mathew said, as if he’d waited his whole life for this moment.  
“I don’t know if we should,” I murmured, my voice barely a whisper.  
“It’s fine,” Hellen tried to reassure me, but her smile was weak. “We can’t let it pass. We made it this far.”

We walked to the entrance. The air changed suddenly; it wasn’t cold or warm, just… dense, as if we were breathing something that shouldn’t be there. It smelled of old wood and trapped damp. The floor creaked beneath our feet as we passed the threshold. Every sound seemed amplified, yet no one said anything.

Inside, time felt different. The air was heavier, and the wooden floor creaked with every step, as if counting our movements. Sometimes we heard sounds we couldn’t locate: a whisper, a distant thump, a door closing without wind. Mathew walked ahead, Sarah by his side, too close, and Hellen and I behind. Each step made it hard to breathe, though I couldn’t say why.

Then the basement appeared.  
The door was reinforced, as if someone had wanted no one to descend. The wood was marked, scratched from the inside. But there was the axe, leaning against the wall, shining in the little light coming through the boarded windows, as if deliberately left there.

Mathew didn’t hesitate. He grabbed the axe, broke the lock, and went down with Sarah. The sound of metal striking wood echoed too loudly, then only the echo of their steps remained.

I froze. Hellen looked at me, waiting for me to act. But I couldn’t. I felt my heart pounding, my breath shallow, and something inside me screamed to run to them, stop them, but another part knew there was no turning back.

“Should I have followed them?” I whispered to myself as the basement silence closed in on us.

The basement triggered something I still couldn’t understand. I felt the first real weight of error, a cold that got into my bones and made it hard to breathe. The air inside the house seemed to settle over me, watchful, attentive to every thought.

There was no turning back.

What happened next… I don’t know how to tell it without feeling the weight of every step. The house was no longer just a building. It was a body, an organism watching us. Every creak, every sigh of the wind felt directed at us. And there was Mathew, or what was left of him.

When Sarah came out of the basement, her eyes were wide open, too wide, unfocused. Her skin pale, almost translucent, and she carried Mathew on her shoulders with an ease that shouldn’t have been possible. He didn’t move, didn’t breathe as before. Only his eyes… always staring at the house.

“We belong to it now,” Sarah whispered, in a voice not entirely her own, to Hellen.

Hellen froze, pale. She said nothing. Couldn’t. And I, in that moment, understood what had happened: Mathew and Sarah were no longer alone. They… shouldn’t have left there, and it was claiming what was theirs.

The air thickened, heavy, cold on the skin. The house creaked slowly, like breathing, closing its invisible eyes over us. Doors closed slowly, branches creaked as if invisible hands pushed us.

We ran, carrying Mathew as best we could. Every step was a huge effort. We walked in circles, following paths that seemed to repeat, knowing they would never take us back to the lake, even as our bodies retraced them over and over.

The compasses were dead, the maps useless. I tried to call to Hellen, but my voice sounded weak, and she seemed not to hear. Sarah murmured the same phrase over and over, like a mantra:

“Return what is theirs…”

We walked like that for hours, maybe more. Until a gigantic tree appeared. I had never seen anything like it: its branches stretched beyond what the eye could reach, and a light mist swirled around it, barely perceptible.

The bark was covered in strange, intricate symbols, as if someone had carved them with patience and dark devotion. Hellen approached and could read a clear, brief text:

“Return what is theirs.”

Everything in me understood instantly. Mathew was the subject of that message. If we didn’t… we would die here, trapped forever. Hellen and Sarah even refused with their eyes. Sarah pressed her lips together, as if she had known from the start it would end like this. Only I understood what had to be done.

Understanding it didn’t make it easier.  
It just meant I couldn’t pretend there was another way.

I waited until both were asleep. I couldn’t explain how or why, but something inside me pushed me. I took Mathew, carried him as best I could, and started walking. Every step was brutal; my lungs burned, my arms trembled. For a moment I thought to wake them, ask for help, not do it alone. I didn’t. The forest seemed to twist around us, the cabins repeating, the trees moving as if alive.

And there it was again: the cobbled path. It led straight to the house. Its doors were closed now, when we had left them open. I approached, trembling, and set Mathew in front of the gate. I couldn’t go in. I shouldn’t. I let go of him and stepped back.

I cried. I felt disgusted with myself. But I couldn’t do more. He was no longer mine, and I had done what I needed to survive.

I fell asleep where I stood, exhausted, and when I woke, the sun was setting over the lake where we had camped at first. Hellen was beside me. Sarah too, but she kept murmuring the same phrase, like an echo that couldn’t be silenced.

We ran into rangers and police further down the trail. They had been searching for us for weeks; three campers had disappeared, and everyone had given up on the case except their families. We were broken, exhausted, but alive. Just… alive.

I passed out there, and woke up in a hospital. Hellen was asleep beside me. I tried to look at Sarah, but she just repeated:

“Return what is theirs…”

I can’t remember Mathew clearly. I don’t remember his hair color, not even his last name. His parents never appeared at the hospital. And something inside me… something within me, no longer lets me feel that I ever held him in my arms.

I’m writing this now, before the memory fades completely.  
And I still wonder… Reddit: would you have done the same as me?
