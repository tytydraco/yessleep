So this is something that I’ve never talked about with anyone, but none of you know me so I’ll post it here to get it out of my head. I’m from a rural, small town in Louisiana. This happened when I was eight years old, and is still somewhat happening at thirty.

I grew up along a levee, our little shotgun house directly across the street from it. Behind it were woods that never seemed to end. Oak, cypress, and thick brush that smelled like mud and old water were all that was back there. I spent most of my childhood running out there, poking at frogs, catching minnows, coming home with mosquito bites and poison ivy rashes so bad that my mama would have to slather me in calamine lotion until I looked like the pink panther. 

That summer was real hot, a lot hotter than the ones before. Even the cicadas were sluggish, and the humidity was so high it felt like a hot shower just stepping outside. I remember climbing up the levee that day and heading into the woods behind it as usual, but this time something was different. The air was still, and I smelled something…off. Sickly sweet, like something rotting but covered in sugar?

I thought maybe something had gotten a deer, so being an eight year old boy I naturally wanted to see. And when I followed the smell deeper into the trees, I saw it.

It was standing there, or at least I think it was standing. It was directly on top of a small inlet of a bayou that wound off into the woods. A shape made of tangled animal furs and the half-rotted carcasses of squirrels and rabbits, snakes twisting through like veins, even the slick hide of an alligator stretched tight across a shoulder. Its head was the skull of a coyote, but with wet, sagging meat that hadn’t fully let go of the bone. Antlers jutted out of its skull, broken dripping blood and flesh. It’s toes…or claws?…barely dipped into the water. It wasn’t standing. It was floating above the bayou. 

And it was just watching me, it’s chest rising and falling though I knew it wasn’t breathing. How could it when I could see its insides were writhing maggots and other insects?

That was when I noticed that every single noise around me had stopped. No cicadas, no rustling, no nothing. It didn’t speak, but for some reason I knew it wanted me to come to it. No, I *had* to. It leaned forward a bit, and I found my legs moving on their own, slowly stepping towards it and over sticker bushes and briars. I felt the pain, but I couldn’t stop and I couldn’t look away. 

I remember knowing that the woods were stretching and folding strange around me. My chest was tight but I couldn’t stop. My vision started to darken. My ears filled with a low hum, not sound exactly, but pressure, like when you drive up a bridge or steep hill too fast.

I was only a few steps away, my entire being both longing and dreading to be near this thing, when a gunshot split the air.

The bark of the tree next to my head exploded, showering my face with splinters. I screamed and hit the ground, immediately throwing up and watching blood drip down onto the leaves beneath me. My nose was pouring blood. The spell (? If that’s what it was) broke. I looked up and saw my neighbor’s son Ethan, a teenager at the time, standing a few yards back with his daddy’s rifle. His face wasn’t angry or scared. It was blank. Just like mine probably was.

I heard a shrill but somehow low sound, like every animal noise all at once, and the thing was gone. Just gone. The smell lingered though, so strong it made me gag. Then every single sound that I was used to in the woods came back all at once. I watched Ethan’s eyes snap back to what was going on and immediately fill with tears. He threw down the gun, rushing to me. He dropped down, holding me as we both shook and cried.

We don’t talk about it now. He’s grown with kids of his own, and I live an hour away in another parish now. I go to church on Sundays and read my bible, but sometimes I get an urge to go outside and light a candle. I don’t know why. And sometimes, when I drive past woods at night, I see it again. Not full-on, just a silhouette at the tree line standing there, probably waiting. And every time I see it I feel a familiar tug. “Just go to it”, I think. But I don’t want to know what’ll happen if I do.
