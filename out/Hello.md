Me and my parents went out on a trip to Hawaii. It was amazing. 5 star hotel and all. However, while I was there no one said the word hello. No matter how hard my parents tried to make people say it. Nothing. They would all walk away, scared, as if something would happen if you said it. Well while I was at the airport with my parents I met a girl. She was really nice and seemed like my soul mate (I usually don't believe in love on first sight but this was different). We had a connection. We were talking for a good 20-30 minutes before I realized my parents weren't sitting next to me.

 They went on the flight without me. I however didn't stress much because I felt at ease with this girl. To make this less confusing let's call her Amy. Now Amy noticed that something was not right. I told her that the people next to me that left we're my parents. She got really worried and said that I could stay at her house for a while (absolute score).

 While we were walking to her house she told me about this app "hello" it was like a Snapchat rip off. Amy told me to download it. So I did. Everything was fine until someone random added me on it (Only person I added was Amy) so this seemed strange that it didn't ask me to accept the friend request.

 Well nothing special happened for a few days. Until I got a picture of me with the caption "hello". Now this could've easily been a prank so I shrugged it off since it was a picture of me from Facebook. *ping* another picture. This time of Amy's house " hello" the caption reads again. When I report this to Amy she doesn't seem worried (which is odd but I brush it off too because I don't want to ruin my chances with Amy).*ping* it's a blank picture with the caption "hello". 

Nothing unusual until I notice that it's not a picture but a live video. This made me freak out even though it wasn't anything to worry about. Paranoid I shine a light outside and I look at my phone and I see myself holding a light. Who ever it is, they're hiding outside. Amy said to not call the police. She seemed awfully calm about the situation. I wake up. Amy's gone. The house is pitch black even though it's 7 am. All the blinds are closed. 

I see a figure standing with a phone *ping* "hello". This time the figure says it in a unearthly voice. Amy texts on the app " ignore it and it'll stop". It's breathing is sending chills down my spine. It's white ping pong ball shaped eyes stare me down as if I were a zoo animal. I run out of the house. Get a taxi to the airport and block everyone on the app and delete it. I use all the money I had to fly back home. It's been about a month. I got therapy and I'm fine but I got another notification about a minute ago titled "hello".
