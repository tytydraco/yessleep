Our son disappeared from our farm when he had just turned 20. He was a great kid, the light of our lives. One night, something, I still don’t know what, woke me up. Compelled, I found myself peering out the bedroom window, only to see the silhouette of my son walking toward the cornfield on the east side of our property. I dashed downstairs, flashlight in hand, but by the time I got outside, he was gone. He never came back, and nobody ever found him.

My wife was truly never herself again after his disappearance. Night after night, I’d find her outside, staring at the swaying stalks of corn under the moonlight, calling out in her nightgown, “Carson! Come on son! Dinner is ready!” Her voice, filled with a mix of hope and despair, tore at my heart. We both lost part of ourselves that day he disappeared. She’d spend hours in his room, setting an extra plate at dinner, unable to accept he was gone. It was tough, she never really healed.

Seven years later, our already fragile world was shattered again when she was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage four, despite never having smoked a single cigarette in her life. Our farm’s earnings were meager, barely enough to get by, let alone cover the exorbitant costs of cancer treatment. I did whatever odd jobs I could, selling produce, offering labor, trying every natural remedy we could think of. But nothing was enough.

On our last night together, as she lay in our bed and I sat by her side, we talked under the glow of the moonlight shining through our open window. We reminisced about how we met and the love we shared, managing to laugh in between her strained coughs. Then, her voice hoarse and fragile, she asked me, “Can you promise me something before I go?”

I tried to brush her off, insisting she wasn’t going anywhere, but she cut me off, “My love, we both know it’s time.” A single tear rolled down her cheek. With all the strength I could muster, I held back my own tears.

“Our son, our baby boy, please find him. He’s still out there. I can feel it. Please, John, find our boy.” That night, as we held each other tightly, the dam holding back my grief finally broke.

The next morning, she was gone. I spread her ashes around our property, a place that once held our dreams and now just echoed with our sorrows. She had spoken of our son often, which had led to many heated, tearful arguments at the dinner table. We never understood why he had left that night, why he had vanished into the cornfield.

As memories haunted me, I stared out over the fields, whipped by the wind, recalling the endless days and years of searching. Abigail had always insisted I keep looking, but eventually, even those efforts dwindled to nothing. Frustration and loss had worn us both down, but now, alone, I was a shell of a man driven by a dying wife's last wish.

Determined, I packed food and supplies, not knowing how long I would be out there. The vast ocean of corn seemed endless and unknowable, we never even knew who owned the land. The local police had been no help, they didn't care much about an adult who seemingly walked away of his own accord. That didn't sit right with me. I was set on searching as thoroughly as I could for my wife's peace and maybe, just maybe, to find what remained of our son.

With my pack slung over my shoulders, I ventured out to the wall of corn. I paused at its edge, taking in the sight and the overwhelming sense of history that hung in the air. Pushing through the dense rows, I followed an old, rough path, one I had trodden many times before, yet never fully conquered by nature. I wasn't expecting to find anything, after all, why would anything turn up now after all these years?

Checking my compass, I kept track of my direction, determined not to become another victim lost to the vast fields. Hours passed with no sign of anything until, quite unexpectedly, a path, a wide, cement path that I had never noticed before, revealed itself between the rows. I had walked past it initially, lost in thought, but something about it made me stop and turn back. The wind whistled around me as I stood, frozen, staring down the smooth, inviting yet ominous path that lay ahead.

After spending countless hours in these fields, I had never encountered anything like this. I paused, contemplating the significance of this new path that stretched ominously into the distance. It was a smooth concrete surface, incongruously cutting through the cornfield, leading to unknown realms. As I ventured down the concrete path, it felt as if I had stepped into another world. The sky above contrasted sharply with the field, a vivid blue set against the endless golden rows of corn, each stalk gently swaying in a breeze that seemed to whisper secrets of the unknown. My mind churned with memories of my son, his subtle discontent growing like weeds among our conversations about the farm's struggles. Maybe he longed for something more, a life less tethered to the soil.

As I reflected on our last conversations, his vague statements about knowing how to fix 'this,' his discontent now as looming as the surrounding cornstalks, the path abruptly cut through my thoughts. There, at the edge, a rusted truck was half-buried in the earth, its brown body weathered and forgotten, a single headlight gazing vacantly skyward like a lost eye. It felt like a relic from another time, oddly out of place, whispering secrets of roads long abandoned.

I continued, each step echoing on the concrete, pulling me deeper into the labyrinth of my thoughts and the path before me. Oddities appeared with each turn, a traffic light swung from a wire above, its colors flickering wildly in the wind as if signaling caution at the unknown. I stopped, peering up, trying to trace its origin, but the dense corn formed a green wall, obscuring my view and deepening the mystery of this path.

The oddities kept getting weirder. There was just this pale blue door, standing all by itself in the field, its frame swaying a bit in the wind with nothing holding it up. It looked like it could be a gateway to someplace else, standing there like a sentinel over a threshold I wasn't sure I wanted to cross. "What the fuck?" I blurted out, feeling more unnerved by each bizarre thing leading me deeper into this strange place.

Compelled by a mixture of fear and determination, I pressed on. The possibility that my son, Carson, had traversed this same surreal landscape fueled my steps. The path twisted unexpectedly, turning sharply and revealing more displaced fragments of reality, a streetlight in the distance, children’s bicycles half-buried in the ground, their frames twisted and tires sunk into the earth as if swallowed by the very land they were discarded on. Nearby, a lone playground slide stood, isolated, with no children to laugh down its slick surface, a silent sentinel in the chaos.

It seemed as if a tornado had wreaked havoc here, scattering objects haphazardly like a child dumping toys out of a box. Yet, there was an unsettling undertone to the chaos. Among the debris, a dog's nose protruded from the ground, its fur fluttering in the breeze, a grim and bizarre sight. This scene appeared as if some monstrous force had playfully but darkly rearranged the landscape into a nightmarish display.

The path twisted in wild, impossible ways, taking me through a landscape that seemed to ignore all the usual rules of nature. With each step, I felt like I was moving deeper into a realm disconnected from any reality I knew. The sun had turned a deep crimson, bathing everything in a sinister, blood-red glow. Under this eerie light, I came across a human foot sticking out of the ground. Its nails were overgrown, and its skin was grimy and pale, like something dragged out of a grave.

Panic clawed at my sanity as I tried to backtrack, only to find that each turn looped me back to the grisly sight of the foot. My surroundings became a maze, my mind as disoriented as the path I trod. I circled, desperation mounting until the landscape itself seemed to react to my turmoil. The ground began to tremble, first a subtle vibration then a violent shaking that knocked me to my knees.

"THIS IS ALL A DREAM! WAKE UP, WAKE UP!" I screamed, my voice lost amid the cacophony of the earth's rage. As I questioned whether my cries were aloud or trapped in the confines of my mind, a vine-like appendage shot out from the newly formed chasm. It wrapped around my leg with an unyielding grip, pulling me down into the abyss with terrifying force.

As I was dragged into darkness, the ground abruptly halted my descent. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and I landed on something wet and slimy, resembling a slick, organic carpet rather than solid earth. Disoriented, I lay there in pitch-black silence, trying to regain my senses and breathe through the pain. Then, a voice echoed around me—deep and resonant, vibrating through the ground. "The path… the path opened to you," it intoned, each word a slow, deliberate rumble that seemed to translate ancient, forgotten meanings rather than mere words.

The oppressive darkness seemed to tighten around me, the enigmatic entity’s grip on my leg growing colder and more formidable. Panic set my heartbeat racing as I managed to choke out, "What are you! What do you want from me!"

The voice that answered seemed to rise from the depths of the earth itself, deep and resonant. "I am something ancient, older than the stone and the dirt, older than the ancestors of your mothers," it declared, each word vibrating through the darkness. A shudder passed through the air at the mention of 'mothers,' a word laden with untold histories.

"The path chose you," it continued, its tone weaving through the cold air. "Your desires burn brightly; something you seek, something you long to grasp. Tell me, what is it that you crave so deeply?"

Overwhelmed yet driven by a desperate hope, I responded without hesitation, "I want my son, my baby boy!"

The entity paused, and the surrounding darkness seemed to pulse with its contemplation. Then, with a shudder that sent vibrations cascading along the walls, it spoke, "Ah, your lineage has tread this path before, seeking what lies beyond the grasp of ordinary men."

Frustrated and anxious, I demanded, "What happened to him!" The force around my legs grew stronger as the creature admonished, "You do not inquire about the fates of those who walked before, nor their desires. If you wish to reclaim what you seek, you must embrace the journey of the wicked path, never deviating, never looking back. Only then might what you desire become yours."

Caught between incredulity and a burgeoning understanding, I weighed my options. This game, if one could call it that, was madness. Yet, what choice did I have? The entity's offer was clear, yet veiled in mystery and ancient rules.

"What if I refuse? What if I reject this path?" I asked, a mix of defiance and fear coloring my tone.

It considered my question, and the air around us seemed to grow colder, "Then you shall return from whence you came, and the path will close forever. Your desires will fade into the echoes of what could have been, and you will continue your life, unchanged, unfulfilled."

I thought about it, about returning as if this was just waking up from a messed up nightmare. I pondered the possibility of the wind being my only companion, of becoming more social, maybe meeting a new woman. But the echo of my wife’s dying wish haunted me, along with the unresolved mystery of my son. Had he encountered this ancient being? Had the path also opened for him? What had he been seeking?

The thought of returning to a life of emptiness, haunted by the memory of my wife's last request and the unresolved mystery of my son, was unbearable. "I'll walk the path," I declared, resolve hardening within me. "I want my son back."

As I declared my intention, a flicker of lights punctuated the darkness. For a brief moment, the area was illuminated by the eerie glow of traffic lights and streetlights, casting a dim light across the cavernous room. The space was a macabre gallery of bizarre and incongruous items, each seemingly ensnared by an insidious network of living vines. These vines crept down from the rocky ceiling like dark, sinewy tendrils, intertwining with everything they touched.

A car, its metal body half-engulfed, was being slowly drawn into the clutches of these animate vines, which writhed and pulsed as if breathing. Nearby, a playground was twisted and distorted, its once joyful structures now grotesque parodies of their former selves, wrapped tightly in the vine's embrace. A bicycle, caught in mid-air, was locked in a silent dance with a rusted tractor, both encased in a thick lattice of vines that crawled and choked.

At the center of this chaos, a whole house groaned under the relentless grip of the entity. Its foundations were encircled and penetrated by the vines, pulling it deeper into the earth, as if it were sinking into quicksand. The structure's moans were almost audible, a lament for its inevitable consumption by the encroaching vegetation.

Beside me, a dog lay transformed, now just another element of this grotesque tapestry. Its form, half-submerged in the ground and encased in vines, seemed both pitiful and terrifying, a stark reminder of the fate awaiting all things caught in this subterranean nightmare. The vines around it pulsated slowly, rhythmically, as if savoring their conquest.

As I turned towards the source of the voice, the fleeting lights abruptly plunged me back into darkness, leaving the chilling scene etched vividly in my mind. 'The entity's voice resonated with a hint of satisfaction, "You will walk the wicked path. Do not stray, do not turn back, embrace all that you encounter."' I hesitated, then asked, 'And if I turn back, or stray from the path?' grappling with the reality of my situation.

A gust of warm air brushed against me as it replied with a chilling simplicity, "Then you shall be consumed." As those chilling words faded, a wave of darkness enveloped me, swallowing any remnants of light. My surroundings merged into nothingness, and I felt momentarily weightless as if suspended in a void.

Abruptly, the sensation ceased, I awoke suddenly, lying on the familiar yet unnervingly unchanged concrete path. The sun bathed the area in its ordinary hue, the bizarre items gone as if they were mere figments of a nightmare. Yet the path ahead was altered; it stretched forward, bordered only by endless rows of corn—behind me, nothing but stalks and silence.

As I continued on, the scene around me was eerily quiet, making every small noise echo in my mind, hinting at further challenges ahead. Then, something bizarre caught my eye—a house flipped upside down. The strangest part wasn't just its inverted position, but the massive roots sprouting out above it as if it had been yanked straight from the ground and left to hang in the air. These thick, twisted roots reached up like tentacles, giving the impression of a violent upheaval that had turned everything on its head. Seeing those roots pulsate subtly really drove home the surreal nature of this twisted reality.

More anomalies appeared as I ventured further along the path. The landscape was scattered with clocks, each seemingly torn from their usual places. These timepieces, warped and flowing like molten metal, dangled from the cornstalks, swaying gently in the breeze. Their forms were distorted, some elongated and others drooping limply over the branches, their faces contorted as if in agony or despair. The hands of each clock moved independently, each seemingly adhering to its own mysterious, disjointed timeline. This created a disconcerting symphony of ticking that echoed through the still air, suggesting a disintegration of time itself, with each clock defiantly marking time towards an unknown and possibly irrelevant moment.

Cars hung suspended in mid-air, eerily frozen in a moment of silent freefall. Positioned above the path, each vehicle was caught in an invisible stasis, as if a giant had paused time while they were tumbling through the air. This surreal scene was further amplified by the angle and positioning of the cars, with some tilted forward as if nosediving, and others skewed sideways, creating a chaotic aerial ballet. The metallic surfaces of the cars, ranging from rusty sedans to once-shiny SUVs, sporadically caught the light, casting odd, distorted reflections on the ground below. It appeared as if each car had been plucked from a moment of catastrophic destiny, only to be suspended indefinitely above the cornfield—a frozen testament to unseen turmoil.

The path eventually led me to a bridge that bore a striking resemblance to the Golden Gate, albeit elongated and foreboding with an eerie sense of abandonment. Its ironwork was cloaked in layers of rust, and the air around it felt heavier, imbued with a timeless decay. Glancing downwards, I was met with a bizarre and disconcerting sight: rows upon rows of corn lined up meticulously far below, a strangely organized chaos that stretched deep into the valley, as if nature itself had been meticulously arranged and then forgotten.

As I stepped onto the bridge, unsettling thoughts raced through my mind, convincing me it must be a nightmare. Yet, the solid rust under my hands and the creaking of my footsteps echoed a disturbing reality. With each step forward, a chilling realization dawned upon me—I wasn't getting any closer to the other end. It seemed as though the bridge was stretching itself out before me, growing longer with every moment. Behind me, progress was evident, yet ahead, the bridge seemed to extend infinitely into a fog of uncertainty.

As I trudged onward, the atmosphere grew ominously heavy. When I tilted my head upwards, what I had initially mistaken for storm clouds struck me with horrifying clarity—the sky was filled with enormous, bloodshot eyes. These colossal orbs hovered above, each grotesquely detailed with vivid veins sprawling across their pallid sclera, pulsating subtly as if imbued with malevolent life. The sheer number of them, all fixed in an unblinking, omniscient gaze, filled me with a chilling dread. Their oppressive presence weighed heavily on my spirit, transforming the bridge into a pathway monitored by these unnatural sentinels.

The overwhelming sense of being watched hastened my steps. The bridge under my feet seemed to respond, its length warping even as I moved. Time itself felt dilated, each second stretching into eternity, each echo of my footsteps a reminder of the surreal journey I was on.

Suddenly, the surrealism peaked when I collided with an unexpected barrier—it was a colossal canvas depicting the bridge’s end. Touching it, the texture was tangible, bizarrely out of place yet undeniably present. Pushing against what I assumed was a solid wall, I found a door cleverly concealed within the mural. I pressed through, and to my astonishment, I emerged onto the actual ending of the bridge.

Turning around, the painted illusion of the bridge on the canvas now reflected the path I had just traversed, with the door still ajar, merging reality with painted artifice. Looking up once more, the skies had cleared, returning to a normal shade of blue, the haunting eyes nowhere to be seen.

Stepping through the portal from the painted bridge into this new reality was disorienting. It hit me just how bizarre and unpredictable this path was—every step was another twist, blurring the lines between what's real and what's not.

In the not-too-distant view, the houses emerged, each painted in vibrant hues of pink, green, yellow, and blue, creating a spectrum of suburban calm. The further I ventured into this neighborhood, the more it seemed to deviate from the surrounding cornfields, which tapered off to reveal a standard, albeit eerily quiet, suburban scene. Having grown up on a farm, my experiences with such neatly arranged residential areas were infrequent, yet this was precisely how I imagined a perfect neighborhood would look—with uniformly parked cars and bright green lawns meticulously bordering each driveway and sidewalk.

I stayed on the path, my steps careful not to deviate. The neighborhood might've looked tranquil on the surface, but a cold sweat broke out on the back of my neck—a raw, deep-seated fear I hadn't felt since my days as a young soldier in Vietnam. The silence here was heavy unnerving, magnifying every tiny noise and making the ordinary feel threatening. There were no kids laughing, no distant barks, just an overwhelming quiet that made you listen a little harder for what might be lurking just out of sight.

As I moved deeper into the neighborhood, the houses presented a strange spectacle. They varied greatly in size—some were as small as playhouses, while others loomed large. This variation gave the streets an eerie, surreal atmosphere. Additionally, some of the houses were visibly distorted; some were tilted at odd angles, and others appeared to be upside-down, which added to the sense of disorientation. The visual warping of these homes created an atmosphere that was both surreal and unnerving.

Then, a flicker at the edge of my vision caught my attention. Down the street, a tall, white figure with elongated fingers clutched the corner of a violet-colored house. Its bulbous head briefly surfaced from the shadows, eyes barely discernible. The sight sent a jolt of fear through me, freezing me in place as the creature's eerie presence loomed. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, and my breath came in quick, erratic gasps.

I shook off the paralysis as the creature began to withdraw slowly, slinking back into the shadows of the violet house. My heart pounding, I started to run, glancing through the twisted houses as I did. The creature stealthily pursued me, its presence unmistakably predatory. As I ran, I risked a single glance back; it now perched atop the roof of a lime-green house, grotesquely enlarged. Crouched low, it watched me intently, its head and hands visible, poised like a predator ready to strike.

It then began to descend the opposite side of the roof slowly, its form blending into the neighborhood's abnormal architecture. Panic surged through me, and I quickened my pace. The path ahead was my only clear guide through the surreal suburbia. The encounter left me breathless, and my mind reeled. Was this nightmare a reality? Were these horrors truly part of our world?

As the creature disappeared from view, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The eyes on the back of my neck prickled uncomfortably as I navigated the increasingly bizarre landscape. The liminal space between the known world and this twisted reality seemed to thin, leaving me in a state of heightened alertness, ready for whatever might come next on this bizarre journey.

As I pressed on, the path beneath my feet remained the only constant in a world that seemed determined to defy understanding. The creature's elusive presence was a constant threat, its ability to appear and vanish at will kept me in a state of high alert. I could feel its eyes on me, hidden within the distorted architecture of the neighborhood, watching from shadowed windows and obscured corners.

The bizarre neighborhood seemed to stretch endlessly, its houses morphing and twisting into increasingly grotesque forms. Some structures seemed to inhale and exhale, their walls bending unnaturally as if breathing. The distorted houses added to the surreal atmosphere, their twisted shapes making every turn on the path feel like a step further into confusion.

Suddenly, the corn began to reclaim the landscape. The houses, sidewalks, and even the streets were slowly consumed by the encroaching stalks, disappearing as if swallowed by the earth itself. I glanced back and saw the creature standing boldly on a patch of lawn that had yet to be overtaken. Towering and gaunt, its scaly, pale skin contrasted starkly against the green of the grass, and its long, slender arms hung low, brushing the ground.

Paralyzed by fear, we locked in a stalemate for a heart-stopping moment. Then, with a chilling sense of inevitability, it began to move towards me, each step deliberate and menacing. The creature's pace quickened, and as it did, a primal scream, a sound both alien and terrifying, tore through the silence, spurring me into a frantic sprint.

I ran without looking back, the path ahead my only focus. Behind me, the haunting echo of that scream reverberated through the newly quiet air, pushing me forward. I dared not check if the creature was in pursuit, the fear of seeing it just behind me was too overwhelming.

After what felt like hours, the neighborhood finally began to fade, giving way once more to the endless fields of corn. The surreal structures were replaced by the familiar rows of crops, though nothing about this place felt truly safe or normal. I checked my watch, an old, reliable piece my wife had given me on our wedding day, and noticed with dismay that the hands were spinning uncontrollably. Time itself seemed to have lost all meaning here.

Exhaustion began to take its toll, and despite the sunlight still shining above, sleep beckoned irresistibly. I cobbled together a makeshift sleeping bag from my backpack, laying it on the hard concrete. As I settled down, the gentle howl of the wind through the corn provided a haunting lullaby.

My thoughts drifted back to my wife and the world I had left behind, and a deep, uneasy sleep overtook me. There, on that narrow path flanked by an ocean of corn, I escaped momentarily from the hellish reality into which I had stumbled.

I'll post the rest of the story tomorrow. I need a day's rest to gather myself before I relive the nightmares ahead.
