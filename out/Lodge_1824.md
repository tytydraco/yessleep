I was a Boy Scout when i was younger. Scout Troop 411. It was the first time our troop was going camping during the winter. I didn't quite think it counted as camping if we were staying in a large comfy cabin. I shared this aloud with the other scouts.

"It's not a cabin, Its a lodge, Carl".  
  
Said my friend from the furthest back seat of the van. There were only five of us scouts going on the trip which meant we were all able to fit in the same van on the way there. Leo was 11. He was the youngest and had the misfortune of having to take the furthest back seat, crammed in with everyone's luggage. I was in the passenger seat up front, next to my mom who was driving. I was 12. In the second row, was Ralph, Diego, and Draven. They were 12, 12, and 13. Me and Leo were arguing and they chose to just listen instead of interject.

The chaperones were all our parents. It being a 3 day trip to a snowy lodge in the woods, they didn't feel too safe letting us go without them. Us and all the other parents were in separate cars, following the scout masters truck, leading the way through the woodland gravel roads. The trip had taken several hours but we had finally arrived. In the last half hour, we had to drive through building snow on twisted and sharp curving trails. We passed by many wide oak trees, most likely hundreds of years old as their trunks were wider than any of us had ever seen. As we finally arrive at the lodge, we all get out of the car while Leo hands us our bags. I like to think we were good scouts. We always did the work we had to and rarely whined or complained about it. First we get the bags, then we get the supplies. Our parents barely had to tell us a thing. We had all been camping before and knew the process. It felt great to do something new.

When we were done unpacking and finally inside, we saw the scout master come in and shut the door behind him. He began to speak and through his words we could all hear the wind outside becoming a blizzard. 

"So Scouts!"  
The scout master shouted over the wind.

"The number of this Lodge!-"  
Leo elbowed me for being right about it being a lodge and not a cabin.  
"-Is 1824! Wanna know a fun coincidence about that?"

We all said yes in unison.

"That! Is when the Boy Scouts first originated. You all know what that means?"

We shook our heads.

"Means this here is a lucky cabin!"  
I elbowed Leo back. 

"Lodge."  
Said Leo.

"Shut up, Leo."  
Said Ralph.

As we unpacked our supplies, i thought to ask the scout master if it was really a lodge or a cabin specifically but i overheard him speaking to Ralphs father. Ralphs father asked if the scouts really originated in 1824. He said he had no idea. If he didn't actually know when the Boy Scouts first started, he probably didn't know what i wanted to ask him either. 

As we unpacked our sleeping bags and headed upstairs to our bunks, our parents worked elsewhere around the cabin. Ralph and Carl's dad had gone back outside in the blizzard to get their own bags out of their cars. Its already 7pm and dark outside and after the long drive, everyone is tired. Our scout master shouts to us from the bottom of the stairs that we will all start our activities in the morning. We mostly mumbled in response but had already started to argue with each other again. Draven had brought a deck of Uno cards and we were on opposite sides of accusing each other of cheating. The game had barely just started and Diego already had Uno. I happened to get a bunch of wilds and draw twos and Ralph accused me of cheating. I opted out of the game and went to the upstairs railing, looking down at all the adults to see what they were doing. 

Leos dad was headed outside to get wood for the fire place. Leos mom was unpacking some food to cook for us. Draven's mother and father quickly stopped Leos father to offer getting the wood themselves. The blizzard was already as cold as it could be and they said they didn't mind the snow. Leos dad agrees to let them get the fire wood but as long as he was already dressed for the storm, he said he would help Ralphs and Carl's dad unpack the cars. The blizzard must have been slowing everyone down. Diego shouted to me from the room.  
"Carl! Could you get some more snacks?"

I said i would and proceeded down the stairs towards the kitchen where most of the bags were. I grabbed a few backpacks we had personally packed and headed back up to our room. When i entered, Draven told me quietly to shut the door. I did and sat down with the bags. We had packed, sour gummies, cookies, chocolate bars, gum, chips, everything. Leo turned on an old radio in the back corner and tuned it to a rock station. Draven used this moment of peace between all of us to reveal what he had really packed in his bag. Sitting in eager silence, we all watch as Draven pulls out a ps3 and a copy of Black Ops 2. It had just come out at the time so we all could barely keep ourselves from jumping up and down with excitement. We had no Wi-Fi of course so we would all just take turns playing local lobbies against each other. He hooked it up to an old Box TV against the corner of the room and turned it on. 

Ralph jumped in to take first turn and since Draven brought it we thought it was only fair he also got first turn. a few hours of bickering over what weapons someone uses or getting excited over the campaign cutscenes passes before Diego remarks that we are out of snacks. 

"No way!" I said.

"You fat ass, you ate them all!" Ralph said to Diego. Diego wasn't exactly fat but he was the biggest of us all so he was on the receiving end of all the fat jokes. I turn back to the tv to see my character die. I shout at Draven to stop killing me because i was talking to Diego.

"Then don't look away! This is war, soldier!" He replied sarcastically, laughing.

People usually consider Draven to be to cooler chill guy but that's more so because he just argued with us the least and always had the newest games and violent adult movies. One time he brought the new Friday the 13th remake for us all to watch when we went camping by a lake. He didn't argue as much more so because he had some real anxiety issues. His parents fought quite a bit and his usual quiet demeanor made him seem more collected than any of us. 

Diego was real polite but had a minor sharing problem. He was kind of quiet too but more so because he was just naturally quiet. He got scared real easy. Its always fun to watch his reactions to the scary movies Draven brings.

I was kind of a stick in the mud. I would watch movies with everyone and stay up late too but i usually tried to stick to the rules. More so just so that we all don't get in big trouble and we can't do fun things like this again. I could occasionally be too bossy but i tried to work on that.

Ralph was a bit more challenging. He wasn't mean when it came to games but he cared way too much about winning. It was more than likely because at home he was the youngest. He felt he had to prove he could accomplish stuff and then lead to him being a bit more arrogant. 

Leo could be hard to listen to in a conversation because he so naturally tries to correct people. He apologizes afterward and usually just says he can't help it because his family is full of morons and he doesn't want to be like them. Which is completely true because anytime any of us heard his parents arguing, it was always about stupid stuff. 

Diego grumbles to himself about how the snacks weren't his fault and he heads downstairs to see if there is any more. It was just past midnight at this point. Me and Draven kept playing against each other as Ralph and Leo commented on our gameplay in the background. We all stopped and went silent however when we heard Diego's voice come loudly from downstairs.  
"Guys!"

We knew it was too late and he was too loud. Our parents would wake up and we would all be in trouble for sure. I dropped the controller and headed out of the room. looking over the railing down below at Diego.  
Soon Draven, Ralph, and Leo were beside me looking over as well. Diego was standing in the living room next to a dwindling fire in the fireplace, his back to us whilst he stared at the open front door. Snow and whistling wind blowing inside. The food Leos mom was preparing to cook for us was still on the kitchen counter. Our parents bags still on the floor or thrown in corners of the living room. Still packed. 

"Where are they?"  
Draven asked.

I started to run down the steps and out the front door, shouting.  
"Mom?? Mom!" I ran barefoot through the snow and looked all around. My friends ran to the door behind me, calling my name, their voices barely audible and the cabin barely visible. None of them stepped out from the door like i did. They stared into the harsh snow filled wind ahead of them, not even being able to see the trees. I ran back inside. I was shivering already. I sat down on the floor next to the fire, as they surround me asking questions. Diego was first.

"What did you see?"

Through shaking hands and chattering teeth, i spoke.  
"All of their c- cars are still here. Out in the c- cold."

"Where the hell is the scout master??"  
Leo shouted to no one in particular.

Draven stood quietly by the front door, looking out through its window.  
Ralph stands and speaks up, as if so easily prepared for the worst.   
"It doesn't matter where they are, man! We gotta keep warm till they get back! Diego, see how much food there is! I'm gonna make sure all the windows are locked!"

Leo shouts back "Hey! Who said you're in charge??"

Ralph replied while checking each window.  
"Dude i don't fucking care who is in charge! We still need to know how much food there is anyway!"

I move over to a chair next to the fire place and wrap myself in a blanket to warm up. Draven tosses me his jacket that he was wearing as an extra layer before continuing to stair out the front doors window. I thank him. Just then we all freeze in place as  we heard a loud cracking sound outside followed by a loud crash.   
Draven says with a slight shakiness to his voice "Was probably a tree falling. All the windows are shut." He turns to Ralph. "Right, Ralph?"

"Yeah but i haven't checked up stairs. Could you?"

"I don't wanna go by myself."

"don't be a pussy, Draven."

"Fuck you, just come with me or let someone else."

"Fineeee."  
Ralph goes with Draven upstairs as they check the windows in each room. 

I stand up and put Draven's jacket on instead of just using it like a blanket. I shout to the kitchen.  
"Diego??"

"Yeah?"

"We got food?"

"A lot of frozen stuff but yeah. Enough for us and the parents when they come back."

And then, a horrible scream. Leo jumps up from sitting beside the fireplace and sprints up the stairs to see what it was. Diego and i followed soon after. Draven was sitting outside the shut bathroom door, holding his legs to his chest. "No don't go inside!"

"What is it??" Leo asks.

"Horrible face! This horrible face staring at me from the bathroom window! White with distant eyes and wrinkled lips past its fucked up square teeth! It was like 5 feet away from the window just looking at me!"

"We're on the second floor, Draven."

"You don't think i fucking know that?!"

Diego sits beside Draven to calm him down. "It's okay dude it's okay! I believe you! We're all good."  
None of us were used to seeing Draven be so emotional about anything. It really set us all on edge.

"Nah, fuck this shit." Said Ralph. "There's no windows in our room. We would only have to barricade the door. Lets just take whatever we need back to our room and stay there!"

I spoke up for a moment.  
"Is there a phone in any of the adults bags? Or one in the building?"  
Everyone looked at me silently for a moment before Leo and Ralph quickly descended the steps and started grabbing all of the adult bags. Diego went down the stairs too to grab any food we would need for the night. All we had that wasn't frozen was water, graham crackers, and peanut butter. I stayed beside Draven and not before long, they were back up the steps and motioning for us to get into the room.   
After everyone was inside, Ralph put a chair up under the doorknob like in the movies. Everyone began rifling through the adults bags to find a phone. After about 2 hours, we had found nothing. Ralph said that if we all go to sleep at some point, someone should stand watch. But none of us could sleep anyway. Especially not Draven.

Suddenly outside was a loud blaring sound. Everyone stood. Leo moved the chair and opened the door to head into the bathroom. Everyone followed him to see him standing by the bathroom window, staring out at where the sound was coming from. It was a car horn. In the still pitch black of the night outside, light pierced through the blizzarding winds. one of our parents cars had its high beams on and someone was laying on the horn. Leo opened the bathroom window and we all leaned forward shouting at the car that we were here.

Leo turns away and puts on his jacket. He runs down the stairs and we all follow behind, almost knocking each other over on the way down. He throws his boots on and tells Ralph to follow behind. Ralph agrees and looks for his boots. We all watch from the front door as Leo runs into the blizzard towards the faint car lights. As soon as he is out of view, the horn stops and the lights turn off. Aside from the wind there is only silence. Ralph finally throws on his boots and stands to leave but I and Diego hold our hands out in front of him to stop.  
  
"Leo??" Draven shouts into the night.

Ralph pushes past us to go after him but stops when we all start to hear something else. Screaming. Screams of absolute horror and panic even overpowering the sounds of the wind. Amongst the darkness, we see Leo running back towards the cabin. But his frame is smaller. He doesn't have his coat. We all start shouting for him to hurry as he jumps with every step over the piling snow. Leos strained screams fill the air as he shouts to us. "Monster. Big Monster. Big." As he pushes forward we see it. Behind him a towering shape emerges. Taller than out parents. With its large frame and a head that comes to a point. Its grows closer behind Leo. lumbering closer towards us all. We all fall silent for only a second before our fight or flight kicks in and we scream for Leo to hurry. The shape moves close to the ground, growing ever nearer to Leo before he throws himself into us. We fall back and Draven quickly stands to shut the door and lock it. He looked out into the night. Nothing was there. 

All of our voices overlap each other as we scream for answers from one another. Leos voice is still heard the most. He stands to his feet by the door shouting.   
"It's a fucking a gorilla-horse-dog thing with a flat face and human teeth! It was waiting! It was by the car waiting! Giant hands! God, massive giant fucking hands!" Leo throws his arm up in the air to exemplify its massive size. Just as his arms are raised, a large white arm smashes through the window beside the door and grabs Leo by his leg. It pulls him to the floor and drags him towards the small shattered window frame. We all freeze in horror for only a second before jumping to grab him by his arms. Leo screams in terror as the thing outside howls and wails like a wounded elk. We all pull at Leos arms as we all shout and Leo begs that we not let go. Both hands take Leos leg as the things shadow moves past the door, blocking out any light there was before. The hands pull even harder and Leo screams as his leg is bent and pulled, making a cracking sounds like a large stick. We continue to slip and lose ground, eventually only holding onto Leos sleeves as he pleads for us to not let him go. Leos pajama sleeves tear apart as the thing pulls him through the thing jagged window frame. We all fall back, pulling the torn sleeves with all our combined strength. We stand back up in only a seconds time. But we all see through the front door window only faint glimpses of Leos silhouette as he is dragged back into the hidden trees. Soon all we hear is his desperate shrill screaming. And what follows is only the sound of wind. The blizzard that hides the thing. 

We stood in silent horror for almost a full minute before we all ran off in different directions, looking for something, anything. Weapons to use or make. Things to barricade the doors with. A walkie talkie or something we possibly could have looked over. I and Draven were upstairs looking through the adults bags before we came back downstairs to find Ralph in the kitchen. Ralph was checking the kitchen drawers, pulling out knives and utensils. Tools from the closet. Diego was too scared to do anything. He was in the basement, hiding in the rec room under a table. We destroyed tables and chairs, finding a box of nails and barricading the door and windows. I'm sure we all knew it wouldn't do anything against the monster but we didn't know what else could be done. We kept fortifying the place until we heard a sound from upstairs.

I turn to Draven, coughing and choking the words out. I was getting sick.  
"The bathroom window. We opened it to see the car. Our food and clothes."

"Fuck no!" Ralph pipes up. "We have frozen food just leave it."

Draven cuts back in. "The windows are broken, Ralph. We all just have shorts and pajamas on. We will freeze before anyone even finds us!"

Diego speaks from the open basement door.  
"I don't wanna even be up here! The basement only has one door and it's closed off. We should wait down there." Ralph nods and agrees with Diego.

Draven silently disagrees and says that i am getting sick.  
"We need the blankets and medicine. The medicine our parents packed is in their bags upstairs."

I could tell Ralph and Diego didn't want to abandon us but they saw it as a choice of survival. A choice I and Draven were refusing to make. We watched them descend into the basement and shut the door behind them. I and Draven walked back up the stairs. We approach the bedroom door with a knife and a hammer in hand. Draven counts to three quietly and we both open the door quickly but quietly. There's nothing inside the room. I turned on the bedroom light and as soon as it was on, it just as suddenly was off. The power went out. I claim that i don't think the thing would know how to turn the power off and that it was probably just the storm. Draven agrees and pulls out a flashlight from one of the bags. It's not a very good flashlight. Just then we heard a knocking on the door. It was Ralph.

"Carl? Draven?"

"Yeah, Ralph?"

"Powers out."

"No shit."

"Could i get one of the adults flashlights? Diego is down in the basemen looking for the-"  
Ralph was cut off by the sound of glass shattering and Diego screaming. It was a scream of agony and pain. Like after falling and breaking an arm or leg. Again the cabin falls silent. Ralph, Draven, and I run down the stairs to block off the basement door. We know Diego is gone. Its only a matter of time before the thing in the basement ascends the stairs and finds the rest of us. I and Ralph reach the door at the same time, both of us ready to slam it shut before we hear a sound and again freeze in place. We hear a voice. Diego's voice. Shaky and emotionless before it grows too deep to be his own. In the ever so dim light of the moon coming into the cabin, we both barely see the monster. It's primate like features and its pointed cone head. It speaks in his voice. It says

"Help me, Ralphie. She's eating me. She's eating me, Ralphie. Help meee."

We stand in fear before Draven comes from behind us and slams the door shut. He slides the couch in front of the door and hands me the cough syrup he found.  
"We have to ignore it and stick together. It's waiting for us to be alone."

I tiredly open the cough syrup and drink from the bottle. I felt grown doing that. Like it's something only adults would do. Ralph walked up to me, the floor boards creaking beneath his feet.  
  
"Hey. How does it ta-"

Ralph is cut off as the hand of the beast tears through the floorboards beneath us and grabs him by his shirt. In the blink of an eye, Ralph is pulled through the ground, his body contorting to forcefully fit the shape of the monsters fist sized hole in the floor. Draven must have been running off pure instinctual adrenaline as he picked me up and ran up the stairs. We were back inside our room where the night had began. He commanded me to help him push one of the bunks against the door and i did. We both pushed. Until every piece of furniture was blocking our only way out. We sat there in silence, not sleeping, not moving. We didn't know what time it was. It could have been 10 hours, it could have been 3 days. We were dehydrated and too scared to rest. The radio kept going in the background which had been turned on by Leo which felt like an eternity ago. At some point we must have fallen asleep, as we both woke up to the sound of the door banging. Banging and smashing. The thing was fighting its way in. All we did was silently hold onto one another, knives clutched in our hands before the door slightly gave way.  
"Anyone in there??"

The voice of an older man came through the crack in the door.

"This is the sheriff! Is anyone in there hurt??"

With that statement, a hand holding a flashlight came through the crack in the door. It really was another person. We jumped to our feet shouting that we were here. We helped push the bunks out of the way. The sheriff lead us outside where more police were. It had been 2 days. The bodies of our parents and our friends had been found in the woods nearby on a biking trail. Mutilated beyond recognition. They limbs were pulled apart, their stomachs open, and their skulls smash. Only their teeth were used to identify them. Much of their bodies were missing. Soon after me and Draven were put through foster homes. We for some reason didn't keep in touch. I am 25 now. I was adopted by a real nice family that lived in the city. Far from any mountains or forests. I don't know where Draven is. We never gave any great parting words or anything. We just simply went separate ways. I still hear it in my fading dreams or when the wind blows in the winter. I still hear Leos screaming. The wailing of the monster. I can feel the cold wind blowing through the broken windows. I still feel like I am still there. In Lodge 1824.
