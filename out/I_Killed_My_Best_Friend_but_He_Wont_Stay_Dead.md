To preface: it was self-defense.

I don't know how to get into this without incriminating myself more than I already have. I probably shouldn't even write this, but I can't talk to anyone about it. I can’t even be sure what my reality has devolved into, whether I’m experiencing some extreme case of psychosis or if this is actually real.

A couple months or so ago, my best friend John called me up to tell me he had something exciting to show me. He was so giddy and secretive that it enticed me, and no matter how much I pressed, he wouldn't tell me over the phone. I'd have to come over to see it. I can't recall what I had been expecting, but I can confidently say there was no genuine excitement in me, and if there had been, I would’ve been surprised. John may have sounded enthusiastic, but knowing him that didn’t bode well.

I’ve known John all my life and over the years I’ve gotten to know his quirks that he wouldn’t show anyone else. To paint a picture, one of my earliest childhood memories is sitting on the searing pavement on a hot summer day in June, and watching John torment a swarm of ants with a magnifying glass. We must’ve been six years old, and he refused to share the magnifying glass with me. I suppose marveling at seeing physics in action for the first time was normal for most children, but most probably grew out of it. He continued the torture of other animals. Squirrels, snakes - never dogs, as he personally liked them - but especially cats. I always told him how gross it was, but it didn’t stop him from showing me. He grew up to be a bully all throughout middle school, but somehow managed to cement his spot with the cool kids, if not as the quintessential cool kid. He was mean, but he was a sweet-talker, and above all he was a pretty boy that grew into a handsome man. The novelty of being with him outweighed the hell he could put you through. I was there when he slipped a firecracker into a girl’s shoe during gym class when she rejected him. I watched it happen over and over during highschool with various one-offs, close friends, girlfriends, but never with me. I admired his popularity, and he knew how to pick me up whenever I fell into self-doubt. He continued to be violent into his adult years. He slept around with no regard for the next day. I had to mediate a myriad of drunken fights, of which only a handful didn’t end with the other brutalized, but somehow John always managed to talk himself out of the consequences. He had friends everywhere and his friends had friends where he hadn’t slipped in yet.

When I arrived, John was already waiting at the door to let me in. I didn’t even have to knock. Before I could get a single word out he pulled me inside, pushing me forward without letting me take off my jacket. He ignored my protests and I was forced to let him lead me down the hallway. I finally wrenched myself out of his grip when we got to the door to his basement. The ‘surprise’ was down there, as he let me know, and I knew my suspicions were correct, just not to what degree. He had to nudge me again as I hesitated. It’d be better to just get over with the headache, so I begrudgingly made my way downstairs. From halfway down, I could already see a lump laying in the darkness. I braced myself for everything I could imagine that lump could be, or at least tried to. When I arrived downstairs and John turned on the naked lightbulb, I recognized the lump as a person.

I first assumed that she was dead. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But John wouldn’t be this excited about a dead girl. If anything, he regarded those as little more than a nuisance to clean up. Just as I thought that, the body moved slightly. She was chained to the wall by her wrist, her ankle covered in a sloppy red bandage that barely concealed the mauled pink flesh beneath.

“Whadda ya think?” He grinned at me like a cat that just brought its human a gift in the form of a dead mouse.

“Why would you show me that…?” I was used to scolding him for getting into fights. I was even used to scolding him for the bodies in his basement. I was entirely lost on how to start on kidnapping. John had the audacity to look disappointed. He rolled his eyes at my sporadic breathing, but he seemed to lose the hostility when I leaned against the wall in an attempt to hold myself upright. I heard him saunter over to me. Then, I felt his hand on my back. “How…?” I began to stammer, using one hand to gesture for him to go on.

“Oh, you know,” he started as if recounting a boring first date. “She was hitchhiking or something. I saw her on my way home and *she* waved *me* down,” he emphasized. “She got in without question, can you believe that? How stupid-”

“Did anyone see you?” I interrupted him. I had already broken out in an uncomfortable sweat and my head spun at the thought of witnesses. John rolled his eyes with an annoyed groan.

“No, nobody saw me. You can relax.”

“I *can’t*, John.”

“Okay, okay, look - there’s no way in hell anyone saw me, and I doubt anyone’s missing her either. Why else would she hitch a ride outta town, hm?” 

I realized he wanted an actual answer and eventually gave him an irritated shrug.

“Yeah, exactly.” He gave my shoulder a rougher pat. “So stop whining.”

“But why did you…” I glanced in the direction of the girl. “Why would you kidnap her?”

“Why not?”

I stared incredulously at John, unable to find a response. He was as ignorant as always, if not moreso. My expression must’ve amused him as he grinned at me. I leaned back slightly as he leaned closer.

“You won't tell anyone.” It wasn't a question. He was stating a fact. “Right?” John nudged me, prodding for a reply.

I bit my lip. “I won't.”

“Attaboy!”

The girl’s name was Dahlia as I learned from the news a day later. In a sick form of self-torture, I watched her parents’ pleas on TV, and as the week went on, I couldn’t escape eavesdropping on people discussing the case. Going to the place that usually managed to brighten my mood - provided that John behaved himself - now made me feel even worse. At some point towards the beginning of it all, I had convinced myself that this was a one-off thing, that Dahlia would last a couple days before John got bored and disposed of her like he did with everyone. A couple days turned into weeks and then into months, and every time I came over, Dahlia was there, alive as ever. John kept her in the basement and I obliged to patch up her leg. It wasn’t perfect, but it was better than what John had tried. She groaned in her half-lucid state when I prodded her flesh with gloved fingers. I had to take a moment to stifle my nausea, but ended up stitching her wound.

I kept a distance when he let her upstairs. Without her chains, she sat politely with John, but often kept her gaze on me in a way that made my skin crawl. He was being reckless, giving her so much freedom. His willingness to let her participate in his routine confused me. I couldn't quite understand what his end goal was, if he simply caught himself a little trophy wife, a show-off piece to stroke his own ego, or if this was something else. I knew that he liked her for her body, as he didn't hesitate to tell me about it, even when I'd already voiced my disinterest.

“You don’t mind staying while I run some errands?” John asked suddenly on a Saturday when I came over.

“I’m not gonna-”

“Am I asking for too much? Come on, I’ll only be out an hour or two.”

“John,” I whispered through gritted teeth. “I don’t want to be alone with her.”

“Scared she’ll bite?” I glared at him until he put a hand on my shoulder and rubbed it. “Just this once, okay?”

I knew he wouldn’t let up until I agreed, so I nodded. When John left, I was alone with Dahlia’s uncomfortable stare that I could feel at the back of my neck. She was sitting on the couch, legs pulled to her chest to the best of her abilities. She was wearing one of John’s shirts, and nothing more.

“Hi, Tommy,” she said, smiling at me. I regarded her with a nod, a bit put off by her greeting. I noticed that it was the first time we’d verbally acknowledged each other, without John as the middleman. I couldn't relax in her presence, knowing that I'd be thrust into a dilemma any minute. Outside, we heard John's car drive off. When the motor was barely audible in the distance, Dahlia suddenly lunged for my arm. “Tommy, please-” 

I jumped at the sudden movement, weakly tugging my arm back in an attempt to pull away. “I…-”

“You gotta get me out of here, please- *please*, I swear I won't tell the cops about you, you just-”

“Dahlia, stop.” I managed to pull back, running a hand through my hair. “He'll kill me if he-”

“Then leave an anonymous tip!”

“You think he won't know it was me?!” I let out an exasperated sigh when her lip quivered. Dahlia looked down, but I could hear try to stifle a sob. I wanted to ignore it, but I caved eventually. Leaning down to her, I stammered out my words. “I’m sorry, I know I’m the worst… I would help if I could, I just…”

“It’s fine.”

“It’s fine?”

“Yeah,” she cleared her throat, still sniffling but wiping her tears before more could come. She sat back with enough space next to her for me and didn’t flinch when I took a seat. “It’s fine, I get it… I dunno what I’d do in your place.”

I hesitantly put a hand on her back and she leaned into the touch. She didn't look at me for once and it felt wrong.

“Is there… something else I can do for you?”

“Could you get me a book next time you're here?” It made sense. John had a wide collection of movies, but his bookshelf was sparse. “Any book.”

“Yeah, sure.”

I did as she asked me. I strolled through my local bookstore the next day, looking for something she might like. She hadn't told me as much as a genre, and I felt an odd amount of pressure. The clerk, an uninterested teen boy, offered a brief ‘*can I help you, sir?*’, but I declined. I spent an hour in the young adult section until I picked a book that didn't seem as dull as the others. Next time I was over, when Dahlia was sitting by the breakfast table, I placed the book next to her, earning myself a surprised and confused glance from John.

“She asked me for a book.” I mumbled when he questioned me about it later over a cigarette outside. He chuckled, giving me a grin.

“Ain’t that cute.”

“Oh, shut up.”

“Told ya you'd warm up to her.”

I shoved him.

When Dahlia and I were alone again, she seemed less shy. She sat with her legs draped over mine as she told me about the book, having finished it in a day. Her wound was already healing.

“You liked it?”

“I did.” She smiled at me and scooted closer. “Thank you, Tommy.” She said, and in an act that made her take a hesitant breath before she did it, she placed a soft kiss on my cheek.

“Dahlia…” I muttered in a reprimanding tone, or what I thought was one, but I couldn't hide the effect it had on me. I cleared my throat and added a quick “Don't mention it.”

I bought her another book upon her request, and she took her time with this one. When John left us alone again, she sat close to me as she continued reading it. Her back against my thigh and her head in my lap while I idly stroked her auburn hair. Sometimes, she let her gaze wander from the words towards my face. I felt as though I was a lifeline in her current existence. She seemed less nervous when it was just us two. She confirmed my suspicions whenever she cowered by my side, and though she didn’t say it, I could tell she took refuge in my company after John’s actions. 

“You’re so much kinder than John.” She said to me one day as we laid in John’s bed, with her enveloped in my arms.

In some way I knew that. It wasn’t hard to be kinder than John. And still, coming from her, it was a genuine compliment. I admit that, when Dahlia and I got closer to the point where I reciprocated her kisses, I got stupidly careless. I would openly smile at her when John was around, and a few small caresses in passing turned out to be too noticeable. John sensed even the smallest advances from my side like a dog. He shoved me against my truck once when we both left the house and held me in place with a stern hand on my shoulder. At this point, he had eased up on the idea of leaving Dahlia alone at home, provided all doors were locked and any phones were out of reach. 

“The fuck do you think you’re doing?”

“What do you-?”

“I see the way you’re staring at her.”

I tried to look away, but he kept me cornered. “I wasn't-... Am I not allowed to look at her?”

“Not like *that*. I let you watch her while I’m out and you take it as an invitation to make a move on her?” 

“What? N-no, I swear, I wasn’t-”

“You’re not subtle, Tommy.”

I swallowed, trying to shrug off his hand, but he held still. His voice was calm, but it held a serious note that I knew all too well from his usual bar fights. 

“I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.”

Satisfied with my resignation, John gave me a grin with squinting eyes and a rough pat on the shoulder before getting in the car. I followed, trying to ignore the pain shooting up my back.

I was more careful after this altercation. When John was around I only talked to Dahlia when it was necessary. I felt I wouldn't get away with just a bruise if he noticed anything again. When he was away and left me with her - which took another week before he trusted me again - though, we made up for the lost time. Dahlia wrapped her arms around my neck, whispering how much she'd missed me. She kept it a secret from John without me needing to tell her to. Another week later, when we were alone again, she pulled me towards her urgently.

“I want to leave with you.”

“You know I can't let you go-”

“No, Tommy. I want to leave *with you*. We can find a place together, no?”

I looked at her, stunned for a moment. “...you… are you sure?”

She pressed a kiss to my neck, soft and hesitant. “Yes. Please, Tommy. You're a good person, I know it,” I wanted to object. “The situation is just…”

She didn’t continue, letting me fill in the blanks for myself, and it did the job to convince me.

This all led me to the decision to kill John, because what else could I possibly do?

It was easier than anticipated. A bullet to the back of his head did the job just fine. I had hesitated at first, and in retrospect I would’ve loved to have one last chat with him, but I knew I’d get sentimental. I stored his body in my car while I cleaned the blood off his mahogany floor. Dahlia was somewhere in the house. My plan was to clean up, bury John, and get her out of town. I’d find a motel before we could settle somewhere else, maybe in the place Dahlia was originally heading to.

I drove my car through the depths of the woods where we’d often frequented. I drove over the uneven ground, leaning on the steering wheel as the branches caressed the hood of the car, until I couldn’t drive further. I continued on foot, dragging John’s heavy body along and stopping ever so often to stretch my arms. Eventually, I got to a small clearing behind some thicket. The ground was hard from the cold, but I managed to dig a grave, not terribly deep, but not shallow enough to raise immediate suspicion, *if* anyone even managed to stumble upon it. With a nudge, John’s body was inside, limp and mangled with his face looking up, and a couple minutes later he was covered. I sprinkled some leaves and branches over the disturbed ground and covered my footprints on the way back. The further I drove away, the more I relaxed into the seat. I felt like I was leaving behind a burden that had clung to me for the past thirty years. I couldn’t help but feel conflicted, wondering if I was supposed to grieve him, but I couldn’t will myself to. I hummed along to the quiet sound of the radio and got out of the car without the usual anxiety when I approached John’s home. It was dusk already. Now to get Dahlia. I hastened up the steps to the house and unlocked the door with a smile on my face. My momentum was thwarted when, upon entering, I saw John sitting on the sofa in the living room, watching TV. 

John craned his neck and gave me a lazy wave. “What’s up?” I stood dumbfounded, just staring at him. “Close the door, dude, you’re letting the bugs in.”

I did as he told me, not taking my eyes off him. 

“John?”

“Yeah?” he furrowed his brows with a confused smile. “Who’d you expect?”

I shook my head, waving my hand dismissively. *Forget it*. I finally managed to walk over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. I felt fabric, flesh and bone under my grip. “...how’re you feeling?”

“Good? What’s up with you?” he patted my hand before pushing it off. I stayed where I was and watched him until he got fed up and pulled me to sit on the couch.

“Nothing, nothing, I just… I don’t know. I’m tired.”

At that point I figured the burial had happened in my mind. No matter how real it had felt, John was here and just as real. Maybe it had been a daydream that I’d gotten lost in, some wish fulfillment slipping out of my control. The idea was upsetting, that I could imagine something so clearly and not realize it was in my head, but I would’ve welcomed it over what it turned out to be. As I was sitting with John, the movie lost my attention in favor of a dark speck towards the bottom of the screen. I’d assumed it was a cluster of dead pixels, or something along those lines. When John got up to grab a beer, I scooted closer and ran a finger over it. It came off, just some stain on the screen. Despite the darkness, I recognized it as half-dried blood, sticky between my index and thumb.

“I gotta go.” I announced as John came back, hastily putting on my jacket and wiping my fingers on the inside.

“Not gonna stay over?”

“No, I-... I have something important to do, just remembered it.” 

I ran to my car, sped off towards the part of the woods I’d come from. I stopped the car far before I’d stopped it last time and got out, running down the path until the concealed clearing. The leaves were still where I’d left them, moved slightly by the wind, but untouched for the most part until I pushed them aside. I dug at the still-loose ground with my bare hands until I unearthed a bit of blond hair discolored by the dirt. I uncovered his forehead and his eyes. John was there. Staring up, unblinking, with his milky gaze meeting mine. 

“...John?” I asked despite myself. No answer, obviously.

I tasted bile in my throat, sitting back on the moist grass. I don’t know how long I sat there for, but two cigarettes later I eventually pushed the dirt back with shaky hands. A few drops of rain had washed some of the dirt from his eyes before I undid its efforts. In every other situation I would’ve told John. He was no stranger to my anxiety attacks. But how was I supposed to tell John about his body buried three feet under while he was very alive at home? Aside from the ridiculous situation, I don’t think he’d be too happy to hear that I’d killed him.

I made my way back to my car and drove off. My mind was only half on the road, half trying to make sense of what was happening. Was I going crazy? The radio had lost its signal and filled the car with an eerie static that I didn’t bother turning off. Instinctively, I drove back to John’s house. In the darkness, I made my way up the stairs to the front door for the second time. This time, I pressed my ear against it. I heard the muffled sounds of the TV and saw tiny rays of light escape outside under the closed curtains. I entered, and John was on the couch. Dahlia had joined him, whether out of her own volition or not, I had no idea. 

“Back already?”

“Yeah, uhm…” I tried to recall the lie I had told when leaving. “The thing solved itself. It wasn’t that important afterall.” I plopped down in the armchair next to them, having hung up my jacket. I grabbed a lukewarm beer from the table and took a long swig, swallowing quicker than usual. John had his arm around Dahlia, grasping her thigh until her flesh turned white. John, who was buried in the woods half-an-hour from his home. John, who was supposed to be dead - and who *was* dead, but not really.

As I sat in the armchair, and as Dahlia begrudgingly cuddled against him, she gave me an almost longing look that made me wonder if she noticed the dead man walking, or at least had heard the gunshot.
