The following was recorded on an undisclosed mountain range in Ireland by a group of 3 hunters out for a seasonal hunt. The device was recovered from a cabin in an undisclosed location, 40 hours after the missing persons report was filed. \[all significant sounds that are not voices are in square brackets\]

What could that be ? huh? That by the window ? Surely not ? Indeed it is . No chance to run this time . No , none . Well ? Well what? Any ideas ? No . Me neither . Hmmm . . . Well , the backdoor is unlocked . Then why doesn ‘ t it come in ? Did you salt it ? No. Then why ? Indeed . Wait. What is it? Outside , it ‘ s not alone . What do you mean ?

Marcus . . . It ‘ s eating ya ! oh that ‘ s sickening , ok , eat this gerald . no - no ! aahgh , son of a - agh - !

At this point in the recording the only sound that can be heard is one of wet crunching and dimming cries. After two minutes and forty three seconds, well after the cries had ceased, the following voice was transcribed.

*St - Sti - ll H - h - UnGRY . hehehe , so tasty , n - n - need a fire . yes , fire will do . ooh - ooh hehe . you make fine m - meal . beathaich mi làn , agus dean làidir mi . thoir don mhaighstir neart a ’ mharbhaidh agus a ’ chreach . Gairm , dùisg , teine , thoir biadh math agus creach. Cha bhi am bàs ' na chrioch ormsa , no mo mhaighstir . ath-lìonadh , ath - lìonadh , biadh , biadhadh . tha mo ghàire a ' gabhail mac-talla, tha mo ghàire a ' biathadh, tha mo ghàire a ' faicinn. beathaich mi, agus làidir .*

The apparent “chanting” is translated from Gaelic.

feed me full, and make me strong. give the master the strength of killing and plundering. call, wake, fire, feed well and raid. Death will not be the end of me, nor my master. replenish, replenish, feed, feed. my smile(laughter) echoes, my smile(laughter) feeds, my smile(laughter) sees. feed me, and strong.

The hunters bodies were never found, although the hunter killian’s rifle was found 300 meters away from the cabin. As of this report Killian, Gerald, and Marcus are still missing and are assumed to be dead.

Officers Bobby Gilmore and Dominik O'Fahy investigated the scene. The only evidence found was copious amounts of salt and several shotguns, as well at the recording device. Due to heavy weather conditions the officers were forced to stay at the cabin for the night. Both officers reported hearing noises not of animal origin as well as insistent high pitched, garbled laughing or chuckling. Officer Gilmore reported spotting a person in the trees, at approximately 3:30-4 am. Both officers safely returned, although Gilmore is showing signs of mental stress. Gilmore is scheduled to meet with police force therapist Reuben MacGenis.
