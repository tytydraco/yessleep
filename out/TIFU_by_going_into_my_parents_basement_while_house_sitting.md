Today, I fucked up while house-sitting for my parents.  

A few weeks ago, my parents asked me for a favor. They were planning an extended trip upstate and needed someone to look after their home and care for Brosco, their beloved German shepherd. Since I had ample vacation time, I gladly accepted the responsibility, excited to spend time with my childhood pet.

However, on the day they left, I was working a long shift and couldn't be there to see them off. They had packed their bags the night before, so I knew they were ready to go, but it felt strange not to be there to wave goodbye. They were set to leave in the early morning, and I planned to head over to their place as soon as work was done.

Once I finally clocked out, I rushed to their House, eager to reunite with Brosco and settle in. I let myself in with the spare key they'd given me. I was immediately greeted by the rhythmic thumping of Brosco's tail against the floor. He looked thrilled to see me, his big brown eyes excitedly shining.

While settling in, I realized I had not been given clear instructions on the House's security system. After some fumbling, I figured it out and locked it up properly.

Brosco and I had a fantastic first night together, filled with laughter and good vibes. We settled in for a movie marathon, the dim glow of the screen flickering softly in the darkened room as we munched on popcorn and indulged in our favorite snacks. Time slipped away, and before I knew it, the clock crept past 4 a.m. I finally succumbed to sleep, feeling warm and content.

Suddenly, a loud, thunderous bang echoed from the basement door, slicing through the tranquility of the night and jolting me awake. My heart raced as I glanced at the spot where Brosco had been sprawled beside me. To my dismay, he was gone. I threw off the covers and slowly climbed out of bed, the cool air shattering my spine. 

As I crept toward the open bedroom door leading into the dimly lit hallway, I saw Brosco standing at the top of the stairs, his silhouette outlined against the faint light. He looked down intently, his ears perked up, waiting in a stillness that made my apprehension grow. What could be lurking in the shadows below?

I nestled next to my furry companion, peering into the thick shroud of darkness that enveloped the stairs. The silence weighed heavily in the air, a suffocating blanket that strained my ears for any hint of sound. 

It felt like time had slowed to a crawl, each second stretching longer than the last. With deliberate care, I descended the creaky stairs, moving as quietly as possible. The hushed atmosphere amplified every faint creak beneath my feet. Finally, I reached the bottom, greeted by the dim glow of the moon filtering through a small window, casting eerie shadows across the space.

To my left, a short hall branched off, leading to a den that loomed like a shadowy secret, while directly ahead loomed the ominous basement door. To my right lay the kitchen, a familiar sanctuary now cloaked in uncertainty. I ventured into the kitchen, my heart racing, keeping my gaze fixed down the hallway, alert to any spur of movement. With a swift motion, I snatched a knife from the countertop, its cold steel a comforting weight in my hand, ready to protect myself against whatever may lurk in the darkness.

With the knife in my hand, As I approached the basement door, my heart quickened, and the cool air seemed to grow heavier around me. I reached out with my empty hand, fingers brushing the surface of the knob, the metal cool against my skin. With a deliberate motion, I slowly turned the handle, anticipation building with each passing moment. 

But to my dismay, it wouldn't budge; it was locked tight. 

I leaned closer, inspecting the knob with a furrowed brow. It had been installed backward, a puzzling design choice that allowed it to be locked from the inside. A deadbolt accompanied it, equally secured, hinting at a more profound secret lying just beyond the door, sealed away from the world.

Why did my parents install the basement door so perplexingly? After a while, the House settled into a deep silence, and gradually, sleep crept in, wrapping around me like a warm blanket. I decided to surrender to the drowsiness, hoping that by the time the sun arose, I would have the energy and clarity to search for a key or some clever way to unlock the basement and uncover its mysteries.

As the sun began peering through the curtains, casting soft rays into my room, I reached for my phone and dialed my mother's number. The ringing echoed in the silence, each tone stretching into the next, creating an almost endless rhythm. I listened intently, hoping for her familiar voice to break through, but the call was silent; she didn't answer. Perhaps she was lost in the joy of a getaway with my father, savoring their moments away from the daily grind. 

I left a voice mail: " Hey, Mom, it's me. I wanted to check in and see how you were enjoying the trip. Love you, Bye."

Yet, as I lay there, a lingering unease from the previous night crept back into my mind. The unsettling noise resonated in the stillness, and the heavy weight of the locked basement door haunted my thoughts. It was as if the air around me was thick with questions, and shadows of doubt lingered beyond my vision.

I slowly slid out of bed, the soft morning light spilling through the curtains and casting a warm glow across the room. With a gentle stretch, I glanced down at Brosco, my loyal companion, who was nestled at the foot of the bed. His ears perked up as I moved, and soon, he trotted beside me as I made my way downstairs to the kitchen.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and the promise of breakfast filled the air. I reached for the skillet, letting the stove's warmth envelop me as I cracked some eggs into the pan. Brosco, ever watchful, settled on the floor beside me, his gaze fixed intently on the basement door. I couldn’t shake the sense of unease it brought me. The heavy, old door was odd, secured with a sturdy deadbolt lock. Who knew what lay behind it?

As I finished my breakfast, unease simmered just beneath the surface. I thought a change of scenery might help clear my mind, so I grabbed Brosco’s leash and headed outside for a walk together. The crisp, invigorating, and fresh air greeted us. We strolled down the quiet street, my thoughts drifting from the locked door to the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves. I hoped that the rhythm of our steps would ease the tension that had settled around me.

The gentle breeze filled my lungs, momentarily lifting the weight of my anxious thoughts. I noticed something unexpected as we curved around my parents' home's long, winding driveway. The door on the side of the House, which led directly into the cozy kitchen, stood slightly open, swinging gently in the wind. A sense of unease washed over me as I recalled closing and locking that door moments before we left. The familiar sounds of the outside world faded as a knot formed in my stomach, urging me to investigate the unsettling sight.

I carefully ascended each weathered step of the side porch, the creaking wood beneath my feet echoing in the quiet of the evening. As I reached the top, I extended my hand toward the door, grasping the cool metal handle to halt its swinging in the wind. Taking a moment to catch my breath, I scanned the surroundings, my heart racing slightly as I searched for any evidence of recent activity—footprints, a snapped twig, or any other sign that someone might have been here before me. The fading light cast long shadows across the ground, heightening my vigilance as I listened for any sounds that might indicate I was not alone.

Brosco burst into the House like a whirlwind, yanking the leash from my fingers with surprising strength. His fur bristled, and a low growl rumbled in his throat as he barked ferociously, a clear sign that something had chafed at his instincts. He raced through the kitchen, his paws skidding on the tile, echoing through the quiet space as he veered sharply and dashed toward the hallway. The door leading to the basement loomed ahead, slightly ajar, as if beckoning him to uncover whatever danger lurked beyond. I stood frozen, half in awe and half alarmed, as the edge of the door creaked wider, revealing shadows that seemed to shift restlessly.

He darted into the depths of the darkness, the sound of the barking abruptly silencing with a sudden, sharp yelp that echoed eerily through the House. A chill ran down my spine as I felt the weight of the silence that followed. Heart racing, I hurried into the House, the familiar creak of the wooden floorboards beneath my feet loud in the stillness. I approached the basement door, my pulse quickening with each step. Grasping the doorknob, I hesitated momentarily, absorbing the darkness that loomed beyond. Taking a deep breath, I pulled the door open entirely and descended the creaking stairs; my senses heightened as I plunged into the inky blackness after Brosco, hoping to find him before it was too late.

As I reached the landing, a wave of icy darkness enveloped me, leaving me momentarily paralyzed. My eyes strained to adjust, but the blackness swallowed all light, creating an impenetrable void. An unsettling sense of fear slithered through my mind, urging me to move, yet I stood frozen, my heart pounding. I strained to listen in the silence, allowing any sound to pierce the stillness around me.

Then, I faintly discerned Brosco's whimper echoing softly in the depths of the darkness—an almost ghostly sound that heightened my anxiety. I steadied my breath and cautiously began to inch forward, each movement deliberate. My feet slid along the ground as I sought to connect with something solid. I soon felt the incredible, rough texture of the wall against my fingertips, which provided a small measure of comfort amid the encroaching dread.

As I continued to probe the surface, my hand brushed against something that felt out of place—a switch. A flicker of hope ignited within me, and with a trembling finger, I reached for it, anticipation swirling as I prepared to bring some light into this suffocating darkness.

The light-flooded everything around me, overwhelming my senses and rendering me momentarily blind. Each ray felt sharp as it pierced through the remnants of pure darkness, causing my eyes to sting and water. I instinctively rubbed them, hoping to clear the haze. Still, the brightness only intensified, a blinding glare against the backdrop of my disorientation. 

An overpowering stench assaulted my nostrils as I struggled to adjust, cutting through the confusion. It was a foul, acrid odor that seemed to cling to the air, reminiscent of something rotten and decayed. The stark light and the noxious smell made my stomach churn, intensifying my unease as I fought to make sense of my surroundings.

A surprising scene unfolded as my eyes gradually adapted to the light flooding the basement. A towering stack of my parents’ luggage stood in the far corner. The familiar, weathered suitcases were scattered haphazardly, striking me with a jolt—my parents had never actually departed for their long-planned trip upstate. The realization sank like a weight in my chest, filling the air with an unshakable sense of unease. 

The ground and scattered luggage were coated in a dark red, dried substance. It appeared thick and crusty, like dried blood.

Brosco was intently pawing at one of the significant, weathered cases stacked in the corner of the room. His curiosity seemed to drive him as he sniffed and nudged the zippers with his nose. I approached cautiously, my heart racing with anticipation, and reached to grasp the worn rusted zipper. I took a deep breath and began to unzip it slowly, savoring the moment. Suddenly, without warning, something unexpectedly heavy and round—about the size of a bowling ball—came tumbling out, hitting the floor with a dull thud and rolling ominously away from the case.

As I stood there, my gaze instinctively tracked the path of an ominous object that had tumbled out of the dark recesses of the back area. When my eyes landed on my mother's expressionless face, a chill ran down my spine. Her stare was vacant and lifeless, devoid of any recognition or warmth. Then, the foul stench enveloped me, thick and nauseating, filling the air like a heavy fog. The putrid odor clawed at my throat, and before I could even brace myself, I doubled over. I vomited, the contents of my stomach spilling forth uncontrollably. Panic surged within me as I stumbled backward, my heart racing. I darted up the narrow staircase, the dread propelling me forward with urgency, my fingers fumbling in search of my phone buried deep in my pocket, desperate to escape this horror and reach out for help.

As I reached the basement door at the top of the stairs, I held my phone and dialed 911. 

"911, what's the emergency?" A calm voice came through, sharply contrasting with the turmoil inside me.

After further investigation, it was revealed that the bodies had been lying hidden in that grim, secluded location for several days, far longer than anyone had initially suspected. The unsettling truth was that the perpetrator had likely remained in the House, lurking in the shadows of the basement, until I took Brosco out for our usual walk that fateful day as the feeling that something sinister had unfolded in my parent's home. At the same time, I was blissfully unaware while house-sitting. 

So Today, I fucked up by going into my parent's Basement while house-sitting
