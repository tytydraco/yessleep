The day started with a drip from the ceiling. A pipe must have busted in the apartment above mine. It was slow at first, but then a patch of my ceiling fell out, slamming onto the floor with a wet slap. It was messy, and it scared the hell out of us. There wasn’t any more water after that. I did my best to clean it all up.

That day was Midas’ birthday, and I wasn’t going to let anything ruin it. Midas was a seven-year-old golden retriever who was a rescue. Spoiled, sweet, and sometimes dumb, he was truly man’s best friend. He was my best friend. He was there for the hard parts of my life. Losing my father to cancer, and when I went through the divorce. He didn’t know it, but he was my strength. I would come home after a long day to a goofy smile, tail wags, and no chance to take off my shoes before being bombarded with love. It was just me, him, and a couple of goldfish. I had won them at the county fair, and was surprised they made it more than a few days, let alone two years.

Our apartment was small, somewhat messy, and old. It was all I could afford after everything. One bedroom, a cramped bathroom, and a kitchen that was just a microwave and a fridge. Neighbors came and went. Some good, some bad, but mostly everyone kept to themselves. With the building falling apart and having more problems, the other apartments were mostly vacant now. 

For Midas’ birthday, I was going to get him his favorite food. Eggrolls from the “Rising Sun.” It was a popular family-owned Chinese take-out place. They knew us pretty well, and they loved Midas. I ordered all kinds of food and had it delivered to us. About an hour or so passed, and there was a knock at the door. That’s when everything started. 

As I opened the door, I was greeted by a giant of a man. Someone I’ve never seen before. Very tall and wearing several layers of thick clothing. Very odd attire for southern Florida. I couldn’t see his face because he was wearing sunglasses, a facemask, and had his hoodie up. I looked at him in shock and felt nervous. He didn’t say a word. He just held his hand out, expecting me to give him something. I looked down and noticed the bag of food sitting beside him on the floor. I knew everyone at that takeout place, but I had never seen him before. ‘Maybe he was a new hire,’ I thought. 

“Oh, I’m sorry. Are you from the Rising Sun?” I asked. No response. Just still in the same position with his hand out. 

"Um, okay. What was the total again?” I remembered what it was. I just wanted him to break his uncomfortable silence, but there was still no response. I just gave up. I reached into my pocket and pulled out some cash. I counted out what was owed and even gave him a tip despite everything. He didn’t reach for it. He didn't even budge. I awkwardly placed the money into his hand. After I did, a fly crawled out from under his sleeve and flew into my apartment. I was disgusted and weirded out. 

Afterwards, he finally moved. He closed his hand, gripping the cash, turned around, and walked down the hallway of the apartment building. He turned and went down the stairs, out of sight. Every shift and twist of his movements was stiff and slow. I grabbed my bag of food from off the floor, then I closed the door, making sure to lock it. “What the hell was that about?” I asked myself out loud. 

My mind was brought back from the realm of unease as I saw Midas staring at me as he sat there with his big brown eyes. His tail was sweeping back and forth. He knew what was in the bag. He could smell it. I unpacked our food and got everything together. Both of our plates were made, and I put on our favorite show, the early seasons of Scooby Doo. Everything was going well. We were enjoying every bite and every minute. It wasn’t long, however, before our enjoyment was interrupted.

 Fading in and out was the annoying buzzing of insect wings. Close, then far as it did pass-by’s near my head. It quickly went from annoyance to near insanity with how persistent it was. I could tell it was bothering Midas as well. He ignored his food to track the fly’s movements and attempted to snap it out of the air. Enough was enough. This thing needed to die. I rolled up some newspaper that was lying around, and we started the hunt.

 Marching from one side of the apartment to the other, going in and out of each room just to do it again and again, climbing over furniture, and several miscalculated jumps, all accompanied by wacky cartoon music from the television. After an entire episode’s worth of chasing the devil, it came to a satisfying end. It had landed on the arm of the couch. I slowed my movement and angled my weapon like a praying mantis. I had lost count of how many times this exact setup had occurred now, all with failure. Midas was stalking his prey just like me, but he was quicker. The bite was swift and silent like an assassination. I knew it was over when I could hear the smacking of Midas’ jowls as he chewed that son of a bitch up. 

“Hell yeah!” I shouted with excitement. “Good job, birthday boy!” I praised as I covered Midas with pets and rubs. “Thank you so much!” 

I could tell he was proud of himself because his mouth curled into a smirk as his eyes squinted thin, followed by uncontrollable butt wiggles. We resumed our planned activities of chowing down and watching cartoons. Our peace didn’t last long, however. Midas walked over to the middle of the room and started dry heaving. I quickly got up to his aid. I rubbed and patted his sides. 

“You okay, bud? That fly was nasty, huh?” I asked. 	

He threw up more than I’ve ever seen. It was liquidy and panned out in all directions, consisting of multi-colored chunks, best described as the worst pizza I had ever seen. 	

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” I said softly to him. “Let me clean this up.” 

He seemed fine after everything poured out of him, but I was still concerned. I took the moment to get cleaning supplies from the bathroom since it didn’t seem like an absolute emergency, and more like an upset stomach. I went and got all that I needed, only taking a couple of minutes. When I returned to the living room, I was greeted by the disgusting sound of wet slop being chewed quickly. The sound alone was enough to make me gag. I found the source on the other side of the room. Midas was not just eating the vomit; he was devouring it, like he was suffering from starvation. I rushed over to grab him by his sides to pull him away. “Stop! Bad! Stop that! Get off of that!” I commanded.

He fought me with every muscle he had. He started to growl and snarl at me as he slopped the floor clean. By the time he gave in to my pull and lost tension, it was all gone. He looked at me with what seemed to be fear, and a whimper followed. His mood had flipped like a light switch. 	

A few hours of quiet confusion passed. I stayed up much later than normal, sitting on the couch with some tea. I watched Midas the whole time. All my thoughts were of concern and fear, hoping that he would be alright, but also talking myself through grief if it was a worst-case scenario and I lost him. He was doing just fine now, like nothing ever happened. Maybe it was a one-off thing. Maybe the eggrolls were off today. Maybe I did something wrong. My thoughts raced with how I should have done things better, gone for more walks, and spent more time with him. How this whole birthday for him was just me making up for not being as good as I should have. 	

“Shut up,” I said softly to myself. 

I knew I couldn’t bear another loss, especially not Midas, but he’s right there. He’s fine, and I’m just thinking the worst. 	

The next day seemed normal for the most part. We had breakfast. Midas didn't really eat though. I figured he wasn't feeling too well. Eventually, I went off to work. When I got home later that day, I wasn’t greeted with the normal warm welcome. Instead, there was a stink in the air and garbage all over the floor. The trash can had been raided and its contents spread everywhere. I looked for Midas and found him hiding under my bed. He had never done that before. I guess he thought I was going to be mad when I found out.	

“It’s okay, big guy. You’re not in trouble,” I said to him as I got down on my belly to look at him head-on. He stayed under the bed, not making a sound. Just staring. I went to pet him and he retracted slowly backwards, wedging himself further under the bed. I never laid harmful hands on him before. Why would he retract like that? This honestly broke my heart.	

“Okay… I’ll just go clean up and give you some space then,” I said.

 I cleaned up the mess, but the smell never went away. Midas eventually came out, and things were okay for the most part. He didn’t eat his normal dinner, and he didn’t even beg for a bite of mine. I think we were both stressed so I called it an early night. The next morning, his mood was cold and almost absent-minded. He didn’t eat or go to the bathroom. He just laid there watching me. I went to pet him and try to cheer him up before I left for work, but it seemed like he couldn’t care less. 	

“You’re starting to make me worry,” I told him. “I’ll be back soon.” I patted his head and went to work. That day, it was hard to focus on anything other than Midas. I tried not to spiral into emotion. It was difficult. 	

When I got back to the apartment, I stood outside the door with my hand on the knob. I was hoping for the best. For a warm, loving welcome but fearing the cold, lonely distance. When I went in, Midas was lying on the couch. He raised his head to look at me, but there was no sign of excitement. I took my shoes off and put my stuff on the table. I walked over to him almost in a defeated march. In a lazy movement, he just slid himself off the couch and walked about three feet before lying down on the floor. There was a wet puddle on the couch cushion. Midas was sick for sure.

 I did my best to clean the stain and then sat there just talking to him from afar. I didn’t want to smother him if he wasn’t feeling well, and he still seemed apathetic. He sat there and watched me as I talked. I stayed up late just recollecting memories together and telling him stories of my father. He never gave me his normal loving, happy-to-be-alive kind of attention, but I could feel that he enjoyed not being alone. The next morning, I called off work and called the vet. I talked to the receptionist, who told me their earliest appointment was first thing tomorrow morning. I was reluctant, but I had no other choice. If I wanted someone to see him today, it would involve a three-hour car ride to the animal emergency hospital and an enormous bill. It was a tough decision, but I couldn't afford to take him there. He seemed off and unwell, but it was just one more day. 

Just one day.

The hardest day of my life. 

Midas still wouldn’t eat anything I offered him. He almost seemed to get sicker at the sight of food. He had a rotten smell to him today. I lit some scented candles to help, but it all mixed into a foul odor of decomposing fruit. 

I did my very best to hold it together, and more importantly, not to blame myself and feel guilty. I did what I could to occupy my mind, doing little chores around the apartment, but I always kept an eye on Midas. 

Everything was slow and bleak in this new home of gloom. Minutes passed, then hours. That’s when I heard a drip, followed by another, and another. Not a stream or a trickle but something leaking. I started my search at the sink. Nothing. Then I remembered the other day and scanned every inch of the ceiling. Still nothing. The dripping continued. I finally found the source. It was Midas. He just stood there with drip after drop coming from under him, while a puddle started to form. I went and grabbed a towel. He kept dripping. 

“You poor guy. It’s okay,” I said with a heart full of dread. I wrapped him up in a towel and helped him lie down. I thought he was having bladder problems. I went to get another towel to clean up, and on closer inspection, the puddle wasn’t like urine. It was slimy and had a thickness like bile. It smelled both sweet and putrid. I did my best to clean it up without vomiting. I gagged and struggled to keep it down. I forced back down the unwanted substance in my throat. That’s when I noticed Midas. Inches away from me with excitement in his eyes. On my hands and knees, next to him, I felt almost like prey. I was scared of him.

My body and mind locked up. I almost forgot how to breathe. He licked and slapped his jowls in anticipation. So close to me, it was deafening. The thunderous wet hunger of him made my heart race until it hurt. I could see the shimmer of the same bile slowly dangle from his mouth. 

My sickness was no longer from disgust but overwhelming fear. We both stayed petrified in a state of hunger and terror, both waiting for the other to move. After a time that was too uncomfortably long, Midas just walked away. Feral starvation left his face, and he laid back down in the same spot as before. I wasn’t as quick to return my composure. I slowly got back onto my feet, and I would never meet him on that level again. I went from fearing for him to fearing him. What the hell was happening? 

After a few hours of distance, I found myself on the couch once again. The apartment was quiet. No music, no talking, not even the sounds of the building falling apart. Then came a whine. A faint, tender whine. Midas was at my feet, looking up at me. My heart sank. His eyes were glossy, and his expression was somber. He seemed to know something I didn’t. He seemed like he was saying goodbye. 

“You’re going to be alright, Midas. Just a couple of hours and they’ll fix you right up,” I said in a broken tone, holding back a cracking dam of emotions. 	

I leaned in to pet and hug him. As soon as my hands felt under his golden, soft fur, I could feel his sickness. His skin felt hot and uncomfortably soft like wet clay. As I applied any amount of pressure, I could feel a mass of movement, like a sack full of worms. My hands retracted, and the dam broke. I shot up onto my feet, my face covered with rivers of emotion running down. 

“We’re taking you to the hospital now. Everything will be alright,” I mumbled to Midas through the tears. 

I knew things were not going to be okay. I fumbled to the kitchen with what balance I could command. I frantically search for my keys. I struggled to get my shoes on, like I didn’t know how to wear them. I grabbed his leash from the wall hanger and had my hand on the doorknob. 

“Come on, bud. Let’s go, we’ve got to go,” I cried. I looked back at Midas, just standing there in the middle of the apartment. He didn’t budge. “Midas! Please!” I cried louder. 

I let go of the knob and took a few steps toward him. “Please, Midas! God, don’t do this, please!” I sobbed. 

Midas just stared at me with those faded brown eyes and gave out the softest whimper. In that moment, the bottom half of him spilled open like a soaking wet trash bag in the summer heat. What was Midas had collapsed into a steaming pile of flesh and maggots on the floor. A wave of putrid odor filled the air, accompanied by a storm of buzzing insects. Under what was left of his golden fleece rose a black and green iridescent cloud of flies that quickly swarmed every inch of the apartment. I didn’t have time to process anything before being quickly attacked  by the swarm.

 They covered me as I screamed and swatted. I flailed as I turned around, searching for the door that was only a few feet away. The flies were so abundantly thick, I couldn’t see anything. They crawled all over me, into my mouth, my ears, my nostrils, and under my eyelids. I finally made my way out of the apartment into the hallway. I closed the door with a slam behind me. I flailed and spat as much as I could. After moments of assaulting myself, the flies were gone. The buzzing stopped. I stood still for a moment before collapsing to the floor and into an all-out wailing cry. 

The hallway was filled with the echoing howls of my painful cries. I was all alone out there. I didn’t have much time to break down until the overwhelming thoughts of Midas filled my head. I had left him in there. I abandoned him. None of this could be real. I got up on my trembling legs and opened my apartment door. The storm cloud of flies was gone; however, there were dead flies sprinkled throughout the apartment, and small piles near the air vents and windows.

I cautiously closed the door behind me. I was hoping that all of it was me going through a mental break or it was a nightmare. But reality in the form of a rotting pile of meat quickly proved me wrong. The odor was so strong and foul. I tried covering my face with my hands as I dropped to my knees beside the mound. My stomach stabbed in pain, and the room began to spin. I choked as I vomited through my hands. It started to spill out between my fingers and eventually, I stopped resisting and moved my hands away so the rest of me could spill out. It was dark, oily, and thick. As the contents pooled onto the floor, I noticed movement. There were several flies in my vomit, still wiggling and buzzing.

 Out of sheer disbelief and disconnection, I watched them. After my contents were purged from me, I began to feel hungry. Not a normal hunger. A starving hunger. I was ravenous. I didn’t even notice my hands scooping up and pouring my stomach contents back into my mouth until it was too late. The acidic burn and slime quickly got my attention to come back. It was agonizing, but before I could process what I was doing, it was already sliding down my throat. I tried to stop. Another handful. I felt tears roll down my face and bile between my teeth. Another mouthful. My body wouldn’t stop. It was like I was on autopilot.

 There was nothing I could do to control myself. I couldn’t even feel my hands, even as they shoveled sickness back into me. They felt numb. The only thing I could feel was my face and my tongue fighting the nauseous chowder of pre-rendered meats and vegetables in a barely recognizable texture. The taste of battery acid and greasy pork mixed into a vile flavor that was the slurry I choked down.

As the pool disappeared with one final retching gulp, I thought it was over, but my possession had only begun the torment. My body was like an animal next to the rotten mound of my friend. I screamed and cried out within my head. The only sound to leave me was a weak, unintelligible, wet gurgle. The first mouthful was just the beginning to a grueling hour-long feast. Each clump was a thick paste, marbled with cartilage. Clumps of hair scratched my throat and got caught between my teeth. The taste was that of fermented fruits and sour, curdled milk. All I could do was endure hell. 

At the end, I found myself chewing on bones with chipped and broken teeth. I could taste a river of my own blood, but I felt no pain. By the end of the consumption, I didn’t feel much at all. My body was relinquished from its foreign control. I slowly got myself up. The only thing that was left of my friend, Midas, was some bones, sucked clean, and what paste of him that was still in my beard. I walked slowly to the bathroom and stared into the mirror. I didn’t wash or clean myself. I found no purpose in doing so.

I knew what had happened was wrong and the worst thing to ever happen to me, but I lacked concern. I had just eaten my dog, my best friend, but I wasn’t sad. My mind felt hazy, and my emotions felt sedated. I knew how I should feel, but I couldn’t feel them. I knew I needed to go get help, even if they thought I was insane. But somehow, my internal instincts must have been rewritten. All I wanted to do was stay home and let nothing happen. My thoughts were still my own, but those thoughts are nothing but a skeleton without feeling or control. 

I went to bed that night and slept without dreams. I awoke the next morning, starving again. I ransacked my apartment, looking for a meal. Everything fresh disgusted me, and I found myself eating forgotten, moldy leftovers. It didn’t bother me. I was used to it. It was just an action that I needed to do – nothing more. I could feel as muscles and organs were devoured and replaced with wiggling, crawling life. 

My sense of self preservation had been coded into something new. This felt like it was in my instincts to host and nurture. Just like birds flying south for the winter, or salmon swimming to spawn, this was my nature. I am torn between this and my memories. Nature will win, but I will remember what it robbed from me. I wish to feel sorrow. I want to cry again. All of that is a ghost now. Trying to recall sadness and joy is like trying to remember how something tastes.  Familiar, but ever distant. Everything has been taken from me, but I am devoid of any emotion.

 My body is full now. Not of myself, but of something else. They have become me and I, them. My skin is soft to the touch like a rotten peach. I must not push too hard or I will puncture myself, and they may die. I’ve been in this state for two days now. Feeding, mothering. Remembering. They have given me this apathetic bliss, but I know that it is hell. Soon they will be free, and so will I. I don’t have much time left in me. I have started to drip.
