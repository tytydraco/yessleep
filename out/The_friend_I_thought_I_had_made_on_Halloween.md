This happened when I was 9 years old.

It was Halloween, and I was always the kind of kid who made friends easily, loved talking, and running with others until I ran out of breath.

That night, we were at the little square near my house. My friends went home early, but I decided to stay a little longer. I like that time of day, when the sky turns orange and everything seems calm before it gets dark.

I sat on the swing and stayed there, watching the sunset, thinking about the route I’d take later to get candy. I could hardly wait to wear my new costume and eat everything I saw.

That’s when I felt someone poking me.

It was a small boy, probably no older than seven. He smiled and asked if I could push him on the swing. I agreed, of course — at that age, I’d make friends with anyone.

His name was Otto.

He seemed like an ordinary child. Very cheerful and full of energy, just like kids can be. He was dressed as a pirate, but the costume looked old, a bit torn. I thought it was odd, but I didn’t mind. At that age, it didn’t matter.

We talked for a while. He told me about the pirate costume he was wearing, and I talked about mine, which I was going to put on later before heading out for candy. We even made a bet to see who could get more that Halloween. It was easy to make friends at that age. You would just say your names and suddenly you were best friends.

Time passed faster than I realized. Before I knew it, it was getting dark, and the orange sky had been replaced by a deep blue. I kept pushing Otto on the swing, and we laughed, trying to see if we could get enough momentum to fly.

That’s when a group of other kids showed up. They wanted to use the swing. They asked me to get off, but I told them Otto and I were still playing.

Their reaction was strange. They looked at me, confused, as if I had said something that didn’t make sense. I didn’t understand. Not at that moment.

But Otto asked me to stop. He jumped off the swing, smiled, and said we should go somewhere else.

“It’s getting dark,” he said.

I told him I needed to go home to put on my new costume. He seemed excited about that and said he wanted to see it.

I didn’t think much about it. As kids, we don’t think much. Things just happen, and we accept them.

We walked together toward my house. The streets were already full of kids running in every direction, wearing colorful costumes and plastic masks. The orange and purple lights flickered in the windows, and the sound of “trick or treat!” echoed from time to time, mixed with laughter and hurried footsteps.

Otto and I, who now seemed like friends of years, watched all of that with the excitement of knowing the best part of the night was still to come.

When we got to my house, I told him to start trick-or-treating at the neighboring houses while I took a shower and put on my costume. He smiled and said okay, waiting for me to go in before continuing.

As soon as I entered, the sweet, strong smell of caramel filled the house.

My mom always made caramel apples at this time of year.

She appeared in the kitchen, a dish towel thrown over her shoulder, her cheeks rosy from the heat.

“Oh, before I forget,” she said, pointing to the corner of the room, “I’ve set aside some old things to donate. Take a look later and see if you want anything.”

I nodded, more focused on the caramel apples, but before going to take a shower, I glanced at the cardboard box.

It was one of those big supermarket boxes, full of old toys, action figures with missing arms, scratched cars, and some clothes I didn’t even remember existed.

I shuffled through the top of the box, just to say I’d looked.

That’s when I saw it.

At the bottom of the box, half-hidden under a dinosaur mask, was the little gray cloth mouse.

It belonged to Polaco.

My cat.

He carried that toy everywhere, and I always ended up tripping over it in the house. It had been years since he’d disappeared.

My mom used to say that sometimes cats run away and never come back.

But I… liked to think he might show up one day, meowing at the door.

I held the mouse for a moment, remembering the way Polaco would curl up with it to sleep.

It wasn’t a sad memory. Just… a good one that came out of nowhere.

I put the toy aside, grabbed an apple from the bucket, and went upstairs to shower.

I lost track of time in the shower, only realized it when my mom yelled, asking if I had drowned in the bathroom.

In my room, I looked at myself in the mirror, and in my head, I heard the imaginary theme song of a hero transforming. I put on my ninja costume — one of those simple black ones with red details — and started posing in front of the mirror, thinking I looked amazing. As a kid, that was enough to feel invincible.

I called out to my mom that I wouldn’t be out too late and dashed out the door.

Otto was there.

On the same sidewalk as before.

With an empty bag.

I thought it was strange. I had told him to start without me. But there he was, as if he had never left. He smiled when he saw me, and I felt a slight unease that I couldn’t explain. Maybe it was just guilt for taking too long.

His pirate costume, which I had originally thought was just old and a little torn, now seemed kind of dirty. As if someone had dragged it through the dirt. There was a dark stain on the sleeve that I hadn’t noticed before. But I ended up ignoring it. I probably just hadn’t seen it before.

And then the night really began. We went door to door, running through the streets lit by Halloween lights. At each house, a new costume, a new candy, and a new chance to show off my ninja outfit. Otto, always by my side, smiling and having as much fun as I was.

Strangely, Otto didn’t interact when they were handing out candy. They would compliment my costume, make nice comments, and drop a handful of candy into my bag. This happened at almost every house.

But something felt off.

They didn’t seem to notice Otto.

And Otto didn’t seem to notice them. He just stepped back a little when they opened the door.

I thought it wasn’t right. They were ignoring my new friend. I figured it was because his costume was dirty and torn, but that’s no reason for exclusion.

But I didn’t let it bother me. We still had plenty of fun to have.

We knocked on a few more doors, and my bag was almost full.

The sky, once orange, was now tinged purple, and the wind was picking up, shaking the trees and scattering dry leaves across the sidewalks.

The house lights were gradually going out. One by one, the windows that had been lit up with Halloween decorations faded into darkness. The sound of kids running and shouting “trick or treat!” was growing distant, like a faint echo.

Otto kept smiling, as if nothing had changed.

When we passed by a square, I heard the sound of dry leaves scraping along the ground, blown by the wind. A nearby streetlight flickered twice before going out. A damp, earthy smell filled the air.

In a quiet corner, near a tree full of fake cobwebs and rubber bats hanging from it, Otto and I stopped. We sat on the sidewalk, the ground still warm from the day. We opened a few candy wrappers and sat there, talking.

I chewed on a caramel, and Otto spun a lollipop as we chatted.

“They’re annoying, right?” I said, pouting. “They pretend you don’t exist just because your costume’s torn. Stupid people.”

Otto looked at me with a crooked smile.

“Yeah… stupid people.”

I told him not to worry, and if anyone made him feel bad, I’d use my amazing ninja skills on them.

“You’d hit someone to protect me?”

I clearly said that in jest, but his response…

I felt he took it a little too seriously.

The way he asked, so calm and curious, made my skin crawl for a moment.

I just jokingly responded, “Of course, you’re my friend, I’d protect you.”

He smiled. And kept spinning his lollipop.

I found it strange that Otto wasn’t eating any of the candy, so I asked him about it. He simply replied that he didn’t like candy much.

That made my jaw drop. It never occurred to me that anyone wouldn’t like candy.

Otto laughed.

That’s when he stopped, suddenly. He lowered his head for a moment, and when he looked up, he spoke in a much lower voice, but loud enough for me to hear:

“I don’t want to go back home. I want to go with you.”

I stayed silent, not knowing what to say. It was just a friend’s request, right? Kids say that kind of thing all the time. But at that moment… it didn’t sound like that.

There was something strange about that sentence. The way he said it. As if ‘going home’ wasn’t about heading back after trick-or-treating, but something he desperately wanted to avoid.

I tried to make a joke:

"What, your mom won’t be mad if you disappear?"

He gave a sad smile — a smile I didn’t understand at the time. And he only replied:
“She doesn’t miss me.”

The way he said it… it sent a chill up my spine.

For a moment, I thought about asking what he meant by that, but he quickly changed the subject, offering me another piece of candy and saying we needed to hurry to get more.

Doing my best not to think about it, we kept walking through the neighborhood. The orange and purple lights blinked on the balconies, and the distant sound of kids yelling “trick or treat!” tried to keep the mood light.
But it wasn’t working.

And then we saw it. An accident.

A dog. Hit by a car.

There were people gathered around trying to help, but you could tell, just from looking from a distance, that it was too late. It wasn’t moving anymore.
I stopped. So did Otto.

The poor dog… probably had a long life ahead. The people crying around it… I imagined they must be its family. And for a moment, I tried to imagine what it would be like to lose someone like that. But I couldn’t.

I ended up remembering Palaco.

My experience with something like this was different. Palaco just vanished, but the dog… clearly dead, in front of its family.

When I looked to the side, Otto was motionless. Eyes locked on the dog’s body. He didn’t say a word. Didn’t blink. Didn’t even seem to breathe.

I called his name.
Once, twice, three times.
The sound of my own voice felt strange.
The third time, I shouted.
But he didn’t move.

I touched his shoulder. Cold. Stiff. I shook him. Nothing.

It was only when I grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away, that he stumbled and fell.
The fall was sharp, landing on his butt.
When he got up, his eyes looked normal again. He smiled, as if nothing had happened. But when I reached out to help him up, the sleeve of his costume slipped down. And I saw it.

A deep, purple mark. Like an old bruise, wide, covering almost his entire arm. It wasn’t bleeding. But it looked… wrong.

I asked Otto how he got that bruise.
He just said, “It was Mom. She says I’m too naughty.” I didn’t react — I wasn’t expecting that kind of answer.

Suddenly, his earlier comment made sense. Otto wanted to run away from home. And in me, he saw an opportunity for shelter. At least, that’s what I thought.

It was getting late. The discomfort mixed with the Halloween atmosphere gave me chills. I wanted to leave. But Otto wanted to keep walking. And something wouldn’t let me abandon him there.

I think we walked too far — I ended up getting lost, unsure how to get home.
And Otto… he noticed. And made an unusual suggestion:

“Want to come to my house? We can call your mom to pick you up. And I can show you something cool — you’ll like it.”

I thought it was weird, this sudden change.
One moment he didn’t want to go home — now he’s inviting me over. It was confusing, maybe because I was still following him around.

I refused. I didn’t think twice, just said I’d head home alone. Otto looked at me with that strange smile, almost like he already knew what I was going to say. I turned around and looked down the street behind me.

Complete darkness.
The street was empty, completely empty.
It didn’t make sense. It wasn’t that late. I took a step into the darkness, but something was pulling me back.

I stood there, feeling the heavy air. The sounds of the night seemed to have vanished. No more laughter, no distant footsteps. The only sound was my heart, pounding hard in my chest, the emptiness around me closing in.

I looked at Otto. He was still there, motionless, with that unshakeable smile.
A smile that made no sense. I tried to take a deep breath, but the feeling of unease only grew stronger. Something wasn’t right. Otto was my friend. So why was I so scared?

I looked down the street again.
But the darkness seemed to spread.
The shadows stretched out, creeping closer. And when I realized, there was no escape. I wasn’t alone. Not anymore.

With my chest tight, not knowing how, not knowing why, I heard myself mumble without control: “Okay, let’s go.” And when I looked back at Otto, he just motioned with his hand like he already knew.

I didn’t know what was happening, but something inside me instinctively told me I was going to regret this decision.

The walk to his house was short.
But each step felt heavier than the last.
And though the houses around were normal, something was wrong in the air.
A suffocating feeling — a place where no one should be.

Otto announced that his mom wasn’t home yet, probably working late.

Inside, the house looked… alive. Clean curtains, the smell of fresh coffee, an old photo above the fireplace. But the air was thick. As if the walls were watching.

“Come on, I want to show you my room,” Otto said, vanishing down the hallway.

Upstairs, I noticed Otto’s bedroom door was slightly open.

The hallway was silent, with the warm light from the lamp reflecting off the pale walls.
It was an ordinary, modern house, with colorful paintings and clean rugs.

I pushed the door gently.

The room looked like any boy’s. Made bed, neatly arranged toys, little string lights blinking on the wall. Toy cars, stuffed animals, a poster from some old cartoon.

But something felt off.

On top of the dresser, there was a small makeshift altar. Dolls neatly lined up, electric candles flickering, and in the center, a photo of Otto. He was smiling in the picture — but the eyes looked empty. Different.

Beneath the photo, a folded piece of paper.

I picked it up.

The handwriting was adult, steady, and the paper yellowed at the edges.
The message read:

“Forgive me. I created a monster. May God receive this poor soul and those he’s hurt.”

A chill ran down my spine again.

I looked around the room.

And there was Otto.

Sitting at the edge of the bed, his feet lightly swinging in the air, smiling. But it wasn’t the same smile from before. It had no joy. No lightness. It was empty. Tired.

“I died,”

he suddenly said, voice low, as if confessing a secret.

“She killed me.”

The room grew colder.

Otto lowered his head, his fingers playing with the edge of his costume.

“She said I was too naughty… too strange… that I did things no child should do.”

He lifted his eyes to me, and it sent a shiver through me.

“I know I said I didn’t want to go home… but I thought you might help me with something.”

He stood up, the carpet muffling his steps.

He stopped by the dresser, picked up the old photo, and looked at it.

“She did this to me,” he whispered.

“Said I was a monster. And killed me. She had no right.”

He turned again.

“I just need you to do one thing, just one,” his voice almost sweet, but there was something rotten behind it.

“Finish her. For me.”

The words hung in the air, heavier than any silence.

“After that… I’ll leave. After that, I’ll be free… and happy.”

The room lights flickered.

I wanted to say no, wanted to run, but my body felt glued to the floor.

The doorknob creaked downstairs.

It was Otto’s mother.

Her voice sounded light, almost humming something. I could hear the jingle of keys being dropped on the table.

Upstairs, in the room, Otto stared straight at me.

“She’s here.”

His words poured into my head like poison.
Telling me I didn’t have to run. That I could fix it right there.
That all I had to do was go down and end it.

I tried to refuse. Whispered a near-silent “no” just for myself.

And for the first time, Otto stopped smiling.

The sound of coffee brewing.

My sweaty hands, heart pounding in my chest.

“You know she deserves it.”
He took a step toward me.

“She needs to pay.”

I closed my eyes. Felt an icy chill on my neck, something crawling up my spine.
Like a weight — another presence taking up too much space in that room.

And then, I lost control.

My fingers clenched without my will.
My muscles moved as if they weren’t mine.

I opened my eyes and saw Otto too close.
Not in front of me.
Inside.

I tried to fight, to order my body to stop — but it was useless. Each step toward the door, each movement, wasn’t mine anymore.

He waited for her to head to her room — then act.
Down the stairs.
Into the kitchen.
And grab the knife from the sink.

In the window’s reflection, I could see my own face. But it wasn’t my gaze anymore.

It was his.
Otto’s.

And then, going back upstairs, the floor creaking under my feet. I heard her voice, laughing softly at some joke. Unaware that the past had climbed those stairs.

The creak of the last step sounded louder than anything in the world.
Every step my feet took thudded in my ears, but I couldn’t stop.

The hallway felt longer than before. Darker too. With each step, the walls closed in, choking the air around me.

The knife was firm in my hand — or his, I no longer knew.

Otto walked with me. Inside me. Like a weight stuck to my skin, breathing through my lungs, sitting in my chest.

When her door appeared ahead, slightly open, the sound of the TV muffled everything else. Some random movie playing, with happy voices that didn’t belong there.

“Now,” Otto whispered, and it was like my head filled with wet echoes.

The doorknob felt colder than normal.
I approached, the knife’s tip reflecting the TV’s weak light.

I could see her.
Lying on the bed, watching TV.

I wanted to scream, say something, anything — but my mouth wouldn’t obey.
Neither my legs, nor my hands.

“She’ll sleep in peace. Unlike me.”
Otto’s words came with a weight in my chest, like the air vanished.

My hand lifted.
The sound of metal cutting the air.

She turned her face, confused, like she’d heard something.
Our eyes met.

And in that second, before the blow, I saw everything she kept hidden.
The fear. The guilt. 
The past returning.

But it was too late.

I saw everything clearly. Each stab my hand — now his — made with the knife. Her desperate screams echoed through the house. Her expression… I saw it all.

I was forced to watch, as if my eyes were glued to a TV screen, unable to look away.

I knew Otto wanted to see.

But deep down, he wanted me to see too.

His revenge. His bloody revenge.

The world went black before I saw the rest. 

Only the sound of a whisper against my ear:

“Thank you.”

And silence.

It’s been a while since that night. 

Sometimes, I feel like I’ve been someone else ever since. As if something… stayed behind in that house. Or inside me.

My mother never knew what happened.
Never understood why I came home like that.
Without saying a word.
Without meeting her eyes.

Otto never showed up again.
No voice.
No shadow.
No reflection in the mirror.

But every Halloween night…

…I feel it.

A discomfort.

Like something, or someone, sliding cold hands over my shoulders.

And even if I tell myself it’s nothing — just the wind — Otto’s smile never leaves my mind.

Never.
