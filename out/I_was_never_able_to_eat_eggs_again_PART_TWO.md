*Hello everyone, I know this next part will make you mad, especially since you guys told me I should stay at my friend’s house. But you need to understand… this is my dad. He would never do anything to hurt me, it HAS to be Amber that’s making him act this way.. and I need to save him.*

*I hurried back to my house to see they already unpacked the groceries into the house. I walked in slowly to see them both packing some stuff into the fridge.*

***“Oh hey lily! You’re gonna love the stories I have!”*** *Amber said to me. She seemed fine.. honestly she seemed brighter.*

***“Lily.. um.. hey, hi!”*** *My dad was nervous I could tell. He had a look on his face that he wanted to say something so badly that he could have exploded right then and there.*

*I walked closer, Amber leaned in to give me a hug and that’s when I saw my dad mouth the words “I told you to stay there” then changed to a normal smile after Amber turned back towards him.*

*At this point I just wanted to say something to the both of them now. I was getting tired of this.*

*“Listen, I need you guys to seriously te-“*

*Amber interrupted me with a bowl of 3 eggs inside.*

***“Here baby, I made you breakfast. It’s important you eat all three, you know, for the protein.”***

*My dad just walked away. I know some of you might think it’s stupid of me to think this, but at this point I figured they were getting a divorce and that’s the reason they were acting so weird with each other, and with me. My dad probably just didn’t want me around them arguing and that’s why he told me to stay away.*

*Later that night I heard some yelling in the kitchen from my room. See, divorce most likely. I just turned my tv on higher to tune it out. I was hoping that I was wrong.. I really hope maybe they’re just in a bad spot you know? I mean.. she’s been my mom figure for 5 years.. I don’t want her to go away.*

*The next morning she was gone. And I don’t mean just left the house, I mean every single trace of her was gone. No photo, no blanket, no jacket. Everything that could have possibly been a trace of her… just.. gone.*

*“Dad… what happened? Where’s Amber? Okay listen.. I understand you guys have been trying to shield me from your issues but dad I’m old enough to understand… I wish I could have at least said goodb-“*

***“Lily.. what are you talking about right now?****”*

*“What?… Amber dad.”*

***“Amber?”***

*“Are… are you joking right now? Your wife!”*

***“Jesus lily, don’t start with me with these jokes right now. I’m not in the mood”***

*I didn’t even know what to say. I have a pit in my stomach and in my throat.. I feel sick. No like, actually sick. Sick enough to-*

*I ran to the bathroom and threw up. After I just started pacing in my room. What do I do? What happened? Am I insane? No there’s no way.. I walked around the house to find any possible trace of her. Absolutely nothing. There’s no way they moved all her stuff out that fast.. and not only that.. but now he doesn’t even remember?*

*My stomach started hurting a little more than usual. More than just a nervous stomach bug. I laid in a fetal position on my bed for a while, then had to move into the shower. Some of my hair started coming out..*

*“What the hell?” I whispered to myself.*

*After I got out my skin felt so oily, almost like I was in a sauna and sweating oil. Something wasn’t right. I walked downstairs in my towel and told my dad what happened and that I wasn’t feeling good.*

***“Oh God.. you must have gotten the virus that’s going around”***

*“Virus? What virus? Is it bad?”*

*I started to freak out, I get really anxious when it comes to my health. He assured me it wasn’t anything to worry about but that I needed to go on a retreat. It will take 8 days and after I should feel perfectly fine.*

*“Dad what? I don’t want to go to some retreat.. why don’t I just go to the doctor?”*

***“That’s where you’re going baby, they’re doctors and it’s where they send you after going to the doctors because it’s a serious virus that you can only get rid of a certain way”***

*“No… no I don’t want to do this..”*

***“Lily just trust me, maybe you don’t even have it and you just have a fever, but they at least need to check okay?”***

*The next day I was taken to the retreat. I felt horrible inside like something was trying to get out of me. To be honest I felt too horrible to even think or be worried about anything else. When I got there they immediately started treating me with different medications and different kinds of juices. They made me throw up but it did give me some sort of relief.*

*I noticed the main doctor carried a book with him. Everywhere he went. I asked about it and he said it’s just a book he likes to keep to track his thoughts on the virus and he’s gonna eventually find a true cure for it so that people don’t have to go on these retreats anymore, once they find it.*

*I felt safer after he said that. But I hated that I was one of the people here. I mean what if it doesn’t work? What if I don’t get the correct one that fixes this? What if… no, I’m not gonna die here.*

*The next few days was just the same. Take medicine, get some movement in by walking a little, rest, eat and drink specific things.*

*After the 7th day I actually felt a lot better. And the next day I was on my way home.*

***“Lily! Oh my babygirl, you look so much better sweetheart!”***

*“I actually feel a lot better, that sucked.. I felt like I could have died”*

***“Oh baby I’m so sorry, I’m so happy you feel better, let’s have some dinner and you should get some rest”***

*During dinner I wanted to bring up Amber.. but I didn’t know how or even what to say.. so I just left it.. I honestly just wanted to take a deep shower and forget all this stuff happened. Not that I could have.. maybe she’s the one who hurt him, and he just wants to forget her.*

*The next day I woke up. But I wasn’t home. I was in some sort of wet tight wrapping thing. I couldn’t* *breathe.* Am I dreaming? What the hell is going on? I dug and dug until I got just a slight hole to peek out of. What is this place? It looks like a weird room with a bunch of these… are these cocoons? WHERE AM I?

*I started feeling something move inside me, almost like something was trying to crawl out of my body, slowly I felt it move every single Inch from my stomach up my throat. It felt thick, it felt disgusting. I couldn’t breathe. What the hell am I about to throw up? Am I dying?*

*It came out of me. It looked like a weird little baby.*

*“What the actual fu-“*

*It started growing, growing and cracking and crying and screaming. I just stared at it, watching it form into this alien human. I felt like I could throw up again. At this point I actually wanted to die. I just want to go home.*

*This… thing got to its “teenager” form I guess you could call it. It looked almost… familiar.. wait is.. oh my God.*

*“A… Amber?”*
