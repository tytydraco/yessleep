I was about 9 years old , me and my brother and cousins were jumping around the bed . The Simpsons was playing in the background. When all the sudden out of nowhere the lights went out and when they went back on , my brother and cousins were sleep but me .

However I had a sheet over me. Next thing I know I see a shape I can’t make it out. But it was to say the least not very human shape, the sounds of it walking were like a sound of horse walking the stomp each time felt like my heart was gonna stop I heard a very weird breathing it was not something I can describe. It’s l Almost like a chocking goat a crow and growling of a wolf all at Once blended in an extremely distorting and disturbing way .

I kept seeing the shape getting closer and closer Something told me to close my eyes. There came a point I got so scared and then I all the sudden  became paralyzed I could not move , however. I felt my heart coming out of my chest and  I don’t think scared or frightened actually describes how I felt. With closed eyes I knew he was right next to me I could even above me . I started praying and I started to hear weird noises almost like it was affecting it . He with my eyes closed ,I could see something really green shiny , though my eyes closed .

I knew I could not open my eyes . But I will say even though my eyes were closed it was the most beautiful green I have ever seeing . It’s like glow emerald green mixed with yellow and a light violet. Something inside told this was extremely powerful and do not open my eyes , something  said keep your eyes closed . Your fighting for your soul . I just kept praying.Those piercings eyes that I could see even with my eyes closed I will never forget . There came a point I could finally move .

But I knew with dread deep inside not to take the sheet of me or open my eyes . But I dunno how I got the courage to ask it what it wants and who it was. I he just said I’m bael and I then he’ll of disturbing Voice said your soul , the he said I have several times to take it but I cannot , the last thing he said to me , I will be back again for it . Again out of nowhere I said why . He just said you can’t get them back .

After that all the sudden the lights went out and back on, everything when back to normal like nothing ever happened, tv was on and my cousins and brother were jumping on the bed . I however was laying on the bed.

But many years later I told a friend about my experience and what this dark figure said . When I told her the name she went like pale beyond I have ever seeing her be . When I asked what’s wrong she just said I have to go . But a cold like super chilly feeling came over the room and mind you this was summer . She didn’t talk to me for at least 10 years after that day . When I finally saw her she said you’re still okay .

She liked scary stuff but this was something I was not prepared to hear . She told me it’s not just any dark spirit or demon , This was something far more powerful , but she said for my own good she was not gonna tell me . So here we are now 13 years later . She made me promise her never to look into it . However a lot weird things have been happening. Stuff that if I told someone they would think I am going crazy or loosing it . I have this weird fear I cannot explain
