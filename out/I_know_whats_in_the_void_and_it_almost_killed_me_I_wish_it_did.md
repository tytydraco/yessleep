 

For all intents and purposes, I should have died. My corpse should be floating in the endless abyss beyond the universe, but I’m obviously here. I don’t know if I’m lucky or not. The things I’ve seen… they can never be unseen, but they can never be understood. And the things I haven’t seen- well, I don’t want to even think about that. In the end, I finally got what I wanted, but I finally understand it made me a monster in the process. I don’t even think I care anymore. We are all expendable, after all. Cosmic ants, that’s what we are.

There are things beyond human comprehension, things beyond any logic or explanation. Most matter in the universe is left unaccounted for, baby stars moving and atoms shifting without any reason. At least, not a reason scientists have been able to find. But it exists. I found it. And the reason is best left undiscovered. 

Why am I telling you this then? I suppose my reasons are mostly selfish. At the end of the day, I want other people to know what’s out there. I want them to be as terrified as I am so that if they ever come back, you’ll know. And maybe it’ll make you lose it, too. 

I’ve always had a sort of obsession with the parts of the cosmos we know nothing about. We live in a vastly unexplored abyss, the only thing holding us to this world being a fragile layer of elements tied together with gravity. 

I’ve spent many nights laying back on the grass in my front yard, clinging onto it for dear life as if it were the only thing holding me to this earth. As I stared up at the stars, I imagined something so powerful and terrifying it couldn’t even be perceived by the human eye.

As a teenager this curiosity grew into an obsession. I scoured the internet for mentions of ancient gods and filled journals with sketches of things reaching out from beyond the stars or the depths of the ocean.

My art teacher was a bit disturbed by my interest, but although she looked distastefully at any of my finished projects, I still got an A. I got disciplined once when another student looked into my sketchbook and had nightmares for weeks. I drew what I saw in my own dreams, but they didn’t scare me. I knew that these abominations were nothing like the old gods. I spent most of my free time trying to conceptualize what I knew my brain would never be able to comprehend. I was desperate for what I would never have: a taste of the abyss.

My dreams went through a sudden shift in the coming months. Drifting through blackness, terror in my veins and the unmistakable feeling of eyes watching me. I was frozen in place, staring up at a frigid night with no stars. No air in my lungs, only a barren vacuum. I awoke in a cold sweat most nights, repeating the same dream day after day. Sometimes I would lay on the grass and swear that I was floating up beyond the stars. It wasn’t flying or falling. I was drowning. And I wanted more. 

In the coming weeks it felt like there were eyes embedded in my walls. I constantly felt like I was being watched. At one point I tore off all my wallpaper just to make sure. Fuck the security deposit. I slowly started picking up less and less shifts as work, my finances strained, but I was oblivious. 

The few friends I had were concerned for my well-being. They didn’t understand. No one understands. They said that I was acting like a lunatic, but I knew that the old ones had noticed me. It was not my place to decide when I would act. I needed a taste of their knowledge. I needed a taste of the universe. 

Despite my desire to know more of these eldritch beings, they terrified a deeper, more primal part of me that I tried to repress with everything in me. Perhaps they desired my fear in equal parts with my curiosity. It was something about the mere concept of their presence that made my heart rate quicken and my feet melt into the floor. In the face of such a force, running was futile. I knew they were real, just as I know now. And I was ready.

My dreams got darker and more bleak. It was like everything was devoid of color, like even the blackness had no hue. It felt like my eyes were bubbling, like my blood was literally boiling in my veins even though it was beyond even freezing. I could see things in my peripheral, swaths of black shifting the stars. 

And I kept searching for leads, for answers. I lived off instant ramen and coffee. I think perhaps deep down, I knew that no matter how far down any rabbit holes I searched, I would never get the answers I was looking for. I needed more. 

I saw human renderings of the old ones for what they were- a sad attempt from the human mind to try and rationalize the unknowable. And it angered me. 

Then, the eyes on me stopped without warning. The days seemed to stretch into eternity. At this point, everyone that I knew had given up on me. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, could barely do anything. I needed their attention. I needed them to know me so that I would know the universe. It consumed me completely.

I made my first sacrifice about 6 months ago. I was desperate. Angry. They had gotten bored of me. They had forsaken me. I would make them realize that I had potential. Her screams were satisfying, and then they grew annoying. When she bled out on the floor I wrote the old hymns on the walls, I carved the constellations into her flesh and prayed that they were watching. It didn’t even really dawn on me to take her wallet until I had already hidden her under the floorboards.

I killed thrice more before I started to feel their eyes on me. So this was the way to their attention, I thought. But I had to be careful. If I was caught, they would leave me again. Their presence was as awe-inspiring as it was frightening. You’ve never known terror untill the abyss stares into you. It’s something itchy beneath your bones, something you’ll never be able to place. 

I was careful and methodical. Tried not to leave a pattern to the disappearances. Sometimes, people go missing. I would speak through the vacuum in my dreams as my tongue boiled, beg them to share their knowledge with me, just for a moment. Beg to be lifted up past the abyss, beg to stare into the eyes of the universe. But I knew the old gods were thirsty. They needed more. They needed blood. 

And who was I to question why? The gods could have crushed us all in a moment. Yet, they enjoyed watching us ants, little specks of dust, slaughter each other on their behalf. Perhaps it was simply entertainment, perhaps it served a greater purpose. I did not care. I simply wished to understand the way that humans could not. That is the fundamental truth. Without their help, we are purposeless. Blind mice lumbering around in an endless maze. 

It seemed that no matter how hard I looked, no one wanted to share in my glorious purpose. I had awakened something more than myself: the desires of the ancients, a craving for blood I was more than happy to satisfy. What are the lives of a few ants in the scheme of things? An already crowded, dying Earth. Their lives were meaningless. I gave them meaning. Anything to get me closer to the truth. 

I was sure the old ones could give me the truth, sure of that more than anything. I barely slept anymore. I didn’t need it. Something beyond that was fueling me, a combination of fear and adrenaline that never seemed to run out. Perhaps it was something more than that, but what it was I couldn’t place for certain. 

They were almost ready. I could feel it. Soon, I would finally find out what I had been longing for all these years, longing for all my life. Soon, the void would be full, and I could finally be complete. 

As the notches stacked up on the handle of my blade, so did the very air I breathed. I no longer needed to sleep or blink, eat or drink. Many times I found myself forgetting to breathe for hours at a time. A gift, from the old ones, so that I could accomplish my work. 

I also noticed some changes happening to my body. My hair was rapidly thinning, my eyes started to take on a peculiar tint, and they swelled in size to the point of practically popping out of my head. My nails looked more like claws, thicker and sharper than nails should be. More gifts. I didn’t need to worry about my human form. It was redundant at this point, only useful for getting sacrifices and furthering my goal. I didn’t draw anymore. I didn’t need to. I saw everything I needed in my head.

At some point, I lost track of the bodies building up in my spare bedroom. At some point i’d given up hiding them, no one would enter anyway. But I knew my work was finally done. I walked out into my front yard, blood staining me as I awaited for the heavens to embrace me, for the old ones to lift me up into their divine light. I could feel the buzzing of the infinite void in my skull. 

Yet, as I waited for my prize, nothing came. Was this some sort of cruel joke? Surely they appreciated what I did for them? The eyes bored into me more than ever. Now they were taunting me. They had what I did not, what I wanted more than anything. I covered my face with my hands only for my nails to make deep gashes into my forehead. I hardly felt it. 

The buzzing turned mocking, deep in the back of my head. I wanted it out. Behind my eyes the heavens howled with condescension. They were mocking me. They were taunting me. They were keeping secrets. 

I pushed my nails smoothly around my eye, and in one quick pull it disconnected from the socket. I stared at it. It looked wrong. Inhuman. I crushed it in my fist. It was filled with a dark liquid I couldn’t identify that burned my skin. I could hear my neighbor screaming in the distance. It felt so far away now. Surely this was the way to their favor? To give up my mortal form?

My other eye went as easily as the first. My nails harder, but nothing I couldn’t handle. I grabbed a pair of pliers to accomplish my next task. Tooth by aching tooth I felt myself grow closer to the infinite cosmos above my head. The humming increased. They were no longer laughing, they were cheering. Cheering for me. 

Fifty-seven teeth lay on the floor. My mouth dripped shades of green and black and crimson. The world around me seemed ephemeral, as if it was fading before my very eyes. I heard sirens, but everything was faint. Translucent. Nothing but the loud humming in my ears. One more thing. One more thing, and you will be free. 

I knew what I was to do last. I took my still-bleeding fingers and shoved them through the hollow bones in my chest to grasp my beating heart and bare it in the cold vacuum of the void. 

It was a chill beneath absolute zero. There was no sound, and the face of a true god finally greets me. It is a stage beyond fear as the deer stares into the face of the abyss. It was beautiful. It was the worst thing I will ever see. If my mind had not left me already, it would have here. 

It reached out its billions of hands and reached into whatever was left of me. As I floated motionless, my blood tasted the stars. They felt like death. They burned in reverse. 

What I saw next is impossible for me to put in words, impossible for me to remember. Constellations of ashes and the spirals of the infinite. Infinite worlds before this one, trillions upon trillions of apocalypses. Unending. Ephemeral. Eternal. The gods let me taste of the universe and then they took it away.

I was put back exactly where I left, in a body I thought I had abandoned. A puny, emaciated thing that was disgustingly human. I still had sight. I gave the police some excuse about the strange teeth and inhuman blood. An august halloween. They’re coming back with a warrant. I will not be here to see it. I can feel the old ones even still, in my head. I know they are getting restless. They are getting bored of sleeping. I think soon, they will wake up. I think when that happens we will not have a planet anymore. 

I do not think there is a hell. I hope that once I die, I will be able to look at the faces of my gods. I hope I will be able to stare for eternity.
