  

It was a Tuesday evening in February 1996 when driving back through Bodmin Moor when I experienced the most traumatic evening in my life. This is my account......

The sky was a somber grey and had smothered any moonlight as evening fell, along with any warmth. I could feel the chill in my bones as I paced briskly with my hands tucked firmly in my pockets. Breaking down on a back-road to the arse end of nowhere was not how I planned my evening. 

I turned one last time before disappearing around a bend to see the orange hazards blinking back at me in the knowledge that Diane was at least in some comfort waiting for me to return with help. 

I’d left the heater on for her but it wouldn’t be long before that diminished or a flat battery.

Thee tall silhouette of trees either side of the road peered down at me like angry gods in the dark.

It was only my fifth date with Diane. But it was everything I hoped it would be. I just hoped this inconvenience had not altered her opinion of me. 

I’d walked a good two miles now and the cold had made camp on my face. It was eerily quite as well with just the nocturnal noises of wildlife bellowing around the woods either side of me. I picked up the pace and I could feel my lungs burning with each quick but long stride I took.

I then came to a crest and sprinted to the top like it was the top of a mountain but as I reached the summit my hopes were crushed. I stopped to get my breath and rest my hands on knees as I peered into the void. 

There no lights anywhere on the horizon and as far as I could make out it was another three miles of back-road to god knows where. 

I yelled in anger at the top of my lungs and my voice echoed around the woods. 

“I hope Diane is not too cold” were my thoughts now. 

Two hours ago we were sat by an open fire in a village pub sipping wine and whispering conversations that gave me butterflies, like young love does. 

And now here I was running in the dark with no clue where I was heading. 

I needed a phone. I needed some warmth. But most of all I just wanted this evening to be over. 

I checked my watch. 11.55pm Maybe I thought, I could just return to the car and wait till morning. At least I’d have some company. I turned around and peered back but there was no sign of the blinkers. I knew I’d gone too far now but somehow looking back made me feel some sense of comfort. 

I carried on, muttering to myself about how stupid I felt about breaking down, playing each moment minute by minute and wondering if I missed a sound, a mechanical sound, something I ignored. And to make things worse I had no tools in the car. 

“You idiot Carl”

I tried to keep a brisk pace but my lungs had other ideas and my nose was leaking halfway down my face from the cold. 

It was then I heard a familiar noise behind me. I turned to see headlights flickering on the horizon and my hopes were suddenly raised to the point I’d forgotten how cold I actually felt. 

I positioned myself as far into the road as I dare in the hope of getting their attention and waved my extended arm. 

The car slowed much to my relief and pulled alongside. A man in a dark coloured BMW drew down his window and smiled at me. 

“You look like you need a lift lad,” he said. 

I nodded quickly. “You’re a life saver, thanks” I smiled back. 

“Hop in then,” he said.

He was a middle aged man I guessed about mid-forties with graying hair, clean shaven with a corporate look about him, certainly he was well tailored in a dark suit. Maybe he’s a salesman I thought, he certainly looked the type.

I nestled into the black leather seat and immediately felt the warm air surround me like a well needed blanket. I then thought about Diane, alone in my car with the temperature dropping with each minute I delayed in getting help. I wanted him to hurry up and drive of but he was hell bent on engaging in conversation at the side of the road. 

“Thanks for stopping it’s been a bit of a nightmare tonight.” I explained moving my hands toward the heater.

“Is that your Ford escort I passed a few miles back?” He asked, pointing behind him.

I nodded. “Yes, damn thing broke down on me, couldn’t have been the main road, oh no that would be too convenient.” I grinned.

“Breaking down is never convenient in my book.”

I turned to the driver and asked. “Did you happen to see my girlfriend in the car as you drove past?” I asked, anxious for a reply.

“There was someone in the passenger seat, yes.”

I felt a small sense of relief. 

The driver extended a hand. “I’m Victor, Victor Mace.” I remembered him saying. 

I shook his hand. It was a damn sight warmer than mine. 

Victor turned to me, his arm resting on the wheel. “You’re lucky I took the shortcut tonight, usually stick to main road but I’m late tonight and figured this road would kill off a good seven miles.”

I nodded with a smile but inside I was yelling “Go. I haven’t got all night” But how can I be rude to the one person who might actually save me tonight and quite possibly save my relationship. I looked at my watch as a subtle cue as to my urgency. But unfortunately it went unnoticed. 

“So how come you’re out this late on a road like this?” He asked me. 

More chit chat I didn’t need. 

I cleared my throat and felt my hands rubbing the tops of my jeans in anxiety, willing the car to go. “Oh we went to the village pub just off the B road and I took a wrong turning but figured if I carry on it will eventually meet up with the main road.” I told him. 

Victor shook his head at me.“No it wont.” He replied. 

“Oh so where does this road go then.?” I asked, but inside I didn’t give a shit if it went to Timbuktu as long as I get to a house or a farm to call for help.  

“Over the moors.” He replied. “You looking for a phone then lad?”

“Yes, yes I am so I can call someone out.” I pointed straight ahead. “So if you just drive until we find a house or a garage I’d really appreciate it. I just don’t want to leave my Girlfriend in the car too long.” I replied nervously. 

Victor set off. Much to my relief. 

“Iv’e a phone at home you can use if you like, it’s about twenty minutes drive. I can also offer you a hot drink and return you to your car.” He said.

“Thanks, If it’s not too much trouble that’s very kind,” I replied, and now we were making headway I felt some obligation to make conversation. “So what keeps you out this late on a Tuesday evening?” I asked.

Victor turned to me. “Work. Just work.”

“Ah okay, what is it you do?” I asked curiously.

Victor hooked eyes with me before returning them to the road. Still bleak and without light. 

“You warm enough lad?” He asked, ignoring my last question. “I can turn up the heat some more if you like.”

“Thanks but I’m okay now.” I replied. 

I tried again at making conversation. At the end of the day here I was in the middle of nowhere in a car with a total stranger and found myself fidgeting in the chair mainly out of some sense of anxiety. 

“I had you down as a salesman. Think it’s the suit. I’m a freelance photographer so casual is my go to attire,” I joked.

Victor said nothing. He just looked across at me and then returned his attention to the road.

I felt my left hand caressing the leather bolster and my eyes searching the door for the latch. My brain was trying to calculate the chances of surviving a fall at this speed if I were to open the door for a quick getaway. I was beginning to feel the full weight of what real paranoia felt like and I didn’t like the taste. I looked down to my right to where my seat belt was anchored. How quickly could I disconnect the seat belt, open the door and roll out. I’ve seen it a million times in the movies but it seemed a thousand times scarier in real life. 

“Stop being silly.” I told myself. He’s obviously just a private person. 

But somehow I found myself asking more questions. 

“Will your family be up at this hour?”

Victor turned to me again. “I don’t have a family, I live alone. Much prefer it that way lad.” He replied. 

I decided to withdraw from any further questions and settled into the seat with my thoughts again turning to Diane alone in the car. It had been an hour now and I was anxious to return to her as soon as possible.

But then my eyes fell on his keys swinging from the ignition barrel. I hadn’t noticed it before. A small photo key ring and a blue unicorn toy. It was a strange thing to have for a man with no family. My curiosity was now like a naughty child seeking attention and difficult to ignore. So to that end I had to make an excuse to use the interior light. 

“Do you mind if I switch the light on for a second I think I may have got oil on my best shirt when I was trying to fix the car. My girlfriend will freak,” I laughed lying through my teeth.

“Sure.” He replied coldly with no reciprocal or jovial comment. 

I flicked the interior light on for a moment pretending to check my shirt tails, but my eyes were firmly fixed on the swinging key chain with the unicorn toy. I only had a small window of opportunity where the interior light and the angle of the photo key ring were aligned to the point where I see it clearly. 

It was the head-shot of a middle aged couple on a tropical beach somewhere and between them stood a young girl of about three or four. But then as the key ring swung around to the momentum of the car I grabbed a glimpse of the writing on the back.

“Jacksons Bar Barbados.” 

My eyes were then drawn to something in my footwell which I hadn’t noticed in the dark. A white envelope with an address that was not even in the same county. Even more un-nerving was the name on the envelope. Mr & Mrs Reynolds.

Something felt very wrong.

I couldn’t help myself but ask an obvious question. “You traveled much?” I then followed it up with another lie. “I get to travel to some nice places in my work. The Caribbean is just incredible, you ever been?” 

Victor left his eyes on the road and replied “Nope”

I had a gut feeling and an urgency to probe some more. “You have any children? I’d like kids one day.” I said nervously.

“Nope.” Victor replied.

By now my gut feeling had transcended to a full on fear. I could feel my heart beating in my throat and could not shake the feeling that this somehow was not his car. My thoughts turned once more to jumping out and my paranoia played tricks on me.

Victor then slowed the car and turned into a narrow drive off the back road. It was a small red brick bungalow surrounded by an abundance of overgrown shrubs and bushes. 

An exterior light flicked on and bathed the front in a yellow tinge. This was not a well kept property. The large front windows were obscured with sheets of newspaper stuck to the inside. Faded and yellowed. 

Victor undid his seat belt. “Wait here lad I just need to sort something before you come in.”

Victor rolled out the car and made his way to the front door.

I didn’t like this at all. My whole body screamed “get the fuck out of here.”

But out of fight, flight or freeze my body was firmly logged in freeze. But then I turned to the back seat and saw the one thing that convinced me this was definitely not his car. A baby seat. 

I didn’t even want to try and imagine why he had this car. All I knew now was that I couldn’t step one foot in that place for fear it would be my last.

I glanced across and saw the keys still in the ignition. Adrenalin hit me like a junkies fix. If I don’t make a move now I never will.

I shot a look to the front door still ajar and leapt across to the drivers seat, my hands trembling as I fumbled the keys.

I started the engine and hit reverse spinning off into the middle of the road before slamming it into first. I laughed hard but it was a nervous laugh and nothing remotely humorous about the situation I had just avoided. My hands were shaking hard and the Adrenalin had sent me into a state of shock. I headed back as fast as I dare back toward Diane. By now the winter sky gave way to sleet which danced in the headlights like sparkly diamonds. 

My eyes fixed on the rear view mirror expecting a set of lights to give chase. But why would they, there was no other vehicle on the drive. I thumped the wheel. “Fuck you.” I yelled with tears falling down my face. I had a plan. Pick up Diane, go home and in the morning I would visit the police station. But as my mind circled with a thousand thoughts, the car suddenly jerked to the right and I fought the steering, narrowly missing the thick hedgerow at the side of the road. “Shit”

I sprung out the drivers seat and gazed in frustration at the flat tyre. “Fuck” I yelled again. 

I figured I was only two or three miles away from Victor. I had a choice. Limp back to my car with the flat or change it here. 

I figured I’d take my chances and fix it here. That way me and Diane could just head straight home. I pulled the keys from the ignition and popped the boot for the spare.

It was then my whole world came crashing down around me. All this time I was only a few feet away from pure evil. There in the boot lay the body of Diane with her throat cut, her glazed eyes staring straight at me.

It was the worst night of my life.
