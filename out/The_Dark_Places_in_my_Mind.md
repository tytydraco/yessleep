Every time it happens, it starts with darkness. Then, the red. A dim, cruel red glow that grows and grows and then envelopes me.

Then, flashes of *something* play before me.

*I stand before a congregation of masked men.*

*Where am I? And why is everything drenched in that dim red glow?*

*Im at a ceremony, one in the bowels of that church. How do I know this place? What even is “I”?*

*With a final motion from the crowd, my surroundings explode into dust and shadow, and I watch as the earth opens.*

*A staircase spirals into the depths of the pit.*

*And at the bottom?*

*Darkness, pain. Something spinning, tearing. Something sticky, cold, and squirming.*

*And I slip into its terrible embrace.*

I awoke with a gasp, shooting bolt upright in my bed. There was that dream again. Like clockwork, It came on the sixth of every month, waking me at exactly 6:06 AM. Always about that ceremony. Always in the Old Church. I don't know what, but something must have happened there, and for whatever  reason, I can't remember it.

It had been six months since those dreams started. Six months of wondering, of strange questions, and…

Gosh, I didn't even want to think about it. I begged him not to go, but the very thing that kept me out is what drew him in.
I had seen that symbol before. I knew that I had, since it made my skin crawl, though I had no idea why, since it seemed innocent enough. But either way, it repulsed me. My friend, Jacob, knew he had seen it somewhere, too, but was fascinated by it. He was determined  to go on that “spiritual awakening” trip, with or without me, and I sure as hell wasn't going. Sounded more like cult initiation to me. It was only supposed to be a month long. Now, I haven't seen him in six.

But what happened last month was the boulder that broke the camel's back. And now, I had to act.

Listening now, I could hear the pounding of rain on the roof, periodic thunder breaking the rhythmic noise. Of course it would be raining tonight, but ultimately, I did not care, for I had made up my mind. I had to investigate that  Old Church, had to find something, anything that might explain the strange things happening recently. Slipping on my raincoat, I stepped out into the storm.



I had been walking through the darkened, sprawling streets of my town for… well, I don't know for how long. The darkness and rain blurred my surroundings, made the familiar streets of my town seem unfamiliar, almost alien, and I had wandered for longer than I had hoped. But suddenly, I stopped. Peering through the pouring rain, I found myself standing before a tall, dark silhouette that towered above me. Thunder rumbled from above, and the flash of lightning that accompanied it briefly revealed what I stood in front of. The old church, right where I wanted to be. 

The mere sight of the Old Church sent a chill down my spine, though I knew not why. This place, set right between the dark, ancient forest and the deep, churning ocean, had always creeped me out. But there was that strange feeling again, something rising in my mind, shifting, like I had old, buried memories of this place that were being provoked by the sight of it. It was like I could almost remember something, some strange past. Almost.

I was surprised when the door swung open with a light push. I had expected it to be locked, or for some kind of security, but as I stepped inside, I was alone.

It was dark, and rain pounded on the shingles of the roof. The wind blew outside, and the old wooden frame creaked and groaned under the force of it. The only light for me to see by was the periodic flashes of lightning that filtered through the stained windows, briefly rendering the interior in flashes of strange colors that cast odd, shifting shadows into the dark corners of the eerie space.

I was searching for something, anything that would confirm my suspicions. One of those masks, that symbol somewhere, a note, even. Turning on my flashlight, a beam of light cut through the unfamiliar darkness. I had stopped coming here ever since I found something around a month ago, and even though I had walked through this place countless times before that, it now looked alien. Threatening.

Sweeping the beam of light around, I saw nothing out of place. A thin layer of dust coated the rows of pews, a wooden cross hung on the wall behind the pulpit, and the majestic arched, vaulted ceiling hid shadows that no light ever seemed to be able to dissipate. To be honest, I didn't know what good could possibly come of this If I found anything. Perhaps, in this case, ignorance is bliss.

You see, there would be no one for me to talk to. Nowhere for me to go, even. Not in my town. It was a small sprawl of old, weather-beaten wood and brick buildings located somewhere on the coast of the pacific. Nestled between low, rolling hills covered in ancient forest, and the dark churning ocean lies a rat’s nest of roads that had no thought or organisation put into its layout at all. There are no city style blocks, no main street, no road names. This town doesn't even have a name, the residents here just call it “The Town”.

Rickety, half-rotten but still somehow sturdy docks stretch a short way into the water, but nothing extends into the forest. The people here still hold on to superstition. Still live like they did I'm the old times, dismissing science and rationality in favor of the old tales that had been told by the founders of this place.

So, an isolated fishing village, right? I wouldn't blame you for thinking that. But this town is stranger than that. Most people here work at the Factory. Overlooking the town on  a hill there lies a tall, brick building with towering smokestacks that never seemed to spew any smoke. I have no idea what is produced there, but whatever it is, it’s got to be important. It’s important enough for someone outside this place to fly a helicopter out here every week to pick up a large crate of whatever is made here in exchange for a week's worth of supplies, and a few new toys. That drop off is why I've got the computer I'm writing this on. We use satellite wifi, though.

I came back to myself as I turned the flashlight beam to the tiled floor. Muddy footsteps had been tracked across it, blocking part of what I had seen from view. But even partially obstructed, it made my skin crawl. A horrible feeling of my skin squirming and writhing, seemingly independent of the rest of my body that almost hid the sensation of something old and rotten clawing it's way up from the deep places of my mind-

*Where am I? It's dark here. Cold.*

*A light grows from the darkness beneath. One that's cruel, red, dim.*

*It envelopes me, and flashes of… something play before my eyes, all drenched in that horrible dim red.*

*I struggle. Masked people carry me somewhere.*

*Inside that church, the ground tears open.*

*A staircase spirals down.*

*Descending…*

*A labyrinth of blood drenched stone.*

*Descending…*

*An altar. Something red, sticky, disgusting squirms atop it.*

*Descending…*

*A knife. Blood.*

*Descending…*

I woke in a panic, scrambling away from something, before I stopped. What had just happened to me? Were those… memories? Whatever happened, I didn't want to think about it. I was safe right now. Alone.

But I didn't really believe that, did I?

Turning my flashlight down to the spot I had just laid unconscious on, I could see what had sent me into that strange state.

There, on the floor was that same, strange, symbol. Right at the point where the post and the crossbeam met in a decorative cross pattern in the tiled floor, was an out of place circular tile. Carved into it, unmistakably, was an eye, set in the center of a seven-toothed gear. Six oddly twisting lines extended from the eye in the center.

Looking upon that symbol again brought back yet more memories. 

Memories

I was growing to hate that term. But now I thought of why I had come here to investigate. What happened last month that weighed on my mind until I finally came here.

Understand that moving out of your childhood home was rare here. That didn't happen unless a relative died and left their house to you, or you were wealthy enough to get someone to build one for you. So, needless to say, It had been an undeniable miracle that I had found someone willing to rent out their basement as an apartment in this town. It was cramped, almost windowless, and dim, but I took it.

You see, I hated living with my parents. Hell, I hated living in this town, but my parents just embodied every part of this place that I hated. Made those aspects worse, and being away from them made it bearable. I was just finishing the move into my new place when I came across that old photo album. I opened it expecting memories and nostalgia, but now? I wish I hadn't opened that cursed book.

At first, it seemed normal, Page after page of childhood photos. Some brought back a fond memory, and others a cringe. But the first pictures of the first page gave me pause.

Six images, each labeled in the corner with that same, strange symbol, drawn by hand in red marker. Each image sent a chill of dread down my spine that I didn't understand at the time. Looking at them, the images were certainly strange, but why did I feel so weird about it? Why did I feel connected to them? It felt like something old , dead, and rotting was rising from the depths of my mind. Something that should stay forgotten.

The first image was of my older sister as a newborn infant. And at the bottom of the image, it was annotated with a single word. 

“Insufficient.”

The second was of my parents, holding my infant sister, seemingly standing in front of an abandoned, empty gravel lot, located right between the ocean and the forest. Three tall, distinctive evergreens stood in the rear.

The third image was of a circle of strange men and women. Each one wore casual clothing, but a strange mask covered each of their faces, and they had interlocked their hands.

The fourth showed the Old Church, those same three tall evergreens visible in the background. This one was timestamped only a day after the second image. Though painted on the brick and wood were the words

“To ascend to him above, we must do his work in the depths.”

The fifth depicted those same masked men and women, but this time they were each within the familiar surroundings of the Old Church’s interior. Each one held a posture of praise, knelt down with hands raised. What stood at the front was not within frame. Thinking back on it now, the scene bore an uncanny resemblance to that first part of my recurring dream.

The sixth image filled me with a kind of dread that I had never once felt before, though I expect to feel again. It was so familiar to me, yet with one change that made my hands shake so bad I nearly dropped the photo album.

It was an old, yellowed photo of me, and wiping away the thin layer of dust that had settled atop it, I could read the single word scrawled across the top of the image in messy, rushed  handwriting.

“Sufficient.”

Looking at that symbol again, I once more felt... something. an old memory that I could just about recall, deep within the dark depths of my mind where old memories are forgotten, and left to rot, something dead and rotten rose, but stayed hidden. Those memory flashes I had… were they the first part of this thing making itself known?

The dark interior of the church now felt more mysterious than before. More dangerous than before. But I doubted that anywhere else would be more than a little better. Getting up from my position close to the floor, I moved for the exit, but didn't make it far before I stopped. Was that breathing I could hear behind me?

I turned around, the sound of creaking and groaning floorboards audible above the pounding rain for a moment, and looked deep within the odd, unnatural shadows that now surrounded me. Nothing. A loud, rumbling boom filled the air, and a flash of light illuminated those dark corners. And for a split second, I could see the dark, empty eyes of familiar masks staring back at me.

I swear that as I turned to leave, I could see them rise in unison for some unknown collective purpose, but I didn't stay for that. So, stepping through the door, I left the Old Church once more, hoping to leave those memories behind.



Walking out, I tried to avoid looking at the old graveyard next to the church. I swear that place was evil, and only evil ever came of it. It was the only place in town that extended any distance into the ancient, twisted snarl of unnatural trees that beset the town from the east, And yet, despite my hatred of the place, I found my eyes drawn to it. And there, in that horrible field of worn stone and the dead, stood a crowd of the living. They all gazed upwards, into the unremarkable sky. Covering my eyes from the rain, I followed their gaze to find… nothing.

Or was there something there? I swear, thinking back, that there was something up in those clouds. Something the color of a dim, cruel red…

When I got home, the door swung wildly in the wind. Slamming open and shut, I found that the frame had been shattered around the latch and locks. Concerned, but also relieved to have some distraction, I entered to find my cramped basement apartment destroyed. Ransacked. Stuff thrown everywhere, glass shattered on the floor crunched under my rain boots as I looked around. It didn't take long for me to find the trail of blood leading deeper in.

In the next room, I found him. My mouth went dry and I lost any words I might have had to say to him. This was something I had fantasized about, hoped for even but… no. Not like this.

My childhood friend, sitting against the wall where he seemingly dragged himself through the glass covered floor. Blood dripped from cuts along his arms and head, as he just sat there, eyes closed, shaking.

“Jacob…?”

His legs… oh god, his legs below the knee, why were they like that? The muscle and bone was replaced with hydraulics and metal and gears…

“You… came… back…”

He spoke between heavy breaths, like he couldn't get enough air.

“Do you… remember?”

I dared not speak to him. No, to it.

“The stairs under… the Old Church… Do you remember…?

“Please… stop… don't talk about… that.”

“They led us down… so far down… through the blood… drenched… earth…”

I whimpered.

“They put me on the altar… and gave you the knife… and you… you killed me, Arthur… look…”

He lifted his shirt  to show me the scars. So many scars… stab after stab after stab…

And Jacob began laughing. He sounded crazy, he was crazy, and yet…

“They threw me in that dark pit… pushed you in after… but I'm dead, Arthur… remember? 

He burst out laughing now.

“Dead, dead, dead, dead… but the machines, the machines… they keep me… alive…”

I looked at him. More closely now, and something was… off… Why did he look almost like a zombie? Rotten, dead, old…

Forgotten.

“What was… what was down there Arthur… I know you saw it… But I couldn't… tell me Arthur… what was down there…?”

I left him babbling insane nonsense behind me. He was crazy. He IS crazy… right?

“He's crazy… no he is crazy…”

I spoke it aloud as if to convince myself, but it was hollow. Empty.

Because I did remember.

Getting my memories of that accursed place back wasn't like a dam breaking. It wasn't like a flood, wasn't overwhelming at all. I can't even point to a single moment where I remembered, only that it was when Jacob was talking. I just remembered.

I remembered the ground opening in the Old Church. The pit underneath, and the staircase spiraling down. I remembered descending… descending…

I remembered the blood drenched pipes and cogs, pistons, belts, and engines that jutted from the walls of that underground place.that shuddered and turned, gosh, they were so loud… That old room, the altar, and…

I remembered killing Jacob, oh god, I actually did it… why would I do that? I wouldn't do that, would I…?

After that, I remember being thrown into that pit… I remember falling, down, further and further into the dark, pinpricks of light around me like old, broken stars in a dying universe… further down and down…

Did I ever come out?

That's the one thing that I don't remember… I don't remember coming out…

I went back to that church. I did it, and I looked. Over and over and over, I swear that symbol in that cross pattern was gone, but just as I was about to leave, I found it, oh god why did I have to find that again? Why? Why? Why?

The tile, the one with the symbol? It twisted. I hated it, oh how I hated touching that symbol, but it turned, and the ground opened just like my dream… there was the pit, the staircase, those lights emitting that dim red, the darkness… it was all the freaking same, the same as my dream… my memory…

I'm going down there, I… I have to. I have to know because, well, memories aren't always accurate, right? I have to go down and I have to hope that it's just nothing… 

But if my memory is right, or if something worse is down there… I just don't want to be forgotten. Please, remember me… just don't forget me, please…

There's just one question weighing on my mind… one question that hasn't been answered…

What am I “Sufficient” for?

I'll update if I come back.
