The sounds of the city at night were comforting to me. I’d come to feel soothed by the screeching of alleycats, the shouting of drunkards, and the occasional gunshot. I felt at home with all the chaos, so I had no issue going for nightly jogs while the city slept. I was faster than the bums that would occasionally try and trip me to snatch my phone or purse, so I didn’t have much to worry about. 

One night, I had finished a long run in the park, working up quite a sweat and draining the last of my energy. At some ungodly hour, I made my way back home. I passed dirty, empty streets, overturned trashcans, and homeless people sleeping on sheets of cardboard. 

There was a nasty part of town I had to make my way through to get to my apartment complex, and I’d wandered into the heart of it. I had my trusty taser at the ready, tucked away in the drawstring of my sweatpants. Sometimes, the sleeping people on the street would stir, and I would dash across the street, zigging and zagging away from any potential harm. 

I was close to making it out of the slums when I passed a long, dark alleyway. Some sound drifted from deep within the darkness, stopping me in my tracks. It was sobbing, a quiet, pained wail that sounded like it came from a young child. I heard the sniffling and whining of what must have been a very young boy. Looking down the alleyway, the darkness looked impenetrable. 

I didn’t want to step foot into it. It looked so thick that I might drown in it before I realized what had happened. But their cries grew louder. It must have awakened some kind of maternal instinct I never knew I had. With a deep inhale, I readied my taser, firing it up and watching the electricity form its wicked arc, and forced myself into the alley.

The smell was unbearable. It was a mixture of burning trash and human waste that burned my nose as soon as it wafted to me. I stifled a gag and breathed through my mouth. After a few yards, I could almost make out something huddled in a ball at the end of the alley. 

The crying was softer. A muttering accompanied the crying, some words in a child’s voice that I couldn’t make out. I thought I heard “help” and “mom,” but I could have easily imagined it. I stepped in something that squished under my running shoes, nearly sending me tumbling to the ground. I righted myself and moved forward a bit more carefully.

“Hey, kid, are you alright? Where are your parents?” I asked whoever tucked themselves against the wall in front of me. I still could make out their form.

“A-Are you gonna hurt me too?” The childish voice asked, cracking with emotion. They still faced the wall.

“No! C’mon, I can get you some help.” I took out my phone to illuminate the alley with my flashlight. It was nearly dead. I didn’t want to waste the battery, but I couldn’t make out anything that deep in it. While I fumbled with my phone, the person spoke up.

“Thank you, Miss. If only the world were filled with more kind people like you!” they called out enthusiastically.

“Sure, kid.” I got the flashlight on and pointed it at the spot where I heard the voice. The light panned up and illuminated a pale, shirtless man, curling his thin, pasty body into a ball. When the light hit him, he faced me.

The skin on his face sagged; it was loose like it had been lazily draped over the muscle. It peeled in parts. One eye was missing. The socket was completely empty. He smiled at me with about a dozen extra teeth jutting out of his gums at disgusting angles. 

“You’ll help me, miss? You’ll save me?” He asked, the voice of an elementary school boy coming from the mouth of a full-grown nightmare. 

There are two major reactions to danger: fight or flight. I could either pounce on him and claw, bite, tear, or whatever I could manage to be the last one left standing. The other option would be to turn tail and sprint off, never looking back. But, unfortunately, I’d always had the worst reaction. I froze. 

My phone fell to the floor, the flashlight aimed straight up, casting a ghoulish shadow on the man’s face.

“I don’t have a name, miss. This body had a name, but I can’t use it anymore.” The man crawled up to me on all fours. He looked up at me, inspecting my body like a piece of meat.

“You’re beautiful, miss. You’ll help me, right? You said you would.” He grabbed my ankle, wrapping long, slender fingers around it and squeezing. I hadn’t taken a breath in over thirty seconds. At his touch, I gasped for air, regaining some of my faculties. 

The taser was still in my left hand. I turned it on, the arc of electricity sending a loud buzz that crackled through the air. The man saw the taser turn on, and before I could thrust it at him, he grabbed my other ankle and yanked it, pulling my feet out from under me and sending me tumbling to the ground. I let out a quick yelp before my back collided with the cement, sending shooting pain up my spine. 

“I thought you were gonna help me.” The man crawled up my body, past my legs, up to my chest, until he pinned me to the ground, his face inches from mine. I could smell his breath. It was worse than the stench of the alley. His one eye fixed on me with a pained stare.

“Help!” I finally managed to scream, “Help me! Someone help!” I thrashed around, but he had me pinned tight.

“It’s okay.” The man assured me. From that distance, I could make out every wrinkle, every blemish on his disfigured face.

“Someone, please!” I begged. My screams echoed through the alley, but the city was indifferent. He crawled further up my body, pinning my arms with his knees. 

With his free hands, he grabbed my mouth and forced it open. My screams turned into gargles. I couldn’t form words with his hand in my mouth.

“Hold still. It’ll only take a second.” The man bent down over me; his mouth was about a foot above mine. I kicked and struggled pointlessly. The taser in my left hand was still on, casting a blue glow over the man’s body. He started to make retching noises, his body shuddering and heaving. I saw something peeking out of his throat, a slippery black mass covered in tendrils that pulled it forward and into his mouth. 

I felt my stomach turn. The waves of nausea hit me. The stench, the sight of it, it all made me feel sick. I hated feeling helpless more than anything, and watching that thing crawl from his mouth and near mine made me feel doomed. The black thing dangled out of his mouth and extended a tendril toward mine. I tried to shake my head and clamp down my jaws, but I failed. 

The tendril touched my tongue. It felt warm and slippery. More of the tendrils snaked down into my throat. The black mass plopped into my mouth and crawled its way into my body. My whole body heaved, forcibly rejecting the invader, but I couldn’t do anything to keep it out and away. 

I felt it wriggle down my throat and into my body. The man on top of me went completely limp. He collapsed over me, smothering me with his weight. I threw him off me and writhed on the ground as the black mass made itself at home inside of me. 

I could feel it extending to every part of my body—making itself part of my nervous system and weaving into my muscles. After half an hour of my body reconstructing itself around that thing, I stopped feeling it move and squirm inside of me. 

I regurgitated everything in my stomach in the process. I lay empty on the ground next to the husk of the man who had put that thing inside of me. I couldn’t do anything but cry or shiver in disgust for a while. I had to get to a hospital or something, but my legs wouldn’t obey me. It stirred inside me.

“Leave.” The voice came from inside me. It sounded perfectly clear but projected directly into my mind. My head was bombarded with a series of images—me leaving the scene, walking down the road, and returning home. I clutched my head. Sharing headspace felt disorienting.

“Get out of me!” I shouted into the empty alleyway. “What are you?!” I was still standing over the disfigured corpse of the man from earlier. It seemed like whatever climbed into me was keeping him alive.

“Leave.” It told me. I felt its emotions. It seemed frustrated and impatient. My vision took on a red tint.

“How can I get my body back? Please!” I begged. Sunrise would be soon. I’d need to get out as soon as possible.

“Leave.” The thing in my head had no voice. It projected ideas and feelings into me rather than saying anything directly. I could feel it nearly snapping. I wasn’t going to let myself be ordered around that easily.

“Answer me!” I demanded. As soon as the words left my mouth, I felt my heart seize, my stomach cramped, my lungs collapsed, and my liver sent waves of pain into my brain. I collapsed to the floor, bashing my knees and screaming in agony while cradling myself. The pain stopped as quickly as it started.

“Leave.” It ordered me again. The creature was punishing me. It had given me a taste of what would happen if I didn’t obey its commands. I hoisted myself to my feet and hurried off back home, leaving behind the malformed body to rot in the alley.

By the time I made it home, my body was feeling strange. I locked the door behind me and ran to the bathroom in case I needed to empty out my guts. Something was making me sick and weak. There was a hole inside of me—my body was failing. 

The invader was doing something to me. I took a look in the mirror and noticed that my body had already started to change. My skin had a yellowish tint, like I had a severe case of jaundice, and heavy bags weighed down my eyes. My arm started to itch. I pulled up my sleeve and found a patch of flesh becoming necrotic. Blackened and cracked skin spread and expanded fast enough that I could make it out. Dark veins spread over my forearm, snaking further up my body. I touched the decaying flesh, and it came off in small chunks. I recoiled in disgust, knocking over the items on my sink.

“What’s happening?! What are you doing to my body?!” I tried to get a response from the thing in my body. I wasn’t sure if I could communicate with it, but I was so repulsed by what was happening it tempted me to try and cut off all of the infected parts myself, even knowing it would do more harm than good. I tried to disinfect it, grabbed some bandages from my drawer, and wrapped the decaying flesh. My mouth twitched against my will, and I started speaking in a voice that wasn’t mine.

“We’re already rotting.” The creature said with my mouth. Watching something else talk through me in the mirror was surreal. “Your body doesn’t like me. Find new parts, or we will die.” The tone it used was the same as the man who’d attacked me. I fought for control of my mouth and lost. 

“Find parts, or I will take your body until it decays.” The creature gave me my mouth back. It wasn’t breathing while it took over, so when I came back, I had to gasp for air.

“What do you mean find parts?” I asked. The creature projected a scene in my mind. I was watching a memory from someone else’s perspective. In the memory, they chased down a man in a park, tackling him into the bushes. 

They struggled for a while. I could see the hands like they were mine as they mounted the man and wrapped around his neck. The man resisted, trying to buck his hips and roll on his back, but the strength of the hands was too much for him. 

The hand squeezed tighter, throttling the man until his eyes lost their light and spittle dripped from his mouth. Once the person whose memories I watched was satisfied, they pulled a jigsaw from their backpack. 

Experiencing the memories, I could feel the person’s emotions. They were desperate and terrified. Their sleeves had come up in the scuffle, and their flesh was rotting the same as mine, but it had progressed much further. Chunks of their arm were missing. The veins extended past their shoulder. The jigsaw whirred to life—the serrated blade pumping up and down in a blur. 

They took the blade to the man on the ground’s stomach. After some sloppy punctures and shaky handling, the blade made it through the flesh. They dragged the blade up, splitting the man’s torso open from his belly button to his chest. The open-cavity steamed as its warmth clashed with the chilly night. 

The person threw aside the jigsaw and plunged their hands into the man's body, fishing around deep past his stomach until they took hold of the organ they were looking for and pulled it loose after severing the connection with a pocket knife. 

One perfectly intact liver rested in their blood-soaked hands, still oozing warm liquid. I could feel the person’s absolute disgust. Their guilt was so profound that they wished they were dead, but their fear of the rot kept them from giving in. Black tendrils spilled from their mouth, wriggling towards the liver and wrapping around it. 

The tendrils pulled the liver into the person’s body, and the memory went dark. I came back to my senses. I could still feel my hands around someone’s neck and the sensation of ripping out an organ. I threw up in the toilet and collapsed to my knees, trembling. My arm itched worse than before. 

“I-I have to *take* people’s organs?” The thought of it repulsed me even more than the prospect of rotting.

“Find parts.” It demanded, straight to my head. 

“No! This is fucking crazy!” I protested. My heart seized like before, sending me back to the ground, clutching my chest. I groaned and convulsed, but it didn’t stop. 

The creature gave me another heart attack, then another, then a fourth, until I was left foaming at the mouth. My world had become pain. All I felt, all I could think about, was the agony I found myself in. I would do anything to make it stop. After ten minutes of consecutive heart attacks, they stopped, and I was left semi-conscious on the ground. 

“Find. Parts.” The creature projected the image of its last host looking in the mirror, his body ravaged by lesions and necrosis. 

“P-Please, no more,” I begged. “I’ll do it. I’m sorry.”

The creature was silent, satisfied by my cooperation. I stumbled to my room and put on a thick hoodie and pants to hide every bit of skin. There was one saving grace about my situation: I worked as a physician’s assistant at a hospital. I might be able to get ahold of donor organs. It was my only real option. I packed my withering body into the car and drove off, hoping to arrive while it was less busy.

Donor organs don’t keep long. The longest an organ can be kept is the kidney, which lasts for 24-36 hours. If a kidney happened to be on ice, that could slow the rot, at least temporarily. I pulled in and entered about three hours before my shift. I tried to pass the receptionist quietly, but she spotted me.

“Veronica! You’re early, what’s the occasion?” She asked. Her name was Julie, and she had been a long-time colleague. She knew me too well, and she might have known something was wrong.

“Doctor Wilkins asked me to come in to help prep for an operation he took over from someone else. I have to go. I’ll talk later.” I tried again to hurry off.

“Wait!” Julie called out. Her nosiness was about to get me killed.

“Are you alright? Your skin looks a bit discolored. Have you had a fever? Stomach pain?” 

“I’m fine. I really need to go.” I walked off, not looking back as she kept talking.

“Okay, just be cautious. We don’t need you getting sick!” She called after me, but I was already rounding the corner.

I hated this place. It was a reminder of my failure. I was settling as a PA. I wanted to be a pediatrician, but I dropped out of med school in the third year. I had to walk around and watch other people live out my dream. With the parasite inside me, I had never been more helpless. So why not ruminate on everything else? I needed to get my priorities in order. 

There were computer records of upcoming surgeries. If an operation was coming up, they might have an organ stored and ready for transplant. I would just have to slip in and grab it. Before I could make it to a computer, I ran into the person I’d been hoping to avoid most.

“Veronica? What’re you doing here? You’re not scheduled for another two hours.” Dr. Wilkins blocked my way to the computer. I thought about pushing past him. The creature in my body was losing patience again. I could feel it becoming more eager and hungry. 

“Hello, Dr. Wilkins. I’m just doing a favor for Kyle. He needed help going through some documents.” I avoided looking at the doctor. He didn’t seem to notice my skin. He never paid much attention to me.

“Look at you! Always the go-getter!” He clapped me on the shoulder. “You’re finally starting to fit in with the family here.” 

“Yeah.” I droned. “I need to get going,” I told the doctor.

“Sounds good. See you later.” The doctor walked away smiling. 

After that conversation, I felt nauseous for two reasons. Finally, I could get to the computer and check on the operations. After some clicking around, I found one kidney on ice in storage. 

The hospital scheduled the operation for four hours later. Without a second thought, I booked it for storage. The rot was spreading further. Some of the black veins were visible on my hands. After that conversation, I discovered that one kidney was, and some

The hall to the storage area was empty. I checked up and down, listening for footsteps, and once the coast was clear, I opened the door and slipped inside. The chill hit me immediately. Even with my outfit, I couldn’t help but shiver. I found the transport box with the organ inside. The creature inside me was elated. Its eagerness was infectious. I wanted to pop the box open and devour the kidney as soon as possible. Carefully, I pulled open the box, revealing the slimy, fleshy mass inside. 

My body vibrated in anticipation. I picked it up with my bare hands, bringing it to my face. Something slinked up my throat. A few slippery tendrils made their way from somewhere deep inside my body, past my throat, and out of my mouth. The tendrils caressed the organ before wrapping around it and lifting it toward my open gullet. It smelled like raw beef, as I expected. It barely fit in my mouth. It felt repulsive on my tongue, kind of like a massive raw oyster. The tendrils pulled the kidney through my throat, gagging me and resting somewhere deep into my body. 

There was an immediate sense of relief that washed over me. I pulled up my sleeve and unwrapped the bandages. The veins had retreated from my hand, and the area of rot receded as the flesh rebuilt itself, somehow invigorated after I consumed the kidney. I heard the door open behind me. Before I had time to react, my coworker Kyle stepped into the room. He looked from the open organ transplant box to my slimy mouth to the rot on my arm. Kyle froze, and the creature acted first. 

The black tendrils shot out of my mouth, dozens of them wrapped around Kyle and shut the door, pulling him toward me. I saw the panic in his face, the wide eyes and open mouth. I tried to shut my mouth and tug at the tendrils, but one of them thrust a mass into Kyle’s mouth right as he tried to scream. I could see the bulge in his throat as it climbed into his body. Kyle collapsed to the ground and convulsed. The tendrils retreated back inside my body.

“What did you do?!” I tried to keep quiet enough not to be heard, but it still came out as a scream. The creature didn’t answer. Kyle stood up in a trance. 

“Kyle, are you okay?” I shook him by the shoulders. He walked out the door without looking at me. I peeked out the door. Kyle made it out of the hall and into the reception area. He stood in the middle of the room for a moment before clutching his chest and groaning in pain.

“Help. Me.” He croaked out before collapsing face-first on the tile, completely still and silent. The receptionist called for help, and Kyle was rushed out on a stretcher, all while I watched in stunned silence, unable to do anything to save him. Before someone could discover me, I ran out of the storage room, down to the other end of the hall, and through the emergency exit.

I made it to the garage and threw myself into my car, slamming my fists on the steering wheel.

“Fuck! What did you make me do?!” I held my head in my hands, shedding tears of frustration. It was my fault. If I’d been more careful—If I’d been more decisive, Kyle would be alive.

“Answer me!” I shouted at the creature. 

“More. More parts.” That was the only reply it gave. I slammed the dash and cried for a while. I needed the creature out of me, but it couldn’t fathom how to do it. It could control my body to some extent, and it could cause me intense pain if I tried to disobey in any way. 

To get more parts, I’d either need to steal from more donors, which would be nearly impossible after what I’d just done, or start taking them from live specimens. I wasn’t going to kill people—even to save myself. I drove back home, ready to barricade myself in my house until I decayed into a pile of flesh and bone. That is if my resolve could hold out.

The rot was already spreading again. It was slower than before, but the veins were up to my wrist. I threw off my hoodie and resisted the urge to scratch at the black flesh. It started to smell. I couldn’t ignore the stench of death that wafted from the rot. I replaced the bandages. I lay on my bed on my back. My body felt more frail as the minutes passed.

“More parts, " the creature reminded me. I stayed quiet. Then, my vision went red, and I sensed its bubbling anger.

“Find more.” It demanded. There was a shooting pain in my liver, like somebody had hit me with a brutal body shot. I clutched at my body, curling into a ball on my bed.

“Fuck off.” I hissed through clenched teeth. The creature hit me with another massive wave of pain. This time, it was in my spine. 

The pain shot through my body, extending to my fingertips. For the next two hours, the creature tortured me with nausea, headaches, dizziness, and anything that it could throw at me. I started to forget my resolve.

“Leave. Leave. Leave.” It projected into my mind on a constant loop. 

The combination of the overwhelming pain and the commands that incessantly poured into my head drove me insane. I picked up a lamp and launched it across the room, causing it to shatter into countless pieces that littered the floor. 

“Stop! Please!” I begged the creature. It only wanted one thing, and I couldn’t give it. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked nothing like me. 

The woman staring back at me was a demented monster. Her skin was yellowish, and the whites of her eyes were nearly entirely red. My hair started to fall out. I ran my hand through my scalp, and it came out in fistfuls. Gripping the sides of the mirror, I leaned back to bash my head into the glass. As I threw my head forward, I lost control of my movements. My body wasn’t my own. It stepped back without my permission.

“We’re running out of time.” The creature said through my mouth in its flat, coarse tone. “We will rot.” It lifted my arm up. 

When the creature took control of me, the decay progressed rapidly, climbing up to my shoulder. The veins covered my chest, and I could see one of my ribs start to bulge forward, contorting my skin. 

“Find parts, or you will become something else. Something not human. I will give you more pain than you can imagine.” 

I felt faculties return to me, and I collapsed to my knees. I understood more about the decay and the nature of the creature, but that only made my situation worse. I lost sensation in most of my right arm, but I could still move it. 

The creature I was becoming was an abomination. Just looking at myself was miserable. I didn’t want to be in any more pain, and I didn’t want to die. It seemed like I wouldn’t even get the luxury of dying as myself unless I gave into the creature and found more parts. 

My body started to burn. Every nerve ending screamed like they’d been set on fire. I rolled on the ground instinctively, but it did nothing to ease the burning. I couldn’t muster the strength to scream anymore.

“Leave. Leave. Leave.” The commands bombarded me once again. I couldn’t bear it anymore.

“I’ll do it! I will! Just stop!” Immediately, the pain subsided, and I could crawl to my knees. I wanted to keep resisting.

 I wanted to be more than a tool to the creature, but in the end, I was too weak. I wrapped every rotting bit of flesh in bandages and put on heavy clothing covered in perfume to mask the smell of death that clung to me.

 I waited a few hours until the dead of night, then left my home to carry out my vile mission. Unlike the man in the creature’s memories, I didn’t have any equipment that would help in cutting open bodies, so I had to settle for a large kitchen knife. I stood in the doorway, taking one last chance to consider turning back. If I turned the knife on myself, it would all be over. 

Me and the creature would both die; nobody else had to be hurt. I wished I could be selfless like that. I had to fight for everything I had. I thought of myself as a survivor. I wanted to be the kind of person who would reach out a hand to people dangling from the ledge, but that wasn’t me. I was the kind of person who felt relieved when Kyle died in a way that didn’t implicate me. I gripped the knife, tucked it into my pants, and headed to the park.

I figured the best target I could aim for would be someone homeless. There were a few spots in the park that homeless people would sleep in pretty often. I was lucky enough not to run into anyone on the way. There was a place ahead with hollowed-out bushes, making for convenient spots to sleep. I crept forward, head on a swivel, checking for joggers or passersby. I was already jittery. The prospect of murdering someone made me sick, but the itchiness that covered my body as more and more of my flesh went necrotic kept me moving forward. I made justifications to myself—stupid justifications. I tried to think that at least homeless people wouldn’t be missed, as awful as that was. 

There was one person in the bushes. It was a shorter man covered in torn, baggy clothing that looked far too thin to be adequate for the cold. He was out cold, breathing ragged as his chest rose and fell slowly. The man didn’t hear the rustling as I parted the bushes and crawled towards him. I was on my knees, just a few feet from him. I tried not to look at his face, but I couldn’t help it. 

He looked young, too young to be left on the streets. He was pale and thin. I could tell it had been a while since he had his last meal. I would kill him. I would end his life because I thought mine was worth more. My hands trembled as I raised the knife over his chest. I hovered there for a minute.

“Parts. Now.” The creature’s command boomed in my mind. It wanted to take over, but the rot had progressed so far that I could fall apart completely if it did. I felt tears well in my eyes. They were selfish tears. I didn’t shed them for the fact that this man would never get the chance to live a better life but that I’d have to live with the burden. 

He was lying on his back. I leveled the knife at his heart and tried to steady my hands so that I could get a clean stab. My hands—the hands that I trained to save lives—thrust downward at the unsuspecting man, right at his heart. Before the knife could strike, he happened to turn over in his sleep, and the knife impaled his shoulder.

“Shit!” I shouted, wrenching it from his flesh. 

“W-What?!” The man was wide awake, staring at me in shock. He saw the knife in my hand and scrambled back.

“What are you doing?!” He screamed, clutching his shoulder, trying to staunch the steady flow of blood. The scene paralyzed me; the knife was in my hands, but I looked at him like a deer caught in the headlights. The man saw my hesitation and took advantage of it, lunging at me and scrambling for my knife. 

He knocked my weak, dying body to the ground, pinning me down and going for my knife. I scratched at his face. 

I managed to get a finger in his eye, causing him to scream and loosen his grip temporarily. I pushed him away but didn’t manage to move him far. He was back on me, angrier than before. The man snagged the knife from me and tried to stab at my neck. 

Before the knife could reach me, the black tendrils shot from my mouth and wrapped around his wrist. He dropped the knife as the tendrils constricted around his wrist, tight enough to break it. I picked the knife up and thrust it at his neck. The knife stuck deep in, piercing his carotid and sending blood spurting out onto me and the dirt. 

The man put a hand to his neck, gurgling and moaning. It didn’t take long for him to go limp. I knelt over his corpse, huffing and panting from the scuffle. My heart was beating out of my chest. I couldn’t look at what I’d done. I had nothing left to vomit. I’d already emptied my stomach three times over, but I dry heaved over him. 

“Take parts.” The creature commanded me. I still had work to do. Pulling off his clothes and exposing his bare chest, I could see the line I would need to cut to flay him open. The creature projected an image into my mind—a human heart. 

“I-I can’t. What have I…” What use was there in complaining? I had come that far. The time to turn back had passed. I took the knife and rammed it into the man’s sternum, dragging it toward me until his chest cavity was exposed. 

The creature provided me with memories of past hosts extracting hearts to make it easier for me. I was only partway through med school before I quit, but some of the experiences stuck with me, making it a bit easier to do the procedure. 

After some cutting and tugging, the heart came free. Those repulsive tentacles came from my mouth and wrapped around the heart, pulling it into my mouth. The heart was big, the tentacles had to compress the flesh, but it managed to fit down my throat—its slimy surface tickling me the whole way down. 

Once the heart was in my body, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The veins retreated, the same as before, and some of my strength returned. 

“Not enough.” The creature stated. “Your body is broken. Find a new host.” The command came.

“What?!” I could tell that I hadn’t healed as much as last time. I remembered the last time the creature left a host. The host’s corpse fell on top of me. “I thought this would be enough!” I shouted. 

The creature projected another memory. This time, I was in the perspective of a man pinning someone else to the ground. The person he pinned to the ground was the man who had attacked me in the alley. The creature climbed out of the man’s mouth and into my attacker’s. The perspective shifted. I was watching the view of my attacker. I could see the man that the creature left standing before stumbling away. 

“I’ll survive?” If I passed the creature on, I could live. From what I could gather, the last host was too far gone, but I could still make it. 

I could pass on this burden that was worse than death to someone else. It was worse than killing them, but I felt such a weight off my shoulders. I didn’t care. Maybe the next person would be stronger than me—strong enough to end this somehow. I knew where to go.

I went back to the same slums where the last host attacked me. It was the same as last time. Trash filled the streets, and the occasional junkie passed out on the sidewalk. There were targets everywhere, and I just needed to find somebody isolated enough. Up ahead, a woman was standing near an alley, slouched over and staring at the ground, high out of her mind on something.

“Miss, would you like some help?” I called out to her. As eager as I was to have the creature out of me, the nerves wracked my body. 

That intense itching returned. The heart had barely held off the rot. The woman grunted in response, unable to meet my eyes.

“C-Come with me, it’ll all be okay.” I stammered, taking her arm and guiding her into the darkness of the alley. She tripped after we’d made it halfway in, lying on the floor moaning softly. 

“I’m sorry.” I mounted her and held her mouth open. “I’m so sorry.” 

The creature, sensing my intention, moved its body up my throat, squirming under my skin. The creature wasn’t too pleased with the woman I chose, but it didn’t have much of a choice. I felt its whole body in my mouth. I could taste it on my tongue, and it was bitter. 

The creature dangled from my mouth. I held the woman's jaws open and let it slide down into her gullet. I felt like I’d removed a massive splinter as it left me. My mangled flesh didn’t return to normal, nor did my bloodshot eyes or yellowing skin, but I was free.

The woman on the ground convulsed as the creature made itself a part of her body.

“Thank you, miss. I hope you’ll be better than me.” 

Relief and guilt battled inside me, and neither won. I walked back home with one burden traded for another. The rot mutilated my body, and my life would never be the same. The next day, I packed everything I had into my SUV and drove off in a random direction. I was a murderer, a freak, and a coward. I would have to live with that until the end of my life. But, at least I was alive.
