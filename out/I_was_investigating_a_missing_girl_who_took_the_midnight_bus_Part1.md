I hadn’t had a decent night’s sleep in days when the call came in. 

Mr Ward, paranormal investigator—that’s what they call me, though if you ask me, it’s just as much about hunting for lost people as it is for ghosts. And I’ve been around long enough to know that the two often go hand in hand.

So when I received a call from a man living in Delmare Creek, a mid-sized town about a three-hour drive from my own city, I was intrigued and immediately made my way there.

When I arrived at his house, the worry etched across his face was palpable. "Thank you for coming Mr Ward, My name is Philip McDonald" he said, his voice trembling. 

"My daughter, Elise, works as a nurse at St. Mary’s Hospital. I haven’t  heard from her in four days."

He ran a hand through his hair, anxiety evident in every gesture. 

“Her job requires her to work late hours. So it is normal for her shift to get over only around 12 in the night. And she always took the bus home. It’s a quick route—direct and reliable.”

“Except for one bus, the one that shows up only at the dead of night, right around witching hour. They call it the Midnight Bus.”

“What do you mean by the Midnight Bus?” I asked, sitting up straight in my seat, the heaviness of his words settling in.

His eyes darkened as he began to explain. “It’s a ghost bus, or so people say. It doesn’t follow any normal route. Instead, it stops at places that make no sense— I mean it stops at random places which makes it hard to predict. ”

“I have heard people say that the bus prowls the streets during the late hours of the night. But it usually picks people up on Fridays. That is the day when people are most vulnerable to getting aboard on it. Elise too has been missing since ….Friday.” He paused, swallowing hard. 

“What else have you heard about this Midnight bus?” I asked him, while I began taking down notes.

“Nothing much, people usually prefer to not discuss it. It makes everyone a bit uncomfortable, you know.  But I’ve heard the stories while having a drink in the local pub. It plays music, something soft and melodious, and it lures people in. Those who get on… they’re never seen again alive. I’ve lost friends to that bus.”

“Now my own daughter …..is missing,” the defeat in his voice hung in the air like a shroud, and I felt the weight of his despair.

“I need your help to find her,” he pleaded, desperation creeping into his tone. “If she got on that bus, I worry if I will ever see her again,” he spoke, tears streaming down her face. 

“Don’t worry Mr McDonald,” I said standing up. “I am going to do everything in my power to find your daughter.”

So once I left Mr McDonald’s house, the first place I went to was the local police station.

 I wanted to check all the evidence they had so far on the midnight bus. Surely, they must have tracked the disappearances of people who went missing before Elise. That might give me some vital clues. 

I was immediately directed to Sergeant Miller, a tall man whose face bore the weight of years on the force. 

He pulled a frayed file from his desk drawer, sliding it across to me. “We’ve had a number of missing persons linked to what folks around here call the ‘Midnight Bus,’” he said, his voice low. “But the story goes back further than most realize.” 

“In the year 1930, a bus called the *Croon Squad*, carrying a group of musicians, suddenly vanished. It was last seen on one of the back roads, late at night. The vehicle, the passengers, everything… just disappeared. Over the years, people began reporting sightings of a ghostly bus that appears only at night, picking people up at random and… well, taking them somewhere no one comes back from.”

I raised an eyebrow. “And what about the bodies? Did you find any bodies over the years?”

Miller looked uncomfortable, scratching his chin. “We found some around the abandoned Abagnale Asylum, near the old cemetery. It’s like… something drops them off there, always after a week since the disappearance. We’ve kept patrols around the place, but we’ve never caught anyone in the act.”

“Has anyone ever come back… alive?” I asked, fully expecting him to say no.

To my surprise, he hesitated before nodding. 

“Just one. He’s an old man now, practically a relic himself. He claims he survived because a priest found him and took his place by… sacrificing himself. But that was a long time ago, and the survivor’s memory is… foggy. You’ll find him at Shady Pines Home.”

Intrigued, I next headed to Shady Pines Old Age Home to meet the old man. He was frail, slumped in a wheelchair, his eyes clouded with age. 

The moment I mentioned the Midnight Bus, he seemed to suddenly recoil, his hands shaking as he tried to grasp the armrests of his wheelchair.

His face drained of color, and his eyes filled with fear. He began muttering, his voice growing louder and more frantic, “Collector… Collector…Collector”

“What do you mean by ‘Collector’?” I asked leaning in, but his expression was one of sheer terror. 

“Tol….Toll….Toll ….. Toll Collector,” he stammered, before his body went limp and he fainted in his chair. 

As I left, a chill settled over me. 

Whoever this “ Toll Collector” was, it was connected to the Midnight Bus in a way that reeked of something beyond my understanding.

Once back in my hotel room, I spread out a map of Delmare Creek and got to work, marking each place where the Midnight Bus was known to appear, and cross-referencing it  with the dates and locations of recent disappearances.

It wasn’t long before I started seeing some troubling patterns. 

Over the decades, the Midnight Bus had made various stops around town, shifting its route every few months. 

But recently, it had settled on five specific locations, each equidistant from the other and known to have foot traffic even late at night. 

These locations were the St. Mary’s Hospital, Delmare Creek Train Station, Vintage Movie House, Grace 24/7 Supermarket, and the local gas station.

As I mapped the disappearances against the dates and locations, a shocking realization struck me. 

It became clear how the local police had overlooked some obvious clues. 

But for me, being a paranormal investigator, the evidence was staring me right in the face. The series of stops formed an unsettling pattern resembling a pentagram.

This couldn’t be a coincidence; the Midnight Bus was following a ritualistic route. 

For each passenger it picked up, the next stop was strategically placed to complete the pentagram pattern, starting with St. Mary’s Hospital, then Delmare Creek Train Station, followed by the Vintage Movie House, Grace Supermarket, and finally ending at the local gas station.

Digging deeper, I cross-referenced the locations where bodies had been found, and a chill crawled up my spine. 

The abandoned Abagnale Asylum lay dead center within these points. No wonder the bodies had been turning up there—it was at the heart of this sinister pattern.

With only two days left on the clock, I now had a solid lead on where the next pick up was likely to happen. My eyes immediately gravitated towards the Delmare Creek Train Station on the map. 

Now all that was left for me to do was to stake out the area, and be prepared, knowing that lives might depend on what I would uncover.

When Friday arrived, I sat waiting in my car, gripping a small cross in my hand. 

From my conversations with the locals, I’d pieced together that hypnosis seemed to play a role in the disappearances, and I was determined not to fall victim to it myself.

My eyes were locked on the small, unassuming bus stop just beyond the train station. From the shadows, I watched a young man, maybe in his early thirties, standing alone.

Then, a plain-looking bus pulled up and stopped in front of him. At first, he didn’t seem interested in boarding, but suddenly, bright lights flared from the bus, its entire look transforming in an instant.  Happy music pulsed through the air, and the man’s expression softened, his eyes going distant as he slipped into a trance.

I quickly got out of the car and ran toward him. 

As I approached, I saw the name *Croon Squad* painted on the side and glimpsed shadowy musicians inside, their faces looking pale and white even in the bright lights.

The bus doors opened, and the driver, with a wide smile, beckoned the man inside. 

He lifted his foot onto the step, ready to board.

But I managed to reach him just in time, grabbing his shoulder to stop him. He turned to look at me, his gaze distant and unfocused. “My wife…she’s inside. I can hear her calling me,” he murmured, as if in a dream. 

“She’s gone, my friend,” I said firmly. “This isn’t real. It’s a trap.”

The driver’s smile vanished, his face darkening as he shot me a look of pure malice. 

Ignoring him, I gave the young man a gentle push away and stepped onto the bus in his place. 

The instant I crossed the threshold, the music stopped. All eyes turned to me—the ghostly musicians, their hollow stares full of resentment toward me for disrupting their plans. 

Holding my cross tightly, I ignored their glares and let my gaze settle on the back of the bus, where Elise sat alone, staring into the void, her expression haunted and withdrawn.

The driver’s silence was heavy, his fury evident in every movement. 

He handed me a slip of paper—a ticket, though no payment was required. For now, at least. 

Without a word, he restarted the engine, leaving the young man stranded at the deserted stop as the bus lurched forward into the darkness. I took the seat beside Elise, but she didn’t acknowledge me, her gaze fixed on something beyond this world.

As the bus rolled into the night, I braced myself for whatever lay ahead, fully aware that there was no turning back now.
