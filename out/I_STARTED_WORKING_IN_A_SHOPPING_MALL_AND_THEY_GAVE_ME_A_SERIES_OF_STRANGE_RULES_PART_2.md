AHHHHH!! Finally home, I sighed with relief. I hadn't felt such excitement about being home since, well, never. It was the first time I felt relieved about something, and I felt the adrenaline still in my body transforming into dopamine, giving me a sense of pleasure.  
  
I blamed myself for feeling this way because I knew I'd have to return to that damn place at night. So, I put on some music while making scrambled eggs, pancakes, and chocolate – at least I still had some food. It wasn't much, but at that moment, I didn't care and indulged myself. I thought I deserved it. I know, I know, it sounds silly, but at that moment, it was all I wanted.  
  
I fell asleep and had horrible nightmares about that eye on the wall. I dreamt the wall broke, revealing a tall, thin, pale creature that seemed to be made of cotton. Its skin on what looked like its face opened in a circular shape like a mouth, revealing multiple rows of circular teeth, and in the center, there was a beak-like thing similar to a parrot's. Then it grabbed me and breathed fishy breath on my face, and its skin felt soft but rough in some parts. I'll stop there.  
  
I woke up abruptly, realizing my cat was in front of me, waking me up to feed him. I felt relieved but also an irrational hatred towards the cat (yes, I do have a cat – a person living alone needs company, right?). It was already 5:30 in the afternoon, so with a grumpy face, I got ready, put on my uniform, and prepared to work.  
  
I had a quiet night at the shopping center, or so it seemed. As a night guard, it was my duty to patrol every corner of the building to ensure everything was in order. As I walked through the deserted hallways, a feeling of unease crept over me. Something wasn't right.  
  
I decided to do an additional round before closing, following rule 6 to the letter: never use the shopping center elevator. I headed towards the stairs leading to the upper floor. The lights flickered slightly, creating eerie shadows on the walls.  
  
When I reached the top floor, I encountered a strange and puzzling scene. The elevator was stuck there, with its doors slightly open. A chill ran down my spine as I thought someone else might be there, defying the rule.  
  
With cautious steps, I approached the elevator and looked inside. To my horror, there was no one there. But something was disturbingly unusual: the button panel was completely blank, with no visible numbers or indications. How was that possible? Was there a system malfunction?  
  
As I moved away from the elevator, a shiver came over me. The air felt thick and heavy, as if something dark was lurking in the shadows. I quickly decided to return to the lower floor, trying not to look back.  
  
However, the feeling of discomfort didn't leave me. As I walked the halls, I noticed the shadows seemed to come to life, moving unusually and contorting into strange shapes. My heart started beating faster, and a sense of paranoia consumed me.  
  
Suddenly, a barely audible murmur filled the air. It was as if whispering voices floated around. I tried to ignore them, but they seemed to follow me every step of the way, as if it were a normal day at the supermarket, people walking, children playing, and that same damn rock and roll music playing. Suddenly, a whisper, spoken as if by the very wind, said, "*None of these people will leave here alive*." I remembered rule 9, but I couldn't help feeling uneasy about what might be behind those whispers.  
  
In an attempt to distance myself from the oppressive atmosphere, I returned to the central area of the shopping center. But my eyes fell upon something that froze my blood: a mannequin in a showcase without a navel. I followed rule 11, keeping my gaze fixed on it as I walked away, but I forgot the part about taking it to the elevator, something that would cost me a great deal of my sanity later on.  
  
As I left it behind, the murmur intensified. My steps became clumsy and desperate, but no matter how fast I ran, it seemed I couldn't escape that feeling of imminent danger.  
  
Finally, dawn arrived, and with it, calm returned to the shopping center. I left the building exhausted and trembling. I had never felt so relieved to leave my workplace behind.  
  
When I reached the security post, I checked the cameras, and my colleague was sticking a piece of paper on the screen. I assumed there was another interference issue, and I was terrified to know that the camera that was failing was the one filming where I was. Thankfully, I didn't know about it and didn't have to confront the camera, so I didn't have to witness that grotesque scene again. It was close to 6 in the morning when I began writing my report of what had happened, but I remained puzzled about what that voice meant when it told me that no one would leave here alive.  
  
Morning came, and I was able to rest, but before leaving, I saw the mannequin without a navel about 10 meters from the security room. It was positioned as if it had been walking. The shopping center had opened, and apparently, it couldn't reach the room. I wondered what would have happened if it had.  
  
Before I could react, an employee of the shopping center picked up the mannequin and took it back to its display. I saw that he took it without anything in his hands, and nothing happened to him. So, I assumed that my coworker had tried to play a prank on me. I scolded myself for that thought, but my mind searched for logical answers to help me cope with the situation.  
  
I went home, rested, ate, fed my cat, and went to bed. I slept relatively well, which surprised me, given the things that were haunting my mind. But I slept well.  
  
I woke up, this time earlier, around 4:30 in the afternoon, so I watched a movie, I don't remember what it was, maybe The Avengers or something like that, but I just didn't want to think about having to go back to work that night.  
  
I put on my uniform again; it felt heavy. I combed my hair, put on some cologne, not sure why I did it; it's not like I was going to meet a girl. Well, actually, I did want a girl to notice me; despite everything that was happening, I had noticed one of the girls who worked at the cinema. She was pretty, and my shift started an hour before hers ended. I hoped she would notice me, but it seemed that day she left earlier than usual, and I couldn't see her.  
  
The shopping center closed at eight, and no one was around anymore. I walked to my security post, not expecting anything. But as I passed through one of the corridors, as calm as it was (if you can call it that), I suddenly felt terror and horror, and my stomach churned inside me, wanting to vomit.  
  
As I turned the corner, I came face to face with the mannequin, standing about 30 meters away from me. I quickly walked to an information desk, never taking my eyes off the mannequin. I felt around the drawers, and I found  
  
various things, even a pack of condoms (how did that get there?), but finally, I found gloves and put them on. I went up to the mannequin and lifted it; it weighed like a regular mannequin, so it wasn't difficult to lift it. I was stunned that this happened at the beginning of my shift, but at that moment, I couldn't afford to take my eyes off the mannequin.  
  
Then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a flashlight beam, and I said, "*Frank, what are you doing here? You should be at the cameras."* But then the same chilling song I had heard before started whistling, and I don't know why, but I felt compelled to turn around. When I looked, it was a different security guard. Then I remembered rule 10 and regretted doing it...
