Hello, my name is Nathan Kramer and I work as an armed security guard. All names, including my own and the company I work for, in this story, have been changed. Most of my job involves patrolling various places during the night to protect people and property. I have been working in this field for the past decade and, for the most part, it's been pretty dull. However, I would like to share with you one of the most eerie shifts that I have worked. This incident took place in 2019 when I was 31 years old and lived in Northern California. That year, the state was hit by massive fires, and one of these fires destroyed the town of Paradise. Several construction companies from all over the country came to help rebuild the town. The company that I worked for was hired to guard some equipment and a recycling yard for one of these companies. This particular company was responsible for removing all the destroyed vehicles and other metal debris from the town. They would collect the vehicles and other destroyed property, catalog them, and try to identify their owners before crushing and recycling them. They did all of this in the town of Oroville, which is about 25 minutes south of Paradise. Oroville is not a large city, but it has a large homeless population, which was made worse by the fires, and a serious drug issue. It wasn't too long after they started storing and cataloging these vehicles in a makeshift yard, rented from a local property owner, that people started breaking in to steal whatever they could.

Our job was to guard a large place from 6 pm to 6 am. The perimeter of the place was about a mile long and had a chain link fence topped with barbed wire. The west and south edges were adjacent to a deep irrigation canal, so there was no fence on those sides. We were situated on the far edge of the town, surrounded by empty fields and industrial facilities.

Initially, the job was easy. We would talk to the employees leaving, report to our supervisor, and then begin our rounds. We used the patrol vehicle to drive along the east side of the property and inspected the fence for damage using the spotlight. We also checked the equipment, doors to the office trailers, and vehicles at each end.

As time passed, the place became a maze of vehicles. The vehicles were separated into three sections: the south side had vehicles that needed to be processed and cataloged, the middle area had vehicles that had been processed and were waiting to be crushed, and the north end had all the flattened and crushed vehicles, along with the office trailers and various other pieces of heavy machinery. After a month, the yard was a maze of twisted jagged metal that smelled like ash, smoke, and chemicals. We couldn't see anything happening without walking through it. We requested to have some light plants set up to help us see but they ended up putting three of them in the worst locations possible. As far as I was concerned all it did was ruin your night vision every time you looked towards them or patrolled near them. Personally, I like walking the place in the dark and trying to sneak up on anyone who made it into the yard, which rarely happened, but everyone else hated it.

My colleagues used to share stories about how they felt uncomfortable and creeped out at that site. They claimed to have seen bloody or burnt body parts in some of the cars, heard unexplainable noises, and felt as if they were being watched. Although I am not a firm believer in the paranormal, I prefer to steer clear of anything that seems creepy. It doesn't stop me from doing my job, but when I come across something unusual or hear strange noises, I take a moment to assess the situation before returning to my work and getting it done as quickly as possible so I can leave. I don't know if any of that stuff is real but why tempt fate? That being said, I enjoy listening to scary stories and creepypastas, as well as teasing my coworkers when they feel uneasy.

One night I was working at a nearby site, as the shift supervisor, and went to check on the guard at the recycling yard. I drove onto the south end of the property and noticed the guy had his head buried in his phone and was oblivious to what was happening around him. I don’t like to throw guys under the bus and get people in trouble but I also don’t want us to lose a contract or have someone get hurt because they weren’t paying attention and doing their job. So I decided to sneak up on the guy and give him a good scare, followed by a quick lesson in being aware of your surroundings. And it worked perfectly. I crouched at the rear of the vehicle and tapped on the underside of it with my baton. Eventually, the guy started looking around, he even radioed in to check if one of us was messing with him. Luckily the crew that we had then was on the same page and knew I was messing with him the moment I said I was still at the other site. He got out and started to look under the vehicle, so I went behind the rear passenger tire. He then slowly walked around the vehicle, and I slowly followed keeping low to stay out of view. After a moment I was able to get right behind him and poke him with my baton while yelling loudly. That guy jumped about five feet into the air and screamed like a three-year-old girl, it was great. We had a laugh about it after he calmed down, and then went on a foot patrol together.

We had made it to the middle section when we heard some whispering. I had him go one way while I flanked and went up the other side. We searched all over the place but never found anything. At the time I didn’t think much of it and chalked it up to voices carrying across the field and echoing off the stacks of vehicles. My coworker, let's call him Gunner, immediately started going on about how the place had to be haunted. “I mean there were like at least 80 or more people that died in that fire and more later at the hospital. There is no way this place doesn’t have some ghost or demon floating around, you know.”

“You might be right but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at least be aware of what's going on around you Gunner. If you’re that creeped out by the place then you should ask about taking a position at another site,” I told him.

“You know how the boss is, everyone has to rotate through and be able to work each of the positions. I think the only one who gets away with not doing that is the old guy, Willis,” he said after letting out a long sigh.

“Well, it's worth a shot. The worst he could say is no.”

“I guess you're right.”

“Alright, I have to head back. Call me if need anything, and watch out for demons,” I said with a laugh as I got back into my patrol vehicle and left the site.

About a week later Gunner called in sick and I went to cover the site for him. This worked out great for me because it meant that I had less to do and could enjoy the night all to myself without having to constantly check on the employees. The night was going well, I had seen only two or three people walking the road or fields, and no one had tried getting in, so far at least. At about 3 am I was standing at the driver's side of the patrol car, parked on the southwest side, eating a quick snack and enjoying my third Monster energy drink when a soul-shattering scream split through the quiet night.

I stood shocked for a second, wondering where it had come from. Then it came again, to the east side near the irrigation canal. It was the voice of a woman yelling “HELP ME”. Up until that point, I had only ever heard a scream like that twice. Both times were because someone was being seriously hurt and was in fear for their life. I immediately called out on the radio, gave my location, explained what I was hearing, and had them call the police. While I was doing that I began running towards the screams.

I’ll never forget the way they sounded; raw, gut-wrenching, full-throated screams of desperation and utter terror. As I drew nearer I pulled my firearm, updated everyone on my location, and steadied my approach, looking for any sign of what was going on and preparing myself for the worst. I approached the final line of cars waiting to be processed and could see out to the canal and the large open field on the other side. The screams just kept getting louder, the cries for help getting more desperate. I finished scanning the vehicles and quickly came out to the edge of the canal and scanned across it to the field and I couldn’t see anyone. I searched and searched, the screams just continuing to go on and on. Finally, I yelled out, “Armed Guard Services, where are you!?”

The moment I finished yelling out everything became completely silent; it was almost deafeningly quiet compared to the screaming that had been happening only a second ago. I called out again, still scanning the area, looking for any little detail that would give me some kind of clue as to what was going on and where this woman was. With my body pumping full of adrenaline, every hair standing on end, and my mind in full crisis mood, my radio suddenly broke the silence, making me jump.

“Nathan, I’m almost to the south gate and the police are another minute out. What's your status?” said Banner, one of the supervisors from another site.

“I’m 10-60 but the situation has gone quiet. Notify PD that the incident may be taking place in the field across the canal on the southeast side of the property,” I said as calmly as I could.

“10-4”

I continued to scan slowly moving along trying to keep some cover in case whatever was happening involved a gunman, but I couldn’t find anything. Eventually, the police arrived, along with Banner, and combed through the recycle yard and field across the canal but couldn’t find anything that indicated someone was hurt or attacked. They even searched the surrounding industrial facilities and still found nothing. Other employees at these facilities had reported the screaming too but nothing was found. We chalked it up to someone playing a prank at best or at worst we were missing something. Either way, the police couldn’t search all night so they eventually left. With a few continuing to patrol the area. Banner had returned to his post shortly before the police left and I was left by myself.

I stood there at the edge of the canal, where I had last heard the scream, thinking through what had happened, trying to see if I missed anything. While I stood there thinking and listening to the normal night sounds I began to notice something. I thought I could hear footsteps slowly moving behind me. I tensed up, I wasn’t sure if I was hearing what I thought I heard. At the same time, an overwhelming sense of dread had come over me and the last thing I wanted to do was turn around. Then I heard a small quiet sniffle. Fueled by another adrenaline dump I drew my pistol from the holster, stepping to the side, and turning around all in one smooth motion, dreading what I was about to come face to face with.

I was met with nothing. Only darkness and the twisted burned remains of the vehicles in the yard. I stood there, frozen in disbelief for a moment. I knew that I had heard someone sniffling, I was sure I had heard footsteps approaching too. I searched the area quickly and quietly and found that I was alone, again. I was completely confused; was I going crazy? As the adrenaline began to fade, leaving me completely exhausted, I slowly reholstered my firearm. Just then something touched my ear and I jumped. Spinning around quickly, dropping into a defensive stance, I found nothing yet again. I let out a deep frustrated sigh saying out loud, “Now you’re jumping at mosquitoes. Dude get a grip…. What the fuck.”

I slowly turned back to my patrol vehicle and began to walk back to it. Just as I crossed back into the stacks of vehicles a loud, maniacal, and cackling laugh crashed through the air. Once more I turned, hand griping my pistol, and readied myself for a fight. Again I could see nothing. The laughter continued as I scanned the area yet again. After a long moment, the laughing stopped. I called out asking if anyone was out there and was met with only silence. After a moment, quietly, almost to myself I said, “I don’t know what's going on but if this is some kind of ghost or spirit please understand I am just here to do my job. If you leave me alone I’ll leave you alone. Either way, I am not leaving and I’d really like it if you would stop scaring the shit out of me. It makes it difficult for me to get my job done, you know.”

I quickly scanned the area one last time before turning around and heading back to my patrol vehicle. As I approached the south gate, where my vehicle was parked with the lights flashing, I heard a low rumbling chuckle in my left ear. It was accompanied by a strong smell of smoke and ash. Although I shivered, I ignored it and finished my snack and energy drink. The rest of the night passed without any incident, and I never experienced anything as crazy as that at the site again.

I’m not sure if it was something supernatural, someone pulling a prank, or, god forbid, someone actually in danger. But I did everything that I could do and while I would hear the occasional laugh or out-of-place sound, I never heard that screaming again. Well that its for now. If you like this I have a few more stories for you. Nothing as crazy as that night, but creepy nonetheless. Let me know if I should continue to share and thank you for taking the time to read this.
