I've decided to name the sword. 

The reason for this is that this sword and the responsibility it represents were both forced upon me. By naming it, I'm making it mine. Some suggestions that yinz made in the comments of the last update made me smile, mostly because they were designed solely to annoy Iolo. And I did strongly consider them, believe me. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

But after thinking long and hard about it - probably about as much thought as most people put in to name their kids - I've decided upon Ratcatcher. 

It might sound strange; it's definitely not the most eloquent name for a sword, but it's a term that's been used to put down not just me, but Orion and our profession as a whole. We're just rat catchers. Not worth anything. Not capable of anything more than taking care of the pests that no one else wants to deal with. Definitely not worthy of respect. We're only allowed to exist as long as we do our jobs and know our place.

I’m proud of my profession, as dangerous as it can be. Most of us are. Now, instead of representing a bad deal, the sword will represent *us.* 

So, now that I got my Joker monologue out of the way, let me tell yinz about what happened in Ohio. 

For some background, River Kingz Pest Control Specialties is where Victor was working before he started up Orion. They're a bit bigger than we are, but they also have a ridiculously high call volume compared to us thanks to operating in an area with a bigger population. 

While it may sound like things are exciting for us over in our little corner of Pennsylvania, our number of atypical cases is actually considerably lower than theirs. Even with a certain Huntsman deciding to ruin our lives for fun, we still have a lot less on our plate than they do. 

Just last week, one of their crews got hit by a runaway truck while they were on their way to a call. Luckily, no one died, but they're all banged up pretty badly. On top of that, three of their employees had their memories completely erased by a particularly vindictive Neighbor to the point where they can't even remember their own names. 

Long story short, the River Kingz are critically shorthanded. 

Before we could venture out to Ohio, someone at Orion needed to stick around at the office and hold down the fort. Picking who that was going to be wasn't easy. 

I initially volunteered, “It should probably be me. Cuyahoga Falls is almost a two hour drive and I'm fairly confident the mechanic isn't going to be happy if I’m late.”

Victor shook his head, “Of all the people to be alone right now, you're the last on the list. Fucker kidnapped and drugged you.”

“I won't be alone. Deirdre will be around.” 

Speaking of the Weeper, something I mentioned in the comments last post was that Deirdre found a way around having to go through the Hunt to operate as a keening woman. She's been venturing outside of their reach, guiding lost souls to where they belong without having to worry about undermining the Hunt’s authority. 

That was what she'd been doing when the mechanic sent Briar to grab me. When she returned to discover everything that had happened to me, she felt responsible. I don't know why. It's not her fault. None of this is. But because of that, she has been making more frequent stops by my apartment to make sure I’m alright. 

Reyna spoke up, sounding hesitant, “I'm not trying to be mean or anything, like I know there's more to her than what meets the eye, but… what exactly is she going to do against Psycho Mantis?”

“As long as I play along with his bullshit, I don't think he'll do anything to either of us.” I said. “‘Think’ being the operative word.”

Honestly, though, I wasn't certain of anything when it came to the mechanic. I just knew that for whatever reason, he wanted me alive for the time being. 

“Again, I'm not trying to sound like a dick,” Reyna started to ask. “But how are we going to help the River Kingz when we're not doing so great ourselves?”

Victor explained, “That was the agreement we set up when the Kingz helped fund Orion. That, and they’re even worse off than we are, believe it or not.”

Reasonably, Reyna looked astonished, “Well, one of us is a vampire and another one of us is under the threat of enslavement from the Wild Hunt, so… can't wait to see whatever they've got going on!”

Victor gave her *that* look. “Not a vampire.”

“Fine. High-functioning zombie. My bad.”

He shook his head. “*Anyways,* I'm thinking it would be best if Reyna stayed behind. As far as I know, the Hunters aren't interested in her. At least not as much as they are in you.”

“Briar?” I reminded him. Reyna cringed when I brought his name up. 

“He won't do anything without the mechanic's say-so.” Victor assured us. “And since he doesn't appear to consider Reyna a threat, that shouldn't be an issue.”

“Nessa, you have *a lot* of nerve being worried about me when you're the one getting stalked by an evil redneck fairy.” Reyna joked. 

“If I focus on other people's problems, then I don't have to focus on my own!” I retorted playfully. 

“The fact of the matter is that being alone is a bad idea, at the moment.” Victor said. “I'm sure he's not going to take kindly to the idea of someone accompanying you to these… training sessions. But just by setting that trap, he sent the message that Orion isn't a hundred percent safe, at least not in its current state.”

That's when he begrudgingly announced that he was going to start hiring. I know a few of yinz sent over your resumés, so best of luck to you. By the way, if Vic seems surly, don't take it personally. Interviewing is one of his least favorite managerial duties. It's not a slight against you. 

It was decided that I'd drive separately to Cuyahoga Falls so that I could leave in time to be ~~tortured~~ trained by the mechanic. 

I muttered, “Looks like I've got a *lot* of running around to do tomorrow.”

By the way, speaking of Iolo, there's something I have to say to the horny jail inmates: I'm gonna be a little crude here, but I just want to say that I know better than to let crazy stick its dick in me. In other words, I'm *not* having the mechanic's horrible little changeling babies. 

But we'll get into my first training session with the scumbag later. Back to the mutual aid. There were kids going missing around one of the more rural areas the River Kingz operate in. While local authorities investigated for human causes, we would be joining our cousin company to search for Auntie Rye. 

Don't let the cutesy nickname fool you. We had to drive one out once before and it wasn't pleasant. 

Auntie Rye infestations can be identified depending upon how a field has been tended. If the farmer has done a good job, she will stalk the field, but otherwise leave it and its owner unharmed. In Germany, Auntie Rye passing by without causing trouble for anyone was actually a sign of a good harvest and some farmers would even try to appease her with offerings in the hopes that she'd bless them with a fertile crop. And despite the name, they will equally inhabit corn and rye fields; as long as the crops are tall enough to cover them, they're happy. 

However, if she feels that the field isn't being tended to properly, the farmer might notice that some of the crop has turned black. These cursed crops will be toxic for human consumption and if not addressed immediately, Auntie Rye's curse will spread until the entire field has been destroyed. 

If Rye Aunts were only a danger to crops,  they wouldn't be so bad. Where they become downright horrific is if a child is unlucky enough to cross their path. The Aunts’ main concern is maintaining the field they've chosen as their homes, and unfortunately, they appear to regard children in the same scornful manner that people regard termites.

Back when one of the farms near us was visited by an Auntie Rye, we got a call from the farmer who was in a panic after not being able to find his son. He'd known about the Aunt's residence and up until that point, he'd been doing a good job of keeping her content. We joined him in his search through the corn field.

One of the Rye Aunts’ defining features is having black breasts that sag down to their knees. The reason for this anatomical oddity is believed to be due to the fact that their mammary glands produce tar instead of milk. Because of their length, the Aunts have to throw them over their shoulders to chase their prey, which probably sounds comical, but I assure yinz that if you saw it in real life, you wouldn't be laughing. 

When we found Auntie Rye back then, she was cradling the farmer’s son in her spindly arms, pressing him to her tar-filled breasts. Her bright nails dug into the back of his head, scorching his hair with their flaming tips. Her jaw hung down to her navel as she began to cackle, showing off her cracked teeth before throwing the boy to the ground, his limp body weighed down like a stone by the tar bloating his belly.  

Once again, that was one of those cases that didn't have a happy ending. 

Of course, fending off Auntie Rye is easier said than done. If the infestation gets too bad, the field has to be burnt down, which ended up being the case for the Aunt we dealt with back then. But for farmers, those fields are their livelihoods. Most of the time, it's simpler to find a way to appease the Rye Aunt and be diligent at keeping children out of the inhabited fields. 

When we first arrived at the field in Ohio, we weren't sure if this Auntie Rye was responsible for the missing kids. It was just an educated guess. Leaving no stone unturned, and whatnot. 

One of the duo in charge of running the River Kingz, Sam, was waiting for us with two others who I didn't recognize. Of course, it had been a long time since I'd seen the Kingz, so they might not have been all that new to the job. They didn't introduce themselves. They weren't rude, necessarily, just wanting to get the search on the way while it was still early in the day. 

The first thing Sam did when he saw Victor was hug him, somehow managing to lift the boss off the ground despite being a head shorter and in his fifties. The boss tolerated it all while looking like a cat that didn't want to be held. All the while, Sam was commenting on how he wished that their reunion was under better circumstances. He then noted that Victor felt cold, eyeing the bandana skeptically. 

It occurred to me then that Victor hadn't informed his old colleague of his condition. 

We decided it would be best to go in groups, given that Auntie Rye could get aggressive if we trampled around in her precious field. For their sake, I hoped that we'd find them with some other Neighbors later on, wearing flower crowns and dancing around merrily. 

There was a part of me that worried about the Gingerbread House making a reappearance. Thankfully, the Kingz hadn't received any reports of anyone finding a trail of treats anywhere nearby. But once again, if we couldn't find anything in the corn and rye fields, the woods were on the list. 

As we shoved our way through corn stalks, Victor noted that the crop all looked healthy. Sam confirmed that the farmer was diligent about leaving Auntie Rye offerings. Hopefully, that meant that she would be *slightly* less aggressive. 

Eventually, we heard someone humming. 

Aside from the comments I'd mentioned earlier, we’d made a point to be quiet during our search. Weapons were silently drawn in preparation of what we'd find. 

Sam delicately pulled two stalks aside with one hand, the other on his revolver, revealing Auntie Rye humming as she prepared a large wooden device with a handle up top. Due to its excessive size, it took a moment to recognize that it was a butter churn. 

A churn big enough to fit a human child. 

It's one thing to read about this happening in old reports. Is another to see a Rye Aunt’s churn in person. Along with forcing their victims to drink tar, they've also been known to grind them up until they're a paste that could be spread upon a slice of bread. 

Victor emerged first, approaching Auntie Rye without hesitation. Her head turned to watch him with gleaming eyes, her humming not stopping. I followed him while the River Kingz circled around in an effort to surround her. 

Banging and crying could be heard coming from the oversized butter churn. *We weren't too late this time.* 

Auntie Rye didn't take her eyes off of Victor as she placed her tar-filled breasts over her shoulders like a fleshy scarf. A trademark display of aggression from these Neighbors. She then let out a roar as she sprinted towards him, glowing fingertips reaching for his face. 

While he dealt with her, I hurried to open up the butter churn. I wedged my knife between the lid and barrel-shaped body to pry it open. The massive lid was so heavy that it was difficult for the knife to get the purchase it needed. 

There was a gunshot. Sam and the other unnamed employee had come out of the field to help Victor keep Auntie Rye occupied. Sam had managed to take her by surprise and shot her in the temple. She let out a snarl as she whirled around, realizing with wild eyes that they had her encircled. 

The other River Kingz employee had materialized by my side to help me get the lid off of that massive churn, sliding her own knife into the same side as me. On a count of three, her and I lifted at the same time. The lid finally rose. A small, dirty hand appeared in the gap, its owner sobbing. 

I yanked the lid the rest of the way while the employee reached in to pick up the girl trapped inside. 

Auntie Rye was still preoccupied with the other three as she and I began to run with the distraught child. First priority was getting the kid out of there. 

“Is it just you?” The employee asked the kid. 

Speechless and terrified, the little girl shook her head quickly. This girl was only one of three that had gone missing, so that begged the question: where were the others? 

We managed to get her back to where our vehicles waited without consequence. The Kingz employee tried to set the girl down in their company van, but the girl clung to her for dear life. The employee resolved to keep holding her, rubbing her back soothingly. 

“Sweetie,” She cooed to the kid. “I know you're *really* scared right now, but I need you to answer something for me, okay? I just need to know if that scary lady has any other kids.”

Another gunshot from the field. 

The little girl buried her face in the employee's neck and whimpered. The employee and I exchanged a look. 

The corn rustled. Instinctively, I pulled out my knife and positioned myself between the field and the employee holding the little girl. Sam came out with his hands up. 

“We found the other two.” He informed us gravely. 

Not wanting to upset the little girl even more, Sam pulled me aside and whispered to me, “The one definitely was nursed, but he's still breathing. Ambulance is on its way. The other one…”

He looked down. His face spoke for him. 

Both of them had been forced to drink the tar. By some miracle, the ambulance got the one who was still alive to the hospital in record time. I guess they'd had to pump his stomach and do a number of other things to keep him alive, but at least he made it. It's just a shame that we couldn't do the same for the other boy. 

As far as Auntie Rye goes, she retreated to lick her wounds after being shot and stabbed so many times. We strongly advised the farmer to burn that section of field, knowing that this incident would make her even more aggressive. However, the farmer refused. 

“I feel horrible for the little ones. Really, I do.” He explained apologetically. “But I'm barely making ends meet. I'll do whatever I have to keep any more from gettin’ taken. I'm sorry, but I can't afford to lose any of it. I got a family, to take care of, too.”

Victor clearly didn't like this answer, but didn't push him. For one, this wasn't Orion's area of operation, for another, we can't force anyone to follow our advice.

Sam just let out a resigned sigh, “We'll be keeping a close eye on things, too.”

I checked the time. Holy hell, how'd it get so late? Sunset was in *two hours!*

I glanced at Victor. Before I could say anything, he told me, “Yeah, you better go. And good luck.”

The River Kingz knew I'd have to leave early, but hadn't asked why. They had enough on their plates. 

On the way back to Pennsylvania, I was a mess of emotions, all of them negative. I was dreading this meeting with Iolo while still processing that we'd lost another little kid to Auntie Rye. Meanwhile, one survivor was horribly injured, the other scarred for life. 

When Victor had carried the small body out of the corn, he'd covered the kid's face with his jacket. All any of us could see of the poor thing were its dangling pale legs. 

I hope that the farmer keeps his promise. I hope no one else has to bury their own child. Regarding the farmer’s decision, I understand that times are hard, especially for local farms. When it comes to the atypical, choices concerning them rarely are guilt or consequence-free. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

If any of yinz get that call from Victor, that may be something you'll have to learn the hard way. 

Speaking of bad choices, I was dreading having to deal with mine. Before heading off to Ohio, I had hidden the sword in the trunk under a blanket, worried that I’d forget it otherwise. Somehow, I managed to arrive right at dusk. I retrieved Ratcatcher before venturing into the woods, using my flashlight to navigate through the darkness. 

There was the orange glow of a fire up ahead as I approached the skull trees. I remember thinking that at least I'd have some light while we did this. 

The mechanic lounged in a folding chair, playing a song that sounded vaguely familiar. It wasn't one of his spells. As I puzzled over it, he looked up at me, clearly annoyed. Wow. That was a new record for me. I'd managed to irritate him without uttering a single word. 

“You sure took your sweet time.” He commented. 

“I came here from Ohio.” I explained, keeping my tone neutral. 

“I don't care. When I tell you to get here, you get here.”

*Well, we’re off to a great start.*

“Should we get started?” I asked, anxious to get this over with. 

The mechanic set his banjo off to the side, “We don't have the luxury of startin’ off with basics. We're gonna have to do this quick, so you better be taking this seriously.”

That prompted me to question. “Are we under some sort of time constraint?” 

He stood up, but instead of answering, he said, “I've been thinking it would be best if you could see what you're really fightin’. Besides, you ain't fallin’ for this pretty boy act I got goin’ on anyway.”

I'm choosing to take his avoidance as a ‘yes.’ But what was the hurry? Was something coming? If it was, it had to be big.

The mechanic held a hand out, something small between his thumb and forefinger. The flickering light of the fire revealed that it was a four-leaf clover. 

Like hagstones, four-leaf clovers can be used to lift the veil over the Neighbors, allowing us to see the things they'd rather keep hidden. Unfortunately, they don't provide any additional protection against them, so it's best to use them with caution. If caught, any Neighbor you take a peek at probably won't be too happy with you. 

After accepting the clover, I was once again faced with the mechanic's true appearance. The fire reflected ominously off of the armor-like chitin covering his body. Those dragonfly wings appeared to be almost as long as I am tall. And *God,* those teeth… they looked like they could snap my arm clean off. 

“How do you see?” I asked casually, not wanting to give him the satisfaction of seeing me gape at him. 

I regret asking. I really do. 

He was more than happy to answer. The chitin just below the crown-like structures on the top of his head began to lift away with a series of soft clicking noises. Two bulbous, compound eyes glimmered in the faint light, the grids within them distorting the flames’ reflection. Looking into them evoked all the same suffocating, nauseating panic that I would imagine drowning does. 

“Don't you be worryin’ about my vision, pup.” Iolo said with a chuckle, the chitin crawling back to cover those terrible eyes up once again. 

I suppressed a shudder, unsheathing Ratcatcher. 

“I want you to get a feel for that weapon,” He told me. “That's why you'll be practicing with that while I'll be using a wooden one. Wouldn't wanna kill ya by accident, now, would we?”

The way he said that last part didn't sound sincere. 

The wooden sword he produced matched Ratcatcher in length. In his clawed hand, it looked far more intimidating than it should have despite its blunt ends. 

“First things first, pup,” Iolo started, advancing on me slowly. I followed him with my eyes and the tip of my sword. “I noticed back at the cabin that you keep wantin’ to stand there and swing, which won't do. Footwork is one of the most important parts of this, especially since most of the things you'll be fightin’ are stronger than you.”

That was the only introduction I had before I spent a good part of the night dancing around, trying to avoid having my ribs bashed in by a wooden sword. It was slightly less embarrassing than being bested by a butter knife, but only marginally. 

To my credit, I didn't get smacked *every* time. Just most of the time. In turn, Iolo was moving much slower than usual. He was going easy on me. Well, *easier,* anyway. He definitely wasn't hesitating to let me know the hard way when I was fucking up. 

“You're lettin’ me push you where I want you.” He commented when I eventually found myself trapped between him and a gathering of skull trees. “You're not supposed to be runnin’ from me. You should be tryin’ to find an opening. You gettin’ me?”

I thought I did. Maybe? We were about to find out. 

I managed to duck under the wooden sword as the mechanic swung it in an arc towards my shoulder. While low, I charged forward, digging my shoulder into his midsection. He staggered back, but didn't go down, retaliating with a sharp prod in my ribs with the wooden sword's hilt. Right over where a bruise was already forming from a mistake I'd made earlier in this training session. Swallowing back the pain, I shoved away from him, staying low, hearing the wooden sword whizz above my head. 

“There ya go.” He said, almost sounding impressed. 

I took a chance and swung Ratcatcher, not surprised when he blocked it. I leapt back with the sword back in front of me, trying to keep some distance between us without letting him herd me again. Easier said than done when your opponent isn't human and is still a force to be reckoned with even while holding himself back. 

One thing that became clear is that I need to work on my stamina. Ordinarily, I don't tire easily thanks to my occupation, but I'm not used to long, drawn-out fights like this, not anymore. This went on for hours. 

My legs were shaking, my arms were sore, and I was beginning to accept that I was going to have more bruises than unmarked skin by the time Iolo announced that he was satisfied with my progress for the night. 

Of course, it wouldn't be an encounter with Iolo if we didn't have at least one heart attack-inducing conversation. 

I was seated in the grass, trying to catch my breath while quietly questioning whether or not I was permitted to leave. He was back in his chair, strumming on his banjo again. Watching those claws, I have to wonder how he manages to play without snapping the strings in two. 

With the nonchalance normally reserved for smalltalk about the weather, he asked, “So, your family seems to have a history of fuckin’ around and findin’ out. Is it a genetic predisposition or some shit?”

I did a double take. “Excuse me?”

“That picture in your Jeep. It fell out when I pulled down the visor. Someone clearly had some objections to the bride and groom.”

I was suddenly glad that I'd had the foresight to hide my registration and everything else with my legal name in Reyna's safe after getting the vehicle. There wasn't a doubt in my mind that he'd looked for it. If I ever got pulled over, I'd just have to take whatever fines I got for needing to bring in the paperwork after the fact. 

“I'm actually not sure about what the full story behind the picture is.” I answered honestly. “We found that a while back and thought it was strange.”

He shrugged, “You got enough on your plate. Probably better that you don't know.”

The way he'd said that made my ears perk up, just as he'd known it would. 

I furrowed my brows at him, “Do you know what did that?”

“I might have a good idea ‘bout it.” He replied, the smile in his voice making his tone infuriating. “And I could very easily find out.”

With a sigh, I muttered, “I already know you won't tell me out of the kindness of your heart.” 

“Right you are, pup!” He stopped playing briefly. “I don't expect you to do this tonight, so consider this offer on-going. Disarm me and I'll give ya the answers you're lookin’ for.” 

*God dammit.* 

Admittedly, when it came to figuring out what happened to my grandfather, I wasn't sure where to start. The only thing I knew was that his name had been taken and him along with it, which wasn't much to go off of. Any Neighbor could do that, including the one in front of me. 

Unfortunately, I also have to admit that the mechanic would be one of my best bets at finding out. His job was to track people down, after all. 

*God fucking dammit.*

“You ever get sick of trying to mess with me?” I asked without thinking. 

He laughed, beginning to play another song. “What can I say? Life gets borin’ when you get old, pup. Gotta get your kicks where ya can.”

There was a part of me that was tempted to fling myself at him right then and there. Very tempted. I knew I was exhausted. And even if I wasn't, I knew I would still surely lose at the skill level I was at. 

But has that ever stopped me before?

I stood up slowly, taking inventory, feeling every ache. This was a bad idea. But after being smacked around so much, I was hoping to get just one hit on him. Just one. And he wasn't concerned with me, at the moment. Maybe I could catch him off guard. 

I told him that I was intending to head out soon. Technically, not a lie. He didn't acknowledge me, focused on his strumming. 

Slyly, I pretended to rub at a bruise while I placed my hand on Ratcatcher’s hilt, measuring Iolo for any type of response. He kept playing, his head down. 

I drew Ratcatcher and stepped forward at the same time, drawing the blade in a swift arc. 

He must've known what I was up to the moment I stood up. In just a few fluid motions, he'd ducked under my blade and stopped me by wrapping one claw around my wrist, the other still holding his banjo by the neck.  

 Am I really that predictable? Good Lord. 

“I'd say that was a good try, but I can't lie to you.” He taunted, letting the edge of one of those claws drag across my skin as he held my wrist. 

Those teeth looked even more gruesome up close. The fangs of a grizzly bear would've been more welcoming than the mechanic's grin. 

“You know, if you were one of my Hunters, you'd lose this hand for even tryin’ it.” The claw dug deeper into my skin to punctuate his point. I clenched my teeth as it burrowed in, a small stream of blood running down my arm. “Luckily for you, I need ya in one piece.”

His grip suddenly disappeared and he returned to his seat, going back to playing his banjo as if nothing had happened. I left for real after that, internally kicking myself for that bad attempt on his life. It was impulsive and reckless, two things I didn't need to be.

When I got back to my Jeep, I examined the mark his claw had left on me. For how much it stung, it wasn't too bad. Nothing some Neosporin and a bandage wouldn't take care of. 

When I made it home, I discovered Deirdre was reading one of the books I keep telling myself I'll get around to someday. *Annihilation.* She looked up with a jolt. Instantly, I felt bad for startling her. 

However, she was more concerned with me. I hadn't taken any shots to the face, thankfully; Iolo had been aiming primarily for my torso. I was black and blue all over, but otherwise, it didn't feel like I had too severe of injuries. Regardless, I thought it best to check with the urgent care to make sure I didn't have any internal bleeding. 

“This isn't training,” Deidre snapped with a frown. “This is *torture.*”

“Combat training normally is.” I replied mildly, painfully pulling my shirt back into place. “It'll get easier as I learn more. At least, that's how it worked when I was in the army.”

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending Iolo. He's a scumbag. But I had many superiors back in the day that adopted the same approach to training as he did; they drop you right into it, and either you sink or you learn to swim. 

“I might be able to help with the footwork part.” Deidre offered unexpectedly. 

She held her arm out to me, thumb up, palm out to the side. Unsure, I set mine on top of hers, but she gently moved it so that my wrist rested against hers, our palms facing away from each other. 

She took short, quick steps, beginning to move in a circle. Still unsure, I followed suit, trying to match her as best as possible, but I suspected I looked like a bull trying to imitate a ballerina. 

“I know it's not exactly the same,” She muttered, pausing briefly to switch arms in one graceful twirl, then began to circle in the opposite direction. I clumsily attempted to do the same. “But from what I understand about the matter, sword fighting is about timing and rhythm. Dancing is no different.” 

I didn't have the heart to tell her that in reality, combat isn't pretty. It's fast and ugly. That definitely was the case when it came to dealing with Iolo earlier that night. Though, I suppose if I had to grasp at straws, I could argue that it might help get my stamina closer to what it needs to be. 

Truthfully, I just wanted an excuse to keep the dance going. As tired as I was, I was willing to fight the exhaustion if it meant I got to do something pleasant that night. Even if I was not very good at it. 

But like with using the sword, I'll learn. I'll learn how to become a hero. I'll learn how to dance with a pretty fairy. I'll learn about what happened to my grandfather.
