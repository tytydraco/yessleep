I anxiously lingered around in the common room mezzanine of my apartment complex as I paced around trying to work up the courage to begin my economics project. At this pace I was going nowhere, the passion I exerted for that class was that which an oyster exerts at life, so none at all. I mindlessly toted my vape which had begun tasting like fermented yeast when I noticed my friend, Alex, who was always studying like he had Chinese parents, was doing something completely out of character. He was standing across the room staring at the tv news with a few other residents. He wasn’t studying, and nobody here really gave enough of a fuck to even look at the tv. I could tell something was off so I joined in. 

“Uh what’s going on?”

Blueberry, who I decided to nickname after a blackberry because she had the personality of one but didn’t want to be racist so blue was used instead, turned around to face me as her ramen noodle hair flipped and said 

“The city’s going on quarantine, again.”

She was sitting in one of the 4 chairs circled around the tv along with Yali and Alex.

A strange excitement trickled in the back of my mind as the stress of college began to fade

“What happened this time?” I asked as I tried to look serious while fighting the urge to smile 

“There’s a national security threat but nobody’s saying what it is probably not to cause mass panic”

“We should rob a store then right?”

“Hell yea we should” Yali chimed in. 

Yali was a towering 6 '9 tall Arab man with a sharp beard and haircut and the muscular build of a greek god. He wore glasses and his jawline was sharp enough to circumcise me. He was sitting on one of the chairs facing the tv with his head turned back towards me.



“You’re gonna get us in trouble” blueberry said 

“I was joking” I snapped back 

Suddenly all my senses were strained to the max as my vision became what I could only describe as a bright white shock while a piercing ringing emanated through my soul as my entire body cringed in disorientation. For a few moments all I felt was absolute tension while my body cringed in adrenaline. I’ve never had a headache in my life and this was not normal.

As I began to reorient myself I noticed everyone else in the room had the same confused look on their faces. 

A few moments passed as we all  looked around in awkward confused harmony before I  spoke up 

“What the shit was that?”

After everyone else expressed their individual variations of “what the fuck” alex finally said

“I know you all felt that, we gotta find out if anyone else did too.”

Then a black honda civic crashed into the bus stop across the street followed by a few other cars all crashing and running a train on each other like some sick vehicular orgy. 

“Yea I guess were not alone” I replied

It must’ve clicked in all of us that shit was going down and we needed to prepare like it’s the apocalypse because Blueberry said

“You know what robbing that store actually sounds like a fantastic idea”

No one said it but we all knew we had to prepare for whatever this was. 

We all went to our apartments, packed our bags and would meet again in the common room. Nobody knew but in my bag I packed a brick of meth and ketamine just in case but as I packed I tripped and accidentally snorted a gram that was already broken down on the table.

When I got down I could see a couple people were down the street all hurrying. 

….



I was skimming canned products off the shelves into my black duffel bag as I ran through the isles when suddenly I stopped at the sight of a hulking irish man reaching for the last 6 packs of ramen noodles. 

I knew I had to get those spicy tom yum ramen noodles. I immediately sprinted down the aisle towards him and snatched the ramen noodles from his hand. He immediately spun to face me and punched me right in the face then he forced me into a chokehold. Somehow I didn’t feel shit maybe it was the ketamine I accidentally snorted but I could also feel the meth surging through my veins. 

I tried to free myself with both hands to no avail but I wasn’t gonna let this fucker take my damn ramen noodles so I did what I knew I had to..

With the burning passion of a pussy deprived navy seal on meth I sent my right hand straight to his nuts then I squeezed so hard I assured that any babies he makes will come out with a fossilized imprint of my hand on their body.

He instantly screamed in pure agony but I didn’t let go. In fact I started to twist it like I was about to braid his balls. 

With that he broke his stranglehold of me to grab my hand in a desperate attempt to break himself free so I took the chance to snatch the ramen noodles and run.

I put the ramen in my bag and yelled 

“Let’s go we got what we need” 

We all dipped out of the store and ran back to our apartment complex. 

As the 4 of us entered the lobby we all froze. The mezzanine looked wrong and my eyes couldn’t process the image in front of me. It was a 2 dimensional plane like a drawing, flattened with no depth. Somehow the entire floor collapsed into 2 dimensions. The couches, tables and everything within were unfolded like reverse origami and we could see the insides of every object. The picture seemed much larger than the space it occupied yet it wasn’t.

Alex took a step towards it as we all stood trying to process what the fuck was in front of us.

“Whoa should I touch it?”

Yali immediately yanked him by the collar holding him back (his muscular arm had veins protruding with such intensity he was 1 papercut away from bleeding out).

“Habibi don’t do that look over there” 

With his other arm he pointed to the upper left corner of the collapsed mezzanine. A brown man was splayed across the image frozen in place like the outline of a body in a crime scene. His entire body was distorted in an unfathomable way which could not be described. 

Alex froze with a look of shock, fear and awe on his face. 

“Holy shit it’s expanding we got to fucking get our shit and go”

The edges of the 2 dimensional image were slowly expanding, collapsing everything it touched into the picture.

“We can’t go up it’s going to touch the elevators by the time we reach our rooms we have to get out” Blueberry’s voice trembled as she backed up. 

“Where do we even go?” I snapped back as we all began backing up ready to break into a sprint.

“Come on guys lets go to my car, it’s right outside” Blueberry was already jogging out the lobby and we all followed.
