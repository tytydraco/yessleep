How much can you really trust your mind? This is a question I think about a lot(Crazy people don't know they're crazy)You can be fine, having a great day. Then, right when you’re heading to bed, your mind will think of everything that scares you.

Ideally, you could be thinking of your girlfriend, the OKC Dynasty we’re about to witness, or how incredible that last episode of Andor you watched was (the Gorman arc, especially the episode "Who Are You”  best Star Wars ever!). Then, all of a sudden, your mind reminds you about the Demon Grandma you know all too much about (the real ones remember bloodstains).

Fear destroys any rational thought. You know when you’re home alone and hear a sound that kind of resembles someone walking? It's nothing, you’d say. Then you see something walk past the corner of your eye. Again, nothing, right? All of this is a series of events that starts your descent into the downward spiral known as fear. A little trick that has always helped me stop this was to take a second, take a deep breath, and say, "it's all in your mind." These 5 simple words have helped more than I could ever imagine. Well, until one night.

I had just finished school and realized that tonight would be my first night alone in the new house. Mom had a date that I heard a little too much about, but I was happy for her. Plus, I was excited that I'd finally get a chance to catch up on Pluribus (Rhea❤️).

 It was around 6:15 when I heard loud banging upstairs.  
"It's just the cat," I said to myself. What else could it be? Theres nothing and nobody here. Of course "this is all in your mind." I say. 

At 7:00, things started to get weird. I heard what sounded like running up and down the stairs. Knowing I was the only one home, I got kind of freaked out. I was convinced it was nothing, but I still had to check. I stood at the bottom of the stairs for two minutes, staring into emptiness (surprisingly empty just was nothing, now that I think about it). 

Still, even after checking, that uneasy feeling lingered. Fear is a bitch when you’re home alone, but I wasn’t going to let it ruin my night. I took a deep breath and whispered, "It’s all in your mind." And just like that, I felt calm.

At about 7:30, my mind began to play tricks again. I saw what seemed to be a shadowy figure slipping across the room(only in my peripherals of course).I snapped my head around, but nothing was there. "It's all in your mind" I said to myself. 

Around 8:00 p.m., I finished the show. I headed upstairs to pee, expecting a dull night of scrolling afterward. I noticed my door was open, which was strange. I’d stopped leaving it open ever since my cat started acting up.l and using my bed as litter box. A cold wave of unease ran over me. I told myself again, "It’s just my mind," and continued to the bathroom.

On my way out I saw it. The figure of nothingness. Pure, endless blackness. It seemed to swallow the corners of the room, stretching shadows into shapes that didn’t belong. I never imagined something so simple could be so terrifying, so so  terrifying. I ran to my room faster than I've ever run before and slammed the door.

This is where the timeline gets fuzzy as I froze. My body locked up. Around midnight, my mom found me in the fetal position, curled up in the corner of my room. 

The next morning I tried to explain what happened. She didn’t believe me(she's a bigger skeptic than me) All I could think about was that thing, its face... Or lack thereof for being honest. It's.burned into my mind. I tried to rationalize everything: the footsteps, the shifting shadows, that shape I saw. "It was all in your mind," I told myself again.

I still believe in that little phrase. So whenever I’m home alone and I think I hear or see something, I take a second and say, "It’s all in your mind." Just like I do every night as I lie in my bed and feel and see that black nothingness hovering over my bed with its blank stare, oppressive and all-consuming. I whisper to myself, "It’s all in my mind," as I close my eyes and drift off. I hear faint whisper replying "are you sure?"
