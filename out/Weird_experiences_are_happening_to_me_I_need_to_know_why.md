To start this off, I've never done this before. However there isn't much to lose, so here's my story. Ever since I was young, I've been more attuned to the supernatural. Starting when I was 11, I had an outer body experience where this snake figure with white slitted eyes visited me. It said one day, it would come for me and that I shouldn't resist. It threatened to torture my family whilst I watched, that I'd have to do as they say. I got woken up by my mum, asking why I was screaming help me over and over...I didn't even hear the screams. 


Years pass, occasionally I'd see those same slitted eyes in the dark. Weird, very vivid dreams keep plaguing me, that something is always chasing me, I feel the darkness and it always says it's going to get me. Things get worse, I start drawing Norse runes (I know, totally weird but I went into a trance when it happened.) Drew them on a mirror, I have pictures of said runes. Also, I'm not prone to hallucinations before anyone asks. 

In my sleep I'll visit these places I've never been to, one was a place with an endless green field and a sun that was almost too bright. A guy in red and gold armour, told me to be careful. One was a bar with no outside details, a bar with booths yet all the windows showed was white bright light. People I didn't recognise were there, old and young. The most recent was this very Roman kind of place, pillars with eagles on the tops, the baths and people dressed very similar for that era of time. It was an island, it was peaceful though. Then evil wise, we are talking foggy, dark forests or trapped in some very old fashioned house. 

I sometimes speak in a dilect that is not known to me, and I feel just like I want answers. It's so frustrating, to go through all of this without really knowing why. Perhaps it's some kind of curse, but maybe not. 

These things keep happening to me, and I thought writing this might get me some answers that I'm looking for. I've always been drawn to the supernatural, it's always just been there. It seems like it'll keep happening, but I don't want to stumble in the dark anymore.

More recently, the vivid dreams keep happening like something is trying to tell me what I need to know. By the time I wake up, it completely disappears. it feels on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't remember. it's very annoying.


Sometimes when I close my eyes, I see faces I haven't seen before. Or eyes looking back at me. I honestly don't know why I've been going through this, and I'm hoping maybe some of you have been through similar things? I'm not mentally ill or anything and I don't take drugs, I'm just looking for help or advice.
