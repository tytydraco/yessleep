[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jfeznw/i_worked_as_an_intern_for_a_tech_company_i_barely/)

A full year had passed since my encounter at DataCorp. And in all that time, I hadn’t spoken a word about it. Couldn’t. Legal consequences aside, who the hell would believe me?

Life had gone to shit since then. I went from an intern at DataCorp to delivering pizzas for minimum wage. Nothing against the job—honest work is honest work—but every delivery, every late-night shift, felt like a mockery of the future I was supposed to have.

And the sleep? Forget about it.

I’d wake up gasping in the middle of the night, my skin clammy, my heart racing. I could feel something watching me. Not in a paranoid, vague way—but something real. Something precise. Like the cold, mechanical gaze of a scanning optic, waiting for me to move.

I did my best to push it down, to chalk it up to stress or trauma or whatever. But no matter how much I tried to bury it, TR-2’s words echoed back.

***The last one tried that too.***

DataCorp knew. They knew exactly what was happening. They just didn’t care. Because this wasn’t some one-off anomaly.

This was something **bigger.**

Then I got the email.

It was the first time in a year that I truly felt afraid.

⸻

**Subject:** We Need To Meet

**From:** Noel R.

[n.rellek@protonmail.com](mailto:n.rellek@protonmail.com)

You don’t know me, but I know what happened to you. DataCorp happened.

It happened to me too. It’s still happening to me.

We need to meet. In person. There won’t be much of a time window—I’m sorry for that.

If you want to know the truth, meet me at Stacy’s. Old diner, two miles northeast of DataCorp’s headquarters. 1:29 am. Not a second later. 

If I’m not there, whatever you do—LEAVE. Immediately.

\-Noel R.

⸻

I stared at the screen, my mind racing.

This could have been a trap. Some DataCorp psycho playing with me, luring me out so they could cut me up into pieces and sink me to the bottom of a lake.

But it didn’t feel like that.

There was something in the message—something real. The fear wasn’t staged. It bled through every word, through the tight, desperate way it was written.

Whoever Noel R. was, they weren’t just some troll.

They were like me.

And they were running out of time.

\-

Sitting in my car felt like an eternity. The dashboard clock glowed dimly—**1:25 a.m.**

The blood in my veins felt ice-cold.

It was like I was back in DataCorp’s sublevels again. Only this time, there were no sterile hallways, no drone of humming machinery, no camera feeds observing my every move. But that didn’t mean I wasn’t being watched.

I glanced at the clock again. **1:28 a.m.** Any moment now.

Then I saw the headlights.

An older model Jeep pulled in beside me, its engine cutting out with a low, mechanical groan. The headlights flicked off, leaving nothing but a faint red glow from the taillights.

Then my heart stopped.

A tall, grizzled Black man stepped out from the driver’s side.

**Oh fuck. I’m done for.**

He rapped on my passenger window. I hesitated, my hand hovering over the switch. My instincts screamed at me to peel out of the lot and never look back.

But I rolled it down anyway.

“You’re not— You can’t be.”

The man let out a humorless chuckle. “Noel Rellek. Not what you were expecting?”

His voice was low, steady, but there was something in his eyes—something hollowed-out, like a man who’d spent too many years looking over his shoulder.

I couldn’t find words. My brain was still putting it together.

“Leon Keller. Software engineer at DataCorp for twenty-seven years.”

And then it clicked. **Noel Rellek. Leon Keller.** A mirror image. A false identity. 

Suddenly, he thrust out his hand. I barely had time to react before I felt the small, plastic rectangle drop into my palm.

“A thumb drive. Single-use. Encrypted. You’ll only get one look—so make it count.”

I tightened my grip around it. This was too much. It felt like I’d stepped off the edge of something deep and bottomless.

Leon took a breath. He looked tired—like a man who had been running from something impossible to escape.

“Hey, kid. I’m sorry about this. I’m sorry you’re involved. I wish I could help more, but this is all I’ve got left to give. There aren’t many good guys at DataCorp…”

His voice dropped, just above a whisper.

“Just promise me one thing.”

I looked up.

I’ll never forget the way he looked in that moment—

“**Burn those fuckers to the ground, will ya?**”

I must have sat in front of my laptop for hours. The thumb drive sat next to me, untouched.

I hadn’t put it in. I couldn’t.

Thoughts spun in my head, looping in endless, nauseating circles. My encounter in Sublevel 4 had been bad enough, but this—this was something else. Something bigger. Something I wasn’t prepared for.

Finally, with a deep breath, I slid the drive into the port.

The screen flickered. No files, no folders—just a black-and-white CCTV feed, timestamped from a year ago.

The sound came first. Garbled. Warped.

Then the footage.

I stopped breathing.

**It was me.**

Jesus Christ—it was *me.*

I was sprawled on the cold floor, TR-2’s massive, lifeless body next to mine. Scientists hovered over me, masked figures in sterile suits. Their voices were tinny, distorted, but one phrase came through clear:

*“The integration will take time. He won’t know what’s going on. We have to make sure he isn’t aware of the situation. Life has to go back to normal for him. And when we’re ready—”*

A pause.

*“We will activate TR-3.”*

I slammed the laptop shut.

**No. No.**

My stomach lurched. My skin burned. I pressed shaking hands to my temples, half-expecting to feel metal, circuits, something *wrong* beneath my skin.

I remember waking up. Signing that fucking NDA. Running out of there.

Didn’t I?

**Didn’t I?!**

The bile rose in my throat. My vision blurred.

*Integration. TR-3.*

Oh, God.

They got me.

They were *inside me.*

Then my phone lit up.

A new message.

Hands trembling, I unlocked the screen.

**Unknown Number:** *You don’t have much time. There’s a man who can help you. I’m sending you a secure message now with his geolocation.*

The sender’s name at the bottom:

**Noel R—**
