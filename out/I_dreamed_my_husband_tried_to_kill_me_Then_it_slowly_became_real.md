I’m running through the forest tripping over roots. 



There’s darkness all around me, no sign of road or any other life. 



Adrenaline is flowing through my body. I can hear myself panting hard; my heart rate is over 200. 



I’m starting to feel dizzy, my body is getting tired, maybe I have finally escaped, but then I hear that bloodcurdling call. 



“Abby, where are you?!” Screamed into the dead of the night.



I look back and there he is, the monster of my nightmare. 



My husband is standing in the middle of two trees with a hatchet.



“Found you!” echoes through the forest as he starts sprinting in my direction. I scream out and start running again.



Then I wake up in my bed at home. 



I jolt all the way upright and scream again. There’s a pool of cold sweat that formed underneath me.



“Jesus Christ, Abby, what’s going on?” says Dan and tries to touch my hand.



I immediately jump out of bed and look at him with my eyes wide open, my pupils shaking.



“Honey, what happened? Talk to me.” He says as he slowly starts getting out of bed.



“Don’t. Don’t fucking walk any closer.”



I stand in a curled-up pose, almost like a fetus standing upright, watching him like a prey animal watches its predator.



“Are you gonna finally talk to me or what?” Says Dan with annoyance more than compassion behind his voice.



“I just had the worst nightmare of my life, Dan! I had a dream, and you were chasing me through the forest trying to kill me with a hatchet! It felt so real!” I shout out. 



I can feel my voice cracking as I say the last line, and then I sit down on the floor and start crying.



“I’m sorry, honey. I’m sorry. I didn’t know. Come here, you know I would never hurt you.” He approaches me. 



I try to move my body away, but he still hugs me. My body tenses up again, but the longer he holds me, the more it calms down.



“It was terrifying, Dan.” I whisper out in between my tears.



“I know, I know. I’m sorry you had to go through that, but you know I would never hurt you, baby.” He now sounds calm and soothing. 



I hug him back, and he strengthens the grip around my body. The world is okay again.



It’s a lazy Sunday of mid-spring in North Carolina. 



The warmth is finally here, but it’s still not too hot to stay home. We plan to take our dog to a nearby lake.



Our dog is a beautiful German Shepherd named Zippy, full of energy and happiness. 



We got him a few years ago from a rescue station and have loved him since.



At the lake, we park our car and start our walk. 



We’re laughing about one of Dan’s jokes when, around the turn, a mom with a small child turns up. 



We don’t have time to call Zippy back. He runs to the family and starts circling them.



Luckily, both of them adore him. He’s excited, but then I see Dan running after him.



He quickly starts apologizing and pulls Zippy by his harness. Way harder than necessary. I run to them, too.



The mom starts saying that it's okay, and that they love dogs. 



Once they turn and start walking, I see Dan watching to see if they turn around and then slap Zippy across the nose. 



He grabs his harness tighter and starts muttering horrendous things at him.



When he lets go, Zippy lets out a faint moan and walks away with his tail between his legs.



“What are you doing, Dan?!” 



“What?! He’s not supposed to do that shit, okay? Maybe you should have trained him better.” He almost screams out. 



His face is twisted with anger. There's hateful fire behind his eyes.



I wrestle Zippy out of his hand and put him on the leash. 



Dan is still looking at me with that anger in his eyes. The rest of the walk is silent. 



I ask him if we can cut it short. He groans, we get back to the car, and ride home.



I put Zippy into his bed and gave him extra love. 



I’m still angered and puzzled by Dan’s behaviour. I have never seen him acting like that.



When he comes in, the anger in his eyes is gone. He’s now looking at the floor like a child who broke something.



I told him to come over and scold him for what he had done at the park.



“I don’t know what has gotten into me, Abby. You know that’s not who I am. It’s like something took over me.” I can see tears forming in his eyes.



I sit there for a second. I’m still angry about what he did to Zippy, and I’m sure he crossed the line, but he’s still my husband.



I decide to forgive him and tell him it’s okay. 



The rest of the week floats like any other. That Friday, we are supposed to go for a long weekend to a cabin that Dan’s parents own two hours away near the mountains. 



He’s getting really excited; he loves that place. 



On Wednesday, I come home. Dan has gauze wrapped all around his right palm. 



Apparently, he cut himself when he was fixing something in the garage.



When he leaves to brush his teeth for the night, I quickly check Zippy for any sign of abuse. Luckily, there’s nothing on him.



After checking, I feel a little guilty for doubting him. The thing that happened last week was most likely a mistake.



When I wake up on Friday, Dan is already awake, staring at me. I almost jump out of bed, and then start laughing.



It takes him a second to laugh. He stares at me with a strange grin, probably trying to make a joke.



A few seconds later, he starts laughing too, and tells me how excited he is to go to the cabin. 



We pack up our stuff and get on our way. 



The cabin is secluded, and the nearest neighbors are almost two miles away. 



It sits on a dirt road that leads for another mile into the forest and stops.



We settle in, and Dan decides to go chop up some firewood. The cabin has a fireplace, and we want to make our night even more cozy.



I prepare two drinks and walk out to give one to Dan. He is standing in front of a log of wood, a hatchet in his hands.



The image of dream Dan standing in the forest at night flashes in front of my eyes. 



My face goes pale, my legs start shaking, and I gasp, almost dropping my drinks.



Dan looks at me, laughs, and goes back to chopping up the wood. I push that thought out of my mind.



“What happened there, honey?” He says while laughing.



“Nothing.”



“Oh, nothing, are you sure?” He asks with a strange grin, almost like he knows what I was thinking.



“Yeah, nothing. Here you go, your vodka soda.”



“Thanks!”



I walk away, quickly down my drink, and prepare a new one. Then I sit around, cuddling Zippy until Dan gets done chopping up the firewood.



The rest of the day is spent playing board games and watching movies. It starts raining as we are about to go to bed.



The storm is pretty bad, with lightning hitting fairly close. Zippy was always scared of storms, so we let him sleep in our room tonight.



I wake up. It’s still dark outside, and the storm is now raging on. I get up from bed to use the restroom. 



My eyes are still trying to open, but the light in the bathroom wakes me up.



As I am walking out, I look to the kitchen, and there he stands. The shadow of Dan holding the hatchet again.



I stand there, frozen, gripping the door handle, my whole body shaking. Then the figure turns fully towards me and starts running.



As I let out a scream, lightning strikes nearby. The lightning strike lights up the house, and the shadowy figure disappears.



I crumble to the floor, crying. 



The morning after, Dan doesn’t ask me about what happened last night. 



It’s raining all day, so we decide to stay in. We spent most of the day reading and watching TV shows near the fireplace.



We have enough food and drinks, so staying in is not a problem.



What’s strange is that I could swear I would catch Dan staring at me. With a child-like grin and his eyes piercing right through me.



When I get up to go to the kitchen or bathroom, I can feel his gaze following my every move, like an animal looking at its prey.



Whenever I would turn back around, he would be staring back into his book or at the screen.



Zippy keeps a distance away from him. Usually, when we sit down to watch TV, he sits between us, but today he only sits on my side.



He stares and backs off a little when Dan gets off the couch.



We decided to call it a night early. Dan says he’s tired. I am tired of him, and that day too, so I am happy to go to sleep and get back home.



I wake up. The storm is still raging on. I swear I could hear a sound in the kitchen.



When I look at the bed, Dan isn’t in it. A wave of cold runs through my body, and I can feel my stomach cramping.



I can’t tell you why, but something inside of me knows what’s going to happen.



I sit in that bed for a couple of minutes before I have enough courage to walk out. 



I walk into the hallway and slowly peer into the kitchen.



The shadow figure is standing there again. I let out a faint gasp, but I try to convince myself that it’s my mind playing tricks on me.



I stand in the hallway for what feels like hours, then the lightning strikes again.



Instead of the shadow figure going away. It lights it up. Dan is standing there with a hatchet in his hands, grinning like a maniac with his eyes wide open.



“Hey, Abby!” He screams out.



I don’t hesitate and bolt through the back door. Running right into the forest.



I hear the door shut behind me, but then a loud “Shit!” echoes. 



I look back. Dan slid on some mud behind our house. This gave me enough time to make a run for it.



I am running through the dead of the night and rain, trying not to fall, hoping that I would lose him.



The mud is cold on my feet. I can feel the rain hitting my face.



“Abby, where are you?” echoes through the forest.



I look back, and he’s standing between two trees. 



A lightning strike lights up the whole forest. He still has that manic face.



“Found you!” He screams out. 



I start running again, but he’s too fast. I can hear his footsteps approaching me.



His breath is almost on my neck. I can sense the hatchet rising in his hands.



Is this it?



Then I hear another sound. It’s Zippy. 



He jumps at Dan and starts tearing at his arm.



Dan screams out. 



I start running again, with their struggle still echoing through the woods.



Somehow, I make it onto the road we came on and manage to stop a car coming by.



The rest of it is a blur. I only remember the police calling the hospital they took me to, informing them that they managed to catch Dan.



Apparently, some driver saw him running around the road like a lunatic with his hatchet.



Zippy made it out alive. He had to get some operations at the vet, but luckily, he’s all healthy now.



Dan confessed to the crime. The police officer said that he bragged about almost killing me.



Sometimes when it rains, I swear I can still hear him scream.



“Found you!”
