I woke up from sleep with a terrible headache, I wouldn't have opened my eyes if I hadn't felt like I was sitting on a metal block below me without a pillow. When I tried to stand up, I hit my head on a metal bars... I was inside a dog cage, completely naked, and my body had deep scratches... I looked around, I was in a place with a disgusting smell full of moths, the walls were moldy and there were many tables and shelves with jars, books and other things... There was blood and other organs like fingers, eyes and testicles thrown on the floor, and there were boot marks on the floor...


I didn't want to scream, I was very scared and frozen, and I didn't want to attract the attention of whoever was also in this place with me... I looked around the place more and saw a key thrown next to me, and of course without thinking I took it and opened the cage I was in and went out immediately, I took a coat that was on one of the chairs and put it on myself... Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a surveillance camera in the corner of the room... Oh my.


I quickly ran to the door and tried to open it, but it wouldn't open because it was locked. I looked around and tried to find any way to open the door, but I couldn't find any.


After that... I took a large knife with a protrusion at the back that would make it impossible for it to come out easily if it entered the flesh, and I hid behind one of the tables waiting for whoever it was to enter... And indeed I heard the door open, then the door opened and he entered... It wasn't a human, it was... It was a deformed creature... it was a man's head placed on top of something that looked like a white medical device with a screen and buttons and four wheels at the bottom, next to it on each corner were metal rods, one of which had a drip bag connected to his neck... And on the sides of the device, there were two mechanical arms with *human hands from which human nerves came out and entered the device...*


The expression on the face of the man's head that was on top of the device between the metal rods was completely dead, it started staring around the room with dead looks, before it entered and the wheels of the device it was in took it inside... I, despite the fear that took over me, attacked It and pushed it, it fell on its side and shattered on the ground... It shattered, and blood came out of the device, and the man's head separated from it and fell on the ground far from the device, with  *Wires, veins and nerves still connected to it...* and he stared at me with a look as if to say *"Thank you"...*


I rushed out of the room and started running, I ran through a series of corridors, some of which were lit and others were not... but all of them were hideously dirty and full of junk and traces of blood and remains, which I had stepped on until finally I reached one of the rooms...


I saw him in front of me, he was sitting on an operating table, next to him was a woman awake, naked but with her jaw dislocated and her throat exposed... He was a young man with black hair sitting to his right, his face was round and his cheeks and lips were red and his pupils were brown... He was wearing a sweater, his right hand had a glove on each finger of which there was a very long metal claw... and he was using it to play with the vocal cords of the woman in front of him, from her open throat...


He then stared at me coldly... and a smirk formed on his lips, then he removed his hand from the woman's throat and said to me with a warm, sweet voice "Don't worry... I discovered that you're not related to her... So I sent one of my inventions to divorce you... You are not corrupt like her." ....


I don't remember what happened after that, but I immediately found myself on my bed... I was in my usual room, nothing different, I wasn't dreaming this time... I got up from the bed and looked around my body, none of those scratches that I woke up with were on me... It was all a dream.. I got dressed and left my room, I called my mother but I didn't find her... Then I remembered, that woman who was disfigured by the black-haired boy... She looked like my mother....


I quickly ran to my mother's room and stormed in forcefully... There... I didn't find her... I found something else... On the wall behind her bed, there was writing in red spray paint, in bold letters that said. 

"SHE WASN'T YOUR MOTHER, SHE JUST ADOPTED YOU TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU!"



When I approached the wall, I confirmed that there was a small word written next to the red spray paint says 'Mikalo'.
