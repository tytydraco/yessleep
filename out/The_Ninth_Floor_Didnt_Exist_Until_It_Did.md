It was almost 2:30 AM when I got into the elevator. I was helping my cousin move some furniture into his flat on the sixth floor of an old apartment building. Nothing unusual. Just a regular late-night errand in a building I’d visited dozens of times. But that night, something was... off.

The elevator hummed softly as it started moving. I pressed the button for the 6th floor and leaned back, exhausted. As I watched the floor indicator light up—2...3...4...—I felt a faint chill. The kind that makes your skin crawl even when there’s no breeze.

Then something strange happened. The elevator didn’t stop at the 6th floor. It just kept going. Seven… eight… and then—**nine**.

My breath caught.

That building only has **eight floors**. I've climbed to the top. I’ve helped my cousin drag a carpet up the stairs once when the elevator was out. I know there is **no ninth floor**.

But the display said “9,” plain as day. The elevator stopped, dinged gently, and the doors creaked open.

I should have stayed inside. I should’ve hit the emergency button or just ridden it back down. But curiosity tugged at me like a whisper.

The hallway in front of me looked... normal. Dull yellow light from the overhead bulbs flickered slightly. The walls were an off-white shade, peeling in some corners. There were doors—normal-looking apartment doors—with little number plates: **9A, 9B, 9C**.

A faint smell of incense mixed with iron hung in the air.

And silence. That was the worst part. No TVs. No fans. No distant footsteps. Just... silence.

I stepped out. Slowly.

From one of the apartments—9C, I think—I heard a creak. The door was ajar. I approached cautiously. Inside was a dim room lit only by candles. And in the middle of it, an old woman sat on the floor, cross-legged. She was humming something—low, guttural, almost like a chant. Her eyes were closed.

But the moment I stepped closer, her eyes snapped open.

And she smiled.

It wasn’t a smile of warmth. It felt like... recognition. Like she’d been waiting for **me**.

I turned and ran.

Back into the elevator. I didn’t even press a button—it started moving on its own. When the doors opened again, I was on the ground floor. The guard at the desk gave me a puzzled look.

“You alright?” he asked.

“Why does this building have a 9th floor?” I asked him, still out of breath.

He stared at me. “It doesn’t,” he said. “Never did.”

The next day, I came back. The same elevator, same building. Pressed every button.

No 9.

No hallway.

No old woman.

It’s been weeks since then. I’ve had dreams—her face, her hum, that cold smile. And the worst part? Sometimes I wake up at night, and for a second, I swear I see a “9” glowing on my bedroom wall. Faint. Flickering.

Like an invitation.

Or a warning.

I still don’t know if I escaped… or if I just brought the ninth floor home.
