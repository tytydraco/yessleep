I used to work a really strange job several years ago. It’s probably something that you would have never thought about, but I swear to you it was real. It was at a defunct state prison in a major city in Pennsylvania. The prison was closed. There were no inmates, guards, or any other people; there was only me, or rather, whoever was on duty that day. We worked 24-hour shifts all by ourselves. We’d show up at 5am and relieve the guy who was there and then at 5am the next day, someone would relieve you. It was actually really nice. I only worked a handful of days a month, the pay was decent for a college student (I was finishing my degree at the time), and the work was really easy. I wasn’t expected to do much. A couple times a day I had to walk around the inside and outside of the prison to make sure no one was in there. Other than that, sometimes I had to mow a small patch of grass in the admin parking lot, or use an ATV to plow snow out of that lot in the winter.

The state still owned the prison, but was doing nothing with it. Honestly, I think the only reason we were there was to make sure people didn’t break in, hurt themselves somehow, and then sue the state; because they (the state) was not interested in spending any more money on that prison than they absolutely had to. There was no heat or air conditioning, nor was there any running water. There was a porta-potty in the sally sort for our…business and we did have a propane heated, camp shower set up that we could use, but we had to bucket in the water. I think we were lucky that the lights were still on, but they sure as hell never replaced a light bulb. Actually, the only time I ever saw someone there from the state, was when they came one time to take a bunch of razor wire down to send to another, still operating, prison. 

Since we were there for a full 24 hours alone, we were allowed to sleep. One of the newer buildings was the Administration Building, and in that building was the sally port (we were able to open the door so we parked in there), the control room, and our shower. The control room was where we were headquartered and contained all our creature comforts, that is, a cot, a coffee maker, a mini fridge, a 24” Roku TV, and a Hot Spot. Most of the controls in the room no longer functioned, but there were a few that we could still use. In the hallway outside the control room there were three, large metal doors that opened and closed on a track. I don’t know what they are actually called, but we called them the blast doors. On led to the sally port. One led further into the prison/to the main yard, and one led to the main entrance. Only one blast door could be open at a time. There was also the door to the (empty) armory in this hallway and the door to that would only open if all three blast doors were closed. To open and close the doors, there were three switches in the control room. Above each switch was a light. Red meant it couldn’t be moved, green meant it was good to go. Turning the switch counter clockwise opened the corresponding door. Turning the switch clockwise closed the door. There was a separate button to unlock the armory. Needless to say, with all exterior doors locked, the three blast doors closed, and the control room deadbolt closed, the control room felt as good as Fort Knox.

Again, with no heating or cooling the room was kept at a livable temperature with an electric heater or an oscillating fan, depending on what you needed. I never really used the TV, but I would use the hot spot to play online games on a laptop that I’d bring with me. I fooled myself into thinking that I’d do school work with it but let’s be honest, that rarely was the case. The cot wasn’t bad. I think they put a mattress from one of the cells on it because there was an ugly white and blue striped mattress that wasn’t half bad to lay on. With a blanket and pillow that I brought from how, I got many decent night's sleep in that room. All in all, it was a decent gig. It wasn’t really until now, several years later, that I began to remember and realize some strange things happened to me while I worked there. I decided to sit down and write about some of my experiences and thought that you all would like to read about them. I’ll start with just this one, and if there is interest I’ll write about some of the others. 



Like I said, one of my main duties was to walk around this deserted prison a couple times a day and make sure that no one else was in there. My whole time working there (about six or seven months) I never found anyone on the property. In order for the state to know that we were actually doing what we were supposed to do, we had these little plastic dots spread all over the prison, in different areas and buildings. We had a little handheld device that we would use to go and “scan” these dots. One of these dots was in the cafeteria building. This building was in the middle of the main yard. It was separate from all the other buildings. Inside was a large industrial kitchen and a big empty room that used to be the main cafeteria. 

“Hitting” this room (scanning the dot) was really easy and I usually did it on my cell block “round”. In order to keep myself somewhat busy, I split the prison up into a couple different sections and would check each section at different times of the day, usually visiting each section at least twice in a 24-hour period. Anyway, the cafeteria was one of my first stops during my cell block round and was little more than a “drive by”. The building had two doors that were propped open all the time, one facing the building with the control room and the other facing the cell blocks on the other side of the yard. The dot was by the cell block door. So, on my way to the blocks, I would just walk through the one door, across the large empty room, and scan the dot on my way through the other door. On this particular day, I was doing what I always do. I walked through the open door and proceeded through the cafeteria. I was maybe fifteen or twenty feet into the room, not even halfway, when one of the loudest noises I have ever heard in my life erupted from behind me. The bang was deafening. It echoed and reverberated through the empty tile and cinderblock room. In that moment the fear, panic, and adrenaline hit me so hard that my senses were dialed to elevens. I could feel every hair on my body stand on end. I could feel my skin and hear my heart beat. The cold shiver that rocketed down my spine exploded into every inch of my body. 

I whipped around toward the origin of the sound, not knowing what to expect. I had never felt this sort of response from my body before and I honestly, even to this day, could not tell you what I would have done if the situation had not been what it was. That is, it was just the door. It had slammed shut. Almost immediately I felt my body relax. I started breathing again which made me aware that I had stopped in the first place. Then the embarrassment came. I couldn’t believe that I had gotten so frightened. What did I think it was? So, feeling like an idiot, and suddenly very tired from the shock of adrenaline leaving my system, I finished the rest of my round and went back to the control room.

It wasn’t until later that evening, while gaming with my brother and recounting the story to him, obviously downplaying how scared I’d been, that he brought up a question that I had not considered. How did the door just suddenly slam shut? What was keeping it open in the first place? I thought for a moment. Like some of the other doors that were being held open in the prison, I was fairly sure that a large stone, about the size of a soccer ball, was set in front of the door to keep it from closing. At the idea, the familiar cold slithered down my spine and the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I endured the feeling for only a moment before I shook it off, got a cup of coffee, told my brother to shut up (he was laughing at me for “being a sissy”). I used the game we were playing to distract me from what I didn’t want to think about. It must have worked because I didn’t think about it again that night.

Actually, I didn’t think about it again until a few days later when I was back for another shift. I went out for my morning cell block round when I came face to face with the door again. It was standing there, wide open with a large rock placed in front of it. I walked over and checked it. It would have been impossible for the door to have slipped over it. It was a heavy rock and stuck up an inch or two above the bottom of the door. I thought that maybe it was at the side of the door and the door slipped past it and when whoever put it back put it right in the middle so that wouldn’t happen again. That made sense to me, so I continued my investigation. I squatted down and pushed the stone out from in front of the door. The door just hung there. It didn’t even move. It didn’t even sway let alone slam shut. The chills began to slowly return. I checked the hydraulic, automatic door closing mechanism at the top of the door. It was disconnected. I pushed the stone back as the panic began to well in my throat. Maybe it was disconnected after the fact, or it might have broken when it slammed. I hadn’t noticed at the time but maybe it was really windy and the door slipped from the stone and a strong gale slammed it shut. That has to be what happened.

I am embarrassed even now to admit, but I did not enter that building again that day. Instead, I quickly walked around the outside of the building to the other door, stuck just as much of my arm as needed to scan the dot, and then continued on my regular route. I did eventually go back into the cafeteria, days if not weeks later. At some point I completely forgot about the incident until I started recalling them again just recently. Even now it is difficult for me to believe that something unexplainable happened. There are perfectly reasonable explanations for why that door had slammed closed. That’s what I told myself. That’s what I forced myself to believe, and I did believe it. But now, after remembering more of what happened there, I’m not so sure. Looking back at my time there, I feel as though I was lying to myself. Forcing myself to ignore all the strangeness. 



As I sit here and remember now, I can recall more events that begin to be harder and harder to explain away. And, I remember that at the time of those events, when I was there, I was terrified. But it is almost like once I left the prison, I forgot. I forgot about what happened. I forgot about the fear. I actively have to force myself to remember. Now that I am, I feel afraid again and I don’t know why. As I write this, the hairs on my arms tingle and stand on end. At risk of sounding paranoid, I almost feel like I shouldn’t be remembering. It’s like my mind and body are protesting when I try to. I will though, if you want me too. I’m going to post this and see how it does. If people want more I will try to remember more. There are already a couple instances that I vaguely remember but I don’t want to go through the process of remembering and writing them if no one wants to read them. I will try to keep an eye on the comments and respond when I can. Thank you.
