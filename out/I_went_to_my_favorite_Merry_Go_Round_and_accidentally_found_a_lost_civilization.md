There is an abandoned playground that is a few blocks away from my house. It is hauntingly beautiful and ornate. All of the other equipment around it had been demolished, though they had left the merry go round untouched. There wasn't anything creepy about it, I found it comforting to be honest. It had strange pink, winged children instead of horses, which I found interesting. The floor of the Merry Go Round was a pale white with absolutely no design, simple and elegant. The roof of the Merry Go Round was modern-eqsue looking, it was a black cube. I usually hate modern architecture but it looked fresh and unique on this merry go round. Oddly, there were no cracks, or imperfections on it, everything about it was exactly the same as the time it was built.  
  
Around the Merry Go Round, there are tumbleweeds and dying dandelions and fireflies rising up slowly, contrasting with the night sky. It was a wonderful sight. I come here whenever life is particularly miserable. Lately, it's been a bit worse, I just lost my job through no fault of my own. The head of the company was sleeping with Elon Musk, and it didn't work out, which pissed off Elon and you can tell how that ended for our company. Throughout my life, I feel like misery was my fate. Growing up I was the kid that was avoided at parties, and never invited anywhere, my grades and my looks were average at best. My life was almost painfully bleak and desolate. I don't think there is very much I can do to change it, and I have tried to just accept it. Everything will always be the same, I am fundamentally doomed and this is my fate, and my life will always travel in circles, resulting in utter misery.

Though I'm trying not to think about that right now. Instead, I admire the beautiful merry go round. It is purely mechanical and does not require electricity. You can steer it, using a little golden steering wheel that is in front of you. I gave it a spin, and usually the horse travels in a perfect circle around the merry go round, though this time, it didn't work. The Merry Go Round started to twist and turn, the whole damn machine, not just the horse! I watched as the center of the Merry Go Round started to bend, and the roof began to open, the cube roof slowly began to drip downwards at a rapid rate forming an umbrella like structure that touched the ground. I was too shocked to react. I watched the winged child melted, it did not feel warm or anything it just began to drip, after getting over my shock, I tried to get out, since I figured the dripping structure would be malleable, though it was tough, and I had no way out. The structure was pitch black and the ground beneath me was starting to drip too, almost like it was turning into quick sand and soon the whole thing began to swirl the way water would in a sink. The structure smelled disgustingly metallic, almost like blood, and it felt soft, cold and wet. I tried to swim up against it but it was weirdly solid. I was terrified but I could not scream or shout. My voice was no longer working and there was nothing I could do about it. I laid there helplessly as this thing tried to swallow me whole. I was utterly shocked. I never took any kind of drugs, I never even touched alcohol, and had no history of mental illness. I didn't think I was having a nightmare either.  
  
I just watched as the jelly like structure slowly became transparent. The scenery outside was precisely the same as before. The structure then evaporated I guess, because then I was outside. At first I didn't notice any changes, and then I looked down at the ground, and saw that all the fireflies were dead. I looked up at the sky, and saw that the stars were all wrong. I don't know how to describe it, but they were too ordered, like the stars on the American flag, in perfect horizontal stripes across the sky. Strangely enough the stars were also blinking, en masse. One side of the sky would suddenly lose all its stars, and then when they came back, the other side of the sky would lose all its stars. I wasn't sure what happened. Was I in another world? A parralel universe? The Merry Go Round was perfectly normal before. Though I had always wondered why it looked so squeaky clean. Then I felt something brush against my leg, it was a piece of paper.

Hello. If everything went right, then you are reading this in your native language. This was the 50th time someone had used our Memory Machine. The Memory Machine has now generated enough energy to bring you to this place. Do not be alarmed. If all goes well then our technology has done it's best to replicate your home land, and you will return to your homeland and no time will have passed. By the time you read this, the Nayami will have been long gone, but you will learn about us soon enough. Do not be alarmed at the many sights you see, no harm can come to you. All we ask is that you remember us, pass on this knowledge to your species, please make sure our memory lives on, I am desperate, please.  
  
I was perplexed. So was this some simulation? Was I abducted by aliens? When will I be back? Who was Nayami? Suddenly, I was in a desert land, with neon pink sand, and I watched as these neon pink humanoid creatures with pink wings, engaged in a flight dance, where they would fly in an x shape in the sky. Amazingly, their sky would change color, almost reacting to their dances. I felt like information was being transferred to me in a form of osmosis, these were the Nayami and this was a celebration ritual, to celebrate the summer, which would last of 50 Earth years. Their voices sounded like violins, and their wings flapping added a beautiful sense of liveliness to the song. Their backs were like mirrors, reflecting the gorgeous hues of their sky.  
  
Suddenly the scene changed, I was in the middle of a Nayami temple, and they were unlike any form of modern architecture I'd seen. The temple had a pyramid like shape but they were not smooth, they had different levels and each level was different kind of gorgeous intricate archways and were clearly the different floors of the temple, each temple like structure was connected by bridges with intricate paintings along them, reflecting the cultural traditions, values, and gods of the Nayami. They were made of some golden like structure. They were beyond magnificent.

In the temple I saw a Nayami child, with large grey eyes, which looked beautiful against their gorgeous wings. They looked like a winged pink human five year old,. I watched as a crown was laid upon her head, it was a birthday celebration, she was turning 5, and I could see other children slowly start to enter the room, and their parents, and they began to sing a song similar to the celebration event, in unity, though this time their voices sounded similar to harps then violin, and they sang using vocal chords in their wings rather than their mouths, and I could see everyone there was smiling, and their wings turned a beautiful emerald green which reflected their contentment.  
  
The scene changed again to a Nayami city, there were cube like buildings, similar to the cube like structure of the Merry Go Round, centuries had passed, and the black and white cubic style was more popular now. I could see their malls, which were chess-like buildings. I was able to see inside of them, I could hear a softer more lively music, and realized that this was just their language. They used music to communicate, there was no other language, but universal music. I could understand it, it was Nayami bargaining on different kinds of accessories for wings, different kinds of art being put for auction, different kinds of clothes. A sense of joy and liveliness was evident.

All of a sudden, I was in the middle of the sky, floating and I could see that it stopped changing colours. A natural disaster was coming, and it was no ones fault. Toxic rain poured, and the food they ate was poisoned, plagues rampaged them. I saw a dying Nayami boy who's skin was a shrivelled translucent colour, who's voice sounded like a begginer playing the violin, horribly squeaky, I saw his eyes melt, and his wings were tatterred, and he bled silver blood eveywhere. I could hear the squeaking wailing noises get louder, and I could see that he was a victim of the plagues that were killing the Nayami people.  
  
Their efforts to save themselves were useless. They were fundamentally doomed. They tried quarantine, and then the plagues become airborne. I watched as Nayami stayed indoors, not daring to leave their houses, yet noticing their bodies became translucent nonetheless, and quickly died within minutes. I could see their horrified scientist and rulers track the exponential population decline before dropping dead themselves. I could see the malls filled with corpses, there were too many bodies to bury, so no one tried anymore. I could see children's schools littered translucent corpse children whose eyes had turned into liquid. The Nayami were brilliant but the plagues and natural disasters were simply too quick.  
  
The scene changed to their version of scientists, launching previously developed emergency technology, working as fast as their weakening bodies could muster, hoping they'd launch enough before they'd drop dead. I saw them launch these spore like capsules containing Nayami DNA, hoping that it would mix with that of the local life on planets, hopefully creating a new animal.  
  
Then I saw an old, lone scientist in his home lab, create a Merry Go Round like structure, and launch it, his skin rapidly becoming more translucent. Suddenly I was back at the place I originally was, except the Merry Go Round was no longer present. I headed back home, and they were correct, barely any time had passed, just the 15 minutes it took to reach my house. I felt indebted to this ancient civilization who's machine had given me comfort on many depressing days. That is why I am telling you this, nosleep, I know that mainstream media will not believe me, but our ancestors deserve to be remembered.
