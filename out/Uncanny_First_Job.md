Hi everyone, I thought this would be the perfect place to talk about my first real job.

I'm currently studying to be a funeral director, so naturally, my first real job is at a funeral home. It’s a small but well-respected place in the area—known for our compassionate service, a spacious parking lot, and stunning stained-glass windows that cast colorful patterns when the sun hits just right. But beyond its charm, the building itself has a much older history. It was originally a church, built in the 1920s, and while time has transformed its purpose, I can’t shake the feeling that some of its past occupants never truly left.

At first, I thought the spirits here were harmless—perhaps lingering souls with no ill intent. But over time, the eerie occurrences became too unsettling to ignore.

Technically, I’m just the receptionist, since I’m still in school, but the embalmer lets me help out in the prep room when things get busy. At first, I chalked up the strange experiences to exhaustion—between work and school, it was easy to convince myself I was just seeing or hearing things. But the disturbances escalated right around the time my boss gave me the keys to open and close the building.

There were too many mornings when I’d come in, disable the alarm, and *clearly* hear someone in the bathroom. The thing is, the alarm had to be turned off before anyone could even move freely in the building—so there was no logical way someone else could have already been inside. Time and time again, I’d knock on the bathroom door and hear a coworker respond, only to check the security cameras and see their car *just* pulling into the lot.

Then there were the funerals themselves. Every now and then, I would see the deceased attending services—sometimes for themselves, sometimes for others. I tried not to stare, but they always seemed to notice me first. Spending hours in the prep room, closely examining their faces and features, I knew for certain that these weren’t just uncanny look-alikes.

The most chilling moment, though, happened when an elderly woman came in, searching for records on her sister, who had died in the 1960s. Management had changed since then, but we still kept old files. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find anything, so she thanked us and left.

A few days later, a middle-aged man came in to make arrangements for his father. He mentioned that we had handled his mother’s funeral back in the early 2000s—one of the reasons he trusted us again. The next day, he sent over pictures for the slideshow and brought in clothing for the service. My coworker and I sat down to review them, and suddenly, the room turned ice cold.

His mother—the woman whose funeral we arranged decades ago—was the same person who had come in earlier that week, asking about her sister.

That was the moment I knew I wasn’t just imagining things.

Despite it all, I wouldn’t trade this job for anything, I love the people and need the money.
