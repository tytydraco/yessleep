It’s a common enough saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. This is wrong. Insanity is not repeating actions that are unsuccessful in accomplishing your goals, insanity is taking actions that directly work against your goals. If you want to run a marathon, it’s not insane to try to run as far as you can, fail, then try again and again. However if you wanted to run a marathon, then every day you refused to go on a jog and ate nothing but greasy fast food, then, well you can see where I’m going with this.  

I also feel the need to mention that doing things that simply seem strange is also not insane, so long as those actions are truly logical and reasonable despite all appearances to the contrary. This is what I tell myself every time I have to readjust the blanket covering my bathroom mirror.

I remember as a kid playing Bloody Mary with my friends, getting the candles lit, turning out the lights, chanting her name, the whole nine yards. Then we waited and waited and… nothing. Of course there was nothing, no face in the mirror nor whisper in our ears, no spirit answering the call from our mini ritual, only a long wait in the silent dark.

I remember that feeling, the waiting. In moments like that where anticipation engulfs the entire world your stomach rises to your chest and sinks within itself all at once. Your muscles trembling and cocked like a loaded gun, the slightest sensation would be enough to cause you to throw your arms out wildly and scream your lungs off. You can’t tell if you’re sunk back on your heels ready to retreat or if you’re on your toes ready to jump. Your eyes constantly moving up and down and left and right looking for the thing you know is coming to get you.

Growing up I remember this feeling washing over me every time we played those stupid games, the dark bathroom might as well have been hell itself. Now at 25, a dark bathroom is heaven. No light, no reflection, no thing in the mirror.

It started when I had moved back home after having dropped out of college. At first it was easy to ignore. On a few occasions a hint of movement would catch my eye when shaving or getting out of the shower. A brief moment of fear gave way to blissful relief when I would turn and find nothing behind me, and confirmed this by studying the room through the mirror. But then mere hints turned into full glimpses and what was once an unknowing innocence became a wilful ignorance.

Formless and invisible it was like witnessing movement itself, being able to physically see the idea of moving. Defined shapes and physical space were like suggestions to it, ones which it ignored entirely. Wherever it chose to make its presence known I looked away from. Above my shoulder, in the corner of the room, on the ceiling, around the corner peeking out from the hallway. It was there in the reflection, and yet in the briefest moments of the reflecting light hit my eyes I could see completely through it, the background, what was behind it never stopped, never interrupted by the outline of any sort of figure. And yet each time I saw it, despite spitting in the face of everything needed to be seen, it allowed itself to be seen anyway.

The occurrences became more frequent and unlike most things in life familiarity did not bring comfort nor alleviate fear. That same feeling I had as a kid playing Bloody Mary reemerged and soon it was a daily ritual to find fear in the mirror, then choose to look away.

I thought things would get better once I finally moved out, yet it seemed to only get worse. I now lived in what amounted to a large box with electricity and running water. The type of apartment where you can see into the single bathroom from the kitchen or the living room.

Almost as soon as the move was complete I began noticing the strange things happening in this mirror as well, except now it wasn’t limited to once a day. Any time I looked into the mirror I found something begging to be seen, something I would never give more than half a second in a passing glance to. I refused to feed it, look at it, or even acknowledge its existence. The thing in the mirror, whatever it was, had never touched me, it had never spoken to me, never even moved anything in the bathroom, it just existed, and if that’s all it could do then I would do everything in my power to deny it even that.

Of course this seems ridiculous looking back now, as if by choosing not to acknowledge its presence it would somehow go away. It didn’t. But now the fear of what it would do began to morph into fear of pure existence. I wasn’t so much afraid of the harm it could cause, but instead afraid of what it meant that something like this was real. 

As a kid you can’t say for certain that ghosts aren’t real, part of you genuinely believes the supernatural may truly exist. But then you grow up, get a job, maybe you find true love, maybe you lose it. Life knocks you down and lifts you up, the things you once found were only for gross old people start to become genuine interests of your own. Despite proclaiming for years that you’ll never become like your parents you start to see the wisdom in what they do and say. Maybe you choose to start a family or maybe you dedicate your life to building a career. Friends you swore would be there for life turn into fond memories and happy birthday texts you forgot to send. And somewhere along the way you come to the conclusion that for better or for worse, ghosts in fact are not real. 

Unfortunately the thing in the mirror was not a ghost. The moment I saw it outside my own mirror, I knew it was real.
