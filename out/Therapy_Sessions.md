I was never meant to be here. Not in this town, not in this office, not in this life.

But fate is a strange thing, isn’t it? It plucks you from one place and drops you somewhere else, shaping you into something new. I spent my childhood in foster homes, drifting from one temporary family to another, learning that love is just a word people use when it’s convenient. I didn’t belong anywhere. No one truly cared. But that gave me an advantage. It taught me how to observe, how to listen, how to understand people better than they understood themselves.

And now, they pay me for it.

I’m the town psychiatrist, the best they’ve ever had. People come to me lost, broken, desperate for answers, and they leave lighter. I have a 100% success rate. Every case I take on, I solve. Always.

I’ve seen every kind of person walk through that door.

Take the couple that came in last month. Young, but worn down by years of resentment. She sat stiffly, fingers curled around her wedding ring like a lifeline. He hunched forward, running a hand through his thinning hair.

“She never listens,” he spat. “I talk, but it’s like I’m not even there.”

She scoffed. “Because you don’t say anything worth listening to.”

They weren’t looking for help. They were looking for a referee. A judge to declare a winner in a fight they’d been having for years. But I don’t do that. I don’t pick sides. I solve problems.

Then there was the boy. His parents dragged him in, their faces etched with exhaustion. He slumped in my chair, barely present.

“He won’t eat, won’t sleep,” his mother said, voice raw. “He just… exists.”

His father nodded. “We don’t know how to help him.”

The boy barely reacted. He was a burden, dead weight pulling them all down. And I knew exactly how to relieve them of it.

Another patient, a woman in her forties, came alone. She was beautiful, but frayed at the edges. She twisted her wedding ring nervously.

“I’m cheating on my husband,” she whispered. “I love him, but I can’t stop.”

Tears welled in her eyes. “If he finds out, he’ll leave me. I can’t let that happen.”

She needed a way out. A way to erase the consequences of her actions. And I gave it to her.

Then there was the businessman. A high-profile client, the kind that only visits a psychiatrist when things are on the verge of collapse. He sat across from me, immaculate suit, perfectly trimmed beard, but his hands shook.

“I can’t sleep,” he admitted. “I keep seeing things. I feel like I’m being followed, like someone’s always watching me.”

Paranoia. Severe anxiety. He was unraveling, and he knew it. But the world doesn’t have patience for a man in his position to be weak. He needed a cure. A way to silence the voices in his head.

And then, there was the mother.

She was older, maybe in her sixties, soft-spoken but hollow-eyed. She sat with her hands in her lap, twisting a tissue between her fingers.

“It’s my son,” she murmured. “He’s ruining his life. He can’t hold down a job, he spends all his money on alcohol and drugs… I don’t know what to do.”

Her voice cracked. “I just want my son back.”

She wanted him saved. Cleaned up, fixed. But some people are beyond fixing. Some people need something more… permanent.

I listened. I nodded. I told each and every one of them the same thing:

“I can help.”

And I did.

The couple? They don’t fight anymore. They don’t do anything anymore. Their bodies lie together beneath the soil, entangled in death in a way they never were in life. No more screaming, no more resentment. Just silence.

The boy? He was drowning in his own misery, dragging his parents down with him. So I guided him toward the inevitable. I whispered the truths he needed to hear. That it would be easier this way. That his family would finally be free. He believed me. And now, they can breathe again.

The woman? Her husband will never find out about her affair. Because he’s gone. A carefully planned disappearance, an unsolved mystery the town will forget in time. And she? She sleeps peacefully now.

The businessman? His paranoia was eating him alive, making him a danger to himself. So I took the problem away. He won’t be followed anymore. He won’t hear voices in the dark. Because he’s gone, too.

And the mother? She wanted her son to be free of his vices. She wanted peace. So I gave it to her. He’ll never waste another dollar, never disappoint her again. His body is resting where no one will ever find it. And now, she can remember him the way he was before, frozen in time, perfect.

Some might call my methods extreme. But what matters more—the rules, or the results?

I think you already know the answer.
