It got harder to believe that my son was innocent when the cops showed up. 

[We had just finished burying our oozing, stinky basement rug in a dirt patch accessible only from a remote fire road](https://redd.it/156djjs). Choosing not to ask about the lump in said rug technically meant that I *couldn’t* know.

My son had instructed me where to dig, how deep, and showed me where the shovels were. I told myself that it was an opportunity for an increasingly rare father/son moment with my rapidly growing preteen. 

But the police made that narrative trickier. 

“You talk to the fat cop, Dad. I’ll take the ugly one down into the basement.”

Every hair on my nutsack stood on end as my boy appeared casually behind me while I stared at the two officers on my front porch. “That’s… not a nice thing to say,” I stammered.

“Basement? Why are you nervous about the basement?” he asked, cocking his head to the side. 

“N-no,” I stammered. “The problem was calling this man fat-”

“He’s the ugly one. I called *that* guy fat,” my son corrected, pointing.

They glared at us. “I’d love to speak with the boy in the basement,” the ugly/fat one said to his partner. “You take care of *him*.”

The fat/ugly one grunted in response as the other two walked to the back of my house.

Shit. I had to think of something *fast.* I wanted to believe that my son was innocent, but was terrified at the prospect of testing that faith. I was trying to conceptualize any possible positive outcome when I got interrupted by a *clang.*

The fat/ugly officer reached for his sidearm while pushing past me. I spun around and chased him to the source of the noise in my backyard. I prayed that whatever sight awaited me would not be terrible.

We burst through the back door to find the ugly/fat one flat on his back, eyes bulging uncomprehendingly at a bright sky that illuminated every drop of the blood oozing from his forehead.

Shit.

The second cop whipped his gun out and spun toward me.

My stomach dropped in fear. 

*CLANG*

He fell to the ground next to his partner, legs twitching but protruding eyes mannequin-still. As I looked up, my stomach continued to plunge past any threshold it once seemed capable of hitting. 

“Well Dad, our morning just got longer.”

That’s all my son said to me, in that matter-of-fact voice, after smashing a shovel against the second officer’s skull. 

“Help me wrap them up.” He dropped the spare shovel by the hose and rinsed off the blood. 

“Then what?” I eked out a whisper.

He looked at me like I was slow-witted. “You know where to drive them, Dad.”

My head spun as my world flipped, replacing every thought with different strains of fear. 

“Why?” I breathed.

“It’s too dangerous to release those question-askers into the wild,” he shrugged before eying me suspiciously. “You know what? Just give me the rugs and I’ll handle things from there.”

I dazedly did as he asked, leaving the rugs in the backyard before sitting alone in the living room.

“Okay, time to go,” my son called a few minutes later. 

This could be very, very bad.

But I figure denying his request could make things much worse, so I promised to meet him at the car in a couple of minutes. Then I typed this up and posted it, because that seemed like the most important thing to do.
