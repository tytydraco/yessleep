*I hope you like it*

I work as a ranger in a wildlife reserve. I've seen it all: predators on the hunt, birds killed by natural causes, even the disturbing buzzing of insects in the rainy season. Nothing prepared me for what happened two weeks ago.

Our team was monitoring T-07, a male Panthera tigris jacksoni—a Malayan tiger within a conservation program. It was the most monitored of all: satellite collar, monthly blood tests and a detailed health sheet. Still, one afternoon we received abnormal readings from his GPS: erratic movements, periods of immobility, and spikes in body temperature.

We found him lying next to a fallen log, breathing heavily. The wildlife veterinarian, Dr. Méndez, ordered him to be sedated for an emergency evaluation. I held the flashlight while she performed auscultation and looked for signs of internal bleeding. Everything seemed within parameters... until the animal began to convulse.

First I noticed a bulge on the right flank, as if something was pushing from within. The skin split open in a clean, silent tear. From the wound emerged a translucent, cylindrical shape that writhed with deliberate movements. It measured more than a meter, maybe two, and was covered with a substance that reflected light in green flashes.

The field parasitologist, Ramírez, stammered:
—That's not a nematode... it's an endoparasite with annelid morphology.

He said it out loud as if naming it made it real.

The creature slithered into the tall grass, leaving a slimy trail that smelled of iron and wet earth. I tried to catch up with her, but she was moving impossibly fast. In seconds, he disappeared into the grasslands. The tiger, on the other hand, began to stabilize. His vital signs improved as if a mortal weight had been lifted from him.

We remain silent. Dr. Méndez ordered a partial necropsy of the tissue around the wound to obtain samples. Ramírez improvised a field laboratory, observing the mucus under a portable microscope.

"Chitin," he murmured, "but with a configuration that doesn't match any recorded species."

Meanwhile, the environmental toxicologist collected air and soil samples, looking for traces of hydrogen sulfide or other gases that would explain the presence of such a strange organism. Nothing.

The disease ecologist noted that the site had a unique microclimate: permanent humidity, decaying logs, and a high rate of decaying organic matter. “Ideal conditions for an emerging parasite,” he said hollowly.

At dawn, we inspected the area. On several trunks we found spiral striations identical to the ring pattern of the parasite, like a map engraved on the bark. Mycologists ruled out fungi; biologists, any known species.

Méndez summed it up with a thread of voice:
—It could be a new phylum of metazoans. If so, the entire forest is a reservoir.

The reservation is still closed. The authorities talk about “routine investigation,” but I have seen how they install biosafety protocols and decontamination equipment on each trail. Nobody says it out loud, but we all know that that creature did not stay in the tiger.

Every time I patrol at night and the breeze moves the grass, I hear a wet rustling that doesn't belong to any animal I know. I feel like the forest is breathing... and that something, somewhere, is looking for a new host.

If anyone finds this story in the future, remember this: do not follow the spirals on the logs. They are more than just brands. They are a trail.
