When you pass me on the street, you usually think one of two things.First, that I’m down on my luck and could use a little help.Second, and much more common, that I’m a dirty, thriving drug addict trying to get money for my next high.

Sometimes that second one isn’t wrong.

I’ve seen real tweakers out here. Meth heads pacing sidewalks, patrolling alleys, so high they don’t recognize reality anymore. Talking to things that aren’t there. Fighting shadows. Screaming at nobody in particular.

That’s the problem.

I know exactly what’s going on with them. But nobody listens to an old hobo like me. They think I’m crazy. They think I’m on the stuff myself.

One of the first rules out here is don’t touch it. That’s how you survive. If someone offers you something, you say no. If men in black suits ask you if you want any, you run.

That’s how it starts.

They pull up late at night in black SUVs. Clean. Quiet. Expensive. They wear nice suits and always wear sunglasses, even in the dark. You never see their eyes. Makes you wonder if there’s anything there worth seeing.

They talk to you like a person. Polite. Calm. Almost friendly. Like they’re not about to ruin your entire existence.

Then they ask the question. “Would you like to get better?”

Not do you need help. Not what happened to you. Always the same words.

If you say no, they leave. If you yell at them, they leave. If you tell them to mind their own damn business, they leave.

But if you say yes, they open the door and ask you to get in. You won’t be seen for a few days. When you come back, you’re not right anymore.

You wander. You scream. You fight people for looking at you. You shove needles into your skin or swallow powders you never had money to buy. Nobody knows where it comes from. Nobody knows how you keep getting more of it.

Most don’t keep going. Some “overdose”. Some kill themselves. Some hurt other people.

I saw a man sprint a hundred feet and bite another man’s ear clean off because he thought the guy was stealing his chicken. He was aiming for the neck. That man got lucky.

Saw guy with a fucking crossbow kill a pigeon on the street once. Crazy fucker that guy was.

After a while, the men in suits come back. They pick you up again. After that, people usually never see you anymore.

Except sometimes, they do.

Sometimes they come back wearing suits, driving black SUVs, asking the same people on the street if they’d like to get better.

I once talked to a guy who swore he knew what was really happening.

He said he and a few others grabbed one of the suit guys and dragged him down by the river. Tied him up. Asked him questions. Lots of them.

The man didn’t fight. Didn’t scream. Just stood there silent for hours.

Then he looked at one of them and asked if he’d like to get better. As if he was programmed to say it. That’s when they lost it.

They told him they knew who he was. Knew his name. Knew he used to live on those same streets. Said they’d seen him shitting in a TJ Maxx parking lot years ago.

Something in the man snapped, a realization of who he once was. 
That’s when he started talking 

He said they take you somewhere that isn’t really a place. More like a bad idea that learned how to hold walls.

They don’t torture you like in the movies. No chains. No screaming. They just turn you on wrong. You’re supposed to come apart. That’s the whole point. Not neatly either. They don’t slice you up and send each piece somewhere nice and organized. Pieces of you get dragged sideways into other plains. Your body stays here, but parts of your mind don’t. Pieces of your soul wander off. Sometimes whole chunks of you end up somewhere else entirely.

Then it starts.

Your arm might swing at nothing because another version of you is fighting for its life somewhere you can’t see. You wake up exhausted because you spent all night running in a place with no ground. You scream because something is pulling on you from the inside, trying to climb back in the wrong way.

That’s why people take the drugs. The stuff doesn’t make you see things. It keeps you from seeing too much at once. Keeps your body heavy enough to stay put while the rest of you figures itself out.

Take too little and you start slipping. Take too much and everything snaps back together before it’s ready.That’s when people die.

But if you survive long enough, something changes.

The fighting stops. The pulling settles. All the scattered pieces of you start agreeing on what they are. You learn how to move without tearing yourself apart. You learn how to listen to yourself across places that don’t have names.

That’s when they say you’re better.

That’s when they give you the suit.

That’s when you start asking other people if they’d like to get better too.

That’s all he told him.

The SUVs showed up not long after. Guns came out. Only a few of the guys made it away.

Of course, the man who told me this story was high as a fucking kite at the time, so maybe none of it’s true.

Maybe some people are just addicts.Maybe some people are part of something bigger.Maybe some homeless people are like me, just trying to get through the night.

But next time you pass a homeless person on the street, maybe think twice about who you’re really talking to.

Weird stuff happens all across this country. I’ve got a lot more stories from my time on the road. If this phone doesn’t get stolen, or disappear, or dematerialize from this plain of existence, I’ll tell more of them.

For now, this has been a tale from a traveling hobo.
