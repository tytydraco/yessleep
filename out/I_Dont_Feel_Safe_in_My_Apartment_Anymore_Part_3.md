Sorry, I haven’t posted an update for a couple of days. I tried to act on the suggestions you all made to work out what was going on.

After the second night of hearing the washing machine through the pipes, I spent most of today doing very little. I didn’t sleep much. I didn’t leave the apartment. I mostly sat on the couch with the lights on, my phone in my hand, refreshing the same few apps without really reading anything.

Every so often, I would get up and walk through the apartment again.

I checked the door. Still locked.  
I checked the windows. Still closed.  
I checked the bathroom. Nothing out of place.

The laundry basket was still empty.

That detail kept pulling at my thoughts. My clothes had been washed twice now, and I still hadn’t touched the basket. It felt like proof of something, even if I couldn’t explain what yet.

By late afternoon, exhaustion started to creep back in. Not the heavy, crushing kind from the first night, but something thinner. More dangerous. Like my body had decided it would keep going whether my mind was ready or not.

I made myself food and barely remember eating it.

At some point, I realised the apartment felt different. Not wrong, exactly. Just quieter than it should have been. Like a sound had stopped and I hadn’t noticed when.

I stood up and walked into the bedroom.

That’s when I noticed the chair.

The chair I’d been using to watch the laundry, the one that had been pulled out and angled toward the bed, was back under the desk. Neat. Straight. Exactly how it had been before all of this started.

For a moment, I felt a strange wash of relief. Like maybe this was ending. Like whatever had been happening had corrected itself.

Then I realised something else.

The laundry wasn’t on it anymore.

I stood there staring at the empty chair, my thoughts moving slowly, carefully, like my mind was afraid of what it might find if it rushed ahead.

The folded clothes were gone.

Not on the bed.  
Not on the floor.  
Not in the closet.

I checked the bathroom.  
I checked the living room.

Nothing.

My chest tightened. The same cold, hollow feeling I’d had when I saw my clothes inside the washing machine in the basement.

I hadn’t moved them.

I was sure of that.

I walked back into the bedroom and stood in front of the desk, staring at the chair like it might explain itself.

That’s when I noticed my phone.

It was on the desk, face down.

I hadn’t left it there.

I was sure I’d had it with me. I could still picture it in my hand just now on the couch, the weight of it, the warmth from the screen.

I picked it up.

The lock screen lit up, and something immediately felt wrong.

I was sure I hadn’t been standing there long. It felt like I’d simply stood up.

That’s why when I saw the time, I thought I was misreading it.

The screen said it was later than it should have been. Not by a few minutes, but close to an hour.

I locked the phone. Unlocked it. Checked again.

The time didn’t change.

I tried to work backwards. Tried to remember doing anything at all that would explain it.

I couldn’t.

I didn’t move. I just listened to the apartment.

No noise from the pipes.  
No humming.

Eventually, against my better judgement, I grabbed my keys.

I needed to know where the clothes were.

The hallway outside my apartment was empty. The elevator was slow, as always. The basement smelled the same. Soap, damp concrete, warm metal.

The laundry room lights were on.

Before I even stepped inside, I heard it.

The loud rattle from the washer in the far corner.

My heart started to pound so hard I could feel it in my throat.

I stood in the doorway, just like before. I didn’t move closer. I didn’t speak.

When the machine stopped, the lid unlocked with that same soft click.

I waited longer than I needed to before approaching.

Inside were my clothes.

Folded.

All of them.

Including the extra shirt.

But something else lay on top of the stack.

My jacket.

The one I’d been wearing earlier that day.  
The one I clearly remembered hanging over the back of the couch.

I backed away from the machine, my legs unsteady, my thoughts looping without finding anywhere to settle.

I’m back in my apartment now as I write this.

The laundry basket is empty again.  
The chair is back under the desk.

Every time my thoughts soften, every time my focus slips, even for a moment, I feel that same cold certainty settle in.

Because whatever this is…

…it doesn’t need me to be asleep anymore.
