 I was getting a glass of water in the evening. The house was quiet and covered in shadows. It stood there, at the end of the corridor. She was just smiling. Her eyes were completely white, almost glistening from the rays of light seeping out of my room. My grip on the door only tightened when she put a foot forward, making a guttural gagging sound.  


I froze in terror, my heart pounding so loudly that I could barely hear the sound of my own breathing. Dread washed over me, the kind of fear that roots you to the spot and leaves you gasping for air. I felt repulsed by the woman's sickly appearance, her pale skin and matted hair making me want to turn away.  


As the figure got closer, I could make out more details. It was a woman, or at least it looked like a woman. Her twisted grin made my stomach churn, and her white eyes seemed to bore into my very soul. I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my voice had deserted me. All I could do was watch as the woman came closer and closer, until she was right in front of me.  


And then she started to gag. It was a horrible, guttural sound, like she was choking on something. The sound filled me with a sense of repulsion and disgust, and as she gagged, she reached out with her hands, grabbing at me, clawing at my skin.  


I tried to push her away, but she was too strong. Her grip was like iron, and I could feel her fingers digging into my flesh. My fear turned to panic as I realized I was trapped, and I was powerless to stop her.  


I was screaming now, screaming for help, for anyone to come and save me. But no one came. The house remained silent, except for the sound of the woman's choking and gagging.  


And then she fell to the floor, writhing in pain. Her body convulsed and twisted, and I could hear bones snapping and cracking. My sense of dread and horror intensified as I realized what was happening, and I sank to the floor in shock.  


A single tear of blood dropped from her eyes as she looked into mine. I recoiled in disgust, feeling a wave of revulsion wash over me. What had I just witnessed? Was this some sort of curse?  


That night all I could dream about was her. The images of her twisted smile and white eyes haunted me, filling me with a sense of foreboding and unease. I was left feeling like I had experienced something beyond my understanding.  


I'm still scared though. Not because of her, but because of me. After that incident, I hid her body. In my yard. The guilt and shame I felt were overwhelming, and I struggled to make sense of what had happened.  


I can no longer sleep or eat. Anything I eat, I end up puking. I tried to leave my house, but whenever sunlight touches my skin, it burns. I can feel my skin tightening and drying, just like hers. The horror of what I had witnessed had left me changed, marked by something beyond my understanding. 

I don't know how to stop it anymore, It hurts to do anything. So I've just let it consume me.
