There is a place you can only go by accident. At least, that's the conclusion I've reached. A place called Esterday. 

I used to wake up at three in the morning and drive that same stretch of highway, desperately rerouting, seeking clues to occult detours yet unmapped. There is no finding your way back. That's not how it works.

I dream of it. That wrong turn onto an unmarked exit, the desolation of the dead farmlands, slightly skewed and somehow misplaced, somehow out of time. Time itself slipping away from me like a child forgets the pain of a skinned knee. 

By the time you come to the old man at the shoulder of a sharp curve in the road, you will feel altogether altered. Like your own doublegoer, catching your reflection in the rear view mirror and finding it uncanny, contrived...

And I did check. It's on Google Maps, about three hours north. In the middle of an empty place. As far as I could tell it's surrounded by swamplands but, rationally, should be easily accessible. 

The question is how a wrong exit twenty miles north of the city took me to Esterday in under fifteen minutes--what's more, heading straight east.

It's impossible. There's nothing about that that adds up.

When I first searched for the little town of Esterday online, I found almost nothing other than two 240p cellphone clips from 2009 and 2011. In one clip a passenger is filming the passing forest, then a barren farmstead, then the driver, a teenager staring wordlessly at the dirt road ahead. 

The cameraman says, "it shouldn't be much further," and he sounds distinctly anxious. Then there's a moment in which the image seems to shatter into ugly digital bars the color of bad maths , scramble, break up, before we see something inexplicable:

The camera is now peering straight down at a brown mid nineties Ford Taurus driving at unknown speeds along what appears to be the same dirt road. We are presumably ten or fifteen meters above the automobile matching its speed perfectly. A moment passes before, very slowly, the driver's bone pale face emerges from the driver's window staring straight up, directly at the camera, eyes wide, and we can see that, despite the distance and unfortunate pixelation, they are filled with horror.  

Then, immediately, the cameraman is back in the passenger seat, swings over to the driver, who looks at the camera and says, "did we miss it?" To which the cameraman replies, "What the fuck." 

They discuss, very briefly, turning around to seek out an "Esterday city limits" roadsign. Then the footage cuts.

The second video clip, from 2011, was just as bizarre. I clicked on the thumbnail of a familiar looking dirt road, titled IN ESTERDAY.

A chaotic, wildly swinging camera captures only brief glimpses of a dirt road and a collapsed barn before suddenly halting on the interior of what appears to be a small laundromat. At floor level, we can make out a row of celadon arsenic-green washing machines. Three of them. As we watch, the one in the center opens slowly. Darkness inside. Then another wild blur of messy unintelligible imagery until the camera fixes once again on an empty country grocery store.

It's silent, except the electric hum of the ugly halogen lighting. Yellow linoleum floors. Rows of half empty store shelves, some bags of what looks to be generic white bread. A colorful banner in one corner that reads, ESTERDAY, NO LONGER YESTERDAY! 

Then cut to the dim interior of an ancient barn. Seasick green light from an unknown source. We're looking at a cramped and dirty horse stall. Some hulking colorless creature is crouched, turned away in the far darkness, too dim to make out; vaguely humanoid, it seems  to be uttering things incomprehensible, in a low unearthly tongue. Almost a low hum, warbling some, barely consistent with any familiar speech pattern. Then,

It's over.

The thing is, these are all places I've been. I've seen that lonesome little laundromat, that liminal and empty store with its desolate shelves. I've stood in the seasick green light of the failing barn before the cramped and dirty horse stall and I've knelt low to hear the sacred truth this wretched creature softly croons. 

They horrify me, these scenes, but I need to know.

To feel that stillness again. That out-of-timeness.

Does anyone have anymore information on this place? Have you tried to go there?

Need more info. PM for contacts, links aren't allowed here. Didn't know where else to look. It's all I can think about. I dream of it. But I'm certain. You can't go there on purpose. Or am I losing my mind?

ANYONE, who knows ANYTHING, please reach out. Leaving this here for now...

If you check now, both videos are scrubbed. 

Does anyone out there know this place?
