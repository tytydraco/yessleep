We held a Midnight Madness Sale roughly once a year at MacPhee Audi.



If you don’t know what that is, plenty of stores do it. We keep the dealership open until midnight and run some special deals to drum up business. There’s music, and food to draw people in too… I actually kinda hated it.



I get the point of it. I really do. But I don’t get why it had to be a mandatory thing? Who’s out there at 11:45 PM on a Friday night going: *“You know what I need to do right now? I need to buy a fucking car!”*



We weren’t exactly a high traffic dealership. We were located roughly an hour outside of Edmonton on a fairly quiet highway without much else around us.



It just seemed like a stupid gimmick for the sake of a stupid gimmick… but unfortunately Terrance and Andy *liked* stupid gimmicky sales.



I’d been working at MacPhee Audi for about three years and I can honestly say Terrance and Andrew MacPhee were the worst employers I’d ever had. 



Terrance was in his late 70s and didn’t really have anything else aside from the dealership, so he spent most of his retirement bumming around, hovering over salespeople's shoulders to try and pass his sage advice on to them… most of which was downright ridiculous. 



   *‘Don’t show them the Carfax report. They don’t need to know the history of a vehicle.’*

   *‘No matter what, a used car only had one owner.’*

   *‘Always round the odometer down.’*



Nevermind the fact that his advice had gotten us audited by AMVIC before, he was convinced he was right about everything at any given time for no other reason than because he’d been in car sales for 40 years.



His son Andy was much somehow worse.



Despite having the cushy position of General Manager, Andy didn’t actually *do* anything at the dealership. His Dad was more of a manager than he was, and he was retired! 



Andy basically just spent most of his day in his office with our Internet Sales Manager, a guy by the name of Rhys French, micromanaging vehicle descriptions (most of which he generated using ChatGPT) and giving Rhys new landing pages to build. Andy loved his landing pages. 



To his credit he was adamant that digital marketing was important but he just went about everything in the stupidest way possible, building a landing page for every single possible thing that came to mind, never asking what value it actually brought to the website. He acted as if we were some high traffic, cushy downtown dealership as opposed to a middling luxury car dealership an hour outside of Edmonton. He used to waste money on some cushy ad agency to write all the copy for him, but once ChatGPT came along, that went out the window and unfortunately that was in fact the closest thing to an intelligent decision I ever saw him make. 



He and Rhys *loved* AI. I swear to God, it did more work at the dealership than either of them combined. Hell, they’d generated the landing page for the Midnight Madness sale, the website banners, the physical banners and even the radio ad with AI. It all looked and sounded exactly as bad as you think it did. 



I’m ranting at this point… I’m sorry.



I had a *lot* of grievances about that place… I only really stayed for the money. But I was hoping I’d find something better soon and I never, *never* wanted anything like… like what happened.



God… I’m still not sure how to describe it. I’m not sure if I’m crazy or if what I saw was real and I’m honestly not sure which would be worse.



\*\*\*



On the night of the Midnight Madness sale, there were nine of us at the dealership.



Terrance was hovering around, trying to feel important. Andy spent most of his time outside on the grill, cooking hot dogs for customers who’d by that point mostly stopped showing up and our Sales Manager, Jason Kale was in his office going through the paperwork for the sales we’d made that night.



Most of the salespeople were sort of just sitting around, snacking on free hot dogs and waiting for someone to come in.



Kathy Nice was on her phone, playing some game she’d downloaded that currently took up way too much of her time. Tony Moss was out having a smoke break while Sheenah Douglas and Rhys had been moving some of the cars we’d put out front back onto the lot. I remember Sheenah complaining about having to be the one to move the cars, but that was pretty normal for her.



 Sheenah complained about a lot of things. She was one of the newer hires and I’d really hoped she wouldn’t be sticking around. Just looking at her gave me a headache. She was somewhere in her late thirties but had neon pink hair, wore tight, low cut dresses that any reasonable dealership wouldn’t have tolerated and obnoxiously high Fuck Me heels that were more or less useless for walking around the lot. 



She was rude too, treating everyone else like they were beneath her… and yet somehow Andy and Terrence let her get away with it. Everyone knew why. 



As the night wound down, I was up in the office with my boss, Janet McMahon. I actually didn’t mind Janet. She was a little bit of a control freak which got on my nerves sometimes but she mostly meant well.



We were handling some of the paperwork on our end for some of the sales we’d made that day… all in all, it’d been a good night (or as good of a night as being stuck at work from 9 AM to midnight could be) although I was more than ready to head home. 



The upstairs office space had a balcony that overlooked the dealerships showroom, so I could still see and hear what was going on down there while Janet and I worked and I could hear Sheenah and Rhys coming in from moving the cars back.



   *“Something’s smoking out there!”* I heard her saying. *“Maybe an engine or something?”* 

   *“What do you mean ‘smoking?’”* I heard Jason ask. 

   *“Look! You don’t see that? Something’s smoking out on the lot!”*



I gravitated closer to the balcony out of curiosity. Sure enough, I could see smoke rising from the used section of the car lot. 

   “We weren’t moving anything over there,” Rhys said. “Not sure what the hell’s going on.”

Jason seemed to swear under his breath before going to the door and opening it.

   “Go grab the fire extinguisher,” He said. “Have a phone ready in case we need to…”



He trailed off as he heard a faint sound in the darkness. It was hard to hear it clearly from where I was… but I heard enough. It sounded almost like a baby crying. It sounded distant, but there was no mistaking it. It sounded *exactly* like a crying baby.



Jason looked back at the others. By this point, Kathy and Tony (who’d just come in from his smoke break) had come over to investigate too. 

   “Is that a fucking baby…?” Tony asked quietly. “What the hell is that?”



Jason didn’t say a word. He just went right out to investigate and Tony hesitated for a moment before following him. The two disappeared out onto the lot, wandering out toward the cars to follow the sound. Janet had come up behind me and was staring out the window.

   “What’s going on?” She asked.

   “There’s a baby out there… least, it sounds like it?”



Her eyes narrowed behind her coke bottle glasses. 

   “A baby? Like with a customer?”

   “I don’t know… but who the hell would bring a baby out on the lot at this hour?” I asked.



Janet didn’t answer. Her eyes were still narrowed. She finally turned away, heading downstairs to go and investigate. I didn’t follow her. I saw her joining Rhys, Sheenah and Kathy in the showroom a few moments later with Terrance and Andy wandering over to see what was going on as well. 



The six of them congregated near the window of the Dealership watching and waiting to see what Jason and Tony would bring back. The smoke on the lot looked like it had mostly faded by this point which was probably a good sign… but other than that all was quiet.



Then the screaming began. Faint and distant but panicked… even from the second floor balcony I could clearly hear it. I paused and leaned against the balcony, watching as Tony sprinted in from the lot toward the door. I'd never seen anyone run that fast before. He reached the door, tearing it open and stumbling back into the dealership. He was hyperventilating, almost on the verge of crying.

   *“Something got Jason!”* He rasped. *“S-something on the lot… there… there’s something.”*



I saw Terrance trying to sit him up and ask for more information but Tony was… well he was hysterical. Not a lot of what he said was intelligible other than that Jason was gone.  At one point, Terrance seemed to give up on him and looked over at Andy.

   “Can you call someone?” He asked and Andy just gave a sort of clumsy nod before going for his phone. I watched him dial a number - but no one seemed to answer. He tried again several times, before watching him started to get on my nerves and I took out my own phone.



There was no signal. 

   “I can’t get through!” Andy said. “Phones are down!”

I saw Rhys heading for one of the nearby cubicles and grabbing one of the landline phones.

   “It’s out,” He said. “What the fuck is going on here?”

   *“GUYS, GUYS, GUYS!”*



Sheenah’s panicked screeching drew all eyes toward her. She was pointing out the window, into the dimly lit car lot.

   *“There’s something out there! Something behind the cars!”*



Terrance stood up.

   “Where?”

   “F-front row! I saw it moving between the cars! A-an animal or something!”

Terrance shuffled closer to the glass, staring out onto the lot but there was nothing to see. Just cars under the LED light poles.

   “I don’t see it,” He said. 



A low thud echoed through the quiet dealership, coming from above us… like something had just landed on the roof. 

All eyes turned upwards.



The roof of the dealership was high above us with metal trusses spanning horizontally across it for support and air ducts winding between them to keep the showroom cool. The actual roof was simple corrugated metal. Sturdy, but when it rained you could hear it pounding on the roof. It was actually kinda calming. 

Something was up there now. We could hear its footsteps as it moved across the roof.

   “The hell is that?” Terrance asked softly. 



Tony had gone quiet, but even from the balcony I could see the look of complete and utter terror on his face.

   *“Oh God…”* He stammered. *“Oh God, oh God…”*

Terrance’s brow furrowed. 

   “What the fuck is this?” He asked. He looked over at Tony. “This some kind of joke?”

   “What?” Tony looked confused. 



   “You and Jason, are you two putting on some kind of prank?” He asked. “That is? That’s Jason on the roof, isn’t it?”

   “No!” Tony insisted and judging by the tone of his voice he was either completely serious or a fantastic liar. I wasn’t entirely sure which myself.



The footsteps continued to echo across the ceiling as whoever… or whatever was up there walked across it.

   “That wasn’t Jason I saw outside!” Sheenah said. “There’s something else out there!”

   “Oh yeah, sure, cuz you’re in on it too.” Terrance scoffed. “I don’t believe this. We’re in the middle of a sale here, and you’re all fucking around, playing games like a bunch of kids? We could have customers here! You really wanna risk doing this in front of a customer? You two both know better.”

   *“This is not a fucking joke!”* 



   “Yeah. Sure. You really think I’m falling for this shit cuz I’ll tell you something and I’m gonna tell it to you right now, I did not fall off the goddamn wagon yesterday!”

   “Terry, I am not fucking around!” Tony snapped but Terrance ignored him and headed for the door.

   “Don’t!” Tony warned, but Terrance wasn’t listening. He stepped out onto the lot, and looked back up toward the roof.

   “JASON! Get the fuck down from there! Whatever this is I’m not…”



His voice trailed off as he stared up at the roof, and I could see his brow furrowing as he saw something - although I wasn’t sure what.

His eyes narrowed, then widened as *something* dove down off the roof and landed on him. 



I could hear Terrance scream as the creature tackled him to the ground… God, that scream. Terror and pain all in one… and moments later it was drowned out by the shrieks of the others. Sheenah was the loudest, screeching like a banshee as she stumbled away from the window, her obnoxious Fuck Me heels caused her to collapse back onto the ground.



The thing on top of Terrace bit at him, although I could see him beneath it, struggling to fight it off. At a glance it looked sort of like a large bird… although birds weren’t usually four feet tall. This thing had to be around four to five feet tall, and it had a long feathered tail stretching out behind it. Its body was covered in sleek black feathers, like a crows although the tips of its wings were bright red. There was a blue crest of feathers atop its head and its long tail was tipped with white.



It had clamped its beak… no… jaws, around Terrance’s arm. He was trying to fight it off, but the creature was too strong. I could see the arm in its jaws bending at a unnatural angle. It had snapped the bone clean in two but he was still desperately trying to get free. 



The creature planted one clawed foot on his stomach… a foot tipped with a all too familiar sickle shaped claw. 



That was when I realized I’d seen this creature before…  not in real life, but in the books and the toys my nephew liked.



The thing that was killing Terrance was a fucking dinosaur.



*That was a goddamn raptor.*



The claw plunged into Terraces stomach. He shrieked in pain as it ripped him open… and from between the cars on the lot,  I could see two more identical creatures emerging from the darkness.



There was a whole pack of them. One of them lunged for Terrance's head, closing it in its jaws. His screams grew louder. He desperately tried to struggle as the first raptor tore his arm off completely. 



Nobody helped Terrance.



Nobody was that brave.



We could only watch in horror as the raptors tore him apart… and looking back at that moment I genuinely could not tell you when he stopped struggling.  For a moment, we all stood in stunned silence trying to process the impossible we were looking at.



Andy was hyperventilating… and for once I honestly didn’t blame him for standing there, useless. He’d just watched his own father get torn apart by fucking Raptors, what the hell was he supposed to do?



Then one of the Raptors looked up… and stared through the window of the dealership, at the horrified but motionless audience to their feast.



Tony was the first to run, scrambling along the ground in a panic. The rest weren’t so quick to move… not until the raptor lunged, throwing itself against the glass.



The window didn’t break, but it shook violently. 



Andy took off next, mindlessly sprinting back toward his office. Rhys went next, trying to follow him although Andy had closed and locked the door before he could get in.

   “Hey, HEY, what the fuck?!” Rhys demanded, pounding on the glass beside the door. From my vantage point, I couldn’t see what Andy said or did in response.



Kathy was stepping back, away from the window.

   “T-that thing can’t get through, right?” She asked. 

   “I-I don’t think so?” Janet replied.



Sheenah was already on her feet again and scrambling away.

   “You really wanna find out?” She snapped.



Kathy seemed to take the hint and started to follow Sheenah, but Janet still hesitated.



The Raptor stared at her through the glass, before backing off, retreating a few feet away before looking back at her again. 



Then it charged.



Janet finally moved, scrambling away in a panic in the moment before the Raptor threw itself through the glass. The window erupted. Kathy screamed. In her panic, she tripped over her own feet… although to her credit she didn’t let that stop her and frantically dragged herself under one of the cars in the showroom.



Rhys and Sheenah both took off in the direction of the stairs.



The Raptor ignored all of them… it only focused on Janet, who couldn’t put enough distance between it and her in time. She tried to get away, but the Raptor shook off the disorientation quickly and charged at her. She had only seconds to react before it took her down… and I could only hear her screams as it tore her apart.



I heard movement behind me and looked over to see Tony stumbling up the stairs. Rhys was right behind him.

   “Come on, *COME ON!”* Tony snapped, and as soon as Rhys was through the door, they both slammed it shut behind them. The moment it was closed, Tony pushed Janet’s desk against it. Rhys helped as soon as he realized what he was doing.



   *“WAIT!”* I heard Sheenah call from the stairwell on the other side of the door. *“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!”*

She tried to open it, but by that point Rhys and Tony had already blocked it. 



Tony hesitated. 

   “H-hold on!” He stammered and tried to pull the desk back to let her in, but Rhys threw his weight against it, keeping the door blocked.

   “What the hell are you doing?!” Tony snapped.

   “The moment we let her in, those things are coming in too!” Rhys replied. “If she wanted to make it up here, she shouldn’t have worn those fucking heels!”



Janet’s screams had gone silent. From the corner of my eye, I saw the other two Raptors coming in through the broken window. One of them looked up at me…

The sight of it made my blood run cold.

   “For Christ’s sake, just let her in!” I said, looking over at Rhys. I rushed over to try and help Tony pull the desk back. I may not have liked Sheenah but I sure as hell didn’t want her to die!



Rhys pushed me away, knocking me to the ground.

   “You wanna get fucking eaten, Abby?” He snarled. “Be my guest! But I’m not fucking dying with you!”

   *“PLEASE!”* Sheenah sobbed from the other side of the door. *“PLEASE!”*



She tried desperately to open it. She pounded on it. *“Oh God… Oh God…”*

   *“RHYS, MOVE THE FUCKING DESK!”* Tony demanded. He tried to pull it again but Rhys forced him back.

   *“I’M NOT LETTING THEM UP HERE!”*

   *“No, no… R-Rhys please… please…”* Sheenah begged. *“I don’t wanna… please… oh God… RHYS, PLEASE! PLEASE!”*



The terror in her voice told me everything I needed to know. 

Sheenah wasn’t alone in that stairwell anymore. 

   *“RHYS, RHYS, PLEAS-”*



Her panicked cries turned into an anguished shriek. I could hear the struggle on the other side of the door as Sheenah was dragged down the stairs, sobbing and screaming. My hands pressed to my mouth in quiet horror as we listened to Sheenah’s death… every ugly detail of it.



Rhys just stood there in silence, closing his eyes as if that might block it all out, and Tony just glared daggers at him the entire time. He lunged for Rhys, grabbing him by the shirt and pinning him to the wall. 

   *“What the fuck is wrong with you?!”* He hissed.

   “I just saved our lives,” Rhys replied, although there was a tremor in his voice. 

Tony just grimaced in rage.

   “I should throw you over the fucking balcony…” He said and Rhys had no response to that. He looked over at me as if I might take his side, but I just avoided eye contact with him.



As far as I was concerned, he’d just murdered Sheenah. I could hear the sound of shattering glass on the first floor, followed by Andy’s shrieks as the Raptors broke into his office. My entire body tensed up as I listened to them ripping him apart. My breathing had gotten heavier.



I didn’t remember the last time I’d been so fucking scared.

Five minutes ago, there’d been nine of us in this dealership.

Now there were only three… no… four.



I remembered how Kathy had crawled under one of the cars. Was she still there? Could we get to her?

I crept back over toward the balcony and peeked over, careful not to let the Raptors see me.

I could see two of them, both of them next to Andy’s office - nowhere near the car Kathy had hidden under.



As far as I could tell, she was still down there.

I wanted to call out to her, but thought better of it. I didn’t want to risk those things hearing me.



One of the Raptors wandered away from Andy’s office, while the other one climbed back in through the window. The wandering Raptor sniffed at the air before making its way toward the car Kathy was under. 



I saw it open its mouth… but the sound that came out made my stomach drop.

It sounded like a man speaking.

   *“All clear!”* 



The Raptor looked around.

   *“All clear!”* 



The voice almost sounded perfectly human. The pitch was a little off… but if I hadn’t seen it come from the fucking Raptor, I would’ve thought it was a person.

   *“All clear!”* It called again… and from the stairwell, I heard a different voice.



Sheenah’s voice.

   *“Rhys!”*



Tony and Rhys looked over toward the door.

   *“Rhys! Please!”*

   “What the fuck…?” Rhys asked, but Tony kept him pinned to the wall.

   “Don’t…” He said. “Don’t touch that door, it’s not her…”

   *“Rhys! Please!”*

   *“All clear!”* Called the voice from the showroom.



Tony and I exchanged a look. He finally let Rhys go and crept closer to me, looking over the balcony to watch as the Raptor patrolling the showroom spoke in a man's voice. 



It was standing a few feet away from the car Kathy was under now, and the other Raptor had come out of Andy’s office, and was stalking toward the car as well.  They knew where she was. 



I had to think fast. I had to think of a way to save her. I glanced over toward my desk. There was a hole punch sitting within arms reach. I grabbed it, and without thinking hurled it as far as I could.  It hit one of the cars in the showroom, bouncing off the hood and landing on the ground with a clatter.



Both Raptors looked over in that direction. They sniffed the air… but only one of them moved to investigate. The other stayed right beside the car, lowering its head to sniff at the ground, before snarling.



I could hear Kathy sobbing as the Raptor forced its head underneath the car… and her sobs turned to screams. It ripped her out from underneath the vehicle. She thrashed and screamed… she almost got away once or twice, but the moment the second Raptor came back, it was over… and by the time the third had left the stairwell to join in, there was no saving her.



Tears streamed down my cheeks as Kathy was torn apart, screaming just like the others.  I wanted to save her… I wanted to stop this…



But I couldn’t.



This whole thing felt like a nightmare… none of it made any sense. I didn’t understand how or why this was happening. *None of this made any sense!*



Kathy’s dying screams had drawn Rhys over. He looked over the balcony and grimaced, before ducking down beside us. Tony glared daggers at him, but didn’t say much else. Instead, his attention shifted toward the door to the nearby board room.



He nodded his head toward it and the message was clear. We’d be safer there.



He put a hand on my shoulder, urging me to go first. I started to go, but Rhys cut me off, grabbing my desk to pick himself up. 

   *“Quietly!”* Tony warned… although it didn’t make much of a difference.



Something crashed against the wall behind me. Rhys spun around, and I saw his eyes bulge with terror as one of the Raptors lifted itself up onto the balcony.

It must have used one of the cars to get up there.

   “FUC-”



The Raptor lunged before Rhys could finish that sentence, tackling him to the ground. Its hooked claws buried themselves in his stomach as its jaws snapped shut around his head. He shrieked in agony, but to be honest I can’t say I cared that much about his suffering.



Tony and I moved. Bolting as fast as we could toward the boardroom. 



From the corner of my eye, I saw a second raptor climbing over the balcony and I waited for the feeling of their claws and teeth digging into my body, but it never came. Tony and I stumbled into the boardroom, and he slammed the heavy wooden door shut behind us, pinning his body against it as the Raptors tried to force their way in - this time without luck. 



   “Help me block it!” Tony said and I wasted no time in grabbing whatever I could. The table was too heavy to move, but there was a storage closet we used for records and office supplies. There were a few heavy boxes in there I was able to stack up by the door to keep it from opening. 



The Raptors pushed against the door, but the boxes held it shut. Tony still lingered close to it, terrified that it was still going to open somehow. 



Outside, Rhys had gone silent… not that I missed him. I could hear movement. Something sniffing around… then I heard a voice.



   *“All clear!”*

A pause before the Raptor tried again.

   *“All clear!”*



Then silence.



Tony squeezed his eyes shut, before looking around as if he could find a way out of this. His eyes settled on the board room windows. They looked out over the showroom and I could see the gears in his head turning. He reached into his pocket, fumbling around with something before grabbing a pair of car keys. They were from our inventory, and he stared at the tag on them for a moment before giving a nod. 

   “A121…” He said under his breath.

A121. That was a Q7 in our showroom. It was an SUV. I’d seen Tony showing it off to a customer a little while ago. 



Tony moved over toward the window. Sure enough, it was right there. Not exactly right beneath us but close enough. He seemed to think it over for a moment, doing the math in his head before nodding.

   “Okay…” He said, “Okay…”



He looked over at me.

   “We’re getting out of here,” He said. “See that Q7 down there? It’s got a sunroof. If I break this window, I think I can climb out and use the trusses on the roof to get to it. Then all I need to do is drop down, and I should be able to get inside before they get to me.”



   “I’m sorry, *you want to go back to the showroom?”* I asked.

   “We need to get the fuck out of here!” Tony replied. “We can’t call for help, everyone else is dead, no one is coming. Not until the morning, at least. Do you really wanna take your chances?”

I wasn’t entirely sure.



Tony took a few other sets of keys out of his pocket.

   “I can hit the alarm on a few cars out on the lot. That should draw them away,” He said. “I’ll break the window, hit the alarms and then go for it. Once I make it to the car, you can follow me. I’ll open the sunroof, it’ll be easier for you to get in!”



I just shook my head.

   “No… no, I’m not going out there. The moment you get to the car they’re going to be right on top of you. You open the sunroof and you’re dead.”

   “Well I’m not just gonna fucking leave you here!” Tony said. “You really wanna stay behind, Abby?”



I didn’t… but between that and staying in the showroom, I knew which choice was better. I looked over at the closet I’d emptied out. There was a little bit of room in there now… enough for me to fit. The door was metal. The Raptors probably wouldn’t be able to break through. 

   “There,” I said. “If you want to try and get help, I’ll be in there.”



Tony didn’t like it. But he didn’t argue. He smoothed down his hair and sighed.

   “Fine,” He said. “I’ll be back as soon as I can, okay?”

I nodded.



He put a reassuring hand on my shoulder, before heading back to the window. I saw him hit the button to unlock the SUV. Then he picked up one of the chairs by the conference table and threw it clean through the window. It shattered on impact and the chair crashed down to the ground below. I could hear movement as the Raptors went down to investigate. While they did, Tony took one of the other sets of keys out of his pocket, and hit the car alarm. 



Out on the lot, one of the car horns went off, blaring out into the night. It would’ve been a great way to call for help if there were any other buildings around us. 



Through the window, I saw two of the Raptors going out through the broken window to investigate. 

   “Gotcha…” He said under his breath. He gave me one last look, silently making a promise.

He was going to come back for me. 



Then I saw the movement through the window behind him… a shape climbing on one of the trusses on the bottom of the roof. One of the Raptors.



I didn’t get a chance to scream, but the look on my face must have given everything away. Tony looked back to see his death clinging on to the truss just outside of the window. It looked back at him, before leaping. It landed on the edge of the window and started to pull itself in. 



Tony let out a startled cry and stumbled back a step as the Raptor lifted itself into the conference room. He grabbed one of the chairs to throw at it, but by the time he’d picked it up, the Raptor was already inside and closing in on him. 



I heard him scream, but I didn’t watch. I just bolted for the storage closet and pulled the door closed behind me. I gripped the doorknob tight, hoping to whatever God might be listening that they wouldn’t be able to open it.



Tony screamed behind me… and in the darkness of the closet, his dying screams were the only thing I had. But when the silence finally came… it honestly felt a little worse.



I could hear the Raptor outside. I could hear it sniffing around the closet.



It knew where I was.



It pushed against the door and I couldn’t stop myself from letting out a strangled sob.



The Raptor chirped. I could imagine it standing just outside, head tilted as it tried to figure out how to get to me. I could hear movement as another Raptor came in through the window… then I heard a voice.

   *“Please!”*



Sheenah’s dying cries.

   *“Rhys! Please!”*



When that got no response, they tried another noise. I could hear the sound of a baby crying. A perfect imitation of a baby's cry… and when that got no response, they tried more.

   *“No! Please no!”* I heard Andy say. *“Please no! Please no!”*



   *“All clear!”* Said an unfamiliar man's voice.



At one point, I heard the sound of a fire alarm. The Raptors gently nudged the door. I felt one of them trying to move the doorknob and gripped it tighter, although they couldn’t seem to get a solid grip on the smooth metal knob. 



And when they finally gave up… I felt no reassurance. 

I knew they were still there.



For what felt like hours we sat in silence, waiting to see who would break first, me or them. They sat patiently outside the door - the only evidence of their presence being their soft breathing. I cried, knowing deep in my heart that I wasn’t going to leave this closet… they had me. This was just delaying the inevitable.



Then… finally there was another noise. The Raptors were moving. I don’t know how much time had passed, but they were moving again. I heard them going out through the window… or at least I thought I did. How could I be sure that wasn’t a fake out or just another sound they were making?



I kept the door closed even as I heard the two of them drop to the ground below. Even as the true silence sank in. I kept the door closed and I held it closed.



That was the only reason I survived.



\*\*\*



   *“All clear!”*



That voice pulled me out of the doze I’d been slipping into. My hand was still on the doorknob and my grip tightened. I could hear movement outside. I could hear human voices.

   *“We’ve got another casualty,”* A man said.

   *“Anyone else?”*

   *“I don’t know.”*

   *“Check the closet.”*



I felt something trying to open the door. I held it fast. A panicked whimper escaped me.

   *“Hold up… door won’t open…”* 



They tried it again.

   *“I think there’s someone inside!”   “Hello? Hello, can you hear me? This is Officer Peyton Charles with the Edmonton Police. Is someone in there?”*



I didn’t answer. It could’ve been them… it could’ve been them. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I didn’t open the door.



They had to take it off its hinges to get to me… and it was only then that I knew that this was real, and I was safe.

***Addendum by Dr. Lana Bloom****The account goes on for a paragraph or so with some tedious epilogue from poor Abby about how she knows what really happened that night and yadda yadda yadda. It’s really not relevant to my notes so I’ll omit it.* 



*While I am slightly disappointed that there was one survivor from the test, I can’t deny that an eyewitness testimony of the first field test of the Pavoraptor is extremely useful. I now have a better idea on exactly how they performed in the field and to be honest, they’ve exceeded most of my expectations.*



*The vocal mimicry continues to be my favorite trait of the species, and appears to be working more or less as expected. I suppose I would like to see them implement a wider variety of sounds, but I also think that will come with time and exposure to new stimuli. Considering the fact that most of the population of the targeted area was eliminated within minutes of the initial attack, and the rest were picked off quickly afterwards, I don’t think it's that important.*



*On the subject of the survivor - I don’t think I’ll do any follow up with Abby McKinnon. Anyone who’s able to survive my work deserves to live and frankly, I figure I’ve put her through enough. I am a little frustrated that hiding in a closet was enough to evade them… but identifying these issues is why we run tests and ultimately I am satisfied with this outcome.*



*Let’s see those pricks sell me a fucking lemon now…*
