“Dead men tell no tales” –A phrase, that lurks in old texts and myths, from the mouths of pirates, thieves and other of the like, dead men tell no tales indeed, but the living do. Those who live to tell at least. But perhaps, sometimes the living might follow their example and keep quiet.

The sentence bears a heavy meaning of secrecy and silence- a phrase in which sadly till this day echoes in my mind and frankly keeps depleting me of my sanity. I’ve made many attempts on finalising my story, I guess writing about traumatic experiences is much harder than I thought, especially when those experiences still feel rather fresh.

Alas, after many sessions of therapy and various medicines I have mastered the courage to finalize a draft and furthermore a final piece. For you dear reader, I give you now my sorrow to feast upon, and please forgive me for perhaps, kindling a new fear for what may happen to your body once you leave us. 

Grace Funeral Home was once a quite astounding place. In fact, the name was quite fitting. The modern funeral home situated near the St. Mary’s Church in Whitby, North Yorkshire, was a place where the living would yearn to visit even upon death. The funeral home had a striking duality, the harsh English brick style building contrasted the cozy and warming interior, a place of stillness was ever present, a reverence that made people trust the institution. The kind of trust that is born over generations.

I once stepped inside that cozy place when I was maybe around ten years old. My little hand trembled from the cold as me and my parents would wait for the dark large mahogany doors to open. We were called to my grandmas viewing a step before the burial. The inside hasn’t changed much, as later in life faith had brought me again to this place, but nor for any misfortune or grief but rather the neediness for a penny.

I had almost finished my journalism studies in York back in 2018, I was on my last semester and was working on my dissertation. I had some projects with the university I was involved with that allowed me with some earnings, but it wasn’t enough. I stumbled it by chance, whilst browsing  online for nearby jobs and eventually came across a vacant position in Grace’s Funeral Home, for the receptionist position.

While reading the add I noticed that the requirements for the position seemed very simple. Good at multitasking, writer or any other related study field and comfortable working alone.

The idea of working in the house where death would be present every moment, was not something I ever anticipated for myself. I must admit the idea even at the time felt rather odd. But somehow, the potential tranquillity, and the fact that the place is of walking distance, neutralized any sense of potential discomfort. I must say that looking at my nearly empty wallet, further established that thought.

Days have passed and I have been in contact with Mr’s Edith Grace, co-founder of the funeral home itself. Now I’ve had the chance to glimpse at her maybe few times either in town or perhaps near the church. I couldn’t recall at the time if she was there during my grandma’s casket viewing, but that was of no importance. Her physique was tall and slender, her white hair and wrinkled skin in certain areas could be the only indicator of old age. She had a somewhat sophisticated look, someone who takes pride in their work and does not hold back to speak harshly. But there were moments where she tried to smile and look natural, something that felt ominously eerie in hindsight.

The interview was short, and I ended up with a proposal quite sufficient for my taste. There were some notes in the contract however, for example certain areas that I was not permitted without company, and some other shady clauses like the right of termination if the employer deemed appropriate (aka if I broke any rules) something that my twenty-year-old self maybe should have noted. But, for fifteen pounds an hour and nearly twelve hours a week I was happy with. Plenty of time for me to equally focus on my dissertation and make some money.

My first shifts were quite uneventful, summer was quite a dead season, (excuse my poor humour), but really there was a week where not a single soul had entered the home, excluding of course delivery boys and personnel.  Me being the new girl was noticed, there were moments where I would be simply bypassed by delivery workers while they would simply leave their stuff and drop the invoices on the reception, and they would head out without exchanging a single sentence.  Rude I thought, but I guess they are equally dying to come to this place too.

It all changed with a phone call, of Mr’s Montgomery, an old lady that I soon came to find out was the wife of one of our town’s lightkeepers. It was a silent summer morning, although the wind outside and gloomy sky made it feel like early autumn, the phone rang and broke the silence.

“Grace’s Funeral Home this is Jana speaking how can I help ya?”

The voice on the other end trembled at first, her breath was escaping at a faster pace, but she tried to catch it.

“I… Uh… yeah I need to make arrangements”

A pause followed. I knew what came next, I thought I knew how to handle it, but I was caught off guard.

“Of course, ehm, firstly I must express my condolences, would you like me to guide you through the process?”

Another short pause, followed by a barely noticeable confirmation. We discussed the essentials, such as embalmment, burial services etc. and of course the prices. Edith had made it clear to me that I must clarify firstly with the client if they wished to know the prices on the first call, she mentioned that usually a lot of people struck by grief sometimes don’t think much about how a service is until it hits them right in the face when they see it afterwards. Now I do not know how much truth this carries but I digress.

Elizabeth Montgomery came to our office two days later to further discuss our high-quality services. She brought photos of the deceased and further information for the service. Grace Funeral Home takes pride in its embalmment process, for their result of the deceased looks as if he or she was still alive. I guess the selling point of the funeral home. 

Days after I came earlier to work than expected and I so happened to stumble upon a queer moment. Just before entering the vicinity of funeral home, I saw a delivery truck that I do not recall seeing before. My journalism instincts kicked in and curiosity took over, I was thirty minutes earlier than expected, for that day I just couldn’t keep myself in bed any longer.

I moved a bit offsite and tried to keep myself from the view. The backside of the service van was open and two short men dragged a couple of red and blue plastic barrels. Shortly after, out of the main entrance, Edith made her way towards the truck, flanked on both sides by two grizzled men. She held a piece of paper and inspected the delivery parcels; she seemed to have some short chat with the two men that accompanied her before signing the paper and hurdling back to the home. This interaction may have lasted for like less than ten minutes and the men were rapidly bolting in the truck and starting the engine. I moved as the truck passed, trying to hide myself a bit more before seeing it vanishing into the distance onto the main road.

I waited until it was just before my shift time, and I slowly made my way and would probably make up an excuse for my delay. Edith didn’t seem to be bothered, she even prompts me if I wanted to come much later the following days since not much work is needed to be done anyways. Now, here is where I would initially say yes, but this whole weird morning made me want to poke my nose a bit deeper.

 

 

While at work I decided to check if there was any expected delivery for today and frankly there was not, the only expected delivery was for tomorrow, which was Mr Montgomery body from the hospital’s morgue.

Montgomery’s body had arrived as expected. The black body bag was dragged from the entrance towards the funerals home fridge, where the body would be kept for a bit longer while they prepared the embalming process. I must say, I found that morning not to be pleasant, I thought I would be fine but seeing a body bag did send a shiver down my spine. The thought that this bag could at any moment move and that a corpse is now in this area made for a quite unsettling sensation.

The body was then moved to the embalming room, a room in which I had no access to.  One of the few restricted areas. In my possession I also had found a small piece of evidence. Tucked deep into some folder files whilst searching for something I found an invoice dating back to 2009 from a company called EduMedica, a company based in Germany who specialized in human silicone replicas, mainly for medical students and universities.

However, one of the CEOs of this company had opened a new company in the UK under the name, SilicaCo. This company, unlike its predecessor not only specialised in silicone replicas but also body parts and other medical equipment. This clicked something in me, something that prompted me to dig a little deeper. In fact, that was probably the only exciting thing that day and seemed like a good way to keep myself busy and not think about death all the time.

My brain began circulating ever more, when I stumbled upon a post for EduMedica from a German site, just two years before some tax fraud allegations. The post was from a medical blog webpage and citing a hospital in Munich praising the company for their realistic take on human bodies. Whilst scrolling through the page there were multiple photos from the medical university showing off the various parts, one photo however captured a detail in which took me a while to process. Behind the students, just tucked under a table were two buckets, one red and one blue like the ones I saw earlier today.

The puzzle pieces seemed there at the time, and in my mind queer questions began living rent free for days later. A coincidence one may say, but through my studies I leaned one thing. Coincidences are rare, especially when fraud and allegations exist. I send the post to myself via email and cleared the history and email addresses. And I kept my silence for the day. For I did not know what to make of it.

Later that night in the comfort of my home, I began thinking, why would silicone be needed in Grace’s Funeral home. Embalming training, I doubt silicone can be used for it, and frankly there’s only Nancy who does the embalmment and I haven’t seen any trainees roaming around, nor for the autopsy for that part, who I believe is done by Edith and her husband James. 

During the viewing day, Mr’s Montgomery would come by around twelve and we would present her with her deceased husband ready for cremation. The viewing room was prepared, and the coffin stand was placed in the centre whilst flower wreaths were made and stacked under and beside the large picture of Mr. Montgomery. He had a smile on that photo, it was taken while he was working at the lighthouse, a joy for him from what I’ve been told by Elizabeth.

Time passed by and I saw Nancy our embalmer and Edith coming from the embalming room. Edith nodded me to come and help carry the coffin towards the viewing room and make sure it placed properly for display. The closed coffin gleaned as we passed though the short parlour area and made our way towards the viewing room where me and Nancy lifted the coffin onto its stand and opened the first half to see if everything was up to standards.

I cannot say that a moment of dread washed over me, the old wrinkly face, the skin and the stitches in some areas like the ears and neck. Nancy broke the silence by ordering me to not stay too close to it, as my breathing could affect something. Nonsense of course. But I was surprised, the detail was immaculate, such clean colours for the makeup, it indeed felt like it was real.

Nancy left the room, and I followed, but halfway through a thought came back to my mind. My brain lingered on the previous day’s finds, something itched, something pulled me back to that coffin and something made me think, why not touch the skin Jana, indeed… why not?

I made sure no one was around and took a glimpse at the corners of the ceiling, making sure I was doing my job, but I was mainly looking for any cameras in which I found not. Paranoia of course. I couldn’t recall if we had any but instinctively, I still decided to make sure. I slowly approached the open casket and before me I saw again the face of old Montgomery, his skin painted as if fresh, his outfit clean and kept, his arms placed in resting position while a bible was placed in his hands.

It’s been a while since I’ve been this close to a corpse, long ago had I had the same misfortune, but here I find myself again, in the same position just a bit older. This time instead of trying to poke my grandma to see if she was truly dead, I poke a random stranger to see what he is made off.

The skin felt warm, soft to the touch yet firm. The more I looked at the dead man, the more unsettling it became, something in the back of my head thought that he would jump or open his eyes at any moment. My eyes tried to avoid his, although they were closed and that’s where I noticed a small detail.  A bit further back on the side of the neck just before the hairline was a small vertical line that seemed to go all the way up to the skull and down towards the shoulders. Of course, it was painted over, and I thought of it being some weird shadow, but the line was quite straight.

Upon closer inspection I also noticed various holes where supposedly the age spots were. My suspicions grew louder but alas I had no time to investigate further for my ears have heard the walking on the wooden floorboards from the reception. I immediately moved back and began adjusting the wreaths. Edith came around and asked me why I wasn’t in my position. Frankly I explained her that the wreath had fallen, and I had to adjust it to look good for Elizabeth, and I wanted to make sure that everything was great since this was my first viewing for the place.

A smile carved on her face as my false intentions made their way through her mind. She instructed me to go back and wait for Elizabeth and inform her once she arrives. I nodded and finally made my way to the reception where I waited to greet our guest. I could not shake the unsettling feeling that perhaps that the “thing” that would be cremated, was not Mr Montgomery, and if that’s the case, where is he!

The viewing came and went, Elizabeth was thankful, and the coffin was taken to the crematorium area where it would be cremated. Days later we had the urn and the message ready for pick up. Much later we received an email from Elizabeth, thanking us for the service and that she spread the ashes of her beloved into the ocean where the lighthouse stands. A touching message, one that somehow clashed with my concerns, for by that time I had learned new information, a far more shocking one, and the main reason why I am writing this.

It was a nice summer night, me and my friends enjoyed some cold pints in our local pub. I had spilled some of my information to them. I remembered it was one of my friends who given the circumstances of alcohol made a giant conspiracy leap.

“Perhaps they ship the bodies and sell the organs!” He said jokingly. But that somehow triggered me, somehow it felt like one of those Eureka moments. I looked him dead in the eye and my smile became wider.

“I think ya right!” I said as I chugged my leftover beer and convinced one of my closest friends to join me to a trip to the funeral home. There was protest of course, but I was determined to show them that perhaps I was not crazy. He reluctantly agreed and we both made our way in the night towards that dreadful place. I was on my opening shift the next day, hence I had the keys to the front door, and I know that we have no security in that place, so perhaps I could sneak in and finally see what’s in those “restricted areas”.

The cold air brought most of our senses back, my adrenaline slowed as I saw the black mahogany doors appear closer. My friend seemed ever more reluctant to be with me, but I told him that his presence inside was not needed, I only needed him to stay out of site but within reach and keep me updated if anything weird pops up. He agreed to the simple task and stood behind the stone wall of the park opposite the funeral home, while I crossed the road and made my way to the building.

 

The black mahogany doors seemed taller than usual, the windows tall and slender reflecting the nearby streetlights, their dark insides felt hollow solemn eyes watching me. The home looked much more eerie at night and far more treacherous. Its brick walls seemed greyer and, in the areas, where the orange streetlamp would reflect appeared as if stained with dried blood. I took a deep breath and entered approached the doors, my key slowly making its way into the keyhole and turning causing the lock to click.

I quickly disabled the alarm next to the door with the code causing the beeps of the buttons to echo into the dark room. A dead silence followed, which could not have been more poetic under different circumstances, but now in the midnight hour it was quite fore boarding to say the least.  I did not dare to turn on the lights, much to my dislike, for I did not risk drawing any attention. The light from the outside illuminated my desk and I could see its casting beams coming through the tall windows, causing some objects to take shapes that otherwise it would have been ignored.

Every breath felt heavy, and I could feel my heart racing with every footstep I made, as it echoed in this dark place. Closing the door behind me did not help either, for every visible light before me vanished. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and texted my friend to let me know if he saw anything from the outside as I navigated my self in this now empty space. I could feel my hair rising on the back of my head, as my eyes slowly would tear up from dread and anxiety.

A random rattle or perhaps a roar, came out of nowhere, which made me jump and causing my phone to drop to the floor. Not long after, the sound transitioned into a harsh buzzing and my mind recognized it. The noise was from the huge fridged in the cooling room, the one where the corpses are kept, the notion that perhaps restless spirits were watching me didn’t make it less comforting. The sound became louder as I approached the hallway that leads to the room, and I could not deny that there was something off about this.

My breath became shorter, as if my lungs were filled with heavier air, and my throat dried. The pulse in my heart could almost be heard as I slowly turned around the wall close to my desk and making my way down the hallway. Just before the end of it I knew somewhere on the left was Edith’s office and opposite to it the storage room. But at the end of the hall at night now it was visible, the door to the refrigerator room. Its red bulb flickering, illuminating parts of the hallway, like some monstrous eye in the night.

Now, what follows I cannot explain it, sometimes I chug it to fear, or potential remains from the alcohol, but till this day I find it wild to ignore. In fact, even writing this makes my skin crawl at the memory.

It was while I was facing the metallic door that shimmered under the red pulsating lightbulb that a sensation of a cold wind came around me. Sending shiver down my spine. It felt as if someone pressed its cold lips next to my ear.

“*Look Inside”*

The whisper made its presence immediately startling me and causing me to turn around facing my flash towards the other end of the hallway only to see nothingness. Silence followed, but soon the faint wind of the outside picked up, causing the nearby trees to sway and their stretched shadows that were casted from the living room to dance onto the wall like menacing tentacles. I gulped but the sensation of dread soon faded, as my task in mind took over. The buzzing sound became louder, and I noticed the handle of the refrigerator room to gleam, inviting me to it.

Upon opening the door, the light flickered, and before me stood a room that was reminiscent of a high school locker room. The fridges were like the ones you expect in a morgue. Blocks of metal, with square door hatches and a latch system to open, then a drawer system where the body would be placed. Upon inspecting the individual hatches one tag was hanging from one of the handles.

Taking a closer look I froze at the name. 

“James Montgomery, age 56, cause of death: heart failure.”

My jaw dropped, I instantly took a photo of the hatch and the note before deciding to do the craziest thing that night I can still think of. Opening the fridge. My heart skipped a beat at the view of the frozen feet coming appearing before me after the frozen mist had settled. My hands trembled as I slowly kept pulling the drawer wishing that this would finally end. My pulse began beating faster, as my hands finally reached near the shoulder and I could slowly pull unveil the white sheet that covered the body.

I stepped back, as the broken half face of James Montgomery was placed before me. The very same man that we cremated yesterday. His facial features were darker, more greyish like expected from a corpse, its face which half deformed and sunken deep into the crevices nearly touching the skull, as if the muscles inside had deteriorated.  This time his skin felt cold to the touch, and not firm didn’t bounce back in place. I quivered, but I knew something here was foul play.

I closed my eyes and tried to take as much as photos as I can. Before I saw the notification from my friend that some van just made a turn and made its way towards the family home. I quickly but meticulously pushed the corpse back to his place. Closed the lid and rushed to go the entrance while shutting the fridge door behind me. Another text, the van parked just behind the funeral home. I quickly rushed to the main entrance where I came from and peeked outside, footsteps were getting closer around the corner coming towards the main entrance.

I quickly locked the door and silenced my phone and frantically looked for a place to hide. I quickly scanned the area as I could, and my first instinct was to go behind the large couch we had in the waiting area. I slowly pushed the couch just a bit from the wall and laid between, making it the most uncomfortable placement I was ever in. Infront of me was a table that thankfully was blocking a lot of my view so I was in hope that I would not be spotted.

I could hear the voices and chatter between the people outside coming closer, and one voice I recognized, for it was Nancy, our embalmer. She unlocked the door and thankfully didn’t open the light either. She stood by the door I could see the silhouette of her legs just standing.

“Alright make it quick you two!”

“What number is the body?”

“You will see his name tag we didn’t have anyone else, Montgomery.”

The two men rushed inside and walked confidently towards the fridge area. Moments later one came towards presumably at the edge of the entrance of the hallway.

“Hey Nanc, this old bloke’s face is sunken weirdly is that how you got him?”

“What you mean?  Just get him and let’s go!”

“I’m just saying! He might fetch less of a price!”

Angrily she just pushed open the door to make more space and looked outside.

She pinched her temple and ordered in a relatively low voice as if trying to not be heard.

“Edith doesn’t pay you and me for chit chat, just load him and we will talk later”

The man’s footsteps disappeared and moments later the rolling of wheels could be heard onto the wooden floorboards. From my view I could barely see much, but I saw them dragging Montgomery’s body onto a stretcher outside the funeral home. I was left speechless.

“A price? What is this all about” I pondered.

Eventually Nancy, closed the door behind her, and I could hear her locking it. I’ve remained in that place for a bit longer, making sure that the van slowly left its initial position. The place again plunged into darkness, and I slowly made my way out of my hiding spot. My phone was spammed with concerning messages and after a short reassurance I slowly made my way towards the exit. I could not shake this eerie sensation, that I felt powerless, I have no idea how deep this rabbit hole goes, and frankly I have no idea what I would have done with that information.

When I exited the building, I saw him peeking out behind the stone wall and rushing towards me in a haste.  His eyes were wide open and he bombared me with questions to which I could hardly respond. But I was glad that this was not a solo adventure.

Just before we left, I told him that I had one more thing to check out, and that was the disposal area behind the funeral home. He insisted that this already was too much, but call It curiosity or stupidity of the mind, I was still determined to look further.

After some brief discussion, we’ve made our way around the funeral home, where in the past I have seen the cleaning lady occasionally disposing the collected trash bags.

There were three large dumpsters whose labels clearly faded by the usage. Three of them were for the main recycling items such as PMD, Paper and the other one for biohazardous materials, the later which was locked with a heavy chain. Knowing it would probably fail but alas, I decided to try my key to its lock but to no avail as predicted. Therefore, I began observing the rest of the dumpsters whose contents nearly fell on the ground due to how overfilled they were.   

Upon closer inspection, the PMD dumpster held something familiar. Upon lifting the lid, I saw deep into the crevasse as if trying to be subtle, some buckets that were stacked onto each other. My phone’s flash, managed to illuminate the label of the one and vaguely its insides. On the wall of the bucket a solidified substance, glossy and gelatinous could be seen. The label on it, although slightly worn and torn, still readable. Silicone Hardener.

I closed the lid, and the dots immediately connected into my mind. I turned to my friend and noted him to leave now as fast as we could and that is what we did that night. We shortly parted ways, and I told him I would send him soon, but for now I needed to rest for the night’s events slowly began creeping in on me.

I do not know what happens under closed doors in Grace Funeral Homes, heck I think I managed to stay for a bit longer before quitting, since I didn’t want to raise any more suspicion. I am tempted to inform the police, but I have no solid evidence and given the people that these individuals deal with I am perhaps in a massive disadvantage.  

I visited my grandmothers grave not long after, and whilst staring at the grave, I couldn’t help thinking that perhaps under that dampen soil, lies a silicone corpse.
