My name is Liam. I’m twenty-six. I have a wife, Clara, a three-year-old son, Mickey, and my "beloved" IT job, where being five minutes late earns you a reprimand and another shouting match with the department head. Until last summer, I was the guy everyone *dreaded*—the one who’d "show up late to his own funeral," as my mates joked. My boss had even hinted at termination. Then, one night, after a booze-soaked office party, my friends **Daniel** and **Alex** and I decided to test the rumors about **Old Agnes**—the former stage actress the town whispered had been "cursed into madness." Her cottage stood on the edge of **Havenbrook**, a sleepy English village of cobbled lanes and ivy-choked stone houses, its paint peeling like old parchment. Inside, the air smelled of incense and rotting apples, and a dusty antique clock without hands hung crookedly on the wall.

— Well, lads, — she rasped, eyeing us through cigarette smoke, — what d’you want?

Daniel wished for wealth. Alex for his ex, Ella, to come back. I stood there, drunk and numb, and blurted: *“I want to never be late again. For time to carry me where I’m supposed to be.”*

Agnes smirked, as if I’d asked for the moon.  
— You’ll see tomorrow, — she whispered, pressing a cracked river stone into my palm. — But remember: *time doesn’t forgive those who cheat it.*

We laughed, tossed coins on her table, and left. The next morning, I woke up five minutes *before* my alarm. Buses waited for me. Even my boss gaped: *“Who are you?”* Clara nearly dropped her tea in shock.

I thought it was a miracle.

The first time I was late was a month later.

Clara and I had tickets to a rare concert—a precious night alone. Mickey wouldn’t sleep. Clara couldn’t find her shoes. We bolted out the door seven minutes late. I counted traffic lights like a maniac, but the bus pulled away. *Bloody hell*, I fumed. When we reached the hall, the concert was canceled—electrical fire, smoke, evacuation. No one was hurt, but Clara sighed: *“Sometimes… it’s better to be late, isn’t it?”*

I nodded, but my throat burned. Then I remembered Agnes. Her words. The stone I still carried in my pocket.

A week later, I was late again. I was supposed to pick Clara up from work at six. Stuck in a meeting, I left at 6:05. Pulling up to her office, I saw flashing lights. The building’s lift had collapsed. Clara was inside. They pulled her out unharmed, but for a week, her voice shook when she spoke.

— You’ve changed, — she murmured one night, staring at the ceiling. — You’re… afraid of yourself.

I didn’t answer. Because I suspected it wasn’t coincidence.

I decided to test it.

I told Daniel to meet me at Starbucks at noon. At 11:55, I shut my laptop and sat in my chair, watching the clock. At 12:01, I walked out.

Ten minutes later, his text lit up my phone: *“Where are you? FIRE HERE. GET OUT.”*

I sprinted to smoke, sirens, shattered glass. The café was burning. No one died, but… I *knew*.

After that, I became a shadow. Woke at 5:59 to be at the stove by 6:00. Set ten phone alarms. Canceled plans if traffic was uncertain. Clara pleaded: *“You’ll crack.”* Mickey started flinching when I jumped up to check the time.

Once, I overslept by three minutes. I was supposed to take Clara for a scan—our second baby. The doctor said: *“You missed the window. We can’t detect a heartbeat.”*

It wasn’t a miscarriage. It was *too late*.

— I’m sorry, — I whispered. She hugged me, confused, but I knew: *this was my fault*. I didn’t deserve her arms.

I understood then: the curse didn’t ask *why* I was late. It just… *acted*.

A week after the scan, I stormed back to Agnes’s cottage. Made an appointment for 9 a.m. *This witch will undo it—or answer for it*, I thought. I sat by her door at 8:45. Then Clara called: Mickey had choked. After rushing him to the clinic and seeing he was fine, I sped back—*late*.

Her door was ajar. Inside, paramedics.  
— Time of death: 9:02 a.m. Heart attack.

I was shattered. The one who cursed me was gone—and with her, my last hope. The medics refused to talk, but I found her last client.  
— She sat by the door, clutching a clock, shaking like a leaf. Kept muttering, *“He’ll be late… he’ll be late…”* Then she just… dropped.

Since then, I’ve been more careful. But today…

Today, I was late for the first time in six months.

Clara asked me to pick up Mickey from the nursery by six—she was stuck at work. I finished a call at 5:30, but en route, the teacher texted: *“Mickey fell off the slide. Bleeding head. Call Clara—I’ve alerted her.”* I floored the accelerator, weaving through traffic, praying: *Don’t be late. Don’t be late.* Distracted, I didn’t see the car speeding toward me at the crossroads.

A brutal crash. My car spun. I stumbled out, scratched but whole. The nursery was one block away. I ran, but when I arrived… something was wrong.

The gates were wide open. The slide lay overturned, toys scattered. No sirens. No screams. Just silence.

My phone buzzed. Clara.

*If I answer, I’ll hear…* But I already knew how the curse worked. At *exactly* six, when I should’ve been here, something happened. Not a fire. Not an accident. Something irreversible. Something I *earned*.

My fingers trembled. I couldn’t press *accept*. Because if I did…  
…if I heard her voice…  
…if she said, *“He’s gone…”*

The call ended. Then it hit me: *If I were really here, there’d be ambulances. People.* *Am I… still in the car? Did I die? Or lose my mind?*

I stared at the screen: 6:11 p.m. A message from Clara at 5:57:  
*“I’m here. Mickey’s with me, getting stitched up. He’s okay. Where are you?”*

Clara called again.  
The screen glowed: 6:12 p.m.

I pressed *accept*.

Silence on the line.

But in that silence… I heard clocks ticking.  
Louder.  
Closer.
