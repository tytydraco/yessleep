I just moved into my new apartment two weeks ago.

I thought the building was kept pretty clean, considering that the price was lower than average. The walls were re-painted not long ago, according to the property agent. He also mentioned something about having regular maintenance for residents here. Who wouldn't snatch up such a good deal?

But the problem is the apartment next to mine. *Apartment 616.*

Anyone who walks past this level would notice the stark contrast between every other door and the one belonging to 616. Most doors are either freshly painted or just having a few small scratches here and there. But the door to 616 was pretty much... dilapidated. The hinges were rusty and coated with some sort of oil, the wooden surface of the door was pretty much falling apart, and the coat of paint is chipping off bit by bit. There were some writings done in red paint on the wall below the window. I'm guessing the person must have been in debt.

I've never seen anyone entering or leaving that apartment during the period I've been staying here. And I came to the conclusion that the unit was vacant.

I've asked my other neighbours, and my assumption was indeed right. But no one knew who the previous occupant was, or what happened to them. I guess it must have been vacant for a long time.

One night, I entered the lift back to my apartment after some grocery shopping. A woman came in after me. She had long silky black hair, wearing a crimson red tank top. I pressed the number 6, and she smiled at me.

"You live at level 6 too? I've never seen you before, you must be new here?"

Ah, another neighbour of mine. I smiled back.

"Yeah, just moved in a couple days ago."

The first thing I noticed about her were her eyes. They looked so pretty. One was blue and the other was brown.

"Your eyes are really pretty by the way, heterochromia?" I added.

She nodded. "Thanks"

Once we stepped out of the lift, apartment 616 flashed through my mind, and I debated whether I should ask her about it, see if she knows anything.

"Uh... any chances that you know who used to live in unit 616? I heard it's been vacant for a really long time. But why is it the only unit that isn't re-painted?"

She turned to look at me, and I could swear that she grinned really widely for split second.

She raised her left arm to scratch her head, and I couldn't help but notice the scars on her wrists. "I've never tried to find out. But rumors say that that apartment is haunted. All those who came for repainting work left immediately after, saying that someone was talking to them from inside the house. I suggest you stay away too. You know, just to be safe."

'Unless... you're the type who likes ghost hunting." She cackled. "Just don't freak out when things don't go like you expected."

I stared at the numerous lines on her wrists, deciding not to mention anything about it. After all, not everyone wants to talk to strangers about their problems.

"Ah I see... alright thanks for the info."

I watched as she disappeared into the last unit on the opposite end of the level.

I didn't think much about the fact that something supernatural might be living next door. Well, I didn't believe in ghosts. I simply went about my days as usual, but I never saw that woman again. I just hoped she was okay... with whatever she was going through.

A few nights later, I was woken up by some noises next door at around 1am. *Yes, from the supposedly 'empty' apartment.* I stayed still for a few moments, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation. It sounded like furnitures were being dragged around, and a woman's voice was then heard. I thought I was hallucinating. The apartment was vacant, and the noises could very well have been from upstairs or something, so I shrugged it off and went back to sleep.

The next morning, I left my house at around 6.30am for work. I locked the door and remembered the noises from last night. I glanced towards apartment 616 and decided to take a look.

For every unit, instead of peepholes, we have this thin rectangular slit with a flap that can be pushed open from both sides to slot letters in, kind of like a pet's door. And to my surprised, the one for 616 was actually opened. Someone might have pushed it open out of curiosity.

I moved closer, wanting to take a look at the interior of this vacant home. But I wasn't ready for what I was about to see.

The moment I lean down a little to peep into the slit, a pair of eyes were staring back at me.

A pair of eyes which I had seen before.

*One iris was blue, and the other was brown.*

I stumbled back, staring at the slit where the eyes had been. The flap was now closed.

*Why was the woman I met inside the unit? Does she live here? But I swore I saw here walk into the last unit on the other end that day. And... wasn't this unit supposed to be vacant?*

So many questions were running through my mind that I didn't notice my surroundings immediately. But when I did, I let out a sharp gasp.

I was no longer at the corridor. *I was now inside the apartment.*

I panicked, gripping the door handle and twisting it. It didn't budge. I tried the lock. It wasn't locked at all, but I just couldn't get the door open. I spent a long time trying to call for help, trying all sorts of things like shouting and banging on the doors and walls, but none of it worked. No one came. They should be able to hear me, but it seems like they didn't, or couldn't.

Since none of it was working, I took a deep breath to calm myself down, turning around and scanning the room.

It was a what you'd imagine a normal apartment to look like. One couch, a tv, and a small dining table in the living room. In the bedroom was a bed, a nightstand, and a closet.

I soon noticed that there were several photo frames placed around the apartment. They must belong to the previous owner who lived here.

I picked up from the one on the nightstand, and to my horror, the woman in the picture was the one I had met in the lift a few nights ago.

I noticed a folded piece of paper lying on the unmade bed.

It was a news article from a long time ago. Even the paper had turned yellow and moldy. But the words could still be seen clearly.

*"Woman found dead in apartment with wrist slit.*

*Signs of struggle, police suspect foul play."*

Everything made sense now.

The woman I met in the lift? She was the previous occupant of this 'haunted' vacant apartment. And the scars on her wrist? That was how she died.

But that aside, I still have so many questions unanswered.

*Why did I get (teleported?) in here? What does she want? Where is she? And how do I get out?*

I have to mention that this unit has no windows (Why? I don't know)... just solid walls where windows should have been apart from the door. And now I'm stuck here with no way to get out. I'm not sure if anyone will find me soon.

Yes I've tried calling all emergency numbers, but the line wouldn't connect, it's all static. And my messages wouldn't go through either.

I'll stop here since my phone is dying, but luckily there's a working charger here.
