[Previous case](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/1IL4NYp0TA)

I’m sorry in advance. It's been a rough couple of weeks, so I'm feeling a little scatterbrained. 

For starters, I've lost my left hand. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

Like I said, I'm not thinking right. Before I get into what happened, I'll begin by updating yinz on the events I left off on last time. 

The mechanic’s stunt with the ELKS worked, at least temporarily. A couple of days after that Wood Maiden clusterfuck, the Department of Wildlife presented their findings about blackpoll warblers at another hearing. This time, they were able to prove that the Endangered Species Act should be invoked to protect that patch of wilderness. 

Despite the good news, we all knew better than to get our hopes up. It was clear that something wasn't right with that company. It was only a matter of time before their overpaid lawyers found some regulatory loophole, or found another area housing territorial Neighbors to infringe upon.  

It was not over. The warbler incident only slowed them down. 

The trouble started out innocently enough. We received a call for an ant infestation. Ants. In hindsight, that was probably the client's way of being funny. He had been casual and pleasant on the phone; nothing to elicit any cause for alarm. And of course, at the time, I hadn't realized the gravity of the situation. Nobody did. 

Because of the way things have been going the past few months, we try to work in pairs now. For the most part, we have the personnel to do that, even with Deirdre being temporarily out to recover from her injuries. This time, Reyna and I had buddied up. It was a good thing, too. I doubt I'd be here if it wasn't for her. 

Speaking of The Girlfriend, she straight up told me that she was hoping to set a positive example for me by giving herself the resources to appropriately recover rather than trying to push through the pain like a ‘stubborn mule.’ I don't know where this audacity has come from, by the way. I think my coworkers have been a good/bad influence on her. I'll give yinz a hint: one of these employees has fangs and a vendetta against a dragonfly, while the other still can't ride the big kid rides at Waldameer.

But for the most part, Deirdre is healing well. She's not used to the soreness and itching that comes with those types of injuries, so she's been paranoid about infections. I've just been doing my best to assure her that all of what she was experiencing was normal, along with helping her change bandages when necessary. Keeping the wounds covered seems to settle her mind somewhat, with the added bonus of keeping her from picking at her stitches. 

It was also for the better that she wasn't around for what Reyna and I got to experience on this ‘ant infestation’ call. 

The client had informed me that his house had a guard. Like a regular person, I assumed that meant he lived in the gated community. Nope. He had a personal security guardbox planted at the forefront of his property, enclosed by what appeared to be a sturdy iron fence. 

Through the gate, I could see that the house looked less like a home and more like a monument to brutalism. All concrete and boxy shapes with the exception of the massive, circular windows. A shiny European car that didn’t seem ideal for driving along these pothole-covered back roads was parked underneath a gray, trapezoidal structure. 

In other words, it was hideous. More of a statue than a living space. Judging by Reyna's grimace, she shared my opinion on the architectural nightmare looming before us. 

In addition to the unwelcoming concrete castle, the guard was… strange. Both of us were hesitant to give him either of our names, for obvious reasons. Despite looking human, something about his demeanor gave me pause, but I couldn't put my finger on what. His movements were stiff and slow, almost mechanical. His eyes were dull and deadpan as he stared down at me. 

We went back and forth until eventually, his phone rang, then he nodded with a swine-like grunt before opening the gate. 

Reyna subtly glanced over her shoulder back at the guard booth and lowered her voice, “Something was *very* off about that guy.”

I let out a little huff of relief, “Okay, I'm glad it wasn't just me.”

“Yeah, that dude looks like he just discovered how to be human yesterday.”

“And not very well.” I agreed. 

Something moved in one of the circular windows. Frowning, I leaned closer like that would make me see better, somehow. I never claimed to be bright. Shockingly enough, I did not spontaneously develop telescopic vision and couldn't see what the source of the movement was. 

Reyna voiced my thoughts perfectly: “Will I sound like a wimp if I say that I don't want to go in there?”

I shook my head, strongly considering putting the company truck in reverse, “Not at all. Actually, I'm right there with you. Should we-”

The front door opened and the man I assumed to be the client strode out. He beamed at us, eyes concealed behind dark shades. For context, it was overcast that day. This is Pennsylvania; we get maybe two sunny days a month during the early spring, if we're lucky. It also threw me off that the client had a glowing summery tan, a stark contrast to everyone else around here who was sallow after months of drab, gray skies. Personally, my complexion was rivaling Victor's; even Reyna’s ordinarily brown skin was looking pale. 

She and I exchanged equal looks of trepidation before I rolled down the window to speak to him. 

The first thing he did was point at the sunglasses, “Forgive my big ol’ migraine glasses! You know how it is.”

I didn't, but okay. He extended a large hand to me through the window in greeting, showing off a watch that appeared more expensive than the company truck and my Jeep combined. I politely accepted, noting the firmness of his grip. He didn't give me any room to exit without hitting him with the truck's door, so I just sat there uncomfortably.

“You have an ant problem?” I asked apprehensively, doing my best to hide my nerves behind the guise of professionalism. 

The client's way of speaking was excitable, punctuated by broad, sweeping hand gestures. “Oh yeah! Big ones! Bigger than you've probably ever seen before, even in your line of work.” The client laughed like it was an inside joke. 

Clearly, the security guard wasn’t the only oddity on that property. I glanced around, wondering if we’d somehow made it below the Mounds without realizing it, or I was having one of my stress-induced, uncanny, work-related nightmares. 

When I looked back at Reyna, I saw that she was subtly shaking her head, eyes wide with worry. She wanted to leave. I was right there with her. Everything within me told me that it wouldn’t be wise to enter that house. But if he was a Neighbor - or something else - we’d need to be clever about removing ourselves from this situation. Lying would be akin to digging our own graves.

“If it's as bad as you make it sound, we might be a bit underprepared.” I felt ridiculous saying it, considering that this was supposed to be an ant infestation, but it technically wasn’t a lie. I didn’t feel prepared for whatever it was that could be waiting inside.

The client’s toothy smile did fade a bit. “From what I’ve heard, Orion Pest Control can handle just about anything. Ants should be no problem for you.”

That statement rubbed me the wrong way. Not the wording, necessarily, but the way he said it.

“What species of ant are we dealing with, exactly?” I questioned slowly.

The client shrugged, “The kind with six legs? How the hell would I know? That’s *your* expertise, isn’t it?”

Biting back irritation, I clarified, “Are these ants from our world or somewhere else?”

“I reckon they came in from outside. They don’t just sprout up in houses all willy-nilly, now, do they?” The client had another laugh at his own not-joke.

This was going nowhere. Still being professional, I let myself sound a little more firm, “Sir, for our own safety as well as yours, neither of us will set foot in that house unless you are more upfront about what is going on. Mishandling of infestations can worsen a situation. Property damage and you losing additional money is the last thing that I want for you.”

I’d expected some resistance. He set his hands on the rim of my open window, drumming his fingers thoughtfully as he replied, “Time isn’t really something I’m willing to spare all that often. It’s not infinite, nor is it some construct created by man. The reality is that time is life, and it’s ticking away with each passing second. We have wasted many breaths here that could’ve been spent more productively. I reached out to Orion because ordinarily, having the best and hiring the best is the most efficient preservation of time and consequently, life. Have I made a mistake in contacting you? Have I contributed to my and your own slow, mundane suicides?”

At the time, I'd thought only a Neighbor could speak this obnoxiously. Turns out, many types of atypical beings are capable of sounding like college students that take one philosophy class and think themselves the next Great Thinker. 

“Yes, I believe this was a mistake.” I told him, doing my best to sound regretful. “It was not our intent to inconvenience you. We will get out of your hair.”

However, the client didn’t move away from the window, though his fidgeting had stopped. For a moment, I simply saw Reyna’s and my own face reflected back at us in his shades, until he leaned in and said almost ruefully, “You’re already in the trap. You should at least see the bait.”

*Shit.*

The client went back to beaming at us, giving the top of the truck an encouraging tap, “I’ll make up some coffee. Meet you inside, ladies!”

Once he had disappeared back into the concrete monstrosity, Reyna whispered, “Just how fucked are we right now?”

With the gloom of the day, I hadn’t been able to see his shadow. The only clues about our situation were that this client was stupid rich and he thought himself highly intelligent. That wasn’t much. We were essentially flying blind. Not good, in our career path. Information is the best weapon against these things, and this client had done well to disarm us. 

With a shake of my head and a pit in my stomach, my only answer for her was, “I don’t know, and I’m not sure how much worse it’ll get if we wear out his patience any thinner.”

“So what’s the plan?”

“We stay together, no matter what,” I explained. “I’m going to call Victor before we head in. Hopefully, he and Wes can get here before anything happens.”

Reyna swallowed before informing me, “My hagstone didn’t move when he got close. Whatever he is, the stone doesn’t repel him. Maybe I can see what he is, at least? Actually, did you see anything?”

I shook my head again, telling her about how his shadow wasn’t visible thanks to our delightful Pennsylvania weather. 

When I tried to reach Victor, the phone didn't ring. The call dropped despite having full service. When I tried again, the same thing happened. Even though she had a different phone carrier, Reyna couldn't get ahold of anyone either. She looked like she wanted to cry. Likewise, I’d jumped from experiencing a vague sense of unease to outright alarm. 

If shit went south, we wouldn't even be able to call for help. We were on our own. 

“We're not helpless,” I reminded her and myself. “I've got Ratcatcher. You've got the Squelcher. We have plenty of salt, as well as the shotgun in the back. Wes has been working with you on how to use it, right?”

She nodded. Reyna was mostly used to handling human infestations, as well as other spiritual matters. She was primarily hired on as an exorcist and a healer. When it comes to combat, she tends to shy away somewhat, which I don't blame her for. 

This was also the first time Wes had been given the responsibility of training, so we were about to see how good of a teacher he was. At the very least, I could see that he instilled the basics of gun safety in her when she pulled it out of the back of the cab: finger off the trigger, safety turned ‘on’, keeping it pointed away from me. 

The front door, like the rest of the house, was gray. Its only feature was a chrome handle. Not even a window to look through. I crossed the threshold first, not surprised when I found that the inside was also monochromatic. Like the exterior, the furniture was a mixture of squares and rectangles. Curves are for poor people. Same with color. And fun. And joy. But what do I know about interior design? I chase and get chased by Celtic folklore for a living. 

The artwork hanging above the fireplace was strangely gory, despite not having a drop of blood or any viscera depicted. It was more like the implication of gore; the shapes in the frame all resembled various limbs strewn together in dull shades of black, brown, and white. Another piece displayed boxy, mechanical faces in various stages of shock. The coffee table Reyna and I passed featured the sculpture of a black hand set as a centerpiece. 

From the floor above us, I heard movement. Jerky, skittering motions. 

The client's voice called from another room, “Hope you both enjoy blonde espresso! I've been on a bit of a kick lately.”

I followed my nose, using the scent of coffee to guide us through the museum-like living room. The client had set clear glasses out on the marble island, one for each of us, filled with golden, foamy espresso. I took one of the delicate-looking cups, but didn't drink from it. Reyna followed suit. 

“Please, try some. I assure you, it's perfectly safe.” The client urged, punctuating his sentence with a sip as if that would somehow prove his innocence. “I'm not among the Good Gentlemen of the Hills. And truth be told, they would most likely find the implication that I am highly insulting.”

If that was meant to be reassuring, he missed the mark. I examined the hot beverage as if I expected a skull to show up in the foam like something from a Saturday morning cartoon. Reyna feigned drinking it by putting it to her lips without taking any of the liquid into her mouth. 

“May I ask who and what you are then?” I inquired. 

He downed the hot espresso like it was a shot of alcohol, as if that was a completely normal thing to do, before he replied, “Well, I own property all around the world, both residential and commercial, though I find residential to be the most rewarding, despite being less profitable in the long term. Especially if you sell rather than rent. Come to think of it, I think both of you live in one of my rental properties right now.” 

So my rent paid for this man's ugly house and artistically psychopathic decor. Good to know. If I didn't love electricity and indoor plumbing so much, I'd be tempted to live in a tent in the woods. And I have to say, I *really* don't love that this man has direct control over whether or not Reyna and I have roofs over our heads. 

Seemingly unaware of the discomfort he just instilled in us both, the client continued, “Real estate is only a more recent endeavor for me. Of course, recent is a relative term. Think I started… one- no, two hundred years back? Anyways, I'm sure you don't care about any of that. The point is, I'm on your side.”

“Not to be rude, but I fail to see how any of what you just said proves that.” I said cautiously. 

Despite claiming not to be a Neighbor, the client sure seemed content to be just as unnecessarily vague and verbose as one, “The Wilds need to be tamed. That's why humans began constructing homes in the first place, isn't it? Your ancestors needed to keep the forest out. The forest, and those who the trees and the hills are the most loyal to. I give you all somewhere safe to hide. Even the Wild Hunt can be rendered nearly powerless by a properly secured home. You know that.”

The Wilds. The phrase itself caught my attention. Why say it like that? And he brought up the Hunt. Meanwhile, Reyna was frowning while staring at him as if she recognized him, but couldn't quite place where she'd seen him before. 

I dared to challenge him a little, “I don't think it's fair to classify all Neighbors of the Hills in the same way as a Hunter. And even then, despite everything the Hunt has done, I can acknowledge that they have a purpose. They're not mindless animals. None of them are.”

His pitying tone drove me up the wall, “They really have beaten you down, haven't they? They're quite effective at that.”

Before I could get myself in trouble by getting defensive, Reyna spoke up, “How have they beaten you down?”

It was a good question. 

His head went down briefly, “I was to be married. Looooong time ago. I'll leave it at that.”

That's when the dots connected in my head: “*Gwythyr.*”

Subtly, the client - the Oak King, The Son of Scorcher - nodded, giving me another smile, “Guilty as charged.”

For a moment, I could only gape in disbelief. *This* was Gwythyr ap Greidawl? The White Son of Mist’s infamous rival? When I pictured the god in my head, it definitely wasn't as some affluent, polished real-estate mogul. But now the actions of his company made sense, with all of his talk of ‘taming the Wilds.’ And on that note, it explained why the Hunters hadn't gone after any of them directly: they couldn't. Per the ancient agreement with King Arthur, the Hunters couldn't touch Gwythyr or those that follow him until Calan Mai. 

It seems so obvious, now. I feel stupid for taking so long to see it. From the very beginning, the answer was right there. 

“Why are we here?” I asked, subduing my tone now that I knew the reality of who we were contending with. “Why lure us in like this if you're on our side?”

“Please understand that I didn't want this meeting to be so unpleasant,” He started. “But if the White Son of Mist's servants thought for even a moment that you spoke to me willingly, he'd have you and all of your colleagues executed, just as mine were. You will have gone from being helpful nuisances to the Hunt to enemies.”

That didn't seem right to me. Though he wasn't human, he also wasn't a Neighbor. As such, he might not be held to the same rules. Did that mean that he was capable of lying? It was best to operate under the assumption that was the case. 

“What do you want?” Reyna asked. 

“It has come to my attention that Orion, as well as many others, have acted against their own best interests and stood against our expansions.” He explained. “I wouldn't dream of asking anyone mortal to fight the Hunters; that was a lesson that Gwyn was more than happy to teach me. But I will ask that you stand down. Simply allow us to do what we must.”

I think I'm getting too used to all of this. I couldn't bite my tongue like I should have. I used to know better, and I still should. But that didn't stop me from retorting, “*Our* best interest? Each expansion just angers the Neighbors more. And it's not you that has to face the repercussions, it's *us.*”

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Reyna trying to gesture to me to stop. Instantly, I regretted being so candid. She was here, too. Just as trapped as I was. He could easily punish her for my mistake. 

Gwythyr sighed, adopting that condescending, pitying demeanor that had irritated me earlier, “That's progress for you. Things will get worse before they get better. But they *will* be better. Can you honestly tell me that isn't what you want? After all that the Wilds have done to you? To your family?”

I swallowed back the lump in my throat, trying to control myself better. Not just for my sake, but for Reyna’s. The amount he knew about us was troubling. 

Carefully, I told him, “This is a big decision, one that affects more than just those of us in this room. It wouldn't be right for me to speak or act on behalf of those who aren't present to speak their piece. If you don't mind, I would like to discuss this with my superior.”

The truth was that I wanted to get us both out of there. There was a lot of what he'd said that either seemed dubious at best or raised bright red flags at worst. 

Gwythyr sighed again, sounding disappointed, “I was hoping you'd have more sense. But after what that beast that calls himself a captain of the Wild Hunt has done to you, I suppose it stands to reason that you'd feel this way.”

He really does think of me as some kicked, brainwashed puppy. My teeth clenched involuntarily as this comparison brought to mind the mechanic’s old, demeaning nickname. Fucking puppydog. 

The noises upstairs became louder. They traveled towards where I'd noticed a set of stairs earlier. Reyna’s eyes went wide. My hand felt for Ratcatcher. 

“I'm afraid that my soldier is losing patience.” Gwythyr remarked. 

Gwythyr hadn't technically been dishonest when he called about having ‘big ants’ in his home. Though, he'd failed to mention that the insect that scampered towards us would be the size of a Great Dane. 

It was quick, too; I barely got the sword out in time before its jaws clamped onto my arm. Unlike a regular ant's, its jaws were vertical, the top one shaped like a scythe. Two long hooks jutted out from the bottom of its head, each one the length of my forearm.  

Most likely afraid that she'd hit me, Reyna tried the Squelcher first. The hell ant simply wrenched its head away to snap its mouthparts at her in annoyance, one long, whiplike antenna reaching for her. 

Salt was useless. *Great.* 

I slashed at its side. The critter hopped out of reach, now focused on Reyna. She had the shotgun aimed at it, fumbling with the safety as she backpedalled. I darted after the hell ant, swinging Ratcatcher at the leg nearest to me. The blade hit its mark, slicing into the hell ant's hindlimb. Unlike the atypical pests I'm used to, it didn't have any sort of allergic reaction to the iron. 

While all of this was going on, Gwythyr had returned to his espresso machine, humming to himself as he prepared some concoction. 

That was the moment I decided that Gwythyr was worse than Gwyn. The White Son of Mist had been terrifying when he found me below the Mounds, and he didn't hesitate to use his power to enforce submission, but he at least seemed to acknowledge humanity as fully sentient, autonomous beings, albeit ones that he finds troublesome. Meanwhile, Gwythyr appeared to believe that we should be kissing the ground he walks on for deigning to grace us with his unwanted presence. 

Then he waltzed out the door with his drink in hand, leaving his hell ant to deal with us. 

As the ant drew nearer to her, Reyna shouted, “*Get down!*”

I obliged, ducking behind the kitchen island before she opened fire. Then she screamed. When I came out of hiding, I was horrified to discover that the hell ant had bitten the shotgun's barrel clean off. 

It was getting too close to her. I went for the chitin connecting the hell ant's thorax to its abdomen, intending to slice the wretched thing in half. The insect stumbled, beginning to crumble into itself as I made the cut. 

It turned swiftly. At the same time as I brought Ratcatcher's blade into its head, that scythe-like mouthpart flashed. I couldn't breath as I felt it snap through the bones in my wrist like they were made of dry twigs. Distantly, I heard Reyna screaming again. My ears were ringing. Or maybe that was residual pressure from the espresso machine. I don't know. Everything is fuzzy. 

Numbly, I looked down to see that the white tiles were drenched in blood. Mine. The ant's. They mixed together. Both of us slipped in it. I fell next to a hand. I remember stupidly thinking, *‘How the hell did that get there?’*”

The hell ant still wasn’t dead. It was thrashing on the ground. Twitching. With the last bit of strength I had left, I withdrew the sword, then used all of my body weight to plunge it into the hell ant's head again. All was still afterwards. 

More skittering. There was another hell ant. *Another one.*

*Get up! Come on, get up!*

I felt hands on my intact arm as I struggled to stand in the mess of fluids I'd collapsed into. Reyna was pulling me away, dragging me into another room and slamming the door behind us. Together, we pushed a dresser in front, hoping to buy ourselves some time. At the end, I slid to the ground, my back still resting against the dresser.

Once the door was barricaded, she ripped her jacket off, tying it tightly around the end of my arm. I blinked at the stump. The world felt fake. My head was heavy. Reyna's voice sounded as if it was coming from underwater as she spoke. The door quaked on its hinges.

It took far too long for me to realize she was talking to me. 

“The name of the Wild Hunt!” She pleaded through tears. “The one that summons them! What is it?!” 

While in my haze of blood loss and shock, I told her. She shouted it, desperation making her voice shiver and break. Vaguely, I recall feeling guilty for scaring her. For failing to protect us both. For being the one to bring this attack on. 

The last thing I remember was her hands on my face as she kept calling me. Begging me to stay awake. I couldn't. 

Everything that followed afterwards came in lightning bolts. Glass breaking. The calls of crows. Reyna dragging me down the hall as the door and dresser were reduced to mulch. Strong arms cradling me like I weighed nothing. Black cherries. 

I came to in a white room. Between my disorientation and the room’s color pallet, it took me a moment to realize I was no longer in Gwythyr's fortress. The paper-thin, hideous gown I wore and beeping machinery attached to various regions of my anatomy told me I was about to receive another sizable hospital bill. 

The first thing I did was look down. My hand was gone. It was a very matter-of-fact, detached acceptance. 

And I'll say that one thing they don't tell you about the infamous phantom limb phenomenon is that it hurts. I keep trying to readjust sore fingers that aren't there anymore, and the attempts at movement make me ache. The pain meds are helping somewhat. 

Deirdre was asleep in the chair next to me. A troubled sleep, at that. I tried to reach for her with my remaining hand. Wanting to rouse her from whatever nightmare she was experiencing. 

When she woke up, tears instantly sparkled in her eyes as she threw herself into me, sobbing as she embraced me, “I thought I lost you. We all did.”

I didn't know what to say. All I could do was shake. 

More voices could be heard in the hallway. Mom's was one of them. She was yelling at Victor. She didn't want to blame me for getting myself into this mess, so she blamed him. He accepted it, even though he shouldn't have. She went from yelling, to apologizing, to sniffling. 

With how uncharacteristically quiet he was being, I hadn't even noticed the mechanic was in the room with Deirdre and me, leaning against the window frame as he stared apathetically at those passing by on the street beneath. 

Mom, accompanied by Reyna, instantly stiffened when she saw him. I had described him to her once before, so she was probably coming to the nerve-wracking conclusion that all of us were breathing the same air as the Wild Huntsman I'd cautioned her against. When he caught her staring at him, he winked. 

She immediately averted her gaze, face contorting in a mixture of grief and relief once she saw that I was awake. Like Deirdre, she rushed for me, as if by embracing me hard enough, she could make this situation go away. 

Maybe I should've been more concerned about my amputation. Yet, all I could think about were those hell ants. Gwythyr. What he was asking of Orion. No, not asking. Demanding. If he were asking, he wouldn't have sent his pets to butcher me and attempt to do the same to Reyna. 

It dawned on me then that Iolo had yet another life debt over not just me, but her. God damn it. Iolo's opinion of Reyna is horrendous; where those of us that love her look at her and recognize her ingenuity, her kindness, and her desire to make everyone around her smile, he sees a tender soul that he could easily break. He’s been open about that.

What if he just killed her? Or worse?

Meanwhile, Reyna was more concerned for me, as well as my Mom and Deirdre. Offering to find various hospital personnel, locate vending machines, whatever she thought would be helpful. Wes eventually came in, staying by her side and gently reminding her that she's not our nurse. Knowing that he was watching her back made me feel slightly better. 

Thankfully, Victor didn't seem to take my mom's freak out to heart, but I could tell from the moment he walked in that she was ashamed of her earlier behavior. I guess it runs in the family. 

The mechanic didn't approach me or anyone else until far later. 

Mom hadn't eaten since that morning, and it was nearing midnight. Deirdre hadn't wanted to leave me alone with the mechanic. I assured her that I'd be fine, pointing out that he could've let the hell ants tear me apart if he'd intended to harm me. Afterwards, I asked her to take care of my mom for me while I couldn't. 

Before leaving, she cast pleading eyes at him. If he saw the look she gave him, he didn't acknowledge it. 

He still didn't take his eyes off the window as he told me, “You been disappointin’ me a lot lately.”

Go figure. I've been disappointing myself lately. 

Iolo finally met my gaze, slowly crossing the room to stand at the foot of my bed, “You know you did wrong by killin’ that Wood Maiden. I can smell the guilt on you. Between what you did to her and where I just dragged you out of, I'm startin’ to wonder if this is ‘bout to become a problem.”

He wasn't wrong. It was still eating me up. 

“It isn't.” I muttered, my voice coming out scratchy.

It was like the progress we'd made with each other over the past couple of months had been erased. In that hospital room, he looked at me like a problem he wanted to take care of in the most vicious way possible. I had neither the energy nor mental clarity to be afraid. 

The Huntsman's demand was delivered calmly and coldly, “Tell me why you were there.” 

“He posed as a client,” I answered honestly, about to scratch at a phantom itch where the back of my left hand should've been. “He wouldn't let us leave until we heard him out. Given that I'm not as handy as I used to be, you can see how well that went.”

Is it healthy to make bad jokes about your own life-altering injuries? Probably not, but it's not like being serious about it will magically make it grow back. 

In all reality, I go through phases. Sometimes I crack wise about my circumstances, other times, all I can think about is the effortless way my bones snapped in the hell ant's jaws. 

When he didn't say anything, I informed him, “The thought of accepting his request didn't even cross my mind.”

The mechanic’s gaze went down to my missing hand, the stump covered in expertly-wrapped gauze. I'd felt another itch on a finger that wasn't there. 

For a moment, the coldness thawed as he remarked, “I still get that ghost-limb bullshit. Drives me up the fuckin' wall.”

“Does it get better?” I asked. 

“Not as bad as it was when it first happened.” He answered with a small shrug, coming over to steal the chair Deirdre had been napping in. “Once I get outta here, I'll look into them seeds for ya. ‘Less you wanna stick with a regular prosthetic.”

At some point, I dozed off in a morphine-induced fog. But before that, I think I made a dumb comment about getting a hook installed like a pirate. Might’ve even thrown in a ‘me bucko’ for good measure. 

Something I need to disclaim is that the conversation I'm about to describe may very well have been a snippet from a dream. 

Through my haze, I felt the comforting weight of Deirdre’s head on my shoulder. Her soft breath on my cheek. There were voices. My dulled mind faintly registered that they belonged to the mechanic and Reyna. 

She'd been describing our meeting with Gwythyr. Her summary of his behavior was and I quote: “He kept talking all about himself, mostly. Like, boasting about how fantastic he thinks he is. Ass clapping just to hear the sound of his own cheeks.”

If this was a dream, it was an incredibly realistic one, considering that is absolutely something she would say. Once I'm released, I'll have to ask her. 

(**Update:** This was a real conversation. I love you, Reyna. Deirdre has given us our blessing, which means we can get married ❤️.)

Once I was finally cognizant enough to hold a conversation, Mom informed me that I'd needed a blood transfusion among various other emergency procedures. Right now, I'm killing time by typing this out and getting into contact with someone my doctor recommended for a prosthetic, in case the seeds don't work out. And to tell the truth, after the complications he experienced, I'm reluctant to try them. 

Maybe I'll go with Morphine Nessa's brilliant suggestion to get a hook. Arrrrg, me hearties. 

**Update 2:** My hospital bill was completely paid for by an anonymous donor. I'm not entirely certain who is responsible for this generous deed.
