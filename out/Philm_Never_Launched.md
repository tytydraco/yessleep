Creeping through the silent house, the old woman moved without sound.

Those who slept never saw her, and at first light, she was gone.

There is a wall of truth, where facts can be traded. There is a veil between this one and the other, and between them is a moment, a place, an echo. That is where I found the first sign, caught on the fabric, slowly fading.

I held it between two fingers and looked closely at it. What I saw frightened me and amazed me. At first, I could not be sure it was real.

"This is what we are made of. When we die, this remains, always. So, how much is left? Can I sell it?" I wondered.

I always put business first, because I am a broker.

Darkness arose like a black mist, boiling out of the shadows. We were not alone, and I told everyone to hold hands, and to keep their thoughts pure. Any kind of fear would lead us into the chasms of ultimate horror.

Those who listened to me did not hear what I just said. The rest ignored me, unable to comprehend the meaning of my words.

There is a voice that speaks in all of us. It is the common will, for when I die I shall live again as another, and again and again. This way, I shall be you, and everyone else. And you are me, and that is how you know what I am talking about. That is why you are listening because you already know.

"I know you, I know your wisdom. I know the beauty of your soul, and I truly love you." I mused.

I always put family first, because I am a parent.

Terror was the footsteps of the old woman made of shadows. I watched as she moved through the night, through the home, and I trembled to know who she was and see how she moved among us.

The rotting severed hand was stolen from the grave of a madman. He'd ravaged and eaten enough girls to make him into a monster. The hand stood on the wriggling wrist bone, the fingers and thumb burning like candlelight.

Everyone's eyes had flashed and closed, and they'd fallen to the floor asleep. The stroke of midnight was like the hair on the sleeping cheek brushed aside by a lover, or a monster.

Each of us lives as all the rest, we are all the same person, living endless lives and forgetting we are all of us. How can we remember such an awful truth?

My memories came to me, my wish granted. I was no longer me, I could never have my ego back, for I now knew I was everyone, and everyone was me. They were all aware that I knew all their troubles, and I could hear such prayers and could do nothing for them. Everyone instinctively knew that someone or something knew them, knew their struggles and their pain and their secret shame.

They also knew I still loved them, although for the cannibal on death row, this was difficult to explain. The moment the veil was lifted, I was a cosmic bride, wilted in the void, taken from my family and cast into sleep. Eternal sleep, for what else could soothe me?

I always put others first, because I am a friend.

She stepped over them, her bare feet barely touching the floor. She grinned in malevolence, claiming all these who had trespassed into her realm. A realm filled with all the things that are worse than death.

Most new streaming services such as Netflix®, Hulu®, Vudu® or Clix™ made a deal with this same devil. I just wanted Philm™ to launch, a streaming service that focused on wholesome, classic and educational movies. I never thought I'd feel such nightmarish terror at what I had unleashed.

With the skin removed, the skulls of my business partners were stacked up one by one until she had a complete collection. I felt sick, the smell of blood overpowered me, and I fell to my knees and threw up.

"Trust in the will of the Mighty One." She hissed, smiling while she removed and ate the last eye. She licked the skulls clean until they were just bones, eating the flesh and brains. "Delicious."

I wanted to scream, I wanted to run, but my voice abandoned me, and my legs hand no bones, no muscle, so I could not flee. Instead, I was paralyzed with the horror of my actions and the nightmare I was witnessing.

Staring at the wicked work of that business meeting, in my own home, I realized the devil was in the details. If I'd just stuck to prayer and left the secrets of the followers of Infis in the shadows, I'd know peace. Instead, I will always know the fear I learned that night. I will always remember the face of the devil.

I always put details first, because I am a storyteller.

Smoke arose from the pit, where only the Sign of Infis was a mark on the wooden floor of the house. Where a circle was, now a hole into Hell.

"The bargain must be sealed. These souls for the successful launch of your new wholesome movie streaming service app Philm™. Just sign here, in blood." An imp with a clerk's visor offered me a paper contract.

"I'm not doing it." I shuddered. My feet felt like they were slipping, my hands couldn't grip, my eyes couldn't focus. The fear I felt went much deeper than mortal dread. I'd discovered circumstances so horrible and painful, that mere death seemed like sleep.

"Then there will be no Philm™. Cursed is the name." The old woman growled, her bloodshot eyes dripping the venom of her rage and her sharp teeth grinding.

When the demons had melted and slithered into the closing rectum of Hell I sighed in relief.

Where their skulls and chewed remains rotted before my eyes, each of them was intact.

I blew out the candle made from the severed hand of the condemned. One by one my business partners began to open their eyes and look around, realizing it was not just a nightmare. All of us could see upon the others, the next sign, a mark of our common demon. Each of us wore the mark of Infis, although we were never claimed.

At least we had not gone too far. The complete failure of our app to launch seems more than a little cosmic, doesn't it? Leave it to someone like me to summon Infis and then change my mind.

I always put myself in these situations, because I'm human.
