I'm a camera operator and I'm filming a cake decorating video that will be uploaded to an obscure TikTok account about cakes. I was invited to film the video by a man who I'm desperate not to give attention to. All I'll say is he's American and the number 77 is in his unsername. He's in his 30s, has brown hair, and he's doing some strange voodoo shit I can't escape.


It began when the cake had one coat of icing. He kept going on and on about how he was going to dump the icing, but took his time doing so. By the time he dumped the icing on the cake, ONE HOUR HAD PASSED SINCE I BEGAN FILMING. After he finally did it, I asked him how long I had to be there, but he kept talking about the next step, a step he's still talking about as I type this. The camera is sitting on a tripod, recording this man's endless speech.


"So now we're going to dump the next layer of icing on the cake," he said. "I'm going to pour it on the cake and it's going to flow down the sides to the bottom. It's a complementary color, so it will give the cake a fitting color scheme. I'm going to pour this next layer on the cake. When I dump it, it's going to fall down the sides. It's going to be a fitting color for the cake..."


I gestured, I gave hand signs... but he ignored them. Five minutes after he began promising to pour the second layer of icing on the cake, I told him to just pour it on already. He ignored that too and kept talking.


I waited it out, but at the 10 minute mark, I couldn't handle it anymore.


"Hold on, I'm going to go take a break outside," I told him.


"And then the icing will cover the icing and complement it. These are some sprinkles..." he continued, picking up a bottle of sprinkles.


I went up to the door and turned the handle, but it wouldn't move. I asked the man if he had a key, but he ignored me once more.


"This isn't funny," I said. "I need a break from this."


"...and the icing will flow down to the plate..."


I stood there for another minute, but he wouldn't stop talking. I walked up to him, then I grabbed the icing from his hands. As I pulled, it wouldn't move. It only moved slightly as the man held it. I couldn't move it at all. As I kept pulling, the man's voice got deeper.


"Why isn't this thing moving?" I whispered to myself, confused and frustrated.


As I held my grip, the man's voice took a monotonous tone, which then started to sound like a text-to-speech AI. Something was very off about this man. I felt cold and let go of the icing.


"...Now we're going to dump the icing on the cake," he said. "When we do, the icing will fall to the sides. Let's get some more sprinkles on the bottom section..."


It was creepy. I couldn't understand what was happening at all. I decided to look around for the key, as I had been in that kitchen for long enough. I ended uo checking everywhere, even in the man's pockets, but the key was nowhere to be found.


"Please stop talking like that," I said, trying to hold back an outburst. "If it's actually what your voice does that's okay but I literally can't move the icing. Are you a robot or something? Huh?"


"Icing will flow down to the sides," he said. "Again, we have all the sprinkles we need," he said in a weaker text to speech tone.


I grabbed a bottle of icing from the table. I was too creeped out to want to stay here. I needed to get this... thing's attention somehow. I put a little bit of icing on the bottom layer the cake. As I stopped, the man stopped talking. Now, I should be relieved, but the man wasn't saying anything I wanted to hear. I was dead silent, which was creepier. I looked at him. His eyes were overbearing voids of the life of lifelessness, if that makes sense. He was staring through me several times over at once. My heart dropped.


I wanted to speak, but the pit in my stomach was too deep. I backed away, freaked the hell out. I ran up to the door and bodyslammed it, then I punched it repeatedly.


"Help!" I yelled.


I went on for another minute, hitting the door while calling for help, but nobody answered. I didn't want to look back, but somehow, feeling his stare from behind was more unnerving than not. I looked back to see him facing me while standing still, frozen like a statue. I tried to opening the window, but it wouldn't budge.


I took out my phone. I called the police, but as soon as I began explaining, the call ended. I called them again, only for the call to randomly end again. I tried Googling, but the search results kept changing before I could do tap on any links. The common dates changed from April 18, 2023 to January 16, 2023 to November 5, 2022. I didn't know what the hell was happening until I saw the time flicker between 8:31 PM and 8:30 PM. It was crazy, but I checked the date. March 16, February 7, December 9... maybe he was just messing with me somehow, or he could somehow travel through time. I went with the former to stay sane. This was until a certain thing happened.


I decided to watch some YouTube videos, but of course the results kept changing. A video about lockdown I watched in early 2020 was posted 6 hours ago, even though I had watched it three years ago. I decided it was a reupload. I mean, why not? But then I watched as all the videos I watched in 2019 flashed before me, with their uploaded stamps changing. One changed from being uploaded 1 year ago to 10 months ago to 9 months ago, and so on. I watched in amazement.


2018, 2017, 2016, 2015... the YouTube logo changed to the older one. 2012, 2011... it was difficult to remind myself he was probably just messing with me, but Archive.org couldn't achieve this level of visiting the internet of the past. Was he... actually taking me back in time?


To really test it, I quickly looked up the names of shock videos that wouldn't stay up on YouTube in 2023. 3 Guys 1 Hammer, Lol Superman, Tubgirl... to my shock... I found them... either this guy was messing with me good or he was taking me back in time. But why? Why would he need to take me back? Not knowing was worse than knowing, because my anxiety was heightening.


What if taking me back to my birth date killed me?
What if he was taking me back before I was born so he could kill me?
What if he was going to kill me in front of my younger self? No, I would've remembered that actually happening from the younger point of view.


Then why was he doing this?


At one point, YouTube went offline. I checked my calendar, it was 2005. I was getting hungry, and I had to use the bathroom. Unfortunately, the man probably wasn't going to let me use the bathroom. At least there was something to eat though... but I didn't know what it would trigger.


In 2000, my stomach was rumbling like hell. I also could barely hold it in anymore. I had to eat something. Maybe just the icing.


In 1996, I went for the icing. I took it and poured it into my mouth. It kinda solved the hunger problem, but my stomach still felt empty. I dreaded the idea of interfering with the cake, but I knew that at one point, I would take my chances anyway.


In 1983, I went for the cake, trying not to look the man in his dread inducing glaring eyes. I took the top layer off, then I ate it up. That solved my hunger, but my bladder was about to burst. I didn't want any bladder problems, so I had to find a can or something. For some reason, there were no cans. Not even any empty waterbottles. Great.


In 1977, I began to pee involuntarily. My pants were going to be stained badly at the end of this, I bet.


In 1970, I watched as my phone shut off. I pressed the power button, but it wouldn't turn on. I was trapped in this room without any communication.


I went up to the window and opened the blinds. Old fashioned 50s/60s cars were driving down the road. I only saw the cars in groups. One second, I saw a couple green and blue cars. The next second, those cars disappeared and some grey and orange cars were driving down the road.


I decided to eat some more of the cake. If the man didn't do anything when I ate the top layer, he wouldn't do anything when I ate the next one, right? I stepped up to the cake, once again avoiding eye contact. The feeling of his stare was still burning my psyche and sending my hairs up.


As I reached for the second layer, a black spiky... thing with a blurred looking body dug itself out of the layer, tumbling down to the third layer with pieces of the second layer. It dug itself into the cake, leaving a hole behind. A pit formed in my stomach, completely replacing my appetite. I wasn't eating that...


I went back up to the window. The cars were a lot older, certain buildings were gone, with others I witnessed their construction in reverse, at one frame per month. One month per couple of seconds. But that rate began to speed up... I saw a snow storm, then sunny spring weather, then heat rising from the concrete, then colourful leaves on all of the trees. The next time what I assumed was the spring came around, it appeared to stay that way, with building construction going by faster and cars getting noticeably older by the second. For one second, I saw a sign nearby to my right that had "1940" and "Roosevelt" on it. Once it disappeared I knew I was in the 1930s.


I counted backwards, watching cars be replaced by carridges, but lost count around 1876. I was still wondering where the man was taking me, especially at the rate we were going. 1776? The 1600s? But then the dirt road and all the buildings I could see vanished and were replaced by tall trees. Then we were hovering above all of said trees. The only differences I could see were the clouds changing. Bigger clouds, smaller clouds, a thunderstorm, clear blue sky. For one second, a kinda dark ash-like cloud covered the sky. Like one from a volcano. I had heard of a volcanic winter having happened in 536 AD. If I was that far back in time... I was alone with this man for miles...


I turned around to face the man, closing my eyes to avoid his gaze.


"Where the h-hell are you taking me?" I asked.


No response.


This was insane. I've never had to deal with anything like this before. I never even believed in time travel.


Wait... the stuff in the cake... what if this guy is just trying to starve me to death...? What if he's going to dump me somewhere far back in time to hide the fact he killed me? He wanted me to die slowly... I turned around and looked him in the eyes. I went cold and shivered like crazy. There was just something so sinister about his glare. Tears began rolling down my face. I sat down on the floor, back against the wall. After probably 10 minutes... or 10 centuries... of crying, I fell asleep.


I woke up staring at the far side of the room. There were no clocks, so I had no idea how long I slept. I looked out the window, expecting to see dinosaurs or something, but what I saw was something more assuring. Buildings, a road filled with cars, people walking along sidewalks... I couldn't tell what year I was in. The cars looked advanced though, so I assumed I was in the future. So, was I taken back to the present then into the future? Or is the big crunch a thing?


I took out my phone and pressed the power button. The Samsung logo popped up! After the phone loaded up, the date was still going wild. July 5, June 2, May 3... I didn't give it much thought, as I had to type all of this up and post it as close to my time as possible. I opened the calendar app. September 2067. I typed the previous night up as quickly as possible, then I checked the calendar again. March 2025. I needed to hurry. My heart was racing as the need to post this, especially in spite of the creepy time traveling TikTok man, weighed down on my conscious.


As I type this in the post body on r/nosleep, a man with black hair who looks to be in his 30s has popped into existence. His face went pale as he looked towards the man, who asked him something that sent chills down my spine...


"What do you mean we're not stopping? W-who are you?"


Of course we're not. Athough, I didn't hear the man talk, so where did the new guy get those words from? Telepathy? At this point, I wouldn't be suprised if that were the case. I guess I'm dying. Screw this. I feel frozen, my thoughts are racing. I don't want to die, but for some reason, that's what's going to happen if this man doesn't let me eat. I'm going to post in my time. I just checked the calendar again. March 2024. I have 11 seconds left until I hit submit when it happens to be April 2023. If you're reading this on 4 19 2023, I got lucky and got to post in my actual present.
