It was a hot July and I was eight years old. That was the summer I discovered that if I clenched my jaw and tensed my temples, I could make a rumblin’ in my ears.

I ran to tell Miss Mills, and she responded, “What it sound like?” Then she started bangin’ and clamoring all the pots and pans trying to match the sound. She hooted and I crowed and all the pans were piled up on the counters as we went lookin’ for the sound. She was always like that, ready to jump when the occasion caught her. They say she shone like the bright yellow sun, but she didn’t, she was the sun, and we lived together in her warmth.

Old Uncle Nick was nothing like her. He was old as dirt and all crooked up in knots. They say he was like that ‘cause he was drinking, but I say it’s ‘cause he was dreaming. He kept thinking he’d be someplace else one day, so today he’d rest, today he’d do his work, but tomorrow he’d be somewhere else living big. So he stayed and rotted here till there was not much left of him. And if there was someplace where he could have gone, it didn’t want him no more. Not in the wicked state he was, all used up, tar stained, and wrinkled. He hung with the hoodlums, the drunks and swindlers—slinging whatever they got their hands on. He was more honest than the rest of them, but he was okay dippin’ down low once in a while, because he still believed he was going places. He never did realize low was the only place he went, and it’s where he stayed.

That night Miss Mills put me and all the animals to bed. She locked the door on the hen house. Closed the gate on the sheep shed. Latched the door on the horse stable. Then she opened up the gate to the farm to let the moon in, and she kissed every animal to sleep. 

That's how I remember it, anyway.

Most days I’d spend time with Georgia. She lived a farm over, and we’d meet at the swimming hole, although nobody swam in the swimming hole since it was riddled with water moccasins. Everybody knew of a boy who got bit by one and died instantly—didn’t stand a chance. Foamed at the mouth and everything. But maybe that’s just a story all boys get told to keep them out of overgrown ponds. It worked—mostly.

We played beneath sycamores that leaned crooked over the water, their roots twisting down like fingers into the mud. Georgia hopped across the shallows from rock to rock, making a perfect landing with both feet each time, her toes curling over the edges and just barely touching the blue-green water.

“What do you want to be when you’re older?” I asked Georgia.

She stood upright, balancing on a rock and put a finger to her chin. “I don’t rightly know what I is now. How can I know what I will be?”

“I know what I am,” I said, hoppin’ rock to rock to keep up.

Georgia was all spirit and no mind, but sometimes lightning would strike and she’d reveal some revelatory wisdom cooked up in that head of hers.

“Who is you? Is it your body? Your legs and your arms? Nah, if a turtle got no legs and no arms it’s still a turtle. It’s when you crack that shell open and see all the slithering bits and pumping parts you know. That’s what you are—a mess of things all working together to keep the rest alive.”

She meant to keep going, elaboratin’ on her turtle thinkin’ towards some grand reveal, but our conversation hadn’t gone unnoticed. The dairy boys were creepin’ through the brush. We called them that on account of their rich folks runnin’ all the milk in the county. They said their great, great grandpa arrived with just two cows a hundred years ago. Now they had an endless supply of cattle, so they were always wearing new crepe-soled shoes and pressed stovepipe trousers. We didn't have things like that, but we didn't need ’em.

The oldest of the dairy boys threw a lit cigarette, burned down to the butt, a short way from our naked feet. The ember at the tip choked out on the wet ground in a sizzle. “You boys know it ain’t safe here, right?” The dairy boys then shot dark looks at one another, smirking.

“We ain’t scared of snakes,” I said.

“Oh, no, not snakes. Something much worse. This is where Tomcat Rot plays his tune.” The other dairy boys started laughing.

“He snatches up boys like you. Comes out to feed, you know, lookin’ for plump little pink boys.” Then he looked to Georgia and raised a dirty fingernail into the air. “Likes dark meat, too.”

Georgia protested. “You’re making that up.”

The boy grabbed his chest in mock protest, as if shot through by some invisible bullet, then raised two fingers. “Scout’s honor.” Then he grinned, showing off a set of crooked teeth yellowed by sugar babies and nicotine.

“He’ll gobble up your souls.” The boy then raised a cupped hand to his ear. “They say you can hear him, down in the mud, tootin’ his horn and hummin’ something awful.”

“I don’t hear nothin’ but birds and crickets,” I said. “Ain’t no music.”

“Listen closer,” the boy said, glaring at me with his grey-blue eyes. The other dairy boys gathered around behind him at the edge of the water.

“Tomcat Rot was a rag-and-bone man,” he continued. “Selling scraps he stole off farms, peddling what he could to make a few pennies to spend on Jack Daniel’s. And you could hear him comin’ a mile away, since he’d always be playing that trumpet of his. Jazz tunes, mostly. Then he found a tune so dark, so unspeakable, that he tore a hole right through the world—and that let something evil in.”

“So what happened to him?” asked Georgia. 

The boy scoffed, as if we should have already known. “He went crazy. That tune scrambled his brains. Nobody knows if it was the vibratin’ of that note, or a frequency he tapped into like some station on the radio dialed directly to Hell, but something was listening, and it came for him—and it got him.” The boy pulled another cigarette from a soft pack in his pocket and perched it between his lips, speaking out of the side of his mouth. “The town got so scared of him they threw him in the swamp. But he didn’t die. He’s still down here somewhere, playing that tune.”

I stiffened, standing as tall as I could on my rock. “I ain’t yellow, and I ain’t afraid of no jazz man. Sounds can’t hurt ya,” I said.

“This one can,” said the dairy boy.

The boy lit a match on the sole of his shoe and lit the cigarette. He took one last big drag, and then led the boys off, returning to their farm, leaving a cloud of smoke behind. They laughed as they went.

“You believe all that?” asked Georgia.

I looked back to the smoke, now almost completely faded into the hot blue air. “Not for a second.”

The next day I saw a man standing still as a fencepost in the yard, head tilted back like he was listening to something he couldn’t quite hear. His lips were moving, but there was no sound.

A hand clamped down on my shoulder and I jumped. Though I’m not proud of it. 

I ain’t yellow.

It was Old Uncle Nick, and he introduced the new farmhand. Said his name quick and low, so I never caught it proper, but the man nodded at me like we’d already met. He was tall and thin, his arms hanging too long, and he carried himself like he was just waiting to set his load down. He wore no hat, though the sun was beating, and his hair was dark, slicked down against his head.

“Miss Mills hasn’t been feelin’ too well, so he’ll be helpin’ out on the farm, workin’ fences, feedin’ stock,” Uncle Nick said, though I noticed he wouldn’t look the farmhand in the eye. “When you’re older, this will be your work.”

The man gave me a grin that wasn’t quite a smile, and when he opened his mouth to speak, no words came—just a low hum, rising and falling like it was caught between his teeth. It weren’t no hymn tune, and it weren’t a whistle. It was something twisted up, wrong in the middle, but still somehow tapping along in time with my heartbeat.

“Where’s Miss Mills?” I asked in a raised voice so he could hear me with his good ear.

“Restin’,” said Old Uncle Nick in his terse, grumbly matter-of-fact way.

I went inside the farmhouse and followed those narrow halls to her bedroom and found Miss Mills in bed, her face sweat-slick and pale. The shutters were drawn but a shaft of sunlight slipped through, illuminating a quilt lying across her lap. The room smelled of camphor and boiled greens, but under it I caught something else, sharp and sour like pennies left too long in the sun. A pitcher of water sat by the bed, sweating onto the nightstand, and a little bottle of tonic stood beside it, the cork pulled halfway.

She smiled when she saw me, weak but warm, and patted the quilt so I’d sit close. I climbed up and took her hand. It was warm as a stove though she was shivering under the covers. Her lips were moving, and after a moment I realized she was humming—soft, broken notes that rose and fell in the same crooked way as the farmhand’s tune. It made the little hairs on my arms stand straight.

She caught herself and pressed a hand to her mouth. “Don’t you ever follow that sound,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “It ain’t meant for us. It’ll take hold of you if you let it. Promise me you’ll shut your ears tight to it.”

I didn’t know what to say, so I nodded. She smoothed my hair back, the way she did when I was small and fevered. 

“This world’s loud enough already,” she said. “With all its wars and trains screamin’ across the country. We don’t need no more noise to lead us astray.” Her eyes closed for a moment, and I thought she might drift away right there.

I asked if she needed anything, water, a cool cloth, a prayer, but she only shook her head. 

“Just sit with me a spell,” she said. “You’re company enough.”

So I sat there and listened to her breathe, ragged and thin, the ticking of the mantel clock filling the space between. Outside I could hear Old Uncle Nick cursing at the fence posts and the farmhand’s low hum carrying across the yard. Miss Mills held my hand tighter, like she was afraid I might slip away into that sound if she let go.

I sat with her ’til her eyes closed and her hand, liver-spotted and worn, went slack in mine. I didn’t cry, but concern for her made my stomach sink, like a peach pit stuck in my gut. 

The room had gone dim, the last of the light slipping off the quilt, and the house felt hollow, cold without her voice filling it up. I slipped out quiet, carrying her warning with me, and felt a sadness that the moon would rise in the night sky without her doing.

That night I heard that same tune, or somethin’ similar. I woke to the window cracked open, the night air creepin’ thick through the curtain. From the field came a faint trumpet, soft as a sigh at first, then stretching into something long and slow. The notes bent sideways, slippery and hungry, like they were dragging themselves through mud to reach me.

I pressed my hands against my ears, but the sound seeped right through, and I began tearing at my temples. I clenched my jaw and started that rumblin’ in my ears to drown out the sound. It came fierce, so strong it made my teeth ache. I shut my window and went to bed, jaw so tight it was liable to crack, and I stayed that way ’til my eyes became too heavy to keep open.

Come morning my jaw ached fit to split. I worked it slow, rubbed at the hinges, and it popped like corn. Miss Mills slept with her mouth a little open, the quilt pulled up to her chin. I set a glass of water where she could reach and stood quiet a long time watching the dust swim in the slanted light.

Out in the yard the farmhand was already at it, walking the fence line with a hammer and a pocket of nails. He didn’t whistle or sing. He kept that same low hum, like he had a beehive tucked in his cheek. The chickens scattered when he passed, and the sheep all crowded to the far corner with their heads together like they were telling secrets they didn’t want him to hear. 

Old Uncle Nick pretended not to notice, and tended to his own chores, mostly ignoring the farmhand. He didn’t like talkin’ much anyway. Since his hearing started going, he didn’t like talking much to anyone. Said he was standin’ too close to a mortar in the Spanish War. 

Towards noon the heat covered us like a wool blanket and the road out front gave off that kind of liquid shimmer you can see if you look just past it. I was sweeping the porch steps when I saw a figure coming up the lane. At first I thought it was a stranger on account of her hat being mashed flat and her dress gone limp from sweat. But I knew who she was.

She carried a little valise banged up on the corners and she held it in both hands like it might float away if she let go. Her stockings had fallen in wrinkles at her ankles and there was a run up the back of one. The powder on her face had turned to chalk in the heat, and her lips were too red, like she’d painted them on crooked and forgot to fix it. When she reached the gate she stopped and put her palm to the post, breathing hard.

“Mama,” I said, but it came out weak. 

I took a step forward but then paused. I didn’t know if she wanted me near or not. Maybe she was a dream, or some ghost from my memory come up like bubbling bile. She didn’t look at me. Her eyes slid past like I was a milestone on the road. She fixed herself on the house instead, like a dog that smells something cookin’.

Old Uncle Nick came over and ushered me into the house, his shoulders rounded and his hat in his hand. 

“You get my letter?” he asked Mama. He said it like a man who already knew the answer, and I understood all at once there’d been a letter—his big bent writing, a stamp licked and pressed. It must have told her Miss Mills was sick and said she ought to come. It must have said more, because he wouldn’t meet my eye.

Her hands held firmly to her traveling case, delicate fingers tensing. “A letter,” she said, as if she was trying the word on her tongue for the first time. “I must’ve.” Then she frowned and rubbed the side of her head. 

“Miss Mills is layin’ down,” I said, finding my voice again. “She’s real tired, but she’ll be glad you came.”

Mama’s eyes shifted to me then slid away. She wasn’t mad. She wasn’t anything I could name. Fuzzy, like someone had breathed heavy on a glass between us. She opened her mouth and shut it. Then she took a step and set her little valise down.

“Nick,” she said, her voice had a crack in it. “Have you got any money?”

He laughed once without smiling. “For what?”

She flinched at the laugh like it was a small slap. “Just a little,” she said. “To get me to Jackson, or Memphis. I can get work in a hotel. I can—” She looked past him to the porch, then to the yard, then to the trees. “It’s hot,” she said. “It’s so hot.”

“You come askin’ for money,” Old Uncle Nick said soft, and it was worse than if he’d shouted. “You don’t come askin’ after the boy.”

She touched the valise with her shoe and didn’t look at me. “Boy?”

“I said Miss Mills was sick,” he cut in, sharp now. “I said you ought to come. And I said—” He stopped and shoved his hat back on his head. “I said maybe you could take the boy,” he finished, and his eyes flicked toward me and away. “I ain’t sayin’ that now.”

She blinked. “I can take him,” she said, but there wasn’t any meat on the words. They hung there and then fell dead.
“You can barely take care of yourself,” he said. “You come askin’ for money, and don’t even recognize your own son. You ain’t takin’ him. Not today. Not any day you come lookin’ like this.”

Her mouth trembled, and for a heartbeat something like anger, or shame, or just plain pain showed through the powder. Then it passed. “Nick,” she said again, like his name might turn into a key if she said it right. “Just a little,” she whispered. “I’ll pay you back.” She said it like a child says it—big promise, empty pockets.

“No,” he said. “I ain’t feedin’ whatever hole you been pourin’ yourself into. Ain’t sellin’ him down the river for a handful of nickels neither.” His voice dropped low, full of gravel. “And don’t you come callin’ for that boy unless you mean it true.”

She stared at the dirty floorboards. Somewhere out in the field the farmhand tapped a fence staple down and the hammer rang a dull note. The sound traveled along the wire and into the bones of the posts and then into me, or that’s how it felt. My jaw started to tighten without me telling it to, like it knew what was coming.

“Whole damn town’s gone mad,” Old Uncle Nick said. “Cows goin’ dry, dogs howlin’ at noon, men hearin’ things that ain’t there. Music in the dirt. You hear me? Music in the dirt.” He took a step toward Mama. “You take whatever madness you brought up this lane and carry it back out with you. Miss Mills don’t need none, and the boy don’t neither.”

She reached for him then, quick and foolish, both hands out like she might catch something falling. “Please,” she said. “Please, Nick.”

He shook his head and stepped back. “No,” he said again. “Pick up your case and go.”

For a second, I thought she would look at me. I leaned forward a hair without meaning to. I wanted to call to her again, maybe jog her memory. Say something that might click in her muddled mind and give her something that might catch and hold. But something inside me told me to wait. That she might discover it for herself. That she missed me, and that she wanted me.

She didn’t. 

Her eyes slid over me to the front door. She bent slow, picked up the valise, and held it to her chest.

When she turned, I heard it. Not loud. Not even clear. Just a few notes slipped between her teeth like they were trying to escape. It was the same crooked little tune the farmhand kept in his mouth. The same bent-up thing that made my head ache. She hummed it without knowing it.

“Mama?” I said, because I couldn’t help it.

She stopped, but she didn’t answer. The humming went on for two more notes, then choked off like someone pinched the sound shut. She stood very still. I could see where the sweat had run down her neck and left clean tracks through the powder on her skin.

Old Uncle Nick lifted his hand halfway and let it fall. “Go on,” he said, tired. “Ain’t nothin’ for you here today.”
She nodded once to no one and walked out the gate and down the lane, the little case swinging a little with each step. After she turned the bend, I could still hear the ghost of that tune, or I thought I could, braided into the cicadas and the hum of the fence wire and the distant lowing of the cows. It made my jaw clench so hard my ears filled with that familiar thunder, my own private rumble trying to crowd it out.

I stood where I was and didn’t move. The sun climbed higher. The shade on the porch shrank away. Finally Old Uncle Nick adjusted his hat and spat into the dust. “Ain’t fit,” he said to the yard. “Ain’t fit at all.”

He walked off without looking at me. I went inside and set my hand on the doorframe where Mama’s shoulder had brushed as she passed. It was just wood. It didn’t remember. The house had gone quiet again, but not the good kind. The kind that presses on your head and makes you think you hear your name called from another room.

I carried a basin and a cloth to Miss Mills and wrung the rag out until it was cool and damp. I wiped her face and the soft spot at her throat where the skin was thin as paper. She stirred and smiled with her eyes still closed. “Sweet boy,” she said. “You sit right there.” So I did.

After a time I heard the farmhand come up to the back step for water. He was careful on the boards, the way a man is when he don’t want to make a sound. The dipper knocked against the bucket and he drank two tinfulls with that slow hum moving through him like a river deep underground you can’t see. I thought about Mama’s tune, the way it had slipped out of her like it belonged to her bones now. I thought about the dairy boy’s story and the way his teeth looked when he smiled. I thought about the night music, the rhythm that came crawling under my window from the swamp.

When the day finally dragged its belly into evening and the light turned amber, I went to the back step and sat with my knees pulled up, waiting for the first stars. The air had that stillness it gets just before dark, when even the insects take a break. Somewhere a train let out a far-off cry and the sound echoed over the fields. I wondered if Mama was on it, sitting by a window with her case on her lap, humming to herself without knowing, riding deeper into whatever place it was had a hold of her.

I didn’t want to sleep. I knew what waited there, the slow horn and the sliding notes and the drag of them in my head like feet through muck. I set my jaw and felt for the rumble until it came, my own sound against the other one. I held to it tight, the way you hold to a fence in high water.

Inside, Miss Mills turned over and sighed. Old Uncle Nick struck a match somewhere and cursed when it burned his fingers. The first star showed itself. Then another. Then the moon lifted up slow over the far trees, all white and watchful, and for a little while the world looked silvered and calm, like it might be alright. But under that shine the fence wire still sang, and the tune in the dirt kept on, and my jaw ached, and I knew the night would come for me all the same.

The next day they laid Miss Mills out in the small white church with a big bell down by the bend where the road climbs a little and the red clay creeps to the surface. On account of the flu, funerals had to be done quick, as bodies were required to be in the dirt the same day. The clapboards of the little church were fresh-painted that spring, but the sun had already bleached the south side, chipping and curling away, showing the blonde wood beneath. I could hear voices within. A gentle murmur of the townsfolk who had come to see Miss Mills off to Heaven. 

They set Miss Mills at the front in a pine box, plain and clean. Somebody had dressed her in her Sunday best and folded her hands over a little Bible whose corners were worn soft as cloth. She looked smaller than she ever had, like the heat had cooked her down a size. The quilt lay across the foot of the box like a field of faded flowers—her doing, every stitch.

Old Uncle Nick took off his hat and twisted the brim the way a man does when he don’t trust his own hands. He steered me to a pew halfway back where the boards were smoothed by a hundred summers of backsides and the varnish had gone sticky. My shirt clung to me. The old women cooled themselves with little cardboard fans on wooden sticks. The fans clicked against their rings and bracelets, a hundred small wings tryin’ to keep off the heat and not doing much.

Georgia found me there. She slid in at the end of the pew with her dress wrinkled where somebody had ironed it too fast and too hot. Her hair was braided tight, but a curl had sprung loose and stuck to her cheek. She didn’t say nothing at first. She just tucked herself in close and set her hand palm-down on the pew so it touched mine. That was enough to make the ache step back a half-inch.

The preacher stood and addressed the congregation. He did the talking you’re supposed to do, dust and bone and the Lord giveth and taketh, his voice wandering the rafters and slipping out the open windows to where the cicadas hollered. The sweat ran down his neck and into his collar and he pretended it didn’t bother him.

A little band had gathered near the front under the windows. Just a pump organ wheezing like an old hound, a guitar with a hairline crack in the top, and a horn, small and dull where the polish had worn, cradled by a man from over past the tracks. They gave us “Shall We Gather at the River” and “Softly and Tenderly,” and folks sang when they could find a note to stand on.

Then the horn man did something strange. It weren’t nothing rude. Just a little turn stepping down from a note that should have gone straight. A slide. It ran under the hymn like a creek you didn’t see till your foot was already in it. The guitar followed, but just barely. The organ found a lower place to sit. The shape of the song got loose at the edges and then it wasn’t a hymn no more. It was jazz.

It was that tune.

At first it was only a feeling, like catching the scent of something familiar and wrong on a breeze. Then I heard it plain. The same bent-up piece the farmhand kept under his breath. The same slipping thread I’d heard outside my window. The same two notes my Mama had let loose without knowing. It climbed up and down, not far, just enough to make my jaw go hard. The paper fans slowed. A woman’s hand stopped in mid-flap and hung there like it had forgot what it was for.

People got quiet. The preacher’s mouth was still moving, but no sound came out. The musicians’ eyes went soft and far off like they was watching a far away thundercloud rolling in. Men froze in place, fixed on the sound. Old ladies’ mouths drooped open a little.

The tune wasn’t loud. It didn’t have to be. It came like steam out of a kettle. It slid under my shirt and onto my skin and into my teeth, and my rumblin’ rose up against it. I clenched till the hinges ached. I felt the pew under me shift like a bobbing boat and then settle. Georgia leaned into me and I felt her breath go slow and even, like she was falling asleep sitting up.

Old Uncle Nick stood. He didn’t stand quick. He stood like a man who knew the weight of his own bones and the price of moving them. His face was dark. Angry.

“Enough,” he said. It was hardly more than a word. Folks older than him flinched like he’d shouted.

The musicians didn’t stop.

Old Uncle Nick reached out and snatched away that horn, tearing it from the man’s grasp. The last note slid off into nothing, terminating into silence. He bent close so only the men up front could hear and he said something I couldn’t catch, but I saw the shape of his mouth and knew there was a curse in it, old and mean.

The guitar player loosened his fingers and blinked like a man waking up. The old women’s fans started again like they hadn’t even known they’d stopped. The preacher cleared his throat and found his voice again and said, “Amen.”

Georgia took a breath like she’d been under water and came back to herself. She looked at me and frowned small, then smoothed her dress where it had wrinkled. “I’m right here,” she said, though I hadn’t asked her to be.

For a minute the church was only a church again, heat and wood and sweat and good shoes pinching toes. Then the whispering started. It ran down the pews and up the walls and out the windows, and a woman in a hat with violets on it touched my shoulder.

“Child,” she said, leaning close. I knew her, Mrs. Dent, from the store where red licorice sits in jars. “Have you seen the Turner boys? The dairy children. They didn’t come home last night.” She looked out over our heads as if she might find them standing in the foyer. “Their mama’s near tore the wallpaper off. She’s askin’ everywhere.”

“No, ma’am,” I said, and it wasn’t a lie, but it felt like one in my mouth. I saw the cigarette smoke again drifting away over the water and the way the oldest had smiled with his crooked yellow teeth. My jaw found the rumble without me asking.

Mrs. Dent nodded like I’d told her something useful and fluttered away, already asking the next pew down. Other women took it up. Have you seen? Did you hear? And the church filled with the same question turned different ways.

Old Uncle Nick came back and sat with a weight that shook the seat. He kept his hands flat on his knees like it was the only way to keep them from doing damage. He didn’t look at me. He didn’t look at the box. He looked at the floorboards like something might come up through them if he let his eyes leave them for a second.

The preacher tried to start “In the Sweet By and By” and made it through the first verse before his voice gave out. We sang the rest soft and thin, but honest, and when it was over folks filed past to say goodbye. I was swept up in the line of people headed towards the casket, but when I got to the box I didn’t know what to do.

Georgia tugged my sleeve. “You okay?” she asked, not as a habit but like she cared for the answer.

“No,” I said, because I didn’t know how to pretend and it seemed the wrong day to learn.

Me and Old Uncle Nick stayed ‘til the last Amen and the last shovel of dirt and the last hand shook. Then we walked home slowly, him holding his hat in his hands, and the path we took felt different than the one we’d come by, like the earth had tipped a degree or two in the heat and didn’t plan to tilt back.

I couldn’t sleep that night, and that was good. Because I wasn’t alone.

The curtain breathed in and out like somebody was standing there, and when I slid up on my elbows I saw faces—small, pale circles floating in the dark. It was the dairy boys. Their stares looked like the eyes on those china dolls in Mrs. Dent’s window—wide open and seeing nothing. Their mouths were moving. I couldn’t hear much but I knew what it was. That same crooked little tune slipping between teeth.

“Come on,” one of them whispered, but it didn’t sound like a boy. It sounded older. Darker.

I should’ve stayed put. Miss Mills had told me not to follow the sound. I slid my knees under me and my bare feet hit the floor then I stepped closer.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“Come outside. We have something to show you,” said the oldest dairy boy.

A dark shape unfolded from the side of the house. A long arm came across the sill and grabbed hold of my shirt, pulling me straight out the window.

“Shh,” said the farmhand, and he hauled me up and out like I didn’t weigh more than a sack of feed. The boys took my wrists, their fingers hot and wet, and together they hurried me off the porch and down the path, bare feet slapping the dust. The moon sat big and white over the trees. The fence wire sang one long, low note as we went by, and the sheep bunched up among each other shivering.

I tried to dig my heels in, but the farmhand had me by the back of the neck now, steering me easy as a calf. “Hush,” he said again, and there was a hum under the word that made my teeth hurt. I set my jaw and found my rumble and held to it. It pushed back at his sound and bought me a little space in my head where I could hold onto my own mind.
They took me to the small white church. The doors were thrown open and lamplight leaned out over the steps. The bell rope hung by the choir rail, frayed soft from a hundred summers’ pulling, and the whole place felt like a bowl cupped to the mouth of the night, waiting to be poured full.

They marched me down the aisle between the pews with my toes dragging. Folks were in there, men and women and a mess of children, sitting straight and still with their hands flat on their knees, eyes soft and far away. Even Georgia sat motionless just a few rows down.  Nobody said a word.

There was a man at the altar. But it was no priest.

At first I thought it was just a man come in dirty from the swamp. His suit hung off his bones like a scarecrow. Reeds clung to the cuffs and one cattail stuck up from near his shoulder, shedding brown fuzz that floated down around him. He was larger under that suit, I was certain, bits of him spilling out and creeping like tentacles from beneath him. It was Tomcat Rot, real as life.

Then he moved, and the coat hem lifted, and bits of him unrolled from underneath and went sliding along the aisle. The long grasping bits of him were slimy, slick and black-green. They split and split again into long, ropy arms that went between the pews and around the legs.

The farmhand put his palm on my head and pressed me down onto the front pew. 

The man at the altar turned to me.

His eyes were like two holes burned through paper. He smiled, and the smile had too many bright pieces in it, and some of those pieces looked like teeth and some of them looked like keys snapped out of a trumpet. He lifted the horn he carried, small and dull where the polish had worn, and he breathed out through.

A sound came that made my stomach turn. It weren’t loud. It didn’t have to be. It slipped along the walls and down the pews and into people’s mouths and sat there humming their throats for them. It found my ears and went stalking inside like it had every right to be there. I clenched my jaw till the hinges cried and set my rumble to meet it.

The man’s eyes narrowed. The tentacles that had slid between the pews twitched and then tightened around the benches as if he’d taken hold of the whole room. The dairy boy nearest me swayed and put his hand on my shoulder like he was maybe going to be kind, but then his fingers dug into my skin.

“You don’t take to my tune?” said Tomcat Rot, and the voice came out the horn more than the mouth. “How come it won’t take?” The sound under the words tried to climb into me, but it couldn’t get purchase. He looked down at me with a sort of hurt. “You give me your note, child,” he said. “You give it to me and I’ll make everything easy.”
I couldn’t answer. The rumble filled my head and pushed against the other sound.

“Hold him,” said Tomcat Rot, and the farmhand leaned into me with his whole weight and pinned my shoulders to the pew. His hum came through his bones and into mine. He smelled like sweat and wet campfire.

Then a loud crack cut through the air.

The farmhand jerked backwards, his hands flying off me. He took one step back for no reason at all and then sat down hard on the aisle. A dark red stain spread across his shirt. His hum went out like a snuffed candle. He looked surprised at nothing in particular.

Another shot from a rifle came after, rolling through the church like a door slamming.

Old Uncle Nick stood in the back, braced in the doorway with the long gun on his shoulder. The muzzle smoked a little. His hat was off. His face looked flat, but deadly serious. He chambered another round with a motion my mind understood even if my eyes hadn’t seen it done but once or twice.

“Boy,” he said, not loud, “rumble.”

He fired again before the word finished, and the bullet found Tomcat Rot at the altar just below the collarbone. Something came out that wasn’t blood. It was blacker than deep water. The tentacles flailed and slapped the pews and knocked a hymn book up into the air. The people, still under his spell, remained motionless.

The horn screamed. That’s the closest I can say it. It wasn’t a horn playing a note. It was the horn itself letting out a noise it couldn’t stand keeping in. Tomcat Rot moaned in pain. The people in the pews began moaning in unison, matching the creature.

Old Uncle Nick shot again. The creature staggered back against the altar rail.

I tore myself from the grasp of the dairy boy. I didn’t think about it. My legs carried me past the front pew and across to the choir rail where the bell rope hung down.

I yanked, pulling it down with all my strength.

There was a mighty clang. The rope lifted me up and I shifted my weight to force it down again. Another loud clang. It chimed again, the big iron bell slamming against its own heart.

Tomcat Rot went up on his toes like he was standing in a river come sudden and cold. The tentacles shrank and then sprang and then shrank again, like they couldn’t decide which way a body ought to be. He raised the horn to his mouth and Old Uncle Nick shot him again, the bullet tearing the coat where a belly should be and showing only a terrible sort of writhing parts beneath. The horn screamed again, and the bell answered, and the two sounds made a fight between them that shook dust out of the rafters.

I hauled the rope again till my hands burned. The bell struck wrong on purpose. Off the beat. Off anything that could be called a beat. It was a big ugly sound without a place to sit, and it ran through the church and out the windows and into the trees and scared the birds into a flutter and came back to us as a shiver.

The sound of the bells seemed to wake up the people from their stupor. Every time Tomcat Rot tried to hum his tune, infect their minds, the bell answered. The children’s faces changed. Their mouths stopped moving. Somebody cried out like they’d had a tooth pulled with no warning and no whiskey. Even Georgia seemed to wake for a moment, and she looked at me with tear-filled, pleading eyes. 

I let the rope carry me upwards again, and brought it back down with another clang. Tomcat Rot’s tune invaded again, and I did my best to shut it out, but this time it came so powerful, so fierce and hungry, I couldn’t resist it.

“You make that rumble!” Old Uncle Nick shouted, and I felt my jaw pull itself tighter to make room for more thunder. He took three steps up the aisle, calm as a cavalcade, working the lever and firing, working the lever and firing, the brass popping out and tink-tinking across the boards. Pieces of reed and coat and something that looked like mud jumped and spurted with each hit.

Tomcat Rot sank back against the altar, tentacles writhing in pain. He dropped to one knee, then another. His fingers, if they were that, scrabbled on the floor and found the horn and hugged it like kin. The creature lifted it and put it to his lips, lookin’ to take back control.

Old Uncle Nick walked right up to him. He stood over him with his boots planted where men had knelt to pray and set the barrel down gentle in the valley just above the bridge of the thing’s nose. The horn lifted an inch higher. The bell gave one more wrong strike—ugly and perfect.

“I never did like jazz,” Old Uncle Nick said, and he sent the bullet straight down.

The sound that came out of the creature weren’t made from a throat. It weren’t made from any part of any body I know. It was a torn thing screaming, and somewhere under it was a whole lot of other sounds piled up—train whistles, saw teeth, bees, frogs, a protest gone to riot. The windows rattled. My rumble broke off all by itself and left me with my mouth open and my hands still on the rope and nothing in my head but the ringing of the bell and the shot.
Then it was quiet.

Not church-quiet. Not night-quiet. A quiet like when a storm passes and you can hear the world put itself back in order. The tentacles sloughed to nothing. The coat fell flat like a wet rag. The horn rolled once and hit the rail and stopped. A little bent piece of brass came loose and rolled to my feet, lying there shining like a gold tooth.

A baby started crying in the back. Somebody screamed and then covered their mouth. The dairy boys leaned on each other and blinked slow like they’d just surfaced from a deep pool. One of the old women crossed herself three times and then fanned so fast the sticks blurred.

I let go of the rope and my arms went limp from the strain. My hands were burned and the skin ready to blister. I stumbled down from the rail and went to where Old Uncle Nick stood, smoke curling lazy out the rifle barrel. He was breathing hard through his nose. He looked down at the heap at his feet like it might get up and ask to be forgiven.
He put his free hand on the back of my head and held it there so I knew where I belonged. Then he dipped low on one knee and hugged me.

“You did good,” he said into my hair. He patted my back. “You keep that rumble handy, you hear?”

“Yes, sir,” I said.

Old Uncle Nick looked around like he was checking his work, then he set the rifle’s butt on the floor and leaned an elbow on the barrel and let out a breath that had been waiting in him a long time.

“Reckon I’m glad my hearin’s half gone,” he said, and gave me a grin that wasn’t much, but was enough.

Old Uncle Nick killed that thing that night, we all saw it. But I know that thing’s still down there, somewhere in the swamp whispering its rot. Sending out that jazz. Singing songs that drive men mad, touching their souls and corrupting them from the inside out. 

I know it, because I still hear it—and every time I get a rumblin’ in my ears.
