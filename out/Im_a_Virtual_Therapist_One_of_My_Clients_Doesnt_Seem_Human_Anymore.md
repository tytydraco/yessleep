I’m a therapist. Not the couch-sitting, pipe-smoking stereotype, but the modern kind. Cognitive behavioral, trauma-informed, licensed, and remote.
Everything’s remote now. Pandemic made it that way, but I never switched back.
Three weeks ago, I took on a new client. Intake came through a youth crisis center. Female, 17. Referred after a home invasion that left both her parents dead. Said she watched it happen.
Her name was Lydia.
Session 1 started normal enough. Blank expression. Flat tone. No visible emotion, not even when I asked about the incident. Dissociation, I assumed. Trauma response. I noted it.
But by Session 2, something was… off.
I noticed her screen lagging. Not glitching—lagging. There was a subtle delay between her movements and the sound of her voice. The image and audio weren’t out of sync. It was like her body was… catching up to her own words.
At one point, she said something, and the sentence kept going after her lips stopped moving.
I chalked it up to latency. Bad Wi-Fi. Happens all the time.
But then she blinked. And I realized: she hadn’t done that once in the entire hour.

Session 3, I logged in a few minutes early. Lydia was already there, just sitting in the call. Staring at the screen. Unmoving. Eyes wide, like she’d never learned how to hold a gaze casually.
I asked if she was okay.
She replied, “Do you ever dream about your teeth falling out?”
I hadn’t prompted anything. No small talk. No question. Just that sentence.
“No,” I said. “Why?”
She didn’t answer.
When I played the recording back—something I always do for notes—the question wasn’t there. She just stared in silence for twenty full seconds.
I checked my session transcript:
 [Client inactive — no audio detected]

By Session 4, I was already nervous.
She’d started wearing a hoodie that shadowed half her face, and behind her was what looked like a mirror, covered by a sheet. Same room, every time. Same lighting. No variation.
But in the middle of the session, something happened.
I asked about her sleep habits. She didn’t answer.
Instead, her mouth opened wide, far too wide, and stayed that way for about nine seconds. Silent.
Then she said: “I like your clock.”
I don’t have a clock.
She meant the one behind me.
Except… there is no clock behind me. I checked the recording. In her window, behind me, there was a clock—round, black hands, ticking slowly. Except the numbers were wrong. Just symbols. Not Roman, not Arabic. Not anything.
When I turned around in real life, nothing was there. White wall. Same wall that’s always been there.
Recording timestamp:
 [Client smiles. Subject's gaze directed off-screen.]
I stopped sleeping well after that.

Session 5 didn’t happen.
Instead, I received a video file in my inbox. No sender. No title. Just a .mp4 timestamped the exact minute our session was scheduled to start.
It opened to show me.
Me, sitting at my desk, in the session window, eyes fixed forward. But my mouth… was moving.
I was whispering something, over and over. Audio was low, but when I cranked it, I caught fragments:
"Let me in… let me in… letmeinletmeinletmein"
I slammed the laptop shut.

I called IT. They said no login records existed for that time.
I checked with the youth center. They couldn’t find any Lydia on file. No referral. No record of me ever being assigned to that case.
When I searched my notes, her profile was still there—but the image was blank.
Black square. No name. No age. No file history.

Last night, my webcam light turned on. I wasn’t on a call.
I walked out of the room, trying to convince myself it was nothing.
When I came back… there was a file open on my desktop.
Therapy_Session_6_Started.mp4
I clicked play.
Lydia stared at me. Same blank hoodie, same gray eyes. She raised one hand—like she was waving.
And then she whispered:
“Now I know how to talk like you.”
“Next session’s yours.”
The video ended.

I haven’t opened my laptop since. I’m writing this from a borrowed machine.
The sheet in the background of her video—the one covering the mirror?
I think I know why it was there.
I think she’s in mine now.
And every time I catch my reflection lag behind…
 I wonder which one of us is still [real](https://youtu.be/d_Gn9T2GxPE).
