I wouldn't exaggerate if I told you that my roommate was if not one of the worst I've ever had to deal with. Ryan, or as in his channel name, "TryinRyan" was a YouTuber who did challenges for content. Most of the time, they ranged from harmless to dangerously stupid. One challenge even resulted in him being in the hospital with a broken arm, and I don't even want to get into the details of how *that* happened.

But besides that, the guy was a complete *asshole*.

He would always make me leave the dorm just so he could do a video, he would always be loud as hell whenever I was trying to study for an exam or to relax, and he would always act like what he was doing was exciting, when in reality, the challenge he was doing was replicated over a dozen times by some other YouTubers.

Whenever the camera was off, he'd fit the perfect stereotype of a "Bad roommate"-never doing chores, helping around the dorm, doing the dishes, and being considerate of me. Sometimes he'd even go out of his way to completely boast about how he was more "successful" than me. (Mind you, this man doesn't even have a job.)

The only possible reason I could think of as to *why* he even has a fanbase is that the people who watch him are either a mixture of children, people who watch to see how shitty his content is, or just mildly bored people. There is no in-between.

It was even more of a headache when we argued. He'd always bring up the "You're just bitter I'm more famous than you." excuse as his way of winning the argument. To him, he was better than some sappy dork majoring in Art History.

One day, he barged into my room to tell me about his "next big video", according to him, it would make him blow up.

He was doing a challenge live (what a surprise) and it wasn't just any challenge, it was a challenge called the "Pitch Black Vial Challenge.". According to Ryan, the challenge goes like this: You had to get this thing called a Pitch Black Vial from the dark web, and then you would have to drink the entire substance in the vial at exactly 3 AM, no later than that.

I stared in disbelief at Ryan. Out of all the crap he's done over the time we've been roommates, this is the dumbest one yet.

"Ryan...." I said, flabbergasted "Please tell me you're joking....".

"Nope!" he spoke excitedly, "This is the one man! This is the one that'll make me go viral!"

I facepalmed. "Ryan, please explain to me how drinking something that could probably just be colored water makes you famous. Please explain that to me."

Ryan didn't explain it to me. He was still being inconsistent. "C'mon Lucas, it's the real deal! I heard about it on some random forum, and from one person, their brother tried it, and it turned out it wasn't fake!" he said, grinning.

My eyebrows furrowed as he finished his sentence. "Wait, so the guy's brother tried it, and then what happened?" I asked.

Ryan just shrugged. "I didn't bother reading the rest of what he said!"

*Oh my fucking god* I spoke inside my head. *This is just ridiculous*

Eventually, I finally gave up. "Fine, go do something that'll end with you either dying or hospitalized," I said, shooing him away.

Ryan just rolled his eyes. "Don't act bitter because I get more fame and money than you." Ok, now he was pushing it at this point.

"At least I have a job that makes me put in **actual** effort, instead of one where I just stay in a room all day editing dogshit videos." I fired back, Ryan looked offended by that. It was common for us to have fights similar to this one.

"Well excuse me for making dogshit videos that manage to rack up to 100 to 300 thousand!" he shouted.

"And excuse me for having to deal with the aftermath of any of your bullshit challenges that result in leaving a mess in either the kitchen or the DAMN LIVING ROOM. I snapped, more angry this time.

"C'mon, you're still mad over that one glitter challenge? That was a month ago move on!" he said with a snide tone in his voice

"You have no idea the hell it is, cleaning up glitter. It took me over 2 days to get that shit done, and I had to juggle both the glitter mess, and finish up a paper!". I raised my voice even higher.

"Whatever, continue being some loser interested in boring stuff like Art History," he said, walking back to his room.

"And continue being some shitty YouTuber who acts like he enjoys the shit that he does when in reality he hates it at the same time and is so DESPERATE to do ANYTHING to get into the spotlight." my voice cracking from the anger I was holding in. Ryan stopped in his tracks for a few seconds. He didn't move or even make a sound, he just stood there. Guess what I said stunned him a bit (which is good). Then he darted off into his room, slamming his door behind him.

I sighed, asking myself why and how I ended up stuck with someone like Ryan. He was the complete opposite of me. I was quiet, and polite and made sure to get by in life and try to build up a future. Ryan, however, was loud, rude, and bound to ruin his internet career, and he desperately tried to keep his subscribers in any way he could.

At 3 pm, Ryan left the dorm without saying a word. An hour later, he returned with a package in his hands.

"That the pitch-black stuff you were talking about earlier?" I asked sarcastically. Ryan turned the box over his shoulder, blocking it from my viewpoint.

"It's none of your business!" Ryan said, before darting off to his room and locking it behind him. He stayed in his room for the remainder of the afternoon. I didn't care though, if anything this was an opportunity to do things I wanted. I could finally finish that essay, I could finally finish a show I've been watching on Netflix. It felt wonderful

Eventually, nighttime soon came, and the effects of the caffeine were starting to wear off. So I decided to hit the hay and go to sleep. I got into my room and soon drifted into the realm of sleep.

I woke up to the sound of glass breaking. At first, my tired mind assumed there was an intruder in our dorm trying to rob us. But that wasn't possible, our dorm is only on the 4th floor, and the only entry to get in is through the door or the balcony. Not to mention there was a choking noise only seconds after the sound of shattering glass. My nerves began to rise as I walked out of my room. The sound had now evolved into a puking noise as I walked. My slippers hit the floorboard faintly.

The sound grew louder as I got to the living room, and when I got to the living room I saw Ryan.

He was on the floor, however, he was spewing out a mixture of blood and some odd black liquid. Beside him, were a few pieces of a broken vial. There were even droplets of a black liquid seeping from it. His phone was still on and live streaming. And conveniently it was in a spot where it was showing him vomiting that strange black liquid. His eyes found mine, they were wild and desperate. They pleaded for help before his whole body went limp. 

"Shit..!" I said, rushing over to Ryan. I checked his pulse and surprisingly he was still alive. But he wouldn't be for any longer if I didn't call an ambulance. I got my phone and dialed the three numbers but stopped at the call button. I noticed something happening to Ryan's body. It started twitching a little bit.

Then black steam started to come out of his mouth, it made a disgusting smell, causing me to fall to my knees and gag. When I looked up, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

It was a figure. It was bulky, steamy, and slimy all at once. it had no eyes and no mouth and had no other facial features. It turned and noticed the phone was still livestreaming. In a quick movement, it crushed the phone with its foot. I could hear the shattering and crunching noises of the device as the figure stomped on it 2 more times. Then it turned its gaze on me.

I took a step back, and so did it. I felt one of its hands touch my right cheek, and I could feel a burning pain on it. I quickly yelped and bucked the hand off me before rushing out of the dorm. I ran down the hall before I caught my breath. I clutched my right cheek, I could still feel the burning pain on it, and I covered it with my left hand, while I called 911 with my phone. A few minutes after I finished the call, I fainted.

I woke up in a hospital bed and was greeted by two detectives, they had questions to ask. I told them everything. About the challenge, Ryan told me, about how I found him lying on the floor convulsing and vomiting, even telling them about the being I saw that gave me the burn mark on my cheek. 

Of course, they didn't believe it. I could tell by the looks of confusion and suspicion on their faces. But they'd told me they'd look deeper into Ryan's case. And after a while of investigation, the police cleared me of any wrongdoing.

Ryan on the other hand ended up in a coma, and the doctors weren't so hopeful if he'd ever wake up. He even has that pitch-black liquid coming out of his mouth sometimes.

He managed to achieve his goal tho. Ryan's livestream went viral, and in only a few days, it was one of the most discussed things online. Many channels talked about the live stream, it was shared throughout social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit. Even when most of the videos with footage were taken down, many people in comment sections and forums discussed whether or not what happened to Ryan was fake.

It wasn't long before I also discovered people on a forum that had people they knew try the challenge, and the results were all the same. The people who tried it all ended up in comas. Just like Ryan

I don't know where Ryan went to get that package, nor do I know what happened to the figure that had somehow escaped through Ryan's body. 

But what I do know is this, Ryan went viral, in the worst way possible.
