It’s been a long time. I’m not sure exactly how long, but if I were to guess; I’ve slept enough for a couple years, or maybe it’s only been a couple days. It’s hard to tell.



I was in the mini-garden for a while, that’s all that matters. I wasn’t hungry at any point, other than looking at those two trees. I’ve learned a lot, like the fact that in the garden, night and day aren’t really a thing. The sun sets when you want to rest, and it rises when you want to explore. I still ate, but it was more for pleasure than hunger. Every tree produced fruit only when I wanted it, other than those two in the middle.



So, I passed the time in the ways I could. I noted as much as I could, but eventually it stopped seeming to matter. I tried to explore, and it was a maze. Almost every direction I went, I ended up back at the start. Except for when I went east. I travelled east and noticed the garden seemed to become less lush as I walked, the further I went the less “edenic” it was. Then I saw a figure in the distance.



Four faces, wings, and a sword of flame. I began to prepare to run, when I heard a sound like wind chimes echoing throughout a canyon.



“Come. Speak with me, human.” The sound resonated, centred on the Cherub. This one sounded infinitely more peaceful than my pursuer, yet there was something under its voice. The sound in a parent’s voice when their kid keeps breaking the rules.



“Who are you?” I called towards it, keeping my distance.



“Names are not of us,” it began, its head was spinning, each face speaking in unison.



“What are you?” I asked, stupidly. I knew what it was but I needed more information.



“I am the Cherub that guards the trees. Nothing more, nothing less.” its voice danced into my head, a song older than the stars.



“Are you going to kill me?” The question jumped out before I even realised what I was asking. A sound came from the midst of the Cherub, like the rolling of the earth during a quake, and the winds of a cyclone. If I were to guess, it was laughing at my question.



“No… I am not going to kill you. Your death would be an instant in the tapestry of that which you cannot know, but those threads are not yet spun.” It spoke with a knowing hint in its voice. Knowing I didn’t understand, yet I perfectly knew what it meant.



“How do I escape?” I asked bluntly.



“You are human, like those before you. Your kind has been banished from this garden, yet you violated the law set upon by the Creator. Knowledge damned you to this place, and only knowledge will free you.” The way it spoke, it sounded like it wasn’t even fully listening.



“What if I just walk by you?”



“The threshold that I guard is not a physical one. Were you to pass, you would be entering into that which you cannot be in. You would not arrive in sheol, you would cease. Like Enoch to the mortals, but to the spirits.”



I backed away. I didn’t know what to say, or what to do. It said that knowledge will free me, and I had a guess what it meant.



I made my way into the garden, to the trees. I looked closely at them. Pomegranates and Figs. Each fruit with a mythological meaning behind it. My withered arm traced the fruits, my wrists groaning in pain as I reached across them. I didn’t know which fruit was which.



I took one of each from the tree. Holding them made the hairs on my arms stand. I looked between the two, every cell in my body quivered with fear and awe. I knew what I needed to do, but I didn’t want to. I closed my eyes and brought the fig to my lips and bit down.



The second my teeth broke the skin, my mind flooded with images and thoughts. I could taste everything I had ever smelt. I could smell every sound I had ever heard. Every choice I made in my entire life flashed before me, and I felt guilt for the evil I had done, and joy for the good I had done.



Time no longer existed for me. I was one with my past, my present, and my future.



Then I was back. Back at home, inside the chalk circle. Incense smoked away. I watched it slither as I listened to the fridge hum and the fan's slow woosh. For a moment I believed my theory: herbs and incense, a hallucination. Then I saw the pomegranate and the fig with the bite missing.. 



I reached forward and felt pain shoot through my arm. The scars on my wrists no longer played with light, but they cut through my bones. I checked my devices and saw the date, making my stomach drop.



I did the ritual in 2016. It’s 2025.



What have I missed? How is the incense still burning? Why does nothing in here look different?



Now I don’t know what to do. I spent so long imagining getting free, seeing my family. Dad was sick when I went there, and I’m scared to know.



But the thing is, I do know. I know so much. Everything I see, I know if it’s evil or good.



I know my dad is alive, but I know he’s been deemed evil, a man of sin, and he will suffer the consequences when he dies.



I know what I need to do. I know I have both fruits. I know what I can give him. But I also know what that would make me.
