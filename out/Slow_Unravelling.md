I went back to work this morning just to get out of my apartment. It smelled wrong, it felt empty, without...I can't remember her name, but she was the sweetest little cat. I know she existed, I have pictures of her on my phone, hundreds. Or, I did. They're all gone now. Every trace of her has vanished and I couldn't understand why.

I tried to lose myself in work, shelving books, helping customers, just keeping myself on autopilot but on the one day I was praying for a rush the store was practically a ghost town. My boss, Maddy's her name - I don't know if I mentioned that. But Maddy had me go home early, no sense hanging around with nothing to do.

When I got home though, still on autopilot I dug my keys out of my pocket and slammed them into the lock—except there was no lock. Just smooth, painted-over drywall. I stepped back, heart hammering. This had to be some kind of sick joke. I wasn’t gone for that long, barely three hours. Just three fucking hours. But my door was gone, and in it's place was a wall, just an ordinary looking wall that blended with the rest of the hallway.

I pressed my ear to its pitted surface and just listened. I don’t know what I expected. My TV playing? The hum of my fridge? Anything at all. But there was nothing, at first. Except, the longer I listened, ear pressed firm against the wall, the more I picked up a faint, distant sound. It sounded almost like breathing. Like something large, something far larger than my apartment could have held was inside it, hidden within the wall where my home used to be, was just waiting. Listening. Breathing.

I stood there for minutes, just staring at that goddamned wall. It had scuff marks on it, like it had been scratched in the past by furniture being dragged down. There were stains from, something, I don't know what. It looked like it had always been there. Like the door to my home, my fucking home itself, had never even existed. Running my fingers over it, I searched the area where my door had been, where the doorknob had been. All I felt was slightly cool wall, and the occasional  dent or scratch as if it had been weathered by the passage of time and people.

My neighbor walked by just as I started kicking and pounding on that fucking wall. I didn't know what I had heard, maybe it was just a trick of my imagination, my anxiety over everything fucking with me. What I did know was that I wanted my home back. I wanted lay down in my own bed, and just curl up until everything was normal again.

That...that didn't work, obviously. My neighbor - except he's not my neighbor anymore, never was according to him called the cops. He'd never heard of me, never seen me before in his life. Neither had my landlord. I called him up begging him to explain what was going on, but he just thought I was a random lunatic. None of them knew who I was, something they both made certain to tell the cops when they showed up. As far as anyone was concerned I was just a random dude that had walked in and immediately tried to tear a wall down.

The cops, well one in particular, they seemed sympathetic to my situation. Told me they were going to let me go but I had to stay away from the apartment building. It was easy enough to agree to. Everything I owned, every memory I'd collected over the years, it was all gone. Like it never existed. My landlord...or, the man that had been my landlord, he was kind enough to not press charges against me, just told me I needed to get help.

One of the cops, the one that had been surprisingly kind, gave me his card and told me to give him a call later. It wasn't a suggestion, the way he said it - it was urgent, there was this kind of intensity behind the words I didn't understand. I nodded all the same, tucked the card away and got into my car.

I didn't go anywhere, mostly I just drove around town thinking about what to do, where I'd spend the night, and listening to music.

My back was aching at the very idea of spending the night in my car, so that was out of the question. More troubling...besides every single fucking thing that had happened so far that day, while I was listening to music my favorite song came on. I've loved this song since I was a kid I'm not joking when I call it my favorite song. But as I was listening to it, it sounded...off. Like note were just slightly wrong, a lyric here or there was different. Worse, her voice itself was just...off. So close, but still wrong enough to be uncanny. Like I was listening to someone do an \*almost\* perfect impression of the artist I knew.

It sounded close enough to my favorite to be recognized, but different enough to leave my brain buzzing and itching with the wrongness of it. After that I had to turn off the radio, and just drove in silence, and eventually I found a decent motel on the outskirts of town. It was cheap enough that I was able to pay for a week, taking one small worry off my mind, if only for a little bit.

Once I was settled in the first thing I did was what I'd wanted to do all day. I called my mom. The second I heard her voice I was crying, and everything I'd been going through, everything that had happened to me, came out in a jumbled rush of words. That she was able to understand anything I was saying was a minor miracle in and of itself. But she did, she understood and listened and shushed me, telling me everything was going to be okay.

Then she asked me something that...it confused me, made my blood run cold. She asked if I was finally ready to take her up on her offer to move in. She said she hated hearing me like this, and she thought it would do me good to have a stable living situation. When I asked her what she meant it was her turn to sound confused. Worried. She told me I'd been homeless for a while, living in my car. When I asked for how long, she couldn't say. She wasn't sure. When I asked her about my cat, she thought I meant I'd just adopted one, and immediately started scolding me for taking in a pet when I was barely taking care of myself.

Hearing that, I had to hang up. Before today I've always been known as someone dependable. I don't get out much, I don't do much beyond work and catching up on shows and books. But I'm always there if someone needs help, and I've always, \*always\* had my shit together. But the way my mom talked, it was like she thought I'd always been flaky or unreliable, things I'd proven myself not to be over and over throughout my life.

I just sat there on the edge of the bed for a while staring at my phone. I started scrolling through pictures I had saved, little funny memes I traded back and forth with friends, when I noticed one in particular was missing. The only reason I noticed is because it's one I've been trading back and forth with my best friend for nearly two years now. It's just a stupid inside joke, but it makes me laugh every time it shows up. But it was gone, along with any signs of it in our message history.

I texted, then tried calling, but he didn't answer and I wound up leaving a message that, in retrospect, probably sounded a little insane. Right after that I called the cop. He answered on the second ring, and as soon as I spoke he interrupted me with a brusque, "Took you long enough."

I had no idea what he meant by that, and said as such with an articulate, "What?"

"Look, I’m gonna keep this brief, kid." A pause. I heard muffled voices in the background. The sound of a car door slamming. "It’s not safe to talk too long."

"Not safe? What the hell does that mean?"

A long, exasperated sigh was my only answer, at first. "It means you’ve caught something’s attention. And it is very much not something you want eyeing you up." In the background I heard paper rustling, and a sharp, indrawn breath. Almost like he'd been on the verge of gasping, and caught himself. Then, quieter -almost a whisper - came his next question "Are you alone?"

"Am I - yeah, yes I'm alone. I'm in my motel room. What does that even matter?"

I asked him that at least twice, tried to ask him more questions, demanded answers. But once he was certain I'd written the address down he hung up. I tried calling again several times, but each time they went directly to voicemail. I got the hint. And I had the address. It all sounded batshit fucking crazy to me, but it felt like I was out of options. My apartment had just fucking vanished, my goddamned cat had gone the same route. I wanted my home back, my cat back, I wanted my life back. Whatever, or whoever, was at that address might have answers, solutions, so it seemed worth the risk to go.
