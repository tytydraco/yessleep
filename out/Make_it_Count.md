“Merry Christmas there, Boogerbear.”

I felt my jaw clenching even before I heard the fluttering laughter—Jenny always had her gaggle of cunts around her, ready to laugh at her mean, stupid jokes and back her up if anyone tried to fight back.  Looking up, I met her green, dancing eyes.  

If you saw her in a picture, you’d probably think she was beautiful.  Tan, clear skin with a light dusting of freckles, delicate features that were symmetrical while being quirky enough to be interesting.  Shit, even in real life plenty of people thought she was hot, though how you could be around her for more than five minutes and still think that was beyond me.

It wasn’t just that she was shallow or petty—there were plenty of people like that no matter who you are or where you lived.  It wasn’t even that she was annoying, though that really didn’t help.  No, it was that she was cruel—not because she had a bad temper or was too blunt or just thoughtless, but because she enjoyed it.  And maybe I appreciated it more than most, but how didn’t everyone see it?

“Ugh.  She’s such a bitch.”  Jackson leaned up against the locker next to mine.  “I can’t believe she’s your sister.”

I shot him a glare.  “She’s not my sister.  She’s just Steve’s daughter.”

Jackson pursed his lips and gave a shrug.  “I mean, I guess that’s technically true, but they’ve been dating for like ten years.  I know you don’t live together full-time, but aren’t you always together on the weekends and holidays?”

Frowning, I gave a short nod.  “Yeah, usually.  It sucks.”

“Is she getting any better at home, at least?  Like as she gets older?”

I shook my head.  “No, she’s just sneakier with it.  Steve isn’t a bad guy, but she has him fooled.  She plays the good daughter when he’s around and then starts shit when we’re alone.  If I fight back, she runs and tells him or my mom and it’s suddenly my fault she’s a crazy bitch.”

He puffed out a long breath, his expression darkening a little.  “So, um, how’s your mom doing?  Is she still in chemo?”

I shrugged as I shut my locker and locked it.  “I don’t know.  She finished this round last week, and it takes time to see any real benefits.  She’s got another doctor’s appointment tomorrow.  But…”  I trailed off, my vision getting blurry.  Jackson reached over and gave my shoulder a squeeze, and I forced myself to push through.  “…but I can tell she’s dying.”

“Jesus.  I…I’m sorry, Cat.”

We walked out of the building silently, headed towards the lot where our cars were both parked.  Halfway there, Jackson forced a smile and elbowed me in the ribs.  “Have you guessed what your birthday present is?”

I shook my head.  “Nope.  Don’t you usually get me a bag of candy?”

He laughed and nodded.  “Sure, but this is your eighteenth!  Got to do it up right, right?  Go big or go home.  I think you’ll find that this particular gift has…”

“Can I interrupt you and your gay boyfriend, Boogerbear?”

I looked around to see Jenny grinning nastily at me.  She was alone now, but her face had a knowing hardness that I didn’t like.  Something was up.  Jackson grunted in irritation but I waved him off.  “No, you can go fuck off though.  I already have to see you more than enough.”

“Oh, Boogs.  I’m going to miss this special bond we have.”  Her eyes flicked over to Jackson.  “You know I’m the one that named her Boogerbear, right?”  When he just glared at her, she continued.  “Yeah, right after our parents first started dating.  We were like, what, eight or something?  And I thought she might be cool.  Like we could be sisters, right?”  She curled her finger and mocked digging it into her right nostril.  “Until I saw her picking boogers and eating them.”  She wrinkled her nose.  “Scabs too.  Fuck you’re gross.”  Suddenly, her eyes lit up.  “Maybe that should be your name instead.  “Scabby Cat.”  Crinkling her eyes, she let out a small giggling snort.

I stepped up to her.  “Listen to me, you fucking cunt.  If you don’t get out of here, I’ll beat your ass in this parking lot for everyone to see.  You can start Christmas Break with a break of your own.”

Eyes widening, she took a step back as she feigned shock.  “Oh my God.  You’re so fucking crazy and violent.  That’s part of what I’ve been talking to Daddy about.  How crazy and fucked up you are, and how your mommy is going to be dead soon.  About how it’s not fair to him or me for us to put our lives on hold when he could be happy with someone who is healthy and we could finally have a good family again.”  She curled her lips out into a pout.  

I’d felt my chest tightening as she spoke, and now I could hardly breathe.  “You… you can’t.  It’ll fucking kill her.  Just leave them alone.”  I wanted to gag and swallowed it down.  “She’ll be…Steve will be free soon enough.  Just don’t make it worse than it already is.”

Her pout curdled into a nasty grin.  “Too late.  I think he’s going to tell her this weekend.”

“Fuck you’re pathetic.”

We both turned to look at Jackson as he went on.

“You hate yourself so fucking much—not saying it’s a bad call, because you really fucking suck—but you hate yourself so much that you’ll literally try to hurt your own family just to what?  Feel like you have power and control?  How sad are you?”

Something passed over Jenny’s face, but she shook it off and turned back to me.  “Not as sad as some people are going to be.”  She pulled her phone out of her back pocket and looked at it.  “Shit, I’m running late wasting time with you two.  Just thought I should give you heads up.  Soften the blow, right?  We were almost sisters, after all.”  Turning away, she waggled her fingers behind her.  “Bye cumstain, bye Booger.  See you laters.”

I was shaking as I stared after her.  What the fuck was I supposed to do?  Was she lying?  It wasn’t that she was above it, but she’d seemed too happy and sure of herself.  Had she really convinced Steve to break-up?  Jesus, could he not wait a few more months?  I jumped a little as Jackson touched my back.

“I’m so sorry.  She’s full of shit.  Has to be.  Steve’s a good guy, right?”

I nodded.  “Pretty good, yeah.  But it’s been wearing on him.  I’ve seen it.  So has she.  If she can make him feel like he’s doing the right thing for her by breaking up with Mom, I could see him doing it.”  I looked back at Jenny.  She’d just gotten in her car and was pulling away.  “I just fucking hate her so much.  She’s like a black hole, just sucking everything in and destroying it.  I…I just wish she would fucking die.”

Jenny’s car was almost out of the parking lot, but it suddenly swerved and ran into the back of a pick-up sitting near the exit.  My eyes widened.  “What the fuck?”  I looked at Jackson.  “What do we do?”

He pointed to where one of the coaches was already running over to her car.  “See, they’re already going to go check on her.  Fuck her.  Go home and see your Mom.  It’s your birthday.”

I nodded.  “Yeah, you’re probably right.”  I glanced back at the wrecked car.  She hadn’t gotten out yet.  “Um, are you sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure.  Now take your present and go.”

I turned around to see him thrusting a king-size Snickers in my face.  “Went all out for my eighteenth, huh?”

He shrugged.  “Only the best for…

“…one call 911.  She’s not breathing…I think she’s dead!”

We stared at each other for several moments before turning to walk toward where everyone was gathering.

**** 

“So do you have magic powers now?”

I blinked and glanced over at Jackson.  “What?”

He shrugged.  “I mean you wished her dead and then she died.  Like the second you said it.  So I think my question is fair.”

I rolled my eyes.  “You’re an idiot.”  Puffing out a breath, I looked away and out the window.  “I mean, yes, that did happen and was weird, but that doesn’t mean they were related.  It was just a coincidence.”

“Wish for a million dollars then.  No, wait.  Wish for a hundred million dollars and give half to me.”

Frowning, I shot him a skeptical look.  “So now I’m a genie or…?”

Jackson snorted.  “How do I know?  I’m not the one that wish assassined the school mean girl an hour ago.  But if you can wish for stuff, make it something cool.  Like, as a test.”

A thought flitted across my mind and I pushed it back.  No, I wasn’t taking it seriously.  I wasn’t.  “Fine, just to get you to shut up.  I wish for a hundred million dollars…um, in valid United States currency that isn’t stolen or something and won’t get me in trouble or get taken away without my consent.”  I shot him a look.  “I’ve seen WIshmaster, bitch.”

Jackson looked at me and then the back seat before frowning.   “Nothing.”  His face brightened.  “Hey, check your bank account.  Maybe it’s there.”

Heart racing a little, I pulled out my phone before letting out a discontented grunt.  “Nope.  Still have two hundred bucks in there.”

He nodded.  “Well, that sucks.”  Then after a moment of thoughtful silence, he added,  “Maybe…maybe you can only wish for certain things.  Like maybe not money, but stuff for people.  Like Jenny dying or…maybe you could help your Mom get bet…”

“Stop it.”

“I’m just…”

“No.”  I felt myself tearing up.  “This isn’t a fucking joke or some game.  I spent three years hoping that she was going to get past this, but she’s not, okay?  I can’t…I can’t give myself false hope playing at some bullshit because you think it’s funny.”

He was quiet for a minute.  “I didn’t mean it like that.  I really think something might be going on.  But I get it, and I was being stupid.  Trying to help, but I should have kept my mouth shut, and I’m sorry.”

Wiping my face, I nodded.  “Accepted.”  

We reached my house then, and he stopped before saying anything else.  “So just text me when you figure out what you want to do.  We can go back and get your car or I can give you a ride to wherever in case you need to drive your Mom back.”

I nodded as I got out of the car.  “She’s probably already gone to Steve’s or the hospital, but I’ll find out and let you know.  Thanks.”

Jackson grinned at me.  “No problem.  I want to stay on your good side.”  He winced.  “Please don’t wish me dead.”

**** 

When I went into the house, I could tell it felt empty.  A few years ago, I’d have known right away no one was there, but it had gotten harder to tell for sure the last few months.  There’d been a couple of times lately when I’d have sworn no one was there but I’d find Mom asleep in bed or watching t.v. on the sofa.  I’d had the thought once that she was dying in increments instead of all at once, slipping away slowly as she made installment payments on her ghost.

Shuddering, I went through the house to make sure she’d already left.  I’d talked to her briefly on the phone and I could tell by how upset she was that she wasn’t waiting on me to get home before she went, but I’d still hoped I’d catch her.  My phone buzzed and I saw I had a new message from her.

We’re at the hospital.  Come when you can.  I wrote your birthday card earlier.  You need to read it before you do anything else.

I reread the message.  Birthday card?  What birthday…oh, it was sitting on the kitchen counter, I’d just ignored it when I came in looking for her.  I almost left it where it was, but then thought better of it.  Texting Jackson to come back and pick me up, I grabbed the card and opened it.  It wasn’t bright or colorful like most cards I’d ever gotten from my mother.  Instead, it just said “On your birthday” in flowing script, and the inside lacked any message other than what my mother had written there in her neat but cramped style.  I had to read it several times, both to make sure I understood and because my hands had started shaking so hard.

Cat:

I should have told you this before you left for school this morning, but the meds have me so out of it these days that I didn’t even realize you were gone until past noon.  That’s part of why I decided to write this down rather than tell you when Steve or Jenny are around or risk waiting until later.  I need it to be clear and I need you to understand that what I’m saying is serious.  This isn’t me out of my head or getting into one of my weird joking moods.  You have to listen to what I’m telling you here more than you’ve ever listened to me before, and while we can talk about it more later, rely on this the most, as I know I’m clear-headed now and telling you everything correctly. 

You are blessed.  Everyone in our family is, going back for a long time.  When we reach eighteen years of age, we get one wish.  A real, honest-to-God wish.  Like you found a bottle with a genie in it. It kicks in at the exact time you were born, which for you is in a little over an hour at 2:13PM.

I don’t know why we get the wish, or where it comes from.  But I know that it works, so long as you follow certain rules.

1)	 Ask for something specific.  You can’t just wish to be happy.  You need to ask for some specific thing to happen or change.
2)	Ask for something related directly to you.  You can’t ask for everyone in the world to live forever or get a gold ring.  But you can ask for those kinds of specific things for yourself or someone else you personally know.  But only for one of you.  
3)	You can’t cheat.  You can’t ask for more wishes or make a neverending sentence that gives you ten things.  It’s only one thing.
4)	You have to truly want the thing you’re wishing for.  Truly and deeply.  If you ask for something that you want to want, but don’t really want, it won’t work.  If you ask for something that you would like to have but don’t feel very strongly about, it won’t work.  That’s actually a really good rule, as it keeps you from wishing for stuff accidently, as I don’t think saying “I wish I had some candy” would work.
Still, I don’t have every answer, and I only have my own wish and what my father told me to base things on.  And I’ll tell you what he told me.  Take your time and think before you decide.

Now I know we’re in a unique situation.  Part of you is going to think about using your wish on me.  I’d be lying if I said part of me didn’t want you to.  But that’s the selfish part of me, and I love you more than that.  You need to decide what is best for you, and there are probably lots of things that would help you more than giving your 52 year-old mom a few more years.  I’m not going to try to persuade you one way or the other, and I’ll respect whatever choice you make and love you for having the bravery and wisdom to make the right decision, whatever that may be.

But take your time.  Think it through.  I trust you to make the right choice, but I’ll go back on what I said a bit and say you shouldn’t use it on me.  Use it on your own life.  But that’s just my opinion, and it’s your choice.  Just remember, this is a blessing very few people ever get.  Treat it gently and guard it well, and when the time comes?
