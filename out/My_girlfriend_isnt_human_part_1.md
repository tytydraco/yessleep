I don't even know how to start or even explain. The best place I can start is, I met her through a friend. And my friend always tried to set me up with any girl he thought I'd like. Spoiler alert They weren't my type. Until he introduced me to Jacklin. She is pretty and likes video games, anime, and horror. I thought it was too good to be true but after the first couple of dates, I realized she was actually into me. After a while, we got together. And...... Everything was completely normal until I started noticing things. When I would go to make dinner for us noticed that some of the meat products I just bought would be gone or half-eaten overnight. And that she got much more aggressive than she usually was during the times we would have sex. And she seemed to somehow know I was hurt before I could tell her. 

Until one night I bought a game I've been fanboying over ever since I saw the trailer. So I stayed up pretty late that night. After a while, I kept hearing something. Like the clacking of nails and the creaking of floorboards quickly going by the gaming room door. 

"Babe is that you?"

I called out hoping to get a response from Jacklin but I didn't. I stand up from my chair and walk to the door. I opened the gaming room door and I heard the sound of something chewing and crunching on something coming from the living room and kitchen area. I grabbed the heaviest thing from the gaming room I could find which was a full metal cast of molnir. Holding the big hunk of steel in one hand with 911 on speed dial in the other I slowly walked into the kitchen to see a mass of black fur behind the kitchen island. 

"what the fuck......"

I whispered out and regretted it immediately. Because the thing heard me. It started to stand up. I'm a pretty big guy I'm 6'5 and this thing towered over me. What I was looking at was a fucking werewolf. I dropped the now-useless hammer with it smashed through a floorboard missing my foot by a half-inch. It turned towards me licking the blood off of its snout and maw. I realized what it could've been eating. I felt my heart sink knowing it killed Jacklin. I run towards the door grabbing the keys. I hear the thing stomping the switch to dropping to all fours I duck in time for it to fly over me and smash through the front door. I take this moment to run out of the now-obliterated front doorway. I run to my car and get in quickly getting it to start and I threw it in reverse peeling out of there. After speeding down the I pulled over to the side of the road and I couldn't hold it back anymore and started to sob. But it was cut short by something tapping on the window I look over to see the thing looking at me through the window smiling at me.
