I went out to get a new shotgun today. They were all way out of my price range, the most I could afford was a old revolver and about 24 silver rounds. It's still a weapon, but not enough to blow off one of Franks limbs. I've also been sleeping in the basement recently, it's the only room that has no windows, so Frank can't get in as easily. I've also started seeing frank at night. Anyways, I'll keep copying down my father's diary entries.

I think destroying the rune is effecting Frank. She looks like she's started rotting, the muscle looking slightly greenish, with multiple parts looking a bit shriveled up. She's also gotten a lot more aggressive. I've been seeing her during the day now, just beyond the trees, and her attempts to break in have become almost nightly now. She doesn't even care how much she gets burned by the silver, she's desperate to get in and kill me so I can't destroy the other runes. The cultists also appear older. I think the runes also affecting the cultists and not just Frank.

Tonight when Frank tried to break in, it was much stranger than every other time. The cultists surrounded my house, the cloaked man standing in the middle. He towered over the others. Then Frank walked out of the woods, towards my house. She now had a long, skinless tail that appeared to be made of multiple animal bodies, ending in a skinless wolf head. Then, her body started shifting. The muscle started melting until her head was replaced with a almost beautiful, black haired, pale skinned, blue eyed, topless, rotting woman. She then spoke, her voice was angelic, ethereal almost. If she were a normal woman, I would've thought her voice sounded beautiful. I'll try and remember what she said. "Friend, do not fret. We will not harm you, if you simply come out and give us the runes, we will leave your pitiful, worthless, mortal life alone. Or, I could even let you indulge. You can join us, eternal life, if you were to give up the runes. The end will not be painful, for as long as I remain, pain is all imagination to us." Frank said. I cursed her out, telling her no. She then transformed back into her normal skinless form, and attempted to break in with the cultists like all the other times, until they eventually went back into the woods as morning arrived.

I completed the blood moon ritual. I stepped outside, Frank was waiting. She charged at me, but I shot her multiple times with the silver buckshot as she got knocked back with each shot. I kept shooting until she was just a lump of muscle and bone on the ground. I then quickly found a patch of mud on the ground, burying the human rune in it. I expected for the ritual to be complete and for Frank to scream out in pain and run back into the woods once she was fully regenerated. But nothing happened, she kept regenerating. I panicked, before in a last ditch effort, I carved the deer rune into the mud, as something then happened. The patch of mud started glowing with blue veins as the mud formed into Frank's head and screamed at me before flopping down back into an old puddle of mud. I looked back, seeing frank rapidly rotting as she screamed in pain. I heard hundreds of peoples screams erupting from the woods. Frank continued rotting until all her muscle was shriveled up, dried and brown as she ran back into the woods. The cultists didn't attack this time. I went back into the house and locked all the doors and windows. I just have to make it too Halloween, and it'll all be over.

I'm so sorry... They've gotten in... Frank and at least 20 of the cultists are in... They're upstairs searching for me... I'm hiding in the basement... Audrey, my beautiful daughter... Please, don't ever come to this ranch or house... I'll miss you... I'm sorry... Know I'll always be with you... Oh God, they're her

That's the last entry. They got my dad, I know it wasn't a bear attack that killed my father. I know what I have to do. I'll finish the final ritual. From now on, these posts will no longer be my father's diary entries. I'll kill Frank, make sure no one ever has to go through this again, I'll make sure to do it. I don't care if it kills me, I'll kill Frank. I'll update you all soon, if I don't, know that Frank got me.
