A couple months ago i was camping out of my mom and stepdads RV on BLM land in Nevada. Where I was parked was about 20 miles from any houses or anything. While I was out there i got snowed in. It was about 3 feet of snow so I sent out a message to my mom telling her what was going on. 

That day I spent digging snow out from around the RV so that I felt like I was doing something. I spent the whole day out there digging snow out. As the sun was going down I had about a 25 square foot section from around the door (I was using a spade, it was very slow going), and a path that led about 80 feet. I was at the end of the path still digging when the sun went down.

 I decided to work a little more and while I was digging I heard what sounded like someone walking through the snow. I looked up and there was a figure of a pretty tall guy ahead of me comming out of the tree line about 200 feet from me. If I had to guess I would say about 6'5 or so. Anyway, he was trudging through the snow towards me. 

Considering that we were in very cold weather and very far from anyone/anywhere my first thought was "oh crap, this guy needs help" so I called out to him "Hey, you ok out here!" And as soon as I finished that sentence the figure broke into a full blown sprint. I immediately turned around and sprinted down the path back to my RV. When I got to the door I looked back and this man had not only crossed the clearing through 3 feet of snow but he was now sprinting down the path I had dug. I got into the RV, slammed the door and locked it behind me.

 I grabbed my gun and moved to the back side of the RV. I could hear the man circling my RV so I shouted "I have a gun, if you don't leave now I will shoot you" after I yelled that there was 2 or 3 insanely loud bang sounds on the side of the RV. I heard the man start walking toward the front end but I couldn't hear past that. I stayed in the bathroom at the rear of the RV and ended up falling asleep. In the morning I woke up and I took the gun and went outside. 

I could see paths leading from the tree like, circling my rv, and back out to the tree line. I also learned what those loud bangs were. The generator cover on the RV was kicked in. I recently told my friend about what happened to me up there because he said he is planning on going up there for the weekend and when I finished the story he told me to post it here.
