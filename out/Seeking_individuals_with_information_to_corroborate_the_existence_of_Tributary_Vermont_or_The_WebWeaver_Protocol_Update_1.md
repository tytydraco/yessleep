In retrospect, my "shot-gun" approach to intel gathering may have not been the most prudent choice.

I.E.: I ended up dramatically shortening my remaining time on this planet. People are (apparently) really dyin' to keep this under wraps.

Don't plan on going out quiet, though. Ain't gonna be snuffed out like a candle - I'm passing into the next life more like a grenade strapped to a landmine. Gonna do as much damage as I can as I go.

To that end, I'm posting the two most damning pieces of classified information I have at my disposal - for posterity's sake. Nothing ever truly dies once it's on the internet.

**Number One:** The Bureau's memo regarding their investigation into the disappearance of Tributary and its people in March of 1992. Published in December of 1998.

**Number Two:** Personal journal entries from the person/celestial entity that inadvertently *caused* those disappearances, recovered from the site in the early 2000s. Her name was Arora Sevitts. But post-ascension, she was more commonly referred to as "Infinity's Daughter" or “The Prism”

God willing, I'll be alive long enough to follow up on all this. If not, at least I went out with a bang, not a whimper.

***(1) Declassification Memo: Mass Disappearance in Tributary, Vermont, 1992.***

**Contents:** Mass disappearances, seismic events, and subsequent investigation of Tributary, Vermont. 1992-1998. Pertinent definitions provided.

Seismic activity first noted at 0632 on March 5th, 1992, by one of our senior personnel, Dr. David Wilkins, stationed at the Woodford State Park, Vermont. At dawn, he noted a magnitude 7.1 earthquake with an epicenter approximately three kilometers northeast of *\[REDACTED\]*. The seismographic data suggested a massive and ongoing tectonic shift centered on Tributary, a small town along the edge of the *\[REDACTED\]*. Despite that, there were no reports of distress from the civilians of Tributary in the hours that followed initial seismographic readings.

That morning, Dr. Wilkins placed calls out to all the nearby ranger outposts. Eleven out of the twelve did not note any abnormal noise or quaking, but five of those rangers observed a subtle visual “vibration” of the landscape when asked to look toward the epicenter. The twelfth outpost, 0.3 kilometers south of Tributary, could not be reached by telephone, despite multiple calls.

Concerned about a potential developing *convergence point*, Dr. Wilkins ordered an emergent quarantining of the area. He and his team planned to perform confirmatory testing once they established a physical perimeter around the epicenter.

———————————————

***Convergence Point***\*:\* A collapse of the temporal framework that keeps diverging chronologic possibilities separate and distinct from each other. This collapse results in an abnormal overlap of multiple chronologies at one single point in space.

Examples of small, non-destructive *convergence points* include: identical twins, déjà vu phenomenon.

The larger the *convergence point,* the more destructive the anomaly is. Additionally, larger *convergence points* are at a higher risk of expansion, as the initial temporal collapse often has enough energy to destabilize adjacent, initially unaffected areas.

Examples of large, destructive *convergence points* include: The Flannan Isles Lighthouse and other missing person cases, such as the disappearances of Eli Barren or that of the Shoemaker family.

———————————————

Dr. Wilkins requested the initial perimeter encompass a half-mile radius around the epicenter. There were concerns from upper management that this was unnecessary use of funding and labor. However, Dr. Wilkins successfully argued that, if the seismographic data was accurate, they may be dealing with the largest *convergence point* in recorded history. If so, the anomaly would be an unprecedented threat to all human life and immediate containment was of paramount importance.

Upper management relented and siphoned resources to Vermont. The organization completed and operationalized the perimeter three days later, on March 8th. No civilians were detected leaving the quarantined area during that time. A handful of calls came in from outside of Tributary inquiring into the safety of family members, friends, or business associates that were permanent residents of Tributary. The Bureau managed these calls with bribery, coercion, or neutralization. Thankfully, the town was insular and had minimal connections to the world at large, allowing a quarantine to be established with limited additional loss of human life.

Further testing suggested there was an exceptionally massive *convergence point* radiating from the seismic epicenter. Bacteria gathered from the perimeter had a 29% rate of *chimerism*, and camera installations positioned towards the epicenter by Dr. Wilkins and his team revealed consistent *refractive doubling*.

———————————————

***Chimerism***\*:\* An abnormal merging of microscopic organisms that indicates recent *convergence.* Single-cell bacteria present in the environment (*Clostridium, Bacillus*) will often form atypical, multicellular hybrids if subjected to *convergence*. Concerningly, unlike their mammalian counterparts, this merging process does not appear to result in death.

There are no documented instances of a multicellular hybrid infecting a human, but it is an ongoing consideration. Some research on hybrids has shown that they may be more deadly, contagious, and resistant to antibacterial treatment, but these findings are early and require additional corroboration.

Normal levels for *chimerism* are less than 0.001%. Prior to Tributary, the highest levels ever documented were 4%.

***Refractive Doubling***\*:\* A phenomenon that can be observed with ongoing, low levels of *convergence*, wherein a photograph taken of the affected area will show overlapping objects that the naked eye cannot perceive.

As an example: Imagine someone took a photograph of a person leaning back against a single oak tree in an area undergoing *convergence*. Although they may appear to look normal, a picture may reveal the person’s right hand has eight fingers. Or that the tree has another, identical tree growing out of its side.

\*\*\*Both phenomena were first described by Dr. Wilkins. His current protocol for evaluation of *refractory doubling* involves placing several automated cameras around an area concerning for *convergence.* Trained personnel manually review photos taken every thirty seconds by the cameras, inspecting for signs of doubling.

———————————————

On March 10th, a trained pilot flew a plane over Tributary to visualize the affected area. When questioned afterwards about what he saw, the pilot remarked that “the land and buildings around the epicenter were wobbling, like the inside of a lava lamp”. His answer was similar, although more extreme, to the observations made by some of the park rangers on March 5th, who described the affected area as “vibrating”.

Pictures taken from a camera on the hull of the plane could not substantiate what the pilot saw. When developed, they were all pure white, with scattered brown-black specks that gave the photos a “burned” appearance.

Based on the testing, Dr. Wilkins was of the opinion that a *convergence point* of unprecedented size and scope had materialized directly on top of Tributary, Vermont. An additional event on March 12th all but confirmed his fears.

HQ received a distress call at 1330 from Lindsy Haddish, one of many mid-tier operatives assigned to maintain and monitor the perimeter. She reported that something living had appeared from inside the quarantined area at her outpost. Dispatch was immediately concerned about a breach. In the moment, Lindsy was unable to describe what she was seeing because her rising distress was turning into a stabbing pain in her right leg. Since she believed she was on the precipice of *amalgamating*. Lindsy gave dispatch her exact coordinates and said she was activating her *sleepswitch*; then, the communication ended, and personnel were sent to assess the situation.

———————————————

***Amalgamating***\*:\* A byproduct of *convergence,* where one individual is physically conjoined with another, nearly identical individual. The process results in the “molting” of the original individual, as the copy spontaneously materializes from within the original’s tissue.

Per current records: 100% fatality rate for the original, 93% fatality rate for the copy.

***Sleepswitch***\*:\* A potent sedative that is self-administered via a previously installed chest port by a remote control. High energy emotions, such as rage or panic, can catalyze an instance of *amalgamation* at a location that is experiencing *convergence.* Immediate sedation has been proven to delay or prevent *amalgation*, even if it is already in progress.

Per protocol, all personnel interacting with *convergence points* must have an installed *sleepswitch*.

———————————————

Rescuers found Lindsay unconscious, but alive, at the southernmost outpost. Her right foot and calf were eviscerated, with a copied foot and calf protruding from the destroyed tissue. Luckily, she halted the *amalgation* via her *sleepswitch* before the copy fully formed. Heroically, she also successfully caught the living being that had appeared from within the perimeter and provoked her distress. It was a robin that had a human eye extending from its abdomen and human bone fragments growing from its wings.

Cross-species *amalgamation*, for official documentation purposes, is still considered by upper management to be impossible.

Dr. Wilkins ordered the perimeter to be extended substantially after what happened to Lindsay Haddish. Upper management, having seen pictures of the robin and Lindsay’s foot, cleared the construction without hesitation. They also green-lit the first ever utilization of a *swansong* to make sure there were no other mammals still living within the perimeter.

———————————————

***Swansong***\*:\* A sonic weapon developed specifically for usage within large *convergence points*. To prevent the spread of *convergence*, it is critical to remove life from the affected area. However, anything that neutralizes targets using fire or an explosion (i.e. gunfire, napalm, missiles) can expand the *convergence point* by giving it additional kinetic energy. A *swansong,* on the other hand, induces self-termination to anything mammalian within two to three minutes, assuming they can hear. It is a lower energy intervention, so, it is less likely to accidentally expand the *convergence point.*

The radius of action is a little under one mile. Personnel deploy them aerially, and they continue playing until the internal battery runs out.

During development, they were affectionately referred to as “earworms”, though this nickname was eventually scrapped.

———————————————

Upper management wanted a ground team to investigate Tributary despite the risks. However, that did not occur until May of 1997. Dr. Wilkins theorized it would not be safe to have personnel at the epicenter until the *convergence point* cooled significantly. By that May, the seismographic data radiating from the epicenter had finally become undetectable. Overhead pictures of Tributary had improved but had not become entirely normal. Most of the area was visible but blurred in the photographs. However, white “sunbursts” still appeared on the pictures - similar to the appearance of the pictures taken in March of 1992, but they did not take up the entire photo like before.

Dr. Wilkins demanded the overhead pictures normalize prior to sending in a ground team. Unfortunately, he passed away on May 21st, 1997. Upper management deployed a team to Tributary and the epicenter on May 23rd, 1997.

Per communication records, there were no perceivable visual abnormalities on route to the epicenter. As the team entered Tributary, however, they reported visualization of many *amalgamated* skeletons. The species that originally housed those skeletons were mostly indeterminable by examination alone because of an array of skeletal anomalies.

When the team was nearing the epicenter, they began to report something “big, bright, and moving in place” on the horizon. Then, communications suddenly went dark. There was no additional radio response from any of the eight team members in the coming months, and they were presumed dead. Transcripts from May 23rd do not detail any reported distress from team members prior to them becoming unresponsive.

No further attempts have been made to physically investigate Tributary or the epicenter. Upper management has elected for an indefinite quarantine for the time being.

Shockingly, all eight team members reappeared at HQ on November 8th, 1998 - appearing uninjured, fully mobile, and well-nourished.

HQ has been housing them in its decontamination unit. Although they are well-appearing, they are unwilling or unable to answer questions. They seem to understand basic commands. None of the team members have requested to return home.

The only helpful abnormality so far: about once every day, each team member says the following phrase in synchrony: “all of her is going to wake up soon”. They live separately. Thick, concrete walls and at least 900 meters of distance separate each team member. They have not seen each other for over a month. Yet, at seemingly random times during the day, they say “all of her is going to wake up soon” in unison with each other, regardless of what any of them are doing or where they are. They have not said anything else, and we’ve had them back for a full month.

We have named whatever is at the epicenter of Tributary “the prism”, on account of it being described as “big, bright, and moving in place”. You are receiving this memo because The Bureau is seeking ideas external to the department. We are looking for thoughts on how to approach re-investigation, and/or ideas on how to neutralize the prism with minimal additional human causalities.

Please respond directly to me.

Sincerely,

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

***(2) Journal entries from Feb. 1992 to March 1992. Written by Arora Sevitts, Infinity's Daughter***

**February 11th, 1992:**

*There was someone missing last night, and it worried me. Worried a lot of my sisters, too.*

*It was a half-moon, so we had all met up in the glade. Just like we had done hundreds of times before, we made a circle around mother. But someone was missing.*

*In the eight years we’ve been looping, no one’s ever been missing.*

*Hard to say who, for a lot of reasons. But we all could see it. Somewhere in the circle, there was an empty spot.*

*We looked to mother for guidance. From her place in the ground, she glimmered and spun and her eyes became a violet color.*

*Mother implored us to loop, as we were already behind schedule.*

*All of the sisters joined hands, save whoever was missing. The girls next to the empty spot had to stretch their arms to complete the circle.*

*When we all took one step left, there was the red flash. Same as there always is, and then I was alone in the glade.*

*My flesh parents looked slightly different when I got home. Same with my room, my dog. Everything was slightly different, so I guess the loop went okay.*

*Mother will be happy.*

\-------------------------------

**February 18th, 1992:**

*It was a normal week, thankfully. My flesh grandfather caught me sneaking in after last week’s loop. I told him it was a pretty night, and I couldn’t sleep, so I wanted to get some fresh air outside.*

*He’s always been very fearful of me. Sometimes I think he can see my latticework, and that he might know and remember some of my sisters. The sisters that had been in this thread before me.*

*No one else seems to notice but him.*

*I can tell because sometimes he has to shield his eyes when he looks at me. My flesh parents think he is just getting old, but I know it's my latticework shining.*

*So, when he caught me sneaking in, I was concerned he might do something strange because he was scared. But he could barely even look at me, I was too bright. He closed his eyes and gestured blindly towards the stairs without saying anything, so I’m assuming he just wanted me to go to bed.*

*There were even more sisters missing tonight. Hundreds of thousands by mother’s measure.*

*Mother shone and gleamed for a very long time. It reassured us, but it didn’t make it any easier to join hands. We all had to grow our arms to make the circle.*

*But we were still able to take one step to the left, conjoined. The red flash happened too, but it was dimmer somehow.*

*Still, things were slightly different at home, which was a good sign. I didn’t get caught sneaking in this time, either.*

\-------------------------------

**February 25th, 1992:**

*This week was a nightmare.*

*I’ve been in a lot of pain. All of my muscles ache and tickle and shake by themselves. Sometimes I’ve seen my sisters in the mirror. They look like they’re in pain too, which makes me want to cry.*

*Then, on Wednesday, I woke up in the middle of the night with an extra pain on my shoulder, sharp like the time I stepped on a nail.*

*Something was wriggling around where I was having the extra pain. I thought I had been bitten by a worm. But when I grabbed the worm and pulled, it didn’t come off. It was stuck and part of me.*

*That’s when I felt a fingernail.*

*I think it was one of my sister’s pinky fingers.*

*I made sure none of my flesh family found out about the finger. Thankfully, its winter. I covered it with heavy jackets.*

*When I got to the glade, there were even more sisters missing. The ones that were there had pain and growths, too. Teeth through the forehead like scales. Some of their bellies looked way too big and had heartbeats. One sister had two or three necks; it was hard to tell how many for sure.*

*Mother looked very tired. She didn’t have much to say.*

*When we looped, something went terribly wrong. I heard a lot of screaming and yelling.*

\-------------------------------

**March 4th, 1992:**

*I think my flesh grandfather has been talking to my flesh parents and everyone else in town about me.*

*They all look at me so strange. They don’t shield their eyes like they can see my latticework, but their expressions seem anxious and evil. It’s hard to explain.*

*My muscles don’t ache as much anymore, but I can feel a peculiar wrongness wherever I step. It’s made it hard to move, like the entire world is jell-o. Everything is wobbly.*

*When I tried to go to the glade, my flesh grandfather stopped me. He had been hiding in the dark, waiting for me to try to leave the house. He asked me all sorts of rude questions, like why I was born so wrong. I tried to run past him, but he blocked my path.*

*I haven’t wanted anybody to touch me this week. Everything has been too wobbly. My latticework feels very sticky. I warned him not to come close.*

*When I put my hand to his face to push him away from touching me, some of him stuck to me. Parts of his eyes and his mouth came off into my palm. He screamed, from himself and from my hand. I really don’t like the feeling of his eyelids blinking in my palm.*

*I ran past him after that. Thankfully, I was wearing my backpack, which is where I keep my journal.*

*At the glade, all of my sisters looked like they were in bad shape as well. They all had issues with their flesh grandfathers, too.*

*Mother said she needed to go for a while, but that we would be okay if we stuck together, like a family. She also told us it's important that we sleep for a while.*

*The world might be different when we wake up, she said. More different than we’re used to. We were never supposed to be together like this. It’s unnatural. But mother also said we’d never be separated again, which made us all happy, despite the pains.*

*As much as I like the things I’ve lived with, we’re not very much alike anymore. Not after the change and meeting my true mother. It's lonely when I'm not at the glade.*

*Since I don’t have time to say goodbye, and I might not remember the same when I wake up, I’m leaving this journal here.*

*I can hear people in the woods looking for me, and they sound angry, so I am hurrying.*

*Whoever finds this, please deliver it to 191 Fairmount Avenue in Tributary, Vermont. It will be the house with all the chimes on the front porch. My original mother's name is Avery.*

*-Arora*
