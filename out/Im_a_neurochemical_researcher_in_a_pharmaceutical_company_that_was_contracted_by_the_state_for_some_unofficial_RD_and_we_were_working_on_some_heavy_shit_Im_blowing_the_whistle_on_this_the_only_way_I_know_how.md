9:02 PM EST let me start by saying I'm currently in full command of my faculties and I believe I am a good person, who got caught up in something bad. I regret my involvement. I hate the impact of my actions but I do not hate myself for them. 

For now I'm not going name my company or the people involved. I snuck out a couple invoices, research data, and even a couple audio recordings which are scheduled to go live if something should happen to me. 

And I expect something will. 

Several respected politicians are implicated in the invoices, and it goes higher up than most people would expect. As in NOT quite local. As in pretty much to the top, or damn near it. 

Then again, there's not much in those invoices that's concrete. The ones at the top are only ever implied, so they still have plausible deniability I guess. Maybe spilling the beans wouldn't achieve much at first but I think the money trail could be enough to pin them if I do end up going public with this stuff and trigger an investigation.

BUT honestly, I'm not really worried that those powerful men and women will be the "Something" that might happen to me. I expect the something... well, we'll get to that, probably. 


To be honest I'm not even sure that what we've been working on is necessarily bad enough to warrant me risking it all like this. 

That sounds kinda cowardly, I know. And if I were 100% certain of anything grossly unethical or for lack of a better word-- evil-- going on I'd do my duty in an instant. 

But I'm a scientist, and I guess I'm just weak against conclusions. I always want more data, the verdict is always out, or so they say. I'll make up my mind soon though, about whether or not we're in the right or wrong enough to be exposed. 

The thing is, the drug we're working on could really help, I mean it could fix some of the harder problems within our society. The work we're doing might turn out to be a really good thing, it could.

You can see I really don't know which way to lean on this, that's why I'm hoping writing it all out will give some perspective. But I have my own theory and Ultimately this is the test, isn't it?

I hope my theory is wrong, but I don't think it will be

To put it all out there: the state commissioned us to develop a drug to be delivered intravenously in certain legal sentencing. I know what you're thinking-- something along the lines of lethal injection. But that's not what they were asking for. They wanted something more along the lines of a court-ordered medicinal treatment that could offer therapeutic 

I won't bore you with the full detail of the invoice where they laid out the primary authorizations and all that crap, but I will highlight the words that summarized what they were truly looking for. The contract approved our company  forthright research and development of a new drug that they hoped would "treat violent offenders who demonstrate a lack of remorse with a drug that will elicit a powerful state of critical introspection and chemically induced empathy."

In other words, it seemed like they wanted us to develop a "fix" for the worst of the worst, the human monsters that make the news. 

Before research began, we were all thrilled-- practically on cloud nine. 

Winning your typical government contract is always a good thing. Usually there's prestige with these, but this contract was slated as "unofficial". That's their way of saying they're not involved in any way with the work they've asked (and paid) for. 

I guess that should have been my first clue that maybe-- just maybe-- this wasn't all sunshine and fucking rainbows and good vibes. If this was strictly ethical and above board, then the state would have claimed it. Of course. That's obvious to me now. Painfully obvious. 

Honestly I feel like... God I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing that right away. Jesus, how could I be so.... 

Stupid. Maybe it was greed. The work paid well, of course. Our company was awarded a pretty hefty sign on bonus and it didn't just get clotted at the top. It was passed around pretty fairly. 


That was probably deliberate too. To keep us silent and compliant. If we were getting paid, we'd be good little lackeys and keep our lips tight to protect their secrets. 

So you see the truth? I wasn't just a fool for not noticing the ethical grey area here-- I wasn't just an idiot for not feeling a little more skeptical towards the government's "unofficial" benevolence. I WAS GREEDY! 

And that makes me guilty. I went along with things, for that damned bonus. I'm ashamed to admit it-- fucking disgusted with myself. 

---- wait a minute---- It's about 10 pm... THIS is IT... way deeper than any guilt I've ever felt. Wow, wow, wow, wow it hurts. God damn my head is buzzing. All I hear is this... nagging disgust towards my own behavior... fuck, towards my own SELF. I know I've felt guilt and remorse before. For making my wife cry once, for stealing from my mom when I was a kid and for ditching a friend back in highschool so I wouldn't get bullied too... I KNOW I felt bad about my behaviors then. Hell I think I even cried and apologized in all three cases, but THIS is just so much... more. 

It's heavier.

It's like the guilt I felt back then was just pretend and this is the real deal. I'm struggling to keep writing, but I'm gonna go on as long as I can. This is fucking crushing

Look, I wasn't planning on revealing this till the end (whatever end that would be), but I think it would be better to just come clean. I took a dose of the chems. We code named it Expathy. 


Fuck me for being a scientist I guess. Wanted to see what the subjects went through... wanted to see if my theory was true

back when we started I told myself I was doing a good thing for society. That the medicine we developed would have therapeutic value for those convicted of the worst crimes-- and it would help rehabilitate them to be peaceful, healthy members of society. impossible. God my lies would put the devil to shame

I told myself that this research could tame the rapists and the murderers and the mass shooters and the racists, or better yet to wake up the humanity within those people who carry themselves like beasts. 

I pretended to be one of a company of saints! And I pretended so hard I fooled even myself! 

god my skull is on fire but i gotta focus so this makes sense

Did you know, before I injected myself I truly BELIEVED that my role in this atrocity could be excused? That is to say I made excuses for myself. But I still thought myself to be a good person at heart. A good person who'd made some mistakes, but who could still atone by owning up. 

but there's no making this right. I lied to myself, the only truth i dared share with myself was in my theory...

Doesn't that make me one of the beasts i meant to cure? To masquerade as a good man when i'm a fucking spineless worm!? I should have known this contract was wrong-- but I looked past the dead giveaways for that damned greedy bonus. 

but aren't we all a little greedy?

A drug that makes people fess up and own their wrongs? Ka-fucking-ching, right? 


I bet you want to know the formula for that gold mine, don't you?, well fuck you for asking! You'll see it all laid out clear as day once my evidence goes live, but by then this won't be worth a dime. 

THe value of the formula will be zero, but they're still be some worth in the knowledge and the warning



EXpathy wasn't even that hard to synthesize, we ran monkeys through an MRI while dosed on different cocktails of some of the most common stimulants and the most potent entactogenic drugs-- drugs in the same class as MDMA. We dialed in on the combination that saw the most increased blood flow and neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

between the neural imaging and the observed behavior in animal subjects, we knew we had created what we'd been tasked with. the drug induced what we'd described as "cyclic empathy", where the subject fixates on their actions, specifically as catalysts towards the negative feelings of others. In other words, subjects fixated on the harm they'd done, with catastrophic results.

fuck

its fucking awful.... We did a bad thing making these drugs. It's not justice and it's not therapy it's fucking TORTURE

We did a bad thing making them and we did a WORSE thing testing them on... fuck even the animal testing... 

We had to trigger traumatic-empathic events in the primates, so we caged them without any food, and 

jesus can't forgive me and neither can I

we took the survivor and dosed him or her with expathy and then we watched. 

We sent some observers through the MRI, and the granular regions of their prefrontal cortices were on fire, even when restrained. They made noises too, the monkeys. Unlike any we'd heard before. It was the sound of anguish-- a different kind of anguish than that born form the pain of hunger. A terrible howling groan. Like a human sob, but coming from the throat of an animal

Other survivors went into isolation chambers for observation, after dosing with Expathy. 

Every. single. one of them began mutilating themselves. They rake their claws across their faces, they'd gnaw their fingers raw 

one strangled itself until passing out and everytime it came to it started again one...

used its teeth to tear into the arteries in its groin

god, one of them dug into it's belly and hurled out it's own guts

ultimately they killed themselves

all of them

they did it without any tools or weapons. They did it violently and they did it with their own teeth and claws. brutally and desperately


I can't believe we were ever approved for human trials. how the fuck did that happen? how and why??? 

Jesus I'm sobbin thiking of what we did. I'm disgusted. absolutely disgusted by the harm i caused. 

and god damn me it's 11:00 pm i'm right on track. It won't be long now im writng as fast ias i can but i have to think so hard about each and every letter

my mind wants to blame and spiral

i wont be long

 i should be scared at first i was. But i knew it was the only way to prove everythig

but now im looking forward to it

i'm looking forard to being so far gone that i can finally have the courage todeliver myself into the hands of justice-- even if they're my own fucking hands

i've never loathed anyone as much as myself right now... I wish i could take it back, but i cant... nothing i can do will make this right. coming clean was a pathetic attempt to buy back my soul.. my soul is damned but that's only fair


still Can't believe i ever went along with the research plan... I thoughti as a good man but then I actually injected this fucking drug into those death row guys what the fuck

AFTER seeing what it did to the monkeys... whatthe fuck

as bad as it was with the animals humans did it worse. theyd start confessing about an hour after injection, but confession seemed to give themzero comfort. they'd ramble on and on and on confessing and confessing all the more pleadingly. THey'd start sobbing about two hours after injection, just like I am thinking now, thinking of all this... 

THey'd get stupider and stupider and become utterly inarticulate 3 and a half hours post injectoun

fuck i'm running out of time i feel it slipping

after that inartiualte theyd start self mutilation 

multialtion no mercy

they killed themslves eveyr one of them, i'm runningo ut of time but im proving my theorr


my colelagues said the drug worke d but only on creatures who had done real erong. they says the monkeye were guilty of cananiabalizm and the deth row guys swas guilty of worser stuffbut i knew better m y theroy

thehyey said xpath could be used to injet people accused of bad things and they wouldn t' be harmed if they was innocent. If theiy guilty theyd take care of thesmelf but innocent would be OK

my theiry was sthat the medeciine madde everyone suicidel even good peolpe and anyone who takess will kill themesleves from the guilt

my tehoy is righth 

i'm provng it next post wiill be automatd, all the darta nd names and the video of what i wil do to myl self at t 3 hour mark



i feeel such rage towards me

i did evil i am evil i must pay deserveit

right now

no more talk
