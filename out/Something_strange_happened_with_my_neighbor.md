I am someone who travels a lot. I can afford it, because I work online. I've been to various places over the years.

It happened recently when I was living at Thailand. I lived in an Island with a small village. I moved into a good neighborhood. People were so kind to me. I was able to make friends with the locals easily since I knew a bit of the Thai language. There was one neighbor in particular that I became really good friends with. Let's call him Jack.

Jack and I would do a lot of things together, like going swimming, fishing etc. His house looked as though it had been abandoned. It was really rundown. He never let me in his house before.

And one night, when I was working in my home, I heard a woman screaming. It startled me. With that, I lost all my mood to work and went outside to check. The woman screamed again. My heart sank as I figured out that the voice was coming from my friend Jack's house. I went to his front door, which looked like it was over 100 years old. I knocked on it. There was no answer. The woman screamed again and it came inside of the house. That motivated me to open the front door and get inside the house.

When I entered the house, it suddenly became extremely cold. So cold that I started shivering. I was in the living room of the house when I heard the woman scream from a room nearby. I did not think any further and barged into the room, only to find out that nothing was there. It was an empty room, devoid of any life nor furniture. A chill ran down my spine. It was at that point that I knew this was a strange occurence.

"Hello?! Anyone here?" I screamed, hoping that someone would answer. No one did. I checked all the remaining rooms of the house, no one was there. They had almost no furniture. It looked as though no one lived in the house. I felt an ominous presence at that point. As though something was watching me. So I immediately went out of the house and got back to mine.

I was in no mood to continue my work so I just lay down on my bed, thinking abiut what just happened in Jack's house. And before I knew it, I had drifted to sleep. I was feeling very tired afted all.

When I woke up the next day, I had a scratch on my arm. It looked fresh. And it burned. It felt as though something had scracthed me while I was asleep. I went about my day, trying to brush it off and I finally finished my work. And by the time I did, it was already 4 pm in the evening. So I decided to go out and take a breather.

I went to a local beach. There were a few people around when I went there. There was a salty smell in the air. This was one of the things I liked the most when I was in Thailand. As I walked down the beach, I saw Jack, swimming. I went up to him and called put to him.

"Jack, where were you last night?" I asked.

"Oh, I was out of town" Jack answered as he reached the shore where I was on.

I could not bring myself to tell him what happened in his house last night. I didn't want to believe what happened last night so I tried my best to convince myself that it was just a dream.

"So what do you want to do?" Jack smiled.

"I don't know. I am just out here to get fresh air." I said as I started to walk.

Jack followed me for a while. And we had conversations about different  things. And not so long after, I decided to go back home. 

"I'll go home now. I'm hungry." I told Jack.

"Okay, see you later. I'll just be swimming here for a bit." Jack told me as he hurried back towards the sea.

So I went back home and sated my hunger with a meal. I had this strange feeling that Jack was acting strange. Like it was not the usual Jack. What I found the most strange is that Jack did not invite me for a swim. He always used to invite me whenever he went swimming.

I looked at the orange glow of sunset through my window. And something was caught in the corner of my eye. I saw a pitch black figure, standing right infront of my house. It had no discernible features. No face, no eyes, just nothing more than pitch black. It stayed there for a long time. Maybe like 2 hours. And the occasional person who walked on the street would not notice this figure. It was as if I was the only one seeing it.

I was frightened to the core. My whole body was trembling with fear. I felt too much fear to stay alone in the house I was staying, so I went outside and wandered around. I stopped in by a local caf√© to eat something and then wandered some more and took the path near the beach to go back home. The beach was in full sight. With dim lights illuminating the pavement next to the beach. I just realized that it was nearly midnight. I soon reached my home.

I searched my pockets to find the key to unlock my house, and it was not there. I had to go back and retrace my steps till I reached the beach. I had no memory of dropping my key anywhere. Even so, I searched eveywhere with my phone's flashlight till I reached the besch.

I caught something shining, reflecting the light from my flashlight. It was half buried. And when I put the sand aside, I found out that it was indeed my key. Then, all of a sudden, I saw a silhouette standing in the distance. It looked the same as the one I'd seen before near my house. I attempted to ignore it. But before I could do anything, it charged at me with inhuman levels of speed, bumping into me. The minute it bumped into me, I was pushed by a force and fell down on the ground. That scared me to my core.

I went back home and tried to sleep, my could not because I was too scared to do that.

It was 5 am in the morning when I started hearing something. It was a laugh. I could barely hear it. It continued for like a good 15 minutes before suddenly going quiet. I went to go and take a look outside the window, opening it, still hesitating to look. When I looked around, I saw him. I saw Jack standing right infront of his house, with a bloodied face, with two empty eye sockets, smiling ear to ear. When he saw me, he pointed his finger towards me and started laughing in an unnatural voice.

He started talking from there. His voice was so loud I could hear it even from the distance where he was. Most of what he said was gibberish.

But the only words I was able to make out were "get out of here". A chill ran through my spine. Is this really my friend Jack? The best friend I had been going swimming with? The friend I have done a lot of things with?

After that, he let out a screech that made me cover my ears. I looked away for a bit, and the screeching stopped. When I looked around, he was nowhere to be found. I haven't seen him ever since. To clarify things, I asked the locals about how lived in Jack's house. They told me that no one has lived there for over 20 years, and that the family that used to live in that home moved away.

I obviously did not stick there for too long and left that place. I am scared of that happening to me again.

Who knows when I will meet another Jack?
