*As the zombie got closer and closer I saw how big this zombie really was. It was almost taller than Fred! It rammed into Fred with so much force that when he fell I heard a loud crack from somewhere in his body. The zombie immediately took advantage and started tearing through the cardboard trying to rip into Freds flesh.*

&#x200B;

*I was so scared and shocked I didn't realize my best friend Caleb was yelling my name. He grabbed me and pulled me away as I saw Fred struggle to get the  zombie off of him. The last thing I saw before Caleb shut the door was the zombie biting Fred's neck and pulling back meat.*

&#x200B;

*I turned around to see 2 other classmates that made it out with me and Caleb. I told Caleb thanks and started talking about getting to a safe place. Darnell suggested we take one of the teachers' cars but none of us had any clue of how to drive.*

&#x200B;

*Me and Darnell started to argue about who could drive better when a loud thump came from the door we had just come from. It was silent for so long I was able to hear everyone's breathing. Kate then broke the silence and said we should go when the door burst open and out came the same zombie that killed Caleb.*

&#x200B;

*It ran so fast it was a blur, it jumped on Kate in an instant and killed her on the spot. We all started to run towards the teachers cars while looking back just in case the zombie decided to chase us. We were all so distracted about that one zombie we barely noticed our surroundings.*

&#x200B;

*So when I got a good look at our surroundings while running I was shocked! Smoke and fire in this distance, gunshots and sirens, people who made it out of the school running towards the road., zombies walking, it was chaos.*

&#x200B;

*We made it to the car and tried the doors but of course it was locked. Darnell suggested breaking the window but it would trigger the alarm which would also trigger the zombies in the area. Caleb then said there were some bikes that the seniors used to get to school.*

&#x200B;

*But then he said it was all the way on the other side of the building. With all hope of escaping lost we decided to make a run for the bikes. We went as far as we could to the right side of the school and slowly started walking towards the location of the bikes.*

&#x200B;

*As we were walking I noticed more and more zombies were just walking around. I didn't want to say anything about it thinking that these zombies had super hearing or something. As we got closer to the bikes I noticed Darnell was looking really scared and anxious.*

&#x200B;

*I tapped his shoulder and made a, ‘’what's wrong’’, face but when he turned around he screamed so goddamn loud people from space probably heard it. We all froze and looked around for zombies running at us or zombies turning towards the noise and staring at us.*

&#x200B;

*It was like slow motion, tons of zombies from almost every side were running towards us. We all immediately started running for the bikes, as we turned the corner of the building we saw the bikes coming into view.*

&#x200B;

*But as we were running I noticed a couple of zombies close to the bikes. I screamed how we were gonna get past them but nobody answered. I looked behind me while running and saw all of the zombies that were chasing us tearing and ripping into Darnell's and Caleb's flesh.*

&#x200B;

*The only reason I was alive and running was because they got distracted eating my classmates. With tears in my eyes I increased my speed and ran even faster to the bikes. One of the zombies who was close to the bikes perked its head up to the sound of my running.*

&#x200B;

*Once it locked its eyes on me it started running full speed at me. Finally reaching the bikes I grabbed one and threw it at the zombie which caused the other zombies in the area to turn and run at me. I grabbed another and started to pedal but one of the zombies that was close to the bikes jumped on me causing me to fall off the bike and onto the grass.*

&#x200B;

*I heard a sickening thud as I saw the zombie go limp from crashing its head into the concrete wall. With 2-3 more seconds before 5 more zombies crashed into me I decided to use the bike that had fallen as a shield and batted the zombies away from me.*

&#x200B;

*Just as the zombies were about to get past the bike I was using as protection a loud shriek came from nowhere. As soon as this shriek was heard all of the zombies stopped and started walking slowly in one direction. Confused, I slowly got the bike quietly and started to pedal away.*

&#x200B;

*I had to occasionally weave past zombies or dead bodies who still didn't turn into a zombie yet. As I rode into the teachers' vehicle area I saw the road just beyond the cars. I pedaled even faster until I was on the road.*

&#x200B;

*I looked around while pedaling and saw abandoned or crashed cars, dead bodies, cop cars, people running, smoke and ash in the air, buildings on fire. It was chaos, I didn't know where to go or what to do, all of my friends were dead and probably zombies now.*

&#x200B;

*I decided that I needed to find a safe place with clean water and fresh food. Knowing my way home I pedaled as fast as I could hoping that I could make it before night fell. I made a quick stop at a local gas station and saw blood all over the floor and some food products.*

&#x200B;

*Along with food products on the floor and a couple of shelves were knocked over as well. I salvaged what I could and grabbed a couple of bags to make it easier to carry the supplies. I checked my watch on my wrist and saw it was 3:49.*

&#x200B;

*I ran to my bike and put the bags on the handles, as I started to pedal I noticed there were a couple of zombies wandering around on the road.*

&#x200B;

*I realized that whatever that shriek did to the zombies had stopped. Now the zombies were back, I couldn't go through the grass because it was too hard to pedal and trying to go around the zombies would be very dangerous.*

&#x200B;

*I decided to stop and find a rock to distract the zombies. Upon finding one I looked up and saw that the zombies were gone. Confused, I wondered if I was just getting real hungry and decided to eat a quick snack when I heard running.*

&#x200B;

*I looked and saw the zombies were running in the grass towards me. I immediately hopped onto the bike and tried to pedal as fast as I could. Luckily I got away because there were some cars the zombies had to get over to reach me which slowed them down long enough for me to get away.*

&#x200B;

*But something was off, as I pedaled away I looked back and saw them just staring at me. For some reason, these zombies had a lot of intelligence.*

&#x200B;

*They could have just ran straight at me but instead ran around. I didn't know what this meant but I didn't really think too much of it.*

&#x200B;

*As I continued to pedal I saw my house come into view. I pedaled so hard my legs were aching but I pushed past the pain until I was at my house.*

&#x200B;

*I quickly hopped off the bike and grabbed the bags of food and drinks. I ran up and looked around to make sure there were no zombies nearby. Once I was certain I knocked on the door before opening the door. What I saw shocked me.*
