Slamming into each other head-on, the two red semitrucks then backed up and slammed into each other again at top speed. They went "VrOom! vRoOm!!" Neither truck had taken any damage; there wasn't even any paint transfer.

**"Truck...red truck..."** The voice demanded. Dad grimly stood, took one of the toys from Michael before he could react, and without ceremony, tossed it into the corner of the living room.

There was nothing there, and then, for an instant, we could all see the mouth. Its lips were glistening, its teeth perfectly white and straight, and the tongue was pink with a gray carpet upon it, and curled around the toy while it took it. As it began to masticate the plastic and the imagination of the child, we could hear the crunching. Then there was silence.

Then Michael began to cry, still holding the other red truck toy. Mom picked him up and took him to his room.

All I could think about was how many things we had fed to the mouth. I thought about when I had first seen it, and it was like it was always a part of our lives. It was always there, consuming whatever made us happy, taking away any comfort. It was always demanding something, and as long as it was appeased, we didn't have to fear it.

The fear was still there, just a kind of background, a kind of silent terror of what it might do to us if we didn't immediately give it what it wanted. I couldn't remember what life was like in our family before the mouth began to speak. I can't remember a time when we didn't live oppressed by its invisible presence, avoiding that blank corner of the room.

"Why don't we just move away?" Mom had asked Dad, quietly one night after the mouth had eaten both of their wedding rings.

"Shhhh, don't say that. You'll make it angry." Dad trembled, worried that the mouth might have overheard what his wife had suggested.

There could be no escape. Even if we all jumped in the car and drove away without packing, without planning, the mouth would somehow catch us. That seemed to be what Dad was afraid of. It could do things, make us forget things.

Not little things, but big things. I suppose we could drive away, but how far would we get before we realized the mouth had made us forget to bring Michael with us? We would drive back for him, of course, but would it be too late? The thought was too terrifying to contemplate.

We couldn't get help from outside, nobody believed any of us. Our family had become isolated and imprisoned by the mouth. I wondered where it had come from, or if there were others like it. Perhaps someone had figured out a way to get rid of a mouth in the corner of their room.

I could hear my parents, they were in their room and they were whispering and crying and they sounded completely terrified and broken. They were succumbing to its tyranny, and its power to turn the truth into lies, to do evil to our family day in and day out, and nobody would believe it. To the rest of the world, our whole family was crazy, and there was no mouth.

I closed my eyes and fell asleep, taken by exhaustion. There was no other way to fall asleep, knowing that thing is in the same house. I just have to wait until I cannot keep my eyes open, and then I am overwhelmed by sleepiness and I get some rest. I always awake to crying and disturbing noises. Knowing sleep only brings helplessness against such a thing, and that I will awake to another nightmare, makes voluntarily closing my eyes for rest impossible.

There is no sleep for the oppressed and the haunted. When something waits downstairs to feed on you, and nobody believes you, that is when you lose yourself. Sometimes I just can't fight it, and I feel like I'd give it anything. That's how my parents are now, they just blindly obey that horror.

I think that is the scariest part of all, that my parents have given in to such evil, and now they blindly obey it. I am worried the voice will speak and it will say: "Michael" or it will say my name perhaps. Would my parents finally snap out of it? I don't think so, they've given over control to the mouth. They listen to it, and they do as it commands, without question.

"It's better to give it what it wants. If it must come and take it, then it is so much worse. There's no escape." Dad had said once, in a moment of lucidity.

That morning, when I was sitting on the stairs, I looked at the dog bowls by the front door. I trembled, as I realized I had no memory of our family owning a dog. I got up and went into the back yard, where I spotted some old dog poop in the grass, and a chewed-up dog toy. I wondered how long ago our dog had gone missing. How long does it take to forget a pet?

This worried me. My mind gradually began to form the disturbing thought that the mouth had eaten our dog. Worse, if we had forgotten the dog, that meant we had cooperated. That meant that Dad had fed our dog to the mouth. The thought of him doing that terrified me, because I could already imagine my father sacrificing one of us to feed the mouth.

Dad is a very cowardly man, who is only brave when he is yelling at his children. He doesn't yell at his wife, he's afraid of her. In my mind, he is just as cruel as the mouth. Everything it eats - he feeds to it. I don't believe my Dad would ever do anything to protect anyone except himself, because that's all I've ever seen him do.

He thinks he is making sacrifices, but if his own children are just snacks for his precious mouth, he is only sacrificing to save himself. I suddenly realized all of this about my father, while staring at a red toy truck on the floor by the front door. Somehow, the toy filled me with dread, and I had no idea why.

Mom said it was a day we could go out, because we had prior appointments. The whole family had the same dentist, and we all had our cleaning on the same day. The three of us got into the car, and I noted they'd never gotten rid of my old booster seat. I couldn't even remember how long it was in the car for. I hadn't needed a booster seat for years.

Dad had a grim but relieved look on his face, like he'd gotten rid of something awful. Or dodged a bullet. I wondered if he had fed the mouth, as it was the only time any of us got any relief, after it had fed. It would be quiet for a day or two after it was fed.

"Ah, the Lesels. My favorite family. Where's the little one?" Doctor Bria asked.

"She's right here, growing so fast." Mom smiled a fake smile and shoved me forward gently. Doctor Bria looked at her and then at me with a very strange and concerned look, but said nothing else. Her warm and welcoming demeanor switched to a creeped-out but professional one.

While we were getting our cleaning, I looked around at all the tooth, dental hygiene and oral-themed decorations. It occurred to me that Doctor Bria might be my last hope. I asked her, with nervous tears in my eyes:

"Doctor Bria, can I ask you something?" And I guess the look on my face, the encounter in the lobby and the conspiratorial and desperate way I was whispering triggered her protective instincts. She knew something was wrong, and she was no coward. She stood and closed the door to the examination room and then leaned in close and nodded. I could see that she was listening to me, and she wasn't going to judge me.

"What is it, Sweetie?" Doctor Bria's voice reassured me I was safe to ask her for advice.

"How do you kill a mouth?" I asked. She flinched, because she had no idea what I was saying, but then she nodded, like she was internalizing something, and then she said:

"Let it dry out. That's the fastest way to ruin a good mouth." Doctor Bria instructed me. She was taking me seriously. I couldn't believe it.

"What if it is a bad mouth, an evil mouth?" I asked. Her face contorted, like she wasn't sure if she should laugh, and was again internalizing complicated thoughts. She responded in a confidential tone, treating my worries with seriousness.

"I clean bad mouths. If it's bad enough, I run a drill, and other measures. The teeth, the gums, even the throat can develop infections." Doctor Bria explained. Then something occurred to her. "I've never dealt with an evil mouth before. For that, to kill one, I'd pull the teeth."

"Pull the teeth?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"Yes, Love. If you pull the teeth, the mouth has no power. Teeth are the source of all the power a mouth has. That's why we take such good care of our teeth." Doctor Bria smiled for me, a kind and motherly smile. She thought she had resolved my fears, and in a way she had. I was starting to think that there might be a way to save my family, a way to defeat the mouth.

"How would I pull the teeth, if the mouth is very big?" I asked.

"Maybe just smash them out with a big hammer." Doctor Bria chuckled. "If you hit them out, it's the same thing, and it will hurt the evil mouth even more."

"What if the mouth cannot be approached, it is invisible, and it instantly eats whatever enters, a hammer or anything?" I asked. Doctor Bria looked quizzical, but indulgent.

"What are we talking about?" She finally asked.

"Nothing." I realized I had already said too much. "I was just wondering."

"Such an imaginative child." Doctor Bria smiled and let me out of the chair, and opened the door and led me out to the lobby where my parents were waiting.

She asked them: "Will you need another appointment for Michael?"

"Who?" Mom asked. Dad had a strange, almost guilty look in his eyes, but he shrugged it off and nudged her.

"Nothing. We don't need anything." And he got up and took me and Mom out to the car without saying goodbye.

Doctor Bria wasn't finished. She ran out after us, demanding answers, letting her professional demeanor fall away. She suddenly didn't care about polite conventions of everyday life that restrain people from doing the good that their instincts command. She ran after us as we left the parking lot, frustration in her eyes and something else.

Back at home I kept thinking about Doctor Bria and the way she had reacted. She cared about me, cared that something was very wrong. Later that afternoon she arrived at our house, quite unprofessional and unsure what she was doing. She'd felt triggered to act, and she couldn't back down, knowing instinctively that something was dreadfully wrong with our family.

I saw her creeping around outside, trying to peer through the windows, which were all drawn shut. I opened the front door for her and let her inside. Dad was in his room, hiding. That's where he spent the day, sometimes.

"Let me show you the mouth," I said quietly and nervously. I was afraid it might overpower her or she wouldn't be able to see it. But it turns out the mouth stood no chance against Doctor Bria.

I was shaking with fear as she neared the mouth, "Wait, careful." I tugged her sleeve, my eyes wide with anxiety, staring at the visible mouth where it yawned in a kind of creepy smile. Doctor Bria kept inching towards it.

**"Bottle...bottle of clear liquid..."** The mouth demanded.

"Sure thing." Doctor Bria was holding something. She tossed a small vial of clear liquid into the mouth and stepped back while it crunched the glass in its molars.

It soon began to snore. Doctor Bria started inching towards it again, and from her fanny pack she produced a surgical scalpel with a clear green handle. She pushed its blade out and it clicked in place. In her hand the tiny blade somehow looked formidable.

"It's asleep." She sighed, relieved.

"How did you know?" I asked.

"I listened to you. That's all it took." Doctor Bria said, "I knew something was wrong, and it was mouth-related, so I brought a few things."

"Now what?" I asked, worried it might wake up angry and demand a horrifying sacrifice.

"We need a sledgehammer. I'm gonna knock its teeth out." Doctor Bria sounded brave.

"You'll do no such thing." Dad was blocking the entrance to the living room.

**"Doctor...female dentist..."** The mouth spoke with a groggy voice, already resisting the drugs and starting to wake.

"No problem." Dad rushed forward and tried to shove her into the mouth, but Doctor Bria neatly stepped aside, a movement rehearsed a thousand times, tripped him and tossed him headfirst into the mouth, and she barely moved or touched him.

The mouth chomped down on Dad and bit off the upper half, chewing violently as his muffled screams gave way to crunching and gulping as it ate. The tongue flicked out and drew in his quivering lower half and ate that part too, until there was nothing but a puddle of blood where he had fallen.

Doctor Bria looked at me and held me, saying "Don't look, it's okay. I'm sorry."

"It's fine." I said blankly, as I stared without feeling anything while the mouth ate Dad. I was more curious about how she had done what she did, so I asked: "How'd you do that?"

"I'm an orange belt in Judo. It was just reflexes. Are you okay, Sweetie?" She asked me.

"Totally fine. I'm not sure what I'm going to do without you. I don't feel safe with that thing there." I said, hearing the strangeness in my response, but I was unsure why.

"You just saw your Dad get eaten, didn't you?" Doctor Bria was worried about something I wasn't. I hadn't seen any such thing, and I had no idea who she was talking about.

"Aren't we going to smash its teeth?" I asked.

"We can try." She said. She got on her phone while the mouth was saying:

**"Smartphone...handheld telephone..."**

Doctor Bria wasn't fully under its power, yet, even though she had fed it. She looked at her phone and almost fed it to the thing, the mouth's influence growing stronger, but I said:

"Don't feed it." And she heard me and snapped out of it.

"We're gonna need some muscle. I called for help." She said. We went outside and waited. Soon a man in a pickup showed up.

"I brought the jackhammer, Babe. Where's the fire?" He said, grinning at Doctor Bria.

She led him into my house, and I heard him swearing and cussing and then laughing as he fired up the jackhammer in our living room. The noise from the jackhammer was unbelievably loud, but the mouth was huge and in trouble, screaming while the man was at work. The mouth sounded very anguished and enraged, but soon its words were muffled, like it was a chubby bunny with marshmallows in its cheeks.

When things went quiet, they went very quiet. And then the man was laughing.

I laughed too, the instant the spell was broken. The man came out holding one of the enormous teeth. In the light of day, it crumbled into what looked like broken drywall. He looked disappointed that he had no proof of what he had just seen and done.

"It's gone." I said. I knew it was. I wondered where I would go, having no immediate recollection of my family.

"Where's your mother and your brother?" Doctor Bria asked me. I had no idea who she was talking about. She took me with her, and I stayed with her.

Social workers came, police were involved. My family was declared missing, and eventually, after three years, I was officially adopted by Doctor Bria and her husband (Walter, whom you met earlier with his jackhammer). I've grown to love them, and they are very good to me.

Over time I remembered all of this, but only when I was ready. As I felt more safe and secure and happy, it was safe to recall my past. Now I know how I came to be who I am, where I am.

I am home, with them, and they know all about me. They will never think I am crazy or making things up for attention. They are my family.

I can't wait until I can become a dentist.
