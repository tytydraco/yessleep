I had only just gotten out of 6th grade when my older brother Jonathan passed. I woke up for another summer day to both of my parents in the kitchen with sore, red eyes. I made myself cereal and sat down. Before I could start eating, my mom sat down next to me.

"Sweetie, I don't know how to tell you, but Jonathan died last night in a bad car accident."

To be fair, I don't remember this memory; this is just what my parents told me. After that, I was never quite the same. I couldn't focus on schoolwork at all. I lost all interest in soccer. By freshman year, I had a 2.1 GPA, and I somehow graduated with a 1.6. I guess the school was trying to graduate as many people as possible for funding. But a few months after high school, I was the same, but now with more free time. I would sleep most of the day away and wake up around 6 PM for dinner. One night, my parents sat me down for a talk.

“Listen, you know we love you, but we can’t afford to have you living here much longer. You’re going to need to find a place until you can get a job and start chipping in.”

A couple of days later, I called my grandparents to ask if I could stay at their house until I found a job. Being the nice people they are, they let me stay. Once I got over there and set things up, I started applying everywhere in my small town. Eventually, after a week, this new mom & pop shop called me in for an interview. I went in about 3 days later and met with the owner. I walked up to the store in a nice pair of slacks and a button-down. The old man behind the counter, Terry, walked around slowly and asked,

"Are you Ryan? For the interview?"

I nodded yes, and he told me to follow him. The shop smelled of disinfectant and looked relatively new. In the back, Terry asked me some questions about availability and hours. After telling him that I'm always free, it was pretty easy to get the job. He said that they couldn't find anyone to cover the graveyard shift if the store was going to be 24/7. Knowing what he was about to ask, I said I could cover the shift. He smiled and shook my hand.

"Be here tomorrow at 10 PM."

I nodded as I walked off. I got in my car and noticed that I wasn't as nervous during the interview, especially after how I acted in high school. I had trouble focusing and was a little dizzy, but my words were coming out clearer than ever. I brushed it off as good luck and drove back to my grandparents’ house. After I had gotten back, I heard my grandma talking to someone in my bedroom. I went to see what she was doing, and when I opened my door, I saw nothing. There was no one in my room, no one who could have been making those noises. 

I brushed it off as my mind just playing tricks on me, mainly so I wouldn't have to think about the implications of what I heard. I barely got any actual sleep that night, possibly because of my horrid sleep schedule or the impossible sound I had heard. Eventually, I drifted off to sleep and woke up in the early afternoon the next day. I stumbled my way to the kitchen to make myself some coffee. Surprisingly, I didn't see my grandparents. I called out for them and looked, but they were nowhere to be found. Back in the kitchen, on the counter sat a note:

"Grandpa and I went to visit your cousins in Ixon, be back Friday."

The only problem was that they left before I got off shift yesterday.

———————————————————————————

I walked in at 9:55, a little earlier than what Terry said, but,

"To be on time is to be late."

My dad always told me. The shop still smelled of disinfectant. I approached the counter, and that's where I found Melinda. Melinda was Terry's wife; she seemed to keep everything in order around here. I asked where to go for training, and she looked at me, confused.

"Honey, all I need you to do is ring customers up. There's no training."

I nodded and asked where Terry was. She pointed me to the back of the store, so I stepped back there. From the sound of things, Terry seemed to be on the phone. I quietly made my way towards him, not to interrupt. That's when I looked at him. He doesn't have a phone in his hand. He's not talking to anyone. I waved over to him, but to no avail. Eventually, after watching him talk to the air for a few minutes, I walked up to him.

"Terry? Who are you talking to?" 

He looked at me as if I had annoyed him.

“It's rude to interrupt people while they're on the phone, ya know.”

I stammered and apologized. He pointed at where the uniform was and said he was leaving for the night. I put on the employee outfit and made my way to the front.

“Don't mind him, he has a bit of undiagnosed dementia or schizophrenia or something," 

Melinda stated. I stepped back in shock.

“You never got him diagnosed? I mean, those types of things are pretty serious," 

I responded. She shrugged me off and started getting the register ready for me. Melinda showed me the basics and got in the car outside, where Terry was waiting. I waved them goodbye as I stood there, realizing that I was a lot more tired than I should be for an 8-hour shift. I told myself to power through it as I leaned on the counter by the register. After about 30 minutes, this ringing in my ears started going. It wasn't overbearing, but it sure as hell was loud. After about an hour of dealing with that, a customer walked in. I greeted them and started getting the checkout space clear. As I was cleaning away the clutter, I heard someone say,

“Are you ok?”

I jumped up and saw it was the customer with his hands full.

“What do you mean?" 

"You weren't cleaning anything. It looked like you were carrying air and moving it to the side," 

I looked down and saw an empty space, something I had been decluttering just a second ago. I excused myself and rang him up. He walked out, staring me down like I had offended him in some way. I rubbed my eyes just to try and wake myself up again, but I was awake. I was sure there was trash on the counter a moment before. As I was trying to collect myself, I got this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I looked up and out into the big window at the front of the store. Outside was a figure, across the street, just staring at the shop, or perhaps staring at me. I tried to make eye contact with them, but it was just a silhouette. As soon as I took my eyes away from them to do something else, I got that feeling in my stomach again. I took another glance at the window, and now they were pressed up against the glass. I stumbled back, paralyzed with fear, and just stared at them for what seemed like multiple lifetimes.

———————————————————————————

I woke up the next day after what had happened. I had a splitting headache and was very confused about how I ended up back home. The last thing I remembered was seeing the silhouette up against the glass, and now I was here. It was far too vivid to be some nightmare but too strange to be reality. I called up Terry, and he picked up rather quickly.

"Ryan? Where the hell did you go last night?"

I was dumbfounded. If I had left in such a manner that caused that type of reaction from Terry, where did I go? I explained to him that I myself didn't remember, and then he stopped me.

"How on earth do you not remember barging out of the back exit? You left the door unlocked, for Christ’s sake!"

I froze, and just as I was about to respond, Terry said,

"You left your car in the lot. You ran into the woods across from the store at 2 in the morning! What the hell happened?"

I was asking myself the same question. Then suddenly I heard footsteps outside my bedroom door. I abruptly hung up on Terry and was so thrown off by everything, I didn't know what was behind that door. The handle rattled before being opened, and in stepped my grandma.

"Ryan, look at you, you're a mess."

I looked down and saw dirt everywhere on my clothes. I stared back at her as if she had the answers I was looking for.

"Wash up, you have work soon."

I looked at my clock and realized I had slept in until 8 PM, and I was still in my work uniform. I told her that I wasn't feeling well and would probably have to call in sick. After a change of clothes and a warm shower, I called Terry back to let him know I wouldn't be coming in. He told me I should just take the rest of the week off, seeing as I was clearly not in the right mental state. I thanked him, hung up, and slumped down onto my bed. I tried to distract myself by scrolling on my phone, but the thoughts of what happened kept flooding my mind. Why didn't I remember anything after I saw the person? Did they knock me out somehow, and I lost my memory? But if they did knock me out, how did I run out of the back of the store? 

As I lay there pondering the possibilities, I realized I was still very tired, surprising, seeing as I had just slept for an entire day. But I gave in just to escape the reality of the situation I was in. I fell asleep rather quickly. After drifting off, I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't move. I realized I was having sleep paralysis; I tried to calm myself down, until I saw it. Outside of my bedroom window was the silhouette person, looking at me as if I had forsaken them. I almost had a panic attack as I was making eye contact with this eyeless entity. I woke up in a cold sweat and with a blistering headache. I wiped my eyes and looked around. On the floor was a broken glass lamp that wasn't in pieces before I fell asleep.

———————————————————————————

About 2 weeks after the events prior took place, I was resting at my grandparents’ place. Nothing too strange has happened, except for a few headaches and misplaced things. I think what happened was due to a mix of stress, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. I wasn't eating much, and since I had a night shift, my sleep schedule was basically nocturnal. On top of that, getting kicked out of my parents’ place didn't help much. But after all of that, I think I'm okay enough to go back to work, plus, I really need the money. When I clocked in, Melinda hugged me and said,

“Honey, I feel so bad for what happened! Are you doing better?”

I told her I was and not to worry. Terry wasn't there that night, so I got to work pretty quickly. After an hour or two of run-of-the-mill customers, I heard something in the back. It sounded like someone was throwing things around in the pantry. I jumped a bit and slowly walked back there. Stupidly, I didn't have any sort of weapon to defend myself. If the person were armed with anything, I would be screwed. When I turned the corner towards the pantry, I saw no mess, no one in the pantry, and nothing was out of place. I was frozen.

“No no no no NO!”

Why am I back here? I thought I was fine! I took the time off! What is happening? I shuffled to the register, lightly hyperventilating, and I tried to stay calm. I picked up the store phone and entered “911.” I didn't dial it; I just had it ready in case something actually happened. After half an hour of no customers, I heard that ringing in my ears again. That same ringing I got on my first shift here, the kind of ringing so loud that my hands started buzzing. I decided not to give in to the fear this time. The last time that happened, I ran into the woods at 2 in the morning. Anything that would happen for the remainder of this shift, I was going to be as calm as possible. 

I was on a pretty high horse until I looked outside the front window and saw the silhouette again. It was like when I had sleep paralysis. I was so stricken with fear that I couldn't even blink. As I was making visual contact with this thing, I noticed it was getting bigger. I focused as hard as I could on it before realizing it wasn't growing; it was moving towards me. I stumbled back into the wall behind me, knocking over some shelves filled with cigarettes. I hit the call button on the store phone with 911 pre dialed and made a run for the back door. I collided with the back exit, but it didn't budge. I pushed against it, but to no avail. I stepped back and read the note left for me by Melinda:

“Locked it for your own safety. I hope you understand.”

I read the note one more time just to seal my fate. I turned around and peeked into the front of the store. The front door was wide open. With nowhere to run to, I just waited for whatever entered the store to find me. On the floor, I saw a shadow of something behind the corner, slowly moving towards the back of the shop. My head hung on my shoulders as I looked down, not wanting to see whatever this thing was. After some minutes had passed, I noticed it had stopped moving. It was just there, standing. Still, I did not want to look at it, until it made me.

“Ryan.”

The thing spoke to me in a familiar voice, somewhere I had heard long ago. I couldn't fight it anymore. I looked up at it.

It was Jonathan.

———————————————————————————

Cops found me passed out in the back of the store no less than 5 minutes later. I’m writing this down in case my memory slips on me again, I’m not crazy, I know what I saw. This is my official statement in case they try to blame this on some mental condition. I know what I saw and they aren’t taking that away from me.
