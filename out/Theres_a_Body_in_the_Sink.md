My grandmother used to tell me to be kind to houses.

They cradled you in their bellies, kept you safe within the walls of their stomachs, let you find comfort in the intestinal tracts of their corridors. She used to talk about them like they were alive, a part of the family as much as a mother, or a sister, or a father. *“Greet them when you enter, say goodbye when you go.”*—that was the kind of respect she used to painstakingly impress on me.

My grandmother died when I was nine, so the habit never really stuck. It turned faded and blurry like most childhood lessons tended to, eroded by time to make room for the bare-minimum habits and reckless coping mechanisms of adulthood. It didn’t help that I had no love for my childhood home either; it was a rickety old house that held too many unpleasant memories, and all I ever wanted to do was run away from it.

I did, eventually. But that’s not the story—the story is the house I landed in after leaving. It’s a long story, and a terrible one, but I think I did alright putting everything down.

Here is a house, here is a sink, here is the water:

\-

Let’s start with another memory: my mother used to tell me I was a born runner.

Long-limbed and lean, I seemed to be born for movement, born for putting distance between myself and whatever current designated starting point. In my elementary and high school years, I put that affinity toward track and field; in my college years, toward avoiding people who asked too many questions about the nasty scar that ran up the length of my right forearm; post-graduation, toward changing my number, packing all twenty-three years of my life into two suitcases, and getting on a bus headed north.

I had no particular destination in mind—just *north,* and *far,* and *away from home.* It was an aimless sort of restlessness, a blind desire to just leave the house and go somewhere. I rode the bus to its last stop and wandered until I found a motel, then spent the night going through travel brochures and ticketing websites. In the morning, I hailed a cab to take me to the pier and bought a ticket for Manila.

Manila was miles and cultures and dialects away from Cebu. The accent there was softer, the traffic thicker, and the skyscrapers more intimidating. It was a hotbed for young graduates looking for career opportunities. If anybody who knew me found out I’d sailed there right after graduation, they would have called me eager, daring, ambitious.

Selfish, too, maybe, for not speaking to my mother before I left. She didn’t even know I was leaving.

\-

It took two nights of sleeping off travel fatigue before I felt enough like a person to decide what to do. First order of business was to find myself a job. I had enough savings to tide me over for a few months, but a childhood plagued with sickness and death in my family taught me never to test my luck on how quickly resources could run out. I applied for everything I was qualified for and some things I wasn’t, and snagged a post as a cashier at a local minimart.

It was mind-numbing work, but nothing I wasn’t used to. I spent my childhood summers selling delicacies to tourists and my teenage summers stocking shelves at a shoe store. The push and pull of a 9-5 was a familiar dance; the monotony that came with it was part of the package.

Second order of business was a roof over my head. Hotels were expensive and I had no interest in living in a motel. I combed through online ads and newspaper listings, took note of posters and tarps marking properties available for rent.

Three weeks into working at the minimart, my manager Leslie pointed me to Bonifacio Grove.

“It’s an ancestral home.” She held her phone up to my face. On screen was a photo of a Spanish era estate: two stories, graying white walls, a faded red roof, and a large lawn-slash-driveway. “Belongs to the Villafloreses. They’re moving elsewhere, so they’re renting the place out. You could try there.”

I’d grown up seeing heritage estates around town—they were scattered all over the archipelago and Cebu had its fair share; most of the time, they were cared for by the government, but a few had private caretakers. The upkeep for one was costly.

“I can’t afford a heritage estate,” I said.

“It’s not \*heritage—\*not with a capital H that’s gonna get the government on your ass, anyway. It’s just one of those heirloom houses. My aunt’s husband’s family has one of those; old thing dates back a decade or so before the Americans jacked our shit. He loves talking about it during family reunions, annoying bastard.” Leslie huffed. “Point is, the Villafloreses got the interior of theirs renovated so they could rent it out by unit. Doing it for dead cheap too.”

That made me eye her skeptically. “Dead cheap?”

“Dead cheap.” She nodded. “I’ve got Mrs. Villaflores’ number if you wanna call.”

I tapped the screen and zoomed into the photo, then dragged the image around to scrutinize the house. The place looked…old, but compared to the more dilapidated ancestral homes I’d seen, it wasn’t too bad.

I fished my phone out my jeans and handed it to her. “Alright.”

\-

When I called her, Mrs. Villaflores told me six out of the seven units available had already been snatched up, so I wouldn’t have much of a choice on which apartment I was getting. I told her that was fine since all I needed was a place to stay. She invited me for a tour around the estate on the weekend.

The front lawn was a generous two hundred square meters of dying grass. There was a grotto at the back with a rain-eroded lump of rock that used to be a statue of the Virgin Mary. The right side of the property had a sad, dust-caked garden of santans and gumamelas.

The estate looked even more stripped of color than it had been on Leslie’s phone.

“It rains a lot here.” Mrs. Villaflores glanced at the overcast sky above us. “So all the paint fades so quickly. The inside looks better, I promise.”

It was more than what I expected for a monthly rent of five thousand pesos—*dead cheap* indeed, especially for its location—so I signed the lease and moved in that afternoon. I tucked my two suitcases into a corner since I didn’t have any furniture yet, and laid out, on the floor, a mattress I’d hastily bought at the mall earlier. I made myself dinner and said hi to two of the tenants I bumped into in the shared kitchen downstairs—Elise, who lived across from me, and Sam, who had one of the three units on the first floor—before I called it a night.

Like Mrs. Villaflores said, the house’s interior did look better. There were no water stains on the freshly-renovated ceiling; it looked nothing like the rain-damaged one of my childhood room. When I rolled on my side to count some other imperfection out, I was met with the same showroom-picturesque quality. My floorboards gleamed a rich, liquor brown, my walls were a shiny, varnished mahogany. Everything from the light switches to the door hinges worked. I got myself a great home for a great price, perfect for the fresh start I craved.

I didn’t sleep until three in the morning, when my exhaustion finally overtook my anxiety of being somewhere new, somewhere my body wasn’t quite used to existing in.

\-

I met the rest of the tenants over the course of my first week in the house. Dominic from next door had a whole shelf full of vinyl records. Charles and Leo were coworkers; IT guys at a nearby call center. Anika hosted her prayer group’s Bible study every Thursday afternoon.

They had a rotating schedule of chores that Elise penned me into: I got Tuesday evenings on dish duty with Anika, and Sunday morning garden duty with Leo. During evenings scraping foodstuff off plates and rinsing soapy mugs, Anika told me about her childhood of bouncing from church to church until her father met her stepmom at a little congregation downtown. On a Sunday spent watering the sad little garden, Leo told me about the time he got caught in a shootout while walking home from school, and showed me a nasty starburst scar on his calf.

“I’m from Cebu too, actually.” The guy grinned as he rolled the hem of his jeans down. “Grew up in a claustrophobic neighborhood that had a decades-running gang feud. Had a lot of accidents.” He tapped his calf. “Saw a lot of shit.”

“I grew up down south,” I said. It was always nice to meet someone from my region of the archipelago. “It was…it wasn’t as cramped as the heart of the island, so we had about the same amount of shit but way less claustrophobia.”

“Lots of room to breathe instead of all the houses piled over each other?”

I made a so-and-so motion with my hand. My neighborhood had still been crowded, since I lived in the impoverished part of town, but it was always a three-minute walk to any open field that would stretch on for miles and miles. Sometimes, when my parents’ screaming matches got too much, I’d climb down my bedroom window, pick a direction, and just *run.* Until my legs burned, until my breath shallowed, until my hair stuck to my face from sweat. As long as I could slip out of the house, there was always ground to escape to, always a sea of tall grass to disappear in.

I told Leo as much.

“Must be nice.” He picked up a pebble and tossed it into the garden; it disappeared behind a graying santan bush. “All that crisp wind and bright sunshine. This place looks so fucking bleak.”

He motioned to the sky, heavy with clouds, then to the mist wrapped around the edges of the property, hiding the rest of the city from view. Manila was hot and searing, but the cold never seemed to leave this place; the rain tapped a heartbeat on our porch in the evening, and the mist ambled into town in the morning.

I could never see the sun from Bonifacio Grove.

\-

Three months into my stay at the house, Charles and Dominic found the sink backed up with inch-deep black water. Since Anika and I were on dish duty the day prior, they approached us about it.

“It was clean when we left it.” Anika shrugged. “Maybe there’s something wrong with the pipes.”

I peered at the water pooled at the bottom of the basin. It was so dark it mirrored my silhouette back at me—and only that; with the light bulb right behind my head, my face was in shadow. I couldn’t see myself, just the outline of my body.

I leaned closer. Dark as the sewage was, it didn’t smell.

“Well, it’s not *our* fault,” Dominic snapped—the whipcrack of his voice cut through the otherwise placid mood of the house. The kitchen quieted, the others minding their business elsewhere in the building hushed. It was almost eerie, the synchronicity of everyone pausing like spooked animals in the presence of danger. The last place I’d seen this kind of freeze response was back home, where my mother and I would hold still every time we felt the building storm of my father’s anger. It never helped, of course, but some long-buried instinct evolutionary rungs in the past stirred whenever my father’s voice rose a little too high, barked a little too sharp.

“It’s not anybody’s fault.” Sam stepped between Anika and Dominic with a placating smile. He set a hand on Dominic’s shoulder and gently nudged him back. “Let’s calm down.”

Dominic shoved Sam away with a sneer. I instinctually braced—years of learning rage hurt less when I tensed made the habit hard to shake off—but that was thankfully as far as Dominic’s fury went. He stomped off into the living room, grumbling curses under his breath.

In my periphery, something rippled through the sink water.

Startled, I turned—but the dark pool was still. Strangely, my reflection looked unnaturally stationary. Not even the flyaway hairs of my bedhead swayed from the soft breeze of the ceiling fan.

Something skittered unpleasantly in my gut.

\-

Mrs. Villaflores was several cities away at her new residence, but she called a plumber for us. He—Mr. Quijano—arrived with a rusty toolbox that looked like it had one handle in the scrap yard and the other desperately clinging to useability. He tutted as he looked at the sink.

“Old houses like these always have their ailments,” he said as he rolled up his sleeves. “Too many things unaddressed and left to fester.”

He prodded around the drain and found nothing clogging it. With another tut, he opened the sink cabinet and slid inside, on his back. The darkness greedily swallowed his torso; it was strangely pitch black in there—or maybe it was just the harsh shadow cast by the kitchen’s white, fluorescent bulb. The brightness of it bleached the room of color, made it look sterile and sickly the way barren hospital hallways do.

I had work in two hours, so I left the others to keep an eye on the repair. It wasn’t like I could do anything other than stand and watch anyway. I quietly ducked out of the house and got breakfast at the bakery near the bus stop. My ride arrived ten minutes later; I found a seat and closed my eyes as the vehicle groaned forward into the morning mist.

Shadows waltzed and swayed behind my eyelids. Something danced in the dark. In the space between wakefulness and slumber, I heard my mother’s voice say: *“You can’t keep doing this forever.”*

I hadn’t called her since I moved here. I didn’t hate her or anything, it was just a complicated situation, where I couldn’t stand being stuck in a house that reminded me of awful things, and she couldn’t stand looking at a boy who was the spitting image of her husband. It was better for both of us if I kept running forever.

And I could. I was born for it, all long-limbed and lean.

\-

When I returned, the sink was fixed. Sam and Elise were rinsing and drying plates, and laughing about a fistfight they saw somewhere in town. Dominic was dozing off in the living room while the TV played the evening news. Charles and Leo were sharing a Red Horse bottle on the back porch. Anika was curled up by the landline and murmuring into the phone: “It’s just a test—for He knows the plans He has for us, remember? Plans to prosper us and not to harm us…”

I had already gotten dinner outside, so I skipped the kitchen and headed straight up to my room. It was still relatively early in the evening, but I had nothing else to do and no one to waste the time away with. Best to just rest. All I’d done since getting to Manila was sleep, but somehow, the fatigue never faded. The lethargy seemed steeped into my bones. Maybe it was the inherent hell of working customer service. Maybe I was sick. Maybe it was something else.

Voices, from downstairs.

I woke—not remembering exactly when I’d fallen asleep—ambled to my desk, and hunted for my phone to check the time. 3:33 A.M. Jesus. What the hell were my housemates doing? It was difficult to make out what they were screaming about. From the wall of noise and shrieking, I could only hear:

*“—did something wrong, because it’s backed up again!”*

*“I told you, we didn’t—”*

For a moment, I was seven years old, lying supine under my bed with my headphones blasting at full volume. Foam did wonders for noise cancellation, I’d learned at school that day, that was why I’d crawled under there. The music was just an extra measure, in case my father’s voice still invaded the fortress of my bed.

It did. *“You stupid bitch!”* still cut through the whine of electric guitars and the cavernous thumping of drums. *“Watch your fucking mouth,”* still seared through layers of pleather and magnet and plastic. I fumbled for my phone to crank the volume higher, but it was already the loudest it could go. Something shattered. My mother cried out.

*“Jesus, Dominic, stop it!”*

That jolted me back to the present. I was twenty-three years old. I was in Bonifacio Grove. My father had been dead for two years.

I headed downstairs and found the others in the kitchen. Sam stood between Dominic and Anika again, arms outstretched to keep them away from each other. Elise cowered in a corner, face pale, shoulders drawn up, eyes wide and glued to the floor. Charles and Leo each had an arm hooked under Dominic’s elbows to keep him from lunging.

“What’s going on?” I asked. What the hell had I missed while I was asleep?

All six of them turned. Dominic shoved Charles back, then Leo, freeing his arms. He swung a hand toward the sink. “It’s backed up again, and now we gotta call the fucking plumber.”

I waited for him to elaborate further—surely that couldn’t be the cause for this commotion—but he didn’t say anything else. Was that all? All that screaming for a backed-up sink?

Sam offered Dominic a smile, the kind that reminded me of my mother’s whenever she tried to soothe my irate father. The curves of his lips were less suppressed panic, and more resigned calm, as if he’d long surrendered himself to the role of peacemaker. The familiarity was nauseating.

“Look,” he said, voice soft, fawning. “This is a fixable problem. Nothing to get violent about.”

Dominic jabbed a finger at his chest. “Don’t get condescending with me like I’m a kid.”

“I’m not.”

“Fuck you.”

Dominic’s lips peeled back to bare his teeth. He grunted out an irritated, disgusted noise, but once again, thankfully broke away from the group. Seconds later, the back door slammed shut.

Everyone in the kitchen deflated. Elise hid her face in her hands and shook with the quiet terror of someone who’d lived with violence all her life. I shot her a sympathetic look—I’d never been the type to ask people about where they’d been and what they’d been through, so even with the months we’d known each other I knew nothing about her save for that she worked as a kindergarten teacher and liked spicy things. But I got that fear. I’d been there. I’d just gotten better at hiding the tremors it reduced me to.

Charles glared at the direction Dominic had disappeared in. “What the hell is his problem?”

“Maybe he had a bad day at work,” Sam said. Charles met the theory with a scoff.

The excuse was another thing that was nauseatingly familiar. The more things changed, the more they stayed the same, I supposed—I’d moved islands away, was in a completely different province, but here was a mainstay of my past haunting my present. My mother had a habit of plucking rationales from the holes her husband’s fist left in the walls, the many shattered ceramics in the trash bin. *Oh, he’s had a tiring day; oh, he got into an argument at work.* After she finally exhausted her roster of reasons for why my father did the things he did, she told me I was too young to understand the things that plagued him.

When I was twenty-one, my father died without offering explanations; without saying what haunted him, what ghosts made him leave welts on his wife’s face, what rage troubled him so terribly he fractured my arm and made the bone rip through skin.

\-

“Sounds like an asshole,” Leslie said the next day, after I told her why I was short two hours of sleep and looked dead on my feet. “Maybe you can tell your landlady about it and get him kicked out.”

I’d never been one for confrontation. I preferred to put my energy into weaving past crowds and ducking into abandoned hallways whenever things got too heated for my taste. I shook my head and took a bite out of my siomai. “I don’t want to get involved in it.”

It was lunch time at the minimart, so I and my coworkers were in the break room with our food. Our stocker Henry had brought a Tupperware of siomai for everyone to share. My fellow cashier Yui had brought a pack of dried mangoes for our dessert. I had braved the midday heat outside and bought everyone trays of tempura.

“He might keep picking fights with people,” Leslie said.

I speared another cube of siomai with my fork. “And if Mrs. Villaflores doesn’t kick him out, he’ll pick fights with *me.”*

“Kick his ass, then,” Henry grunted.

I snorted. Easy for the kid to say—he looked like he belonged in a sports arena rather than a minimart, nearly seven feet tall and jacked with muscle. But he was a nerd who liked collecting antiques, and was struggling through college bills, so he was here working part time instead of putting up numbers at a court.

“I’d rather not get hit back, thank you,” I said. “Besides, maybe he’ll get sick of the sink breaking. Or the weather. Bonifacio Grove’s not exactly as sunny as the rest of Manila is.”

Outside, the day beamed bright on the boiling asphalt. It was scorching enough that the air shimmered and waved off the sidewalk. People dashed under neon-painted awnings to flee the noontime sun. This part of the city was loud and bustling and vibrant and *hot.*

“It’s quiet, though,” Yui said from the other end of the table. “And you’re less likely to die from heatstroke.”

“I guess…” I shrugged. “It’s just…”

The others waited for me to finish the thought. I chewed on another bite of my food before I continued.

“Sad,” I said. “It looks all sad and gray. All the rain flushes out whatever new paint gets put on the house.”

“Bonifacio Grove is old,” Henry said. “Old places don’t take well to new things.”

Leslie scoffed. “It’s just a house.”

“It’s seen too much, is too lived in.” Henry set his empty lunch box down and snapped the lid back on. He snatched a strip of dried mango from the opened pack at the center of the table. “If a place stands long enough and swallows too much misery, it wakes.”

My grandmother’s words buoyed to the forefront of my mind. At this point, it’d been a while since I’d last thought of them. To me, houses were houses, just buildings to sleep in or run from; structures that would collapse if met with enough brutality.

“I did a paper on Bonifacio Grove for my senior year. You know there used to be a chapel there?” Henry continued. “During the Spanish era, it wasn’t just one property. The house belonged to a nobleman, but the plot where the garden currently is used to have a chapel.”

I lowered my fork, the rich taste of my food now soured. Religion was the Spaniards’ favored weapon when they colonized the country. With churches and chapels came beaten children, murdered men, and abused women.

“A kid stole a loaf of bread from the chapel and the friars sicced the soldiers on him.” Henry tapped his index finger on the edge of his lunch box lid, then dragged it to the other end. “They chased him all the way to the river behind the woods and beat him so bad that when his brother found his body, he didn’t recognize him at first. His face had been ground off his skull.”

*“Jesus,”* I breathed.

“It burnt down four centuries later and was never rebuilt,” he continued. “When the Americans came, they took the house over and used it as a base. One of the generals had an affair with the nearby baker’s daughter; his wife murdered her when she came to the house to deliver bread. Cut her to pieces and fed her to her husband.”

“Was she a War Bride?” Leslie asked. “The wife, I mean.”

“I think she was. It was around the 40’s, and I couldn’t find anything about whether she came to the country with her husband.” Henry paused, then waved a hand as if to brush the thought aside. “Anyway, they lost the base during the Japanese era, and it got turned into a comfort station.” Another pause. He sighed through his nose and swallowed. “Thirteen of the women tried to escape in the middle of the night, but they were discovered, so they ran to the river and drowned themselves.”

The break room fell silent. I tucked my utensils back into their container and closed my half-empty lunch box. Leslie grimaced.

“Another dreary building with a fucked-up history,” Yui said. “Just like most of the old places in this miserable country. What else is new?”

I leaned back in my chair and craned my head back to stare at the ceiling. She was right. Bonifacio Grove’s history was sad, but it wasn’t particularly unique. My hometown’s streets and roads were paved by the Spaniards after they stole the land. Plenty of schools were built by American missionaries so they could slowly wipe away the local culture. The CNU campus was used by the Japanese as a POW camp. There wasn’t an inch of this country that hadn’t been force-fed suffering and made to choke down bloodshed. Most of its heritage sites were monuments to the pain it endured, and I couldn’t tell if it was a warrior proudly showing battle scars or a wounded child boasting about abuse because it had known nothing else. Agony was the state of the world, violation was the status quo; *aren’t I so good that I can take so much of it?*

“If everything around here is just wretched,” Leslie said. “Why’s Bonifacio Grove *old* and resistant to change or whatever?”

Henry tapped a beat on his lunch box, expression thoughtful. “Maybe most of the archipelago is content to slumber the pain away,” he said. “But that house is awake enough to drown in its grief.”

\-

Weeks later, the sink was clogged again. There was two inches of water in the basin this time. Dominic was luckily out of the house—hanging out with his coworkers and wouldn’t be home until later—so nobody was yelling about the flooded sink. Anika and I washed the dishes under the garden tap while the others waited for Mr. Quijano drop by. He arrived in an hour and fixed the issue in less. Everyone went to bed without a fuss. It was sad, in a way, how much more peaceful and reasonable the house was with one less member.

I crawled onto my bed and passed out within a minute.

The sticky sweet smell of street food reached me first, then the rhythmic sound of thumping feet. Warm sunlight hit my face—the brightness turned the back of my eyelids into a curtain for dancing shadows to flit and hop about. I lifted a hand to shield myself from the light and opened my eyes.

There was a glade just a few meters away from me, lush with green grass and washed with amber lighting under the golden hour. In it, wooden food stalls stood in rows, displaying all manner of trinkets. Children darted around to inspect the wares available, while their parents trailed after them with calls to be careful.

It was nostalgic sight. I used to spend my vacation days at summer festivals, and wasted whatever change I collected in my piggy bank at my town’s patron saint celebrations. A laugh bubbled up my throat—suddenly, I was a child again, buzzing with excitement, eager to join the crowd.

I fell in line with the other children perusing the stalls; they ‘ooh’ed and ‘ahh’ed over binka and gulaman, and dutifully inspected the wooden charms meant to bring good luck. A stick of cotton candy made its way into my grasp despite me having no memory of buying it. A bracelet with a bright red cord and a wooden sparrow got wrapped around my left wrist despite me having no recollection of putting it on.

Eventually my legs tired, so I scurried to the edge of the clearing to eat my cotton candy in peace. Laughter and music floated around me, mingling into the pleasant cacophony of community I’d grown up with in countryside Cebu. A man’s voice soared over the din as he broke into the first notes of a drinking song. Cheers erupted. White and gray fabric curved through the air as a woman started dancing; my attention snagged on the flutter of her shawl.

She pivoted and lifted her head. The movement bared her face to me—her eyes had been carved out.

I flinched.

The woman towered over the rest of the crowd. Her skin was corpse-pale, and the left side of her chest had been gored open, exposing her maggot-infested heart to the air. Seven rusty swords pierced through it, and with every *thump, thump, thump* of the organ, black blood sluggishly oozed from her wounds. There was a tarnished metal halo behind her head.

The decaying eyeless figure of the Virgin Mary swayed and bent to the beat of the music around her. She stepped forward and pivoted once more, then lifted a hand to slowly point at me—no, not at me; her hand continued rising until her arm extended straight out. She was pointing somewhere over my shoulder.

I turned.

Darkness. Silence.

The noise of the festival was gone. Pitch darkness walled me in—there was no dim lighting so my eyes could make shapes out from my surroundings, no stimulus to drum up pareidolia, just a foot of brightness illuminating the space in front of me, and beyond that, solid opaque black.

I froze; held my breath. Prey animal playing statue in fear that there was something I couldn’t see about to attack.

Then—

*Tap.*

*Tap-tap.*

Muffled footsteps, in the distance. Clumsy. Off-beat.

I stepped back. In front of me, the off-rhythm footsteps crept closer, closer, closer.

The tips of two dusty boots slipped into the circle of light I stood in. The leather looked cracked and speckled with dark stains—blood; old, coagulated blood.

“Lookie what we have here,” the darkness said. I couldn’t see anything other than the tips of those boots. “Some coward *dog RUNT!”*

I jumped as the voice’s slimy, amused tone swiftly climbed to a bark. Two points of light blinked into existence in the darkness; they stared straight at me.

“Crossed a sea to run away from your father’s ghost, mutt? You trying to find something other than misery in that rotting home of yours? Trying to find something that makes you feel alive?”

The barrel of a rifle emerged from the shadows, rising in an arc as two white hands pointed it at me. Grime crusted on the length of the metal. More old blood speckled the half-shadowed figure’s pale fingers.

I stumbled back, heart beating wild with fear, but there was only so much lit area behind me. My feet ended up right by the edge of the circle of light, and when my ankles dipped into the darkness, bony fingers snatched them in a painful grip. I kicked in surprise—or tried to, because the hands yanked my feet back, and I ended up smashing my chin into the dirt. Pain blazed up my jaw. *Shit.*

“I know a thing or two about sparking life into one’s bones,” the figure in the dark continued.

I looked up. The twin lights ahead of me blazed brighter as the rifle angled down toward my face.

“I feel it every time I aim my gun at something like you” — something clicked; the safety, *it was the rifle’s safety!* I had to move — “and \*pull—my—\****TRIGGER!”***

I—

\-

—jolted awake covered in sweat, blinding pain between my eyes. Spots of bright light assaulted my vision and rendered me blind. I scrambled out of bed, and put my hands out to feel the floor, the walls, anything to guide me to the bathroom. The back of my right hand hit a doorknob—I wrenched it open and stumbled inside.

Pressure bore down on the bridge of my nose. My saliva soured and burned the inside of my cheeks, the telltale precursor to being sick. I hurriedly groped around for the edge of the sink; when I found it, I clumsily hunched over and vomited.

It hurt. My head *hurt.*

*“What the fuck is happening?”* Charles cried out from downstairs.

I blearily looked up. Was something happening with my housemates again? God. I turned the tap on to flush out the mess I’d made and splashed water on my face. The cold made me flinch, shocked me to attention. I finished cleaning the sink, then headed downstairs.

Shouting reached me before I even made it to the bottom of the stairwell. Smashed plates littered the hallway, marking a breadcrumb trail toward the crowded kitchen. I followed it right into another fight.

“I thought you said Mr. Quijano fixed it?” Dominic yelled at Sam’s face.

The sink again? Jesus, what an awful time for it to break. The sun wasn’t even up yet, and there was already yelling over something we could easily solve in the morning. My jaw worked in uncharacteristic annoyance, but I kept away from the one-sided screaming match as I went to check the problem for myself. With how Dominic had woken everyone up, the sink had better be flooded to the brim instead of being backed with only a measly inch of water.

Predictably, it *was* just an inch of water in there. I held back a scoff—no need to draw attention to myself and get an earful of Dominic’s tempter tantrum—and made to head back upstairs.

Except, in the corner of my eye, the sewage suddenly churned alive.

I turned back in alarm. My housemates’ yelling pitched high into panicked screams. Dark water bubbled up the drain, gurgling to the lip of the basin so violently fast that the pool seemed to *boil.*

Then—it stopped. The sink filled to the very brim, and the water calmed immediately. No ripples. No waves. Just a perfect sheet of darkness.

The kitchen quieted. Nobody moved.

A mound of dark hair floated up from the depths of the pool. It breached the surface of the water, and clumped into wet, tangled strands as the head it belonged to peered out of the flooded sink. The spaces where the hair parted revealed rotting, infected skin, covered in maggot-infested wounds and pus-weeping holes. From the mess, two swollen, decaying eyes blinked open and stared at me.

I’d seen this mangled face before. Some years ago, a particularly bad storm hit my town by surprise. It came in the middle of the night, forecasted as light rain but descending as torrential sheets and roof-ripping winds. The resulting flood swallowed my entire neighborhood in a tide of muddy brown water. Houses washed away. Pets washed away. People washed away. My house had two floors, so I was lucky enough to have someplace to climb when the water started to rise; the buffer against myself and the flood meant I was able to climb onto the roof for safety instead of getting swept away like everything else. My little sister, only fifteen, wasn’t so lucky—she was having a sleepover at her friend’s that night, and that house got taken away by the mud and the rain.

It took a week for the water to recede. Two for the rescuers to make it through fallen powerlines and trees, and reach us. They never found my sister’s friend or the girl’s family, or even their house. My mother and I had been prepared to never find my sister’s body, but I still hoped they would, somehow, if only for closure. They did. They found her in front of the local shrine for the Virgin Mary, lying face down, covered in wounds she must have sustained from the house collapsing, and rotting away under maggot teeth.

I managed to snag a look at her before people ushered me away.

Face to face with her again, years after we’d buried her, I screamed.
