Part one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8avy9/my_husband_had_an_accident_nothing_has_been_the/).

I made a post about a while ago about my husband. I have been trying to mind my own business. I had never violated Terry's privacy before that night, or since. I still don't know what to think about what I saw in that barn. We have talked for the first time in months. Maybe being away from me on Thanksgiving finally gave him a wake up call, because he called me. When we met he didn't mention the night I had followed him, so I started to suspect he didn't know it had happened. I wasn't going to be the one to bring it up.

I was just happy to have him home, even if it only lasted an hour, and we barely talked. When he left, I checked to see if he had disabled location sharing on his phone. He hadn't. I considered snooping, but managed to restrain myself. I tried to focus on Christmas shopping online, but the urge to pry into my husband's recent activities overwhelmed me. He had been visiting that strange barn at the edge of town a lot lately. I had flashbacks of that night. The strangers surrounding my lover, with those candles at their feet, speaking those strange words.

I tried to push it out of my mind. Eventually I managed to focus on my work, and tried to return to normal. I was well on my way to that, even though I have started drinking at night to help me sleep and if I'm honest, cope with the loneliness I have felt over the last few months. I want my husband back, but I don't know how to go about achieving that goal. I called him the other day, but the conversation was brief. One positive is that we were cordial. He's actually starting to act more like himself again.

Maybe all of this is his way of processing his time in the coma. I planned to ask him about that the next time we met up, and I finally worked up the nerve to call him for the second time in a week. I arranged for us to meet on Sunday. The next couple of days seemed to crawl, and grow progressively more lonely as I eagerly anticipated my opportunity to get some answers. Sunday arrived, and I was chipper as I made a pot of coffee and even a small breakfast for myself. I didn't realize how hungry I was, devouring the waffles quickly.

I ventured into the bathroom, and quickly noticed that I had also been neglecting my appearance. I shaved and hurried out of the apartment, driving myself downtown to get a haircut as well. I went and visited my mother, who has been supporting me, though I didn't tell her about the strange ritual in the barn. We talked for a long time, and she echoed a sentiment that I recalled from a comment on my original post. It was time to get my husband back, though I didn't know exactly how to go about it. I went home and got ready to meet Terry, changing my clothes.

I called my husband to confirm that he still wanted to see me, and he said he did, and even suggested a restaurant that we frequented in the early days of our relationship. That gave me hope, and I was actually smiling when I got into the car, already planning on things to say. My spirits died when I saw Terry waiting for me at the doors to the building with an official looking envelope.

“Don't open this until we get inside, please?” he said, and I felt my face fall into a frown.

“What's going on, Terrance?” I asked, but he didn't answer.

He simply turned and walked inside the building, and I followed. We were seated quickly, which I found odd, and the server seemed to linger at our table even though we had already ordered our drinks. Eventually the young man walked away, and my husband looked at me with a semi-glazed look in his eyes. I opened the envelope. When I saw the header of the papers, my heart stopped.

“Divorce?” the word felt heavy and my lips and tongue felt numb as I spoke it.

“Yes.” he replied with no emotion, though the question had been rhetorical.

I shook my head and tucked the papers away before the young man brought my soda and his water. Anger and sadness were at war inside me. I wanted to confront him about how much he had changed since the car accident. Instead, I broke down in tears. I stood and excused myself. I didn't feel stable enough to drive home, so I called my mother who was more than happy to come and pick me up.

“It went that badly, huh?” she asked me, trying to be sympathetic.

“He wants a divorce.” I explained.

“Oh honey. I'm so sorry.” she said, reaching over to pat the back of my hand before returning her grip to the wheel.

I didn't reply, simply stared out of the window until we arrived at my home. When I got inside, I placed the paperwork on the dining room table, sitting down to start reading through the packet. His reason for the divorce was irreconcilable differences, but had offered no explanation in the space provided. For a moment I wondered if he had somehow changed his sexuality after awakening from the coma. I gave myself a few days to process things, and called him last Wednesday. Once again he was cordial with me, almost as if he weren't breaking my heart.

It was that night that I decided I would do something drastic. If he went out to that barn, I would go there as well, and confront him. I checked his location obsessively that night, but he stayed in town. It was Friday before he visited the barn, but true to my silent promise, I got dressed in all black clothing and drove out of town. I parked on the side of the narrow dirt road again, glancing around as I pulled the hood over my head, the chill immediately biting my ears. My breath hung in the air as I crept forward.

I looked around, but again saw nobody outside the building. I could again see the flickering light. I hurried toward the barn, feeling emboldened suddenly. I was going to get my answers at the very least. I didn't care what any of the strangers said. Those thoughts died in my brain when I tried to open the door I had peeked through before. It was shut, and there was no give to it at all. That meant that someone had known about my visit after all. I could hear Terry's voice through the wall, once again leading that foreign chant.

I looked around again, feeling as if I were being watched. I saw no one as I looked over by the minivan and other car parked in the small lot again, but the feeling persisted. I stepped away from the door and started around toward the front of the building. I heard a scrabbling sound from the roof of the barn, which caused my head to jerk in that direction. The first thing I noticed were a paiir of glowing deep purple eyes in the darkness above my head. I couldn't make out the form of the thing initially, as it kind of blended into the gloom around it.

It moved, and I took it in. The thing was bipedal, but I would not call it humanoid. It was like a twisted, undulating mass of darkness except for the eyes. A cry rose from my throat before I could slam my mouth closed, and the thing on the roof reacted, leaping toward me. I started running before it landed on the ground, and didn't look back until I reached my car. It hadn't chased me. I sat behind the wheel and waited to see the thing coming at me. I didn't. I also didn't leave as I was planning to do as I sprinted down the dirt road.

Instead, I turned the key and drove toward the barn, turning my headlights on, hitting the lever that turned on the brighter bulbs. I rounded the corner, but there was nothing there but the barn. I wondered if I had imagined the thing, but the fact that the area was vacant also galvanized me. I accelerated until I got closer to the barn, the palm of my hand pressing into the horn, laying on it. The prolonged beeping sound seemed to down out everything, and when I braked, I shifted the car into park, and my foot pressed the accelerator to the floor. The impromptu plan to disrupt whatever they were doing worked.

The barn doors opened and there was a group of angry people illuminate by the lights on the car. One of them, the woman who had been at my apartment began to grin. She stepped forward and raised her left arm, two fingers of that hand directed at my car. There was a thud on the roof and I heard a low rumbling noise above me. The sound seemed to resonate in my very core, turning my guts and spine into jelly in an instant. I slammed the car into reverse and pressed the gas again. The wheels spun for a half a second before it started moving backward.

The thing on the roof hung on somehow and I started to panic, I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could. That threw the thing in front of my car, and I got a good look at it for the first time. Its flesh was as dark as I had thought, and pulsing with odd cyst-like knobs that seemed to have minds of their own. The worst part was that twisted face, no nose or ears, just knobby a knobby mass with a split that revealed rotted looking, sharp teeth. I screamed again, and started to reverse again. I turned my car around as the creature rushed toward me.

I glanced in the rearview mirror as I rounded the corner and punched the gas pedal again, the thing with the glowing eyes gaining ground on me even as I sped up. It stopped when I reached the main road, and I breathed a sigh of relief even though I was still terrified. I drove the rest of the way home, and tried to reason through the night's events. I have spent the past five days or so going down internet rabbit holes, trying to figure out what the thing I saw was, but have had no luck. Another recurring question I have is this.

What happened to my husband while he was comatose, and who are these strangers he is meeting with? I don't know about going back to the barn, with that beast guarding them. I signed the divorce papers, and am going to call my soon to be ex-husband. Maybe I will confront him on the phone.

I will update again soon.
