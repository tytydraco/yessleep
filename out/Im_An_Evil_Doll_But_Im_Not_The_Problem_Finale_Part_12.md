You guys like the 50s?

“No, not going to happen. This isn’t your usual crazy, it’s just stupid.”, Leo asserts. 

“It isn’t. 

There’s a handful of old slugs and knife tips in me. This place fixed everything about my body, besides that. Why would that be? It’s because it can’t.”, Mike explains. 

“The reason your cutman left them in would only be because removing them would have been more risky. 

Maybe you’re right and maybe you’re wrong about the shrapnel you caught being from somewhere else. The fact remains taking it out, in a dusty old place like this, not a bright idea.”, Ashton adds. 

I don’t want to encourage this, but all I can find to say is, “This place used to belong to a kind of doctor, it has…rooms for this type of thing.”

“For Christ’s sake Punch.”, Sveta says. 

“I’m just saying, if Mike really needs to do this, let’s not do it on a table covered in rat crap.”, is my reply. 

“Probably have something to put you under at least.”, Ashton postulates. 

“No can do on that. Light sedation at best, preferably on the rocks. I need to be mobile after this is over.”, Mike says. 

“That’s a good way to stroke out, kid. And no booze. Judging by your skintone, you can’t afford to lose much more blood.”, Ashton answers. 

“Does that mean you’ll do it?”, Mike asks. 

There’s a pause, I didn’t know a place with this many people in it could be so silent. 

“ If I say no, what then?”, Ashton replies. 

“Guess I’d have to go in myself.”, Mike answers. 

Ashton laughs, shaking his head. 

“You sure you aren’t a Hero? You got a real stubborn streak in you.”, the old man jokes. 

“There are other ways Mike. Don’t be an idiot.”, Sveta pleads. 

Mike shrugs. 

“And if they don’t work?

I don’t understand half of the game of universal chess that’s being played here. And the half I do understand, I don’t know what I believe. 

But if we’re here for a reason, if this isn’t just all some bad roll of a set of cosmic dice, this is what I need to do. I’m not a hero, or a werewolf, not Jack the ripper, or a body swapping diplomat. 

I’m just, Mike.

Now, someone get me a marker.”, Mike says, the grim work starting. 

Ashton prepares the surgical suite as best he can. For all his inventiveness, the previous owner wasn’t very concerned with hygiene. 

Stripped, Mike lays on a metal table, 3 spots marked on his pale flesh. One near his hip, one on his right thigh, and one close to his left shoulder. He shivers, whether it’s fear, cold or both I can’t tell. 

“Will you do me a favor and take some ether at least? This is shit your pants kind of pain.”, Ashton asks. 

“Good thing I’m not wearing any then. 

I’ve had people with a lot less concern for my safety rooting around inside of me before. 

But I can’t turn down the chance to get banged up on ether.”, Mike answers. 

Ashton provides Mike with an ether soaked rag and a leather wrapped stick to bite. 

“You guys aren’t going to want to be around for this. Battlefield surgery isn’t pretty.”, Ashton tells us. 

We listen about as well as you’d guess, not wanting to leave our friend. 

In the past year, I’ve seen blood and gore of all kinds. Pain, loss, mutilation. But watching Mike put his life on the line on the off chance his hunch is right, it felt like there was a knife in my guts as well. 

Of course, in the immediate future all of us are going to be flipping a coin on survival. But the thought that Mike could have such a brutal, undignified death? It’s scaring me in a whole different way. 

  It was horrible, so much so that I’m struggling to describe it. 

My best try would be to say that when a doctor tells you, you don’t want to watch something, it’s not really for your sake. 

Combat, adrenaline, and the dozens of lethal problems that come with them take a lot of the pain out of being wounded. With nothing to distract you though…. I can’t even imagine. 

Mike screams, actually he howls. He pleads, he cries, it’s not cowardice, it’s instinct. Self preservation. 

Mind over matter only goes so far, dedication only goes so far. At some point with enough nerves screaming danger, you have to listen. 

Ashton’s hands shake. He keeps his face close to the surgical sites. Blood hits his impromptu surgical mask. Honestly, I’m not feeling very confident.

But he’s all we have. The closest thing to a doctor in this hellhole.   

We leave. Not because we can’t handle the gore, we’ve seen worse. But because staying would be for our own benefit. A way to say we tried to share in Mike’s pain. 

He needs privacy, he needs to be able to go through all the undignified steps on the path he chose on his own. 



If anyone has waited in a hospital waiting room for a friend in danger, you know how we felt. If you haven’t, I envy your life. 

It was about 45 minutes, maybe an hour, but felt like half a day. Eventually, Ashton leads Mike back to us. 

He’s dressing as he walks. He limps heavily, stitches criss-cross the surgery sites. They’re thorough, but meandering.

“Hey, buddy. By all means, hang back here with my people. You’re not even walking wounded, you're walking dead.”, Travis says.

Mike laughs, “You have no idea how much I want to do that.”, he winces, then motions for something from Ashton. 

He hands him a fist sized bottle and a rag. Mike soaks the rag and takes a deep inhale. A glazed look comes over his eyes but he stands a bit straighter. 

Then Ashton holds out a small, plastic bag. Inside are few bullet fragments, one or two slugs, and an assortment of small knife tips. 

This is what we’re wagering our lives on?

 “I was hoping there’d be more.”, Leo says, disappointed, “I can probably make some pistol rounds if we have a stove.”

“Sorry I wasn’t worse at my job.”, Mike says, giggling, then grabbing his side. 

“Michael, trust me when I say, stay here.”, Demi says.

“Can you walk?”, Leo asks Mike. 

Mike nods. 

“Can you fight?”, is Leo’s next question. 

“If someone has a little something to even out this ether, yeah.”, Mike replies. 

“Your choice. I support it either way.”, Leo says. 

“Can you spare any people, Travis?”, I ask. 

“I would if I could, but we have our own plates to spin. 

I trust Ashton, and I’m sure you trust your friend, but mine’s an old man, and yours is a lunatic. I can’t take those kinds of risks right now.”, Travis replies. 

As Leo forges the slugs I sit and think of how it’s all come to this. 

Not just my story, but Leo’s, Mike’s, and all the other people that have lead novel-worthy lives I’ve met. 

I think back to what Mike said about us being here for a reason. Seems like it should be comforting. But it’s not, not a single step on this journey has been anything but brutal. How could that all be for a good reason?

And so starts the beginning of the end. An eight shot revolver of hope, and a half dozen people cursed, wounded, and full of uncertainty. 




To begin the path to the void is enshrouded in something that I can’t quite describe as fog. It has a sticky texture, and turns everything in the distance into blurred smudges devoid of color. 

When we break through, the road in front of us stretches out to the horizon. A thin path of strange rock, strewn with debris I can’t even guess at. Some biological, some mechanical or natural. It gives the feeling of an infinite history of interrupted journeys. 

“Bit of luck, doesn’t look like the Bishop made much…”, Demi begins, his voice full of hope. 

Then, as our eyes adjust to the strange perspective we understand. We pause in silence, stunned, fear for our bodies and souls overtaking all of us. 

He’s not close, he’s changed. 

His body is warped, massive, a walking building sized thing. Like a loose concept of what the Bishop was. 

His clothing melds seamlessly his body. A shifting, twitching carpet of a robe trailing behind him. With every step, every passing moment, it grows, entrenching itself into the scenery like a cursed fungus. 

His features are deep pits, the form under his robe, if there is one, seems random, and changing. 

One hand carries a massive, thick metal staff. Random spikes jut out around a central circle. 

What’s left of the poor souls he dragged on this infernal journey with him follow behind. We can’t make out detail at this distance, but they move slow and unsteady. 

The Bishop drones, his voice somehow carrying over the distance. It isn’t some ancient prayer, or incantation to dark gods. It’s an eclectic mix of lyrics, quotes, and other information.

That doesn’t diminish it’s effect though. The swirling, grey and purple expanse around us looks, sick if that makes sense. 

  And in the distance, flickering like the last star is the gate to the void. 

“Holy shit.”, I say. 

“Yeah, I’m not feeling overly confidant right now.”, Leo says. His tone isn’t fatalistic, just honest. 

“Why? I’m doing great.”, Mike replies taking a huff of the ether. 

“There’s a reason for that.”, Sveta says with a hollow laugh. 

The worst part about the journey isn’t the increasingly strange artifacts we have to walk around or climb over, it’s the time to think. 

What set all of this into motion? And more than that who’s side is it on?

The Bishop reaches the gate long before we do. By the time we get within shouting distance his chanting has became a floor shaking recitation. He has some sort of dais set up and screams his nonsense to his unwilling parishioners. 

“What in the hell?”, I say, stunned. 

“No idea, but we need to find out the why in a hurry.”, Leo answers. 

“Nine.”, Alex says from behind us. 

God-damn, even her massive, corrupted form seems tiny compared to what the bishop has turned into. 

“He has to be manipulating the gate.”, Demi offers. 

He points toward the massive, almost wound shaped portal. A massive arch of what appears to be bronze, behind which lay the secrets of the universe. 

“No, not the gate. The space between it and the void.”, Sveta corrects. 

“I’m a bit angry I never thought of such a thing, truth be told.”, Demi replies. 

I get a good look at the Bishop’s congregation. The dozen or so left are testaments to the human body’s ability to keep going. Each being host to a collection of garish wounds in various states of infection. 

Their replies to the Bishop are drowned out, but it doesn’t take a lip reader to make out begging. 

“Where do we start?”, I ask. 

Leo takes a deep breath before answering, “We need to get those people out of here. I’ve got to think it’ll slow down whatever he’s doing. 

Sveta, are you feeling…”

“No.”, Sveta answers shamefully. 

“Damn, I was hoping that was temporary. 

Mike, Demi you two see if you can get his attention. I’ll try hitting him with a few things, see what takes.”, Leo continues. 

“Did I just get my guts ripped out for nothing?”, Mike asks as he starts to check various pockets.

“You see the size of him? Those bullets are a last resort. I couldn’t tell you where anything important is on that flesh hillside. 

If I don’t have anything he notices, Alex you need to have a run at this bastard. You understand?”, I see the look of self hatred in Leo’s eyes as he gives the order. 

“Nine.”, Alex somberly replies. 

“Don’t get yourself killed, if you can’t hurt him, back off, go catch up with the people he kidnapped, make sure they get back safely. 

Demi, you manage to find anything you can use?”, Leo asks. 

“I’ve been known to pick a pocket or two.”, Demi replies with a smirk. 

“Good, because if he’s still standing after Alex gives it her shot, the three of us try to take down the gate itself. Fucking risky proposition, but at that point we’re running out of options.”, Leo advises.

“And if that doesn’t work?”, Mike asks, punctuating the sentence with a breath of ether. 

“That’s on a need to know basis. Let’s keep it at that.”, Leo says. 

“What about me?”, I inquire.

“Stay alive. I don’t know what is going on here, but if anything comes out of that gate, maybe we can talk to it.”, Leo answers. 

It’s noticeable Leo leaves Sveta out. 

“Fuck this.”, Mike says, taking an inhale directly from the bottle of ether, “ Sveta isn’t a coward, she’s pregnant. I don’t know much about werewolf banging, but from what I’ve been told, if she turns the bun  in her oven doesn’t bake. 

I know Sveta, I’m an asshole, but chances are at least one of you is dying today. No matter who draws the short straw, this secret is going to taint their memory.”

Sveta is livid, the phrases she’s using to refer to Mike are as colorful as they are vulgar. 

Then, for a brief second, we’re just a group of people who have been through a lot together in a stupid argument. 

The anger dissolves, Sveta smiles, we laugh. 

“Staying here then?”, Leo asks, softly. 

Sveta nods. 

“Then let’s clean up the neighbourhood a bit before you move in.”, Leo replies to her silent admission. 

“How are you planning on distracting…that?”, Demi asks Mike. 

“How deep in my head were you? The truth this time.”, Mike counters. 

“I don’t know how you’d want me to quantify that.”, Demi’s tone seems honest. 

“Far enough you can improv?”, Mike says, a deranged glimmer in his eye. 

“I practically invented the art.”, Demi replies. 

“Feel like following my lead once before we die?”, Mike offers. 

Demi tips his hat and the two rush to meet their fate. 

I follow Leo and Sveta, Alex stays back waiting for her moment. 

The Bishop pays us no mind. He’s deep into whatever communion he has going. The air takes on a foul odor, becomes humid. 

Just before we hit the Bishop’s sightline, we hear Mike, voice cutting through the thunderous chanting. 

“You’d really destroy the universe to see what it’s like to be me?”, Mike taunts. 

The bishop continues chanting, Leo motions for us to wait. 

“That’s what all of this is about isn’t it? Trying to see what else is out there?”, Mike wavers a bit. Can’t blame the man, trying to yell at something bigger than a tanker truck. 

The bishop scoffs, the sound kicking up a rotten smelling wind. 

“What you’re doing here isn’t the end, this is the beginning.”, Demi adds. 

“You think you can collect junk for a few decades and see behind the curtain? I’ve heard of ego, but holy shit.”, Mike says.

They get the bishop’s attention, in a way. 

A lumpen, asymmetrical eyeball appears on the Bishop’s robe. A ten foot blob of flesh and fabric rises in front of Mike and Demi. A haggard maw giving the impression of a rushed attempt at a face. 

“I have a lifetime of somewhere else in my rotten melon. Used to think it was bullshit, but now, I know better. 

Just imagine what you could do with that.”, Mike offers. 

“Or, what someone who knows what they’re doing could do with it. 

You were some unlucky peon who stumbled into knowledge beyond you. Maybe I take Michael away from here and become the Wiley Edison to your quirky Tesla?”, Demi says. 

For a half second the chanting stops. Then a look of anger and aggression comes from the lump of flesh and fabric. 

But the Bishop didn’t get this far without intelligence. The globular offshoot begins to laugh, catching Mike’s attempt to bait the Bishop. 

Mike is scrambling, Demi and him exchange a worried look. 

Something starts to seep from the space between where we are and the void. I can’t make out exactly what it is though, the harder I try the less of it I understand. One moment it seems like prodding fingers, the next, almost electric crackling. 

“Michael!”, Demi exclaims. 

“I’m thinking!”, Mike replies.

I’m sweating bullets, trying to think of some way I could help. 

A smile spreads over Mike’s face. 

“You remember that television pilot I was in?”, Mike asks Demi. 

Demi looks confused, “The one you see as where your life started it’s downfall? The one you watched on a nightly basis for years?”

“That’s the one.”, Mike’s smile seems almost predatory. 

There’s a change in Mike, a softening of his body language, his facial expression and mannerisms. In an instant, he’s playing a role, that of an upbeat children’s performer. 

 I can’t hear everything being said, but the two of them begin to act out a pretty juvenile slapstick routine. 

As the scene starts to play out the Bishop begins to stutter, fall over his incantation. 

“What the hell?”, I ask. 

“He’s disrupting the Bishop. The scene they are playing out was written where Mike is from. 

We’ve got to get these people out of here, now. This is sugar in the gas tank, not slashed tires.”, Leo replies. 

  As Mike and Demi act out that scene from some other where, we see brief looks of recognition on the faces of the Bishop’s thralls. 

The Bishop is straining, his ramblings from elsewhere getting tainted. 

The Bishop’s robe starts to form long tendrils, claws, and even half attempts at…things. They come at Mike and Demi from every possible angle, and strike home more than once, but through it all they keep up their dialogue.

I’m sure you’ve heard a fight described as a violent dance. What Mike and Demi were doing was a comedy routine by way of mortal danger.

We’re below the Bishop’s notice. It takes a minute but between Leo and myself we finally snap the thralls out of their stupor.

“Run in the opposite direction , hope for the best!”, Leo instructs. And to the best of their wounded ability the group of unfortunate people begin their own journey. 

This doesn’t stop the Bishop. We can feel the energy of this place start to skip and wane, but whatever he has planned is still ticking on. 

 “Disengage!”, Leo yells, Mike and Demi oblige, “You too punch, I can’t be worrying about you.”

I’m a little offended, but I can’t say he’s wrong. 

Mike is looking bad, even Demi has some wounds that aren’t healing. 

At this point it’s hard to tell where the Bishop ends and the scenery begins. We are insects trying to figure out how to stop a speeding truck. 

Then again, seeing Leo go gloves off, maybe we are at least a rock. Hopefully we can chip this windshield. 

I can’t say the bishop doesn’t react, but as fast as Leo can char, cut, or shoot something off, another portion of the increasingly amorphous villain swoops in to take it’s place. 

In an instant Leo is surrounded by asymmetrical warped copies of the Bishop. 

“If there is anything better than killing you once, it’s killing you a dozen times.”, Leo Taunts. 

He eviscerates the copies of the Bishop, working a k-bar style knife like a steel whirlwind. 

But it’s not nearly the only trick the Bishop has to play.    

It’s a stalemate, but not for long. Leo is unloading the kinds of things you’d find in the bible, but the Bishop  almost casually deals with the barrage. 

With a high pitched metallic twang, the gate explodes.  Shrapnel sends us hitting the deck.

The Bishop cackles, increasing the furor of his chant. 

In the space that once held the gate…

Listen, I can’t explain it. All I’d be saying is my mind’s half-assed attempt to rationalize seeing something that shouldn’t be there.

It was fear, it was the unknown, but other than that, it could have been anything from energy to a living creature. 

Leo crawls back to us, exhausted, and a few pounds of ammunition lighter.

“There goes destroying the gate. For fuck sakes, I wish he had a handle on this bastard.

Alex!”, Leo yells. 

I notice him look away. He knows we have to try everything, but sending in a tortured kid? No matter how scary she is, he knows this is wrong. 

She flies toward the Bishop, her barbed, massive body moving with purpose. She can’t be a tenth of his size, but she shows no fear. 

The laugh. The cursed, soul crushing laugh. If the universe dies today, it’d still leave that sound as the second worst thing to happen. 

Before she can so much as scratch him, a twisted , gnarled 9 fingered hand forms from the mass of the bishop. It points at the massive staff, then Alex.

It soars through the air like a missile. Opening along the way. It’s hollow inside, too late we realize what it is. 

A prison. 

 It closes around Alex, trapping her. Limbs jut out from portholes, her head crowning the scepter.

It has a horrific kind of beauty to it. She floats through the air, like some kind of twisted religious icon. A nine armed cross of sorts.

“Such hubris to think you were ever a step ahead of me. 

I’ve been crafting this moment for decades. This was all about the child. Every step of the journey guided by my hand. 

What is between the corners of reality is form waiting for function. Power beyond belief. 

But I have to show it what it can be. Show it the possibilities. Show it how to enter this entropy ridden universe, and bring new life!”, the Bishop screams. 

Alex floats in front of that miasma of wrong and broken laws of the universe. Everything starts to feel thin, far away. And worse than that, a sense of twisted curiosity and sinister needs. 

“We’re fucked.”, I say simply. 

No one refutes the statement. 

“Mike, take the pistol. “, Leo beings handing the firearm to Mike. He starts to go through his pockets, “I was really hoping it wouldn’t come to this, but we need to figure out where the hell to aim. If they even work. 

Where the hell…”

“Looking for this?”, Demi says holding out his hand. In it sits a small, shimmering grey capsule. 

Leo tries to snatch it, he doesn’t get close. 

“You can heal, I can’t. I’ve outlived my usefulness.”, Leo says, bluntly. 

“Leonard, you know how I died, the first time?

Small town out near Michigan, creature that called itself the God eater. Big enough event someone even chronicled it. It was a situation full of * Hollow Promises* . 

I purged the energy of a lifetime of artifacts. I broke the limits on a lifetime of knowledge. I made myself into an inferno of the void. 

For a very brief period anyway. 

The point is, that isn’t a trick anyone has been able to pull off twice, should have left me as nothing but ash and memory. 

This time, I can focus it, work with the rupture of the rules of the cosmos. Wield it like a rapier, not a warhammer.”, Demi replies.

“You think you can survive a dose of Valhalla?”, Leo says dismissively.

“It won’t just be that. I’ll purge every trinket I’ve found here. 

And no. There is nothing left of me other than this. Maybe if we made it back I’d have some kind of live rattling around in Michael’s brain, but this will be my final murder.”, Demi admits. 

And here is where I have to end things for now. In the middle of a supernatural shitstorm the likes of which no one else has ever seen. 

If you don’t hear from me again, I don’t think it’s going to matter. 

So , till the last time. 

Keep your friends close. 

Punch.
 


    
The End
