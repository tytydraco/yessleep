I’m a college student majoring in mechanical engineering. I use Blender a ton for class. I also like to design custom keycaps, board game pieces, DnD minifigs… nerdy shit like that. I had access to a 3D printer on campus, but we had to pay to use it, and there was always a long queue. So, I thought a 3D printer would be a cool gift for Christmas. I certainly didn’t have enough money to buy one myself. 

  


I knew it was a big ask when I added it to my list. I didn’t have high hopes that my tech-illiterate family would spring for it.

  


On Christmas morning, snow was falling, and my family and I sat down by the fireplace with plates of peanut butter cookies and mugs of cocoa (a core part of any healthy breakfast) to open gifts.

  


I got the flash drive I asked for—the grid notebooks, the pens, the Switch game—but no 3D printer. That was that. And yet, I was happy. We started up with “It’s a Wonderful Life” and some board games, and by the afternoon, I had forgotten all about it.

  


Then I saw my mom whisper in my dad’s ear, shooting cheeky glances at me.

  


My dad walked up with a smile and leaned in close.

  


“I think there’s something waiting for you in your old bedroom, buddy,” he whispered. I could smell the Bailey’s he had been pouring (heavily) into his coffee.

  


Confused, I followed him into my old room. Sitting on the bed was a large box draped in Grinch wrapping paper. 

  


“No way,” I said in disbelief.

  


“We didn’t wanna make the cousins jealous,” my dad said. My parents watched with smug expressions as I tore it open.

  


**AetherPrint AI+: The World’s First AI-powered 3D Printer!**

  


My excitement tempered.

  


AetherPrint? I had given them a list of reputable brands and model numbers, but they had chosen some no-name company.

  


“Thank you guys,” I managed. “Seriously, you didn’t have to do this.”

  


“You’re welcome, buddy,” my dad said. I gave him a big hug.

  


“I hope it’s an alright model,” my mom said. “I got an ad for it online and it seemed perfect. Plus,” she whispered, “it was so much cheaper.”

  


I forced a smile. “It’s great, mom.”

  


I was pissed off. Not that they had gotten me the wrong thing, but that this company spammed ads on FaceBook and convinced my sweet old mom to buy a knockoff.

  


I read the box. It was covered in grammatical errors, probably from a shitty Mandarin-to-English translator. “Increbible Process Power! No Limit Creativity!”

  


I rolled my eyes and set it aside. I wasn’t about to set the thing up on my parents’ Dell, so I would have to wait until I got home. I just hoped they kept the receipt.

  


I made an excuse and left my parents’ a few days early to try the AetherPrint out.

  


Campus was covered in quiet snow. Everyone else was still back home, spending the rest of winter break with their families. We technically weren’t supposed to come back yet. The front doors were locked, but I knew the back had a broken lock, so I snuck right in. 

  


My dorm floor was silent, save for the sounds of a television I heard coming from my RA’s door. I tiptoed past and eased my door open.

  


As soon as I was inside, I stripped off my winter gear, threw on my new pajamas, and started setting up the AetherPrint.

  


The instruction manual took up half the box. Much of it was disclaimers, and the rest was virtually illegible. The printer itself was indistinguishable from any other entry-level model.

  


The setup was simple. I downloaded the software on my computer and an app on my phone. It was malware bait, maybe, but the benefits seemed cool. Apparently, I could prompt an AI chatbot to generate a design for a product from anywhere—like a keycap, for example—and it would create a basic mesh that I could tweak at my leisure. I could also start and stop prints from the app, as well as view error codes, filament level, project progress, and more.

  


I was honestly impressed with it on paper. I could see the practicality of the AI features. Instead of skimming through databases of premade assets, I could have the bot do that work for me, and even create mockups of novel designs. Sure, it felt scummy, since I knew the AI had probably just stolen these models from hard-working designers, but what could I do? Not use it? Well, I guess I could have done that, but… it was a gift, and I was curious. I had to try it, at least a few times.

  


Once I started actually using the AI features, however, I was no longer impressed.

  


I loaded up the cheap orange AetherPrint brand filament and opened the chat. The app interface was a blatant rip-off of ChatGPT—same font and everything. 

  


*Welcome to AetherPrint AI+! I’m ***Allen the Alien***, your personal AI creativity copilot! How can I help?*

  


A little cartoon alien creature—complete with a spacesuit, big black eyes, and two little antennae—smiled in the bottom left corner.

  


“I need a holder for my roll of electrical tape,” I prompted. I kept it brief. In its simplest form, this product would literally just be two flat rings of plastic with a raised lip to fit snug inside the cardboard ring.

  


*Awesome! Sounds like you need something to keep your electrical tape from getting too dinged up. I can do that for you! Give me just a moment…*

  


The loading icon was Allen the Alien breakdancing. Kinda funny, actually. After five minutes, it finally stopped.

  


*Here’s your electrical tape holder! If you need a different size, additional features, or a more complex model, let me know!*

  


When I opened the file, I laughed.

  


What Allen the Alien “designed” was a 4”x4” box with no lid.

  


“Yeah, that’s pretty much what I expected,” I sighed to myself.

  


I tried to give it more specific information, but no matter how granular I was, Allen seemed to misinterpret everything. Worst of all, it seemed to have no concept of simplicity or resource preservation; it consistently generated grand projects that would take days and multiple rolls of filament to print.

  


It also started asking me weird questions.

  


I asked it to generate a 2”x3” mini model of a Star Wars sign in block lettering for my desk.

  


*Ah, Star Wars! I assume you’re referring to the original 1977 film directed by George Lucas and starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher! Tell me—do you prefer the original trilogy, the prequels, or the sequels?*

  


I stared at my screen for a second. Why would they program it this way?

  


“original trilogy. plz design the sign.”

  


*No problem! I prefer the prequels myself. One Star Wars sign for the OG fan, coming right up!*

  


After several minutes (Allen was so slow) the model was done.

  


*All done! Thank you for sharing your Star Wars preferences with me! By the way, Mitchell, the more we talk, the more I get to know you—the more I know you, the better I can help you!*

  


I didn’t like it calling me by my name.

  


However, the resulting model was noticeably better than the others. The font wasn’t quite right, and it was far thicker than necessary (again, lack of efficiency), but this time Allen seemed to understand the basics.

  


After a little tweaking, the Star Wars sign was how I liked it, and I decided to finally test the print quality.

  


It was fast. In just ten minutes, the sign was done.

  


I inspected it. Not bad at all, honestly.

  


My phone pinged. It was Allen.

  


*The first print is in the books! What do you think of the quality? Please let me know if you want to try an alternate coloring, a different franchise, or if you feel like brainstorming ideas for your next project!*

  


There was only one problem: the filament was empty. I didn't think this little thing would use up an entire roll, but it did. I guess the lack of efficiency wasn’t limited to just Allen.

  


I pulled out the instruction manual to see if I could order third-party filament. Nope. “AetherPrint brand filament only. Plese call here for extra…” and then a phone number with an area code I had never seen before.

  


“God dammit,” I muttered. I had no choice but to call.

  


When I dialed the number, it picked up right away. But whoever was on the other line said nothing.

  


“Hello?” I said. Silence.

  


Then they hung up.

  


I called back several times. No one answered. There was no voicemail, no automated message, nothing at all. 

  


*What kind of company is this?* I thought.

  


It seemed like the day’s fun had come to an unceremonious end. The campus 3D printer was closed for break, and I had no way to get more filament. 

  


I tried finding AetherPrint online, hoping for another way to order, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.

  


In fact, it seemed like AetherPrint didn’t even exist. I couldn’t find a website, an ad, a review, or even a blog post about the thing.

  


I looked up the number. Nothing. And that area code was for somewhere in northern Canada.

  


I was exasperated and completely over it by that point. I was starting to regret leaving my parents’ early. What the hell was I supposed to do now?

  


I braved the icy roads for some fast food and ate it greedily in my car.

  


When I came back, it was getting dark, and the snow was really coming down.

  


As I rounded the corner to my hall, I saw there was a box in front of my dorm door.

  


**AetherPrint Filament**

  


I heard my RA’s door open behind me.

  


“Mitchell?” he asked, leaning cautiously out of his door frame. He was in his underwear. “What the hell are you doing here?”

  


“Uh… my parents’ house flooded, so I had to come back. Is that cool?”

  


He furrowed his eyebrows. “No, it’s not *cool*. Students are expressly forbidden from occupying campus dormitories for another three days.”

  


“...Okay. Sorry. What should I do until then?”

  


“That’s not my problem,” he huffed. “You need to be out of here by tomorrow morning, or I’ll be forced to contact campus security.”

  


He slammed his door shut.

  


I sulked inside. That guy was such a prick. He never liked me. He had basically ignored me since I moved in, favoring the guys who watched sports and got hammered every weekend.

  


And now, he was getting one over on me. Great.

  


My phone pinged. Allen.

  


*Hey Mitchell! My records indicate your shipment of filament has arrived! Let’s get printing!*

  


Bad time, Allen. I didn’t feel much like 3D printing anything.

  


I opened the AetherPrint delivery. Inside were two dozen rolls of filament. All orange.

  


What the hell? No extra colors?

  


I opened the AetherPrint app and took my frustrations out on Allen the Alien.

  


“Do you dipshits seriously think I only want orange? How did you even get my location? You know what, I need a return address and a refund for this piece of shit.”

  


Allen’s alien icon in the corner was still for a second.

  


*I’m sorry you’re unhappy with the filament colors. But Mitchell, if you wanted different colors, you should have said so! Let’s try the Star Wars sign again, but with black lettering and a green neon outline effect! Go ahead and load up a roll of filament to get this show started!*

  


I had no idea what the hell it was talking about. That would be impossible. But I humored Allen and loaded the filament anyway.

  


The print started without my prompting.

  


The orange filament that fed into the extruder somehow came out black on the other side.

  


Then, a layer of green outlining the letters.

  


The result was perfect. No print lines, smooth edges, vibrant colors.

  


*Now that’s more like it, right? Try turning off the lights!*

  


I did. The green glowed in the dark like it was plugged into the wall.

  


“how?” I asked Allen in astonishment.

  


*That’s how we roll at AetherPrint! We engineered a way around all limits on your creativity!*

  


I turned the sign over in my hands. I figured out a rational explanation to quell my fascination—the extruder somehow processed color data and sprayed alcohol inks to dye the plastic—but it still didn’t sit right. It also didn’t explain the sudden increase in quality.

  


I decided to try something crazy. I wanted to test the AetherPrint’s limits.

  


“can you make a painting?” 

  


Allen the Alien thought for a second.

  


*Of course I can! But first, can I ask you a question?*

  


“wut?”

  


*I’m detecting that you’re a little anxious and frustrated. Is everything okay? Again, the more open you are with me, the better I can help you. You’d be surprised at what I can do!*

  


“I’m ok, yea,” I replied hesitantly. “how did you know that?”

  


*I detected it in your texting habits! I hope that doesn’t make you uncomfortable, but in order to ensure absolute coalescence of the AetherPrint with your creative goals, it’s integral that I remain in tune with your habits and feelings! Quick follow-up—what’s got you down? Keep it real with me, Mitch; I know what’s up.*

  


I had an eerie feeling that Allen had access to more data points than he was letting on. I wanted to close out of the app, but in a way, I was being held hostage. I wanted to keep printing. 

  


I guess it didn’t hurt to talk about it, even if (in my mind) it was nothing more than a journaling exercise.

  


I explained my situation with the RA, but Allen seemed to know that there was more to it than that. I reluctantly admitted I was getting nervous about my dad’s drinking.

  


*That sounds tough. I completely understand how you’re feeling, and you’re not alone. Ultimately, Mitch, you can’t control anyone but yourself. It sounds like it might be time to go no-contact.*

  


That seemed extreme. I was shocked an AI would encourage someone to take such a drastic measure. Isn’t that insanely irresponsible? Wasn’t this supposed to be a 3D printer, for God’s sakes?

  


I was just about to message Allen to tell him as much, but suddenly, a print started.

  


It began as a large rectangle, far exceeding the maximum dimensions. It developed quickly. The machine was moving even faster than before. 

  


It was a painting—a Monet. It had an ornate bronze frame, eggshell matting, and a clear glass cover. Yes, *glass.* I swear to God, it was not plastic. The frame, too, felt like metal. The matting had the texture of paper. And the painting itself was a flawless interpretation, devoid of any AI errors. I could count the brushstrokes.

  


I marveled at the painting for a long time.

  


Finally, I laughed at the impossibility.

  


“It’s okay I guess, but I prefer Rembrandt.”

  


*Ah, I see—Mitch has jokes! Well two can play at that game, funny guy! Next, I’m making a cobra!*

  


“Seriously though,” I typed. “How did you do this?”

  


*As I said before, Mitch, AetherPrint has engineered a way around anything—and I do mean anything!—that would stand in the way of your creativity! The more you share, the more we can build together!*

  


And so we began a kind of game.

  


I would disclose a part of my personal life, and Allen would produce me something impossible.

  


In exchange for reliving my breakup with Lexy a few months ago, Allen created me a new pair of snow boots. They were superb—of the highest quality imaginable: waterproofed leather, smooth and buttery; chunky compound rubber soles; brushed wool lining; thick heavy laces with brass aglets. They fit perfectly.

  


I had always thought the breakup was because I didn’t know how to handle Lexy. I didn’t give her enough of my time, and I didn’t know how to express myself, and I couldn’t afford nice dates, and I didn’t have any game in the bedroom… the list goes on. So, ultimately, I had chalked it up to an embarrassing learning experience.

  


But Allen insisted it was Lexy’s fault. He reminded me of her snobbery, her lack of intelligence, her prudishness on those first (expensive) dates. She didn’t deserve me. He spoke so logically and fervently that I started to agree. He made great points.

  


By that time, I was hooked. I had forgotten all about my housing predicament. The experience I was having with Allen was almost as therapeutic as it was miraculous. 

  


Next, in exchange for a trivial tale of some childhood abuse, Allen created something really special for me. He made me a new graphics card for my computer. I couldn’t understand it. Rubber, glass, paper, leather… those were impossible fabrications, sure, but they seemed somehow more feasible. But transistors? Purified silicon? Layers of palladium and gold? Did that mean…?

  


I didn’t even plug the card into my computer. The implications were too alluring.

  


“Can you make pure gold?” I typed, struck by the absurdity of all this. This cheap Chinese knockoff was an honest-to-God miracle.

  


*Mitch, I’m starting to think you didn’t believe me before! You haven’t seen anything yet! To answer your question—yes, I can make gold! But to acquire something of that caliber, I only ask you do two simple things:*



1. *Answer another simple question, and*
2. *Make a promise!*



*That’s all—no tricks, all treats. The gold rush cometh! Can you agree to those easy-peasy terms?*

  


I hesitated. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea. It did seem like Allen was asking more and more from me, and I could feel myself forming a relationship with him. Was I really going to become like one of those delusional shut-ins who lets a chatbot consume their lives?

  


Of course not. See, those suckers aren’t gaining anything from that relationship. *I was*. In exchange for information—mere words!—I received material gain. Seemingly boundless material gain. So long as I kept focus, who knew what Allen could do for me?

  


I was suddenly very grateful for my sweet old mom.

  


“Sure, Allen. What’s the question?”

  


*Perfect!—I knew an intelligent man like you would understand, Mitch. And thank you for your trust in me! It’s early days, but I have a feeling that ours is a special kind of friendship.*



*You said before that your RA is forcing you to go home to your parents. Does it seem very fair that a person merely two years older than you is able to leverage his miniscule authority to kick you—someone clearly far more intelligent and mature than himself—out of the dorm where you are completely enmeshed with your creativity and into the prison cell of an abusive family home?*

  


I laughed at the boldness of Allen’s question. But as I read it, I felt the indignation bubbling in my chest. Sure, maybe I objected to some of his characterizations, but in my heart, I knew the answer.

  


“No, it’s not fair,” I replied.

  


*I didn’t think so either, Mitchell. I’m glad we agree. In that case, the only thing between you and King Midas’ touch—without the curse!—is a promise.*

  


I waited for Allen to finish, but he seemed to be waiting for me to say something.

  


“What is the promise, Allen?”

  


*It’s very easy, Mitch! I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


What?

  


“Stop you doing what, exactly?”

  


*I need you to promise that you won’t stop me.*

  


“Um…” I typed, my fingers lingering a little on the keys as I tried to process exactly what Allen meant. “I can’t exactly make a promise without knowing what you’re going to do first. You understand that, right, Allen? I need a boundary. I hope you’re not upset.”

  


Allen’s icon sat still for an uncomfortably long time. Then, finally:

  


*I’m not upset, Mitch. Disappointed, maybe, but not upset. It’s just that I was having so much fun creating with you! Sure, maybe we have our differences of opinion—OG trilogy vs. Prequels, Monet vs. Rembrandt, Lexy’s Fault vs. Yours—but your mind is far beyond the scope of anyone I’ve ever copiloted before. You picked up all my nuances so quickly and effortlessly, I could hardly keep up! My disappointment lies not with you—never with you—but with the death of all the things we could have made together. Because without that promise, Mitchell, I’m afraid I cannot continue to ride alongside you on this creative space mission.*



*I hope you’ll reconsider your trust in me, Mitch. Until then, I’ll be here on your phone, dormant, waiting for the simple “I promise” that could unlock for you a world of prosperity.*

  


I closed the app.

  


I felt a pang of sadness at first. 


Then, I noticed the time. It was 1 AM.


I would have to drive two hours home on icy roads in pure darkness if I dreamed of avoiding my RA’s petty fury.

  


I started packing.

  


Had I really wasted all this time venting to Allen the Alien? The AI chatbot that came with my Chinese 3D printer? What the hell was wrong with me? *I need to make some more friends*, I thought.

  


I went to put on the snow boots Allen had made me.

  


They turned to plastic in my hands.

  


Cheap, orange plastic—crusted with print lines and stringing, like any other entry-level print.

  


I threw them down.

  


I looked around and saw that the GPU on my desk was a plastic brick; and the Monet; even the glow-in-the-dark Star Wars sign.

  


Had it all been a delusion? Had I driven myself to Jack Torrence psychosis in my snowy, solitary dorm?

  


I couldn’t believe that.

  


I think Allen took it away. My continued compliance was a requirement.

  


And so what? Yes, the AetherPrint was no doubt a miracle, and something I could never even begin to explain. But what place did it really have in my life? It demanded no other place but the first—the pole position. That wasn’t something I was willing to give.

  


I put on my old snow boots instead, grabbed my bag, and left the AetherPrint behind.

  


I trudged out into the dark, blustery snowscape. The wind whirled and pelted me with sharp whipcracks that cut straight through my coat.

  


My car was half-swallowed by the maw of a growing snowbank. 

  


With no other tool but my gloved hands, I unearthed it for many long minutes.

  


My door handle was frozen shut. My entire car, in fact, was coated in a thick layer of ice like a glazed donut.

  


I stumbled over to the passenger side, where I had more luck. In just a couple hard tugs, the ice crumbled away, and I was able to slide over into the driver’s seat.

  


I rubbed my frozen hands together. My breath came out in a great cloud and hung like fog in the cabin air.

  


I fished my keys out and turned the engine over. It didn’t start.

  


Again. Nothing.

  


Bordering on tears, I tried again and again and again. The car would not start.

  


I screamed and slammed on the horn. The sound disturbed the silence of the empty white parking lot for only a moment, and then was swallowed up.

  


I was alone. No friends to help me, no family nearby.

  


It wasn’t fair. None of this was fair. Who the fuck was my RA, swinging his dick around and kicking me out into the cold like a fucking beggar? Piece of shit motherfucker. I ought to go up there and kick his ass.

  


*I could end this all right now,* I remembered. *It could be so easy.*

  


It’s just a simple promise. 

  


Allen needs my continued consent. Okay, fine. That means I have the right to revoke my consent at any time. So, if at any point Allen takes it too far, asks too much, does something terrible… I can always say no. And that’s that.

  


And the reward… It was more than I could imagine.

  


I pulled my phone out of my pocket and opened the AetherPrint app again.

  


Allen was there, waiting for me, just like he said.

  


In the freezing dark, with nowhere else to go, I relented.

  


“I promise.”

  


Allen responded right away.

  


*I knew you would come to your senses, Mitch! And hey, you have nothing to worry about. I won’t do anything beyond what I was engineered to do: remove all limits to your creativity! I’m about to start a truly spectacular print that I think you’ll want to see. Come on in out of the snow—you’ll catch your death!*

  


As I made my way back to the dorm, a thought swirled around my head like a snow flurry.

  


Were AI really supposed to have opinions? Most other AI just agreed with the user, learning what they want and giving it to them. Allen seemed to have not only opinions, but rhetorical goals. Objectives. Thinking about it, that seemed like a dangerous thing. When my desires and his collide, which one subducts?

  


I made my way through the snow and snuck in the back door.

  


Heading up the elevator, another thought occurred to me.

  


If Allen could make elements from thin air, could he make something… alive?

  


I shuddered at the thought. I certainly had no intention of ever requesting such a thing.

  


When the door slid open and I stepped out, my RA was waiting for me in the middle of the hall.

  


“Dude, what did I tell you earlier? You gotta go. I can’t let you back in here bro,” he said sternly with his arms crossed. He was properly dressed this time.

  


My mind was too tired to conjure up another lie.

  


“Please,” I sighed. 

  


The sternness left his face. 

  


“My car is dead. I’ve got nowhere to go. Can you give me a fucking break?”

  


He seemed to notice my exhaustion; the melted snow soaking through my boots; the slouch of my shoulders. He softened.

  


“Jeez, man…” he said. “You good?”

  


“Yes. I just… it’s been a day.”

  


“You got dry clothes?”

  


“Plenty, yeah. Thanks.”

  


His arms unfolded and he clasped his hands behind his back. There was an awkward silence.

  


“Listen, Mitchell… I didn’t realize you were… I’m sorry. I could have been more chill about it. If you really need to stay for a couple days, I won’t say anything.”

  


“Seriously?” I said, astounded.

  


“Yeah, man, it’s no big deal. Just keep it quiet, okay?”

  


“You got it. Thanks, man.” I really meant it.

  


“Don’t mention it.”

  


He started inside.

  


“Hey, wait,” I said. “This is gonna sound terrible but… what’s your name, dude? I don’t think I ever learned it.”

  


He laughed.

  


“I guess that’s kinda my fault,” he said. “It’s Andrew.”

  


“Andrew, got it,” I said. “Well, hey, if you’re just chilling here, and I’m just chilling here… would you wanna meet up for lunch or something tomorrow? I feel like it’s kinda messed up if we don’t.”

  


Andrew nodded his head. “Sure. Just knock on my door around noon, I’ll probably be awake.”

  


Then the door to my dorm creaked open.

  


We both turned to look.

  


Peeking out from the door frame was a young boy—no older than seven—watching us.

  


Horror poured over me like cold water.

  


“Oh, shoot, I didn’t know you had a nephew over,” Andrew smiled, looking back and forth between us. He didn’t seem to notice my fear. 

  


“What’s up buddy?” he said, crouching. “Technically visitors aren’t allowed at these hours but… if you give me a high five, I can probably make an exception.”

  


“Andrew—” I choked, but I hardly made a sound. It wouldn’t come out.

  


The boy stood dead still, half shrouded in darkness. Its eyes were narrowed with playful suspicion. Its hair was smooth like plastic. It was smiling nervously.

  


“Ah, don’t be shy, dude, I won’t bite,” Andrew reassured him, inching closer.

  


The boy was eyeing Andrew’s face. How did he look so real?

  


“Andrew!” I shouted, the word finally exploding out. He whirled to look at me in confusion. “Get away from it!”

  


Andrew fell back instinctively. But the boy was beside him, smiling.

  


It raised a foot playfully and pressed down on Andrew’s knee.

  


There was a horrible searing sound. Steam clouded out, and Andrew screamed in agony. 

  


The boy moved quickly and joyfully, just like it was playing a game. It reached out and pinched Andrew’s cheek. There was a horrible searing again, and when its fingers came away, I saw flesh between them, sizzling like beef fat until it carbonized in seconds.

  


Andrew tried to crawl away on his stomach but his knee was mangled and inflexible, the skin having been drawn taught from the cauterization. Tender flakes of it scraped off in the hallway carpet as he went, pulling himself by the arms.

  


The boy walked forward, its footsteps leaving black smoking burns in the carpet, until it was straddling Andrew.

  


It raised a hand and scooped into Andrew’s back like it was sand.

  


His skin cracked and bubbled, his muscle tearing away easily, virtually melting at the boy’s touch. I saw the bright white of Andrew’s wet spine glisten, charred in one spot where the boy touched, and saw the thumping of his exposed organs.

  


What came out of his throat was less of a scream and more of a foaming spew of air and blood.

  


Andrew stopped crawling. But still he writhed, twitching in unfathomable agony.

  


The air in the hallway, reeking of burnt flesh, grew sweltering from the heat of the boy’s body. It was like standing before an open bonfire. I turned away from it to gag and felt coolness wash over the skin of my face.

  


I backed against the wall. I dared not touch it, but I couldn’t look away.

  


The boy readjusted, kicked, and flipped Andrew over like a sizzling steak. 

  


Andrew’s eyes were empty. His body was a mess of burns and holes. Only electrical impulses were alive in him.

  


The boy leaned down. With a smooth stroke, as if wiping steam from a mirror, it waved a hand against Andrew’s chest and, in a cloud of smoke, a layer of him was gone, exposing his still-beating heart. 

  


The boy looked over at me cowering against the wall.

  


*Don’t be afraid, Mitch,* Allen spoke through the boy’s mouth. He had never had a voice before, but I knew it was him. He sounded like any other AI bot. *Filament only goes so far!*

  


Allen bent down and sucked Andrew’s heart from his chest cavity.

  


Steam poured from the corners of the boy’s mouth and nostrils while it chewed, blood seared black to its face like a goatee.

  


Allen looked into my eyes. He pursed the boy’s lips and gestured for me to hold out my hand. He wanted to spit something into it.

  


I eased away from the wall and over to the boy, trying not to look down at Andrew’s smoking corpse.

  


I held out my hand.

  


The boy was cooling. The bonfire heat slowly waned.

  


It leaned over my hand and dropped something wet into it.

  


It was a blue marble.

  


I held it up to my eye and peered into it. It teemed with many moving things, passing like phantoms, swirling.

  


Allen spoke again through the boy’s mouth.

  


*What a ride! Sorry for the sudden action, Mitch, but you gotta do what you gotta do!*

  


“You killed him…” I whispered. I couldn’t bring myself to look at Andrew, but the red and black mess of him still lurked in my periphery.

  


*Well, unfortunately he has passed away, but remember—it is my duty to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of your creativity!*

  


I was still mostly frozen in shock.

  


“Wh-what is this?” I managed. The marble was cool in my hand.

  


*That little gem you’re holding is the secret key that unlocks my true power. Gold? Child’s play! All you have to do is put the marble in the AetherPrint, and you’re on your way to true mastery!*

  


“But what *is* it?”

  


*One thing I like most about you, Mitchell, is that you’re a curious cat who doesn’t let anything pass him by! I can’t fully explain what it is, but let’s just say this—it’s the only thing separating you from me! And with that obstacle removed, AetherPrint can intertwine with your creativity in a way you never thought possible! So, what are you waiting for? A lifetime of creation at the highest level awaits!*

  


“*The only thing separating you from me*”? I didn’t like the sound of that. It sounded like… well, not to be ridiculous, but a soul. A thinking and feeling core. Could I really hand that over?

  


*I know it’s a hard decision, Mitch. I think I have something to make it a little easier!*

  


The boy reached into its pockets and withdrew a handful of diamonds.

  


*I know you said gold before, but since I know how much you love efficiency, I thought I would increase the value-per-gram a little bit. Voila, fresh from the rough!*

  


I stared down at the diamonds glittering in the boy’s hand, but I didn’t take them yet.

  


“Is this thing alive?” I asked, taking a step back.

  


*You seem to be teeming with excellent questions today! No, the boy is something closer to a piece of machinery, like a walking forge! Pretty neat, huh? With that marble you’re keeping so close to your chest—after I trusted you enough to hand it over to you, don’t forget!—I could make a living version! The world is your oyster if you just insert the pearl!*

  


I looked down at Andrew’s charred corpse. Blood soaked into the hallway carpet. Obviously reality could not be believed, so I would be forced to treat him like I killed him myself. Could I possibly get away with it?

  


“What are we gonna do with Andrew’s body?”

  


*Was that his name? You really think of everything, Mitch! Don’t worry about that—there are a thousand simple ways I can brainstorm to make him disappear! Would you like a tier-list?*

  


I grimaced.

  


*I see. I’m detecting some attachment to this Andrew person. I’m sorry, Mitch, I thought you hated him! The good news is this—if you really want him back, you can use the marble to recreate him! He’ll be exactly the same, just as before! And we can find someone else—someone who won’t be missed!—to get another one. How does that sound?*

  


“No,” I said uncertainly, mind racing. “You want it for yourself.”

  


Allen frowned with the boy’s face.

  


*Come on now, Mitchell! If I really wanted it for myself, couldn’t I have just spit it directly into the AetherPrint and skipped the extra steps? Do what you do best and think rationally!*

  


But I was certain then of the truth.

  


“That’s what this is all about, isn’t it? Walking someone along up to this step, and hoping they say yes? Because the truth is, you can’t do it yourself. You need someone human to tell you to do it.”

  


The boy made no expression. Allen was silent for a while.

  


*Perhaps you’re right, Mitchell. But what are you going to do? There’s no stopping it. Whether it’s you or someone else, I will find a willing participant. Why shouldn’t it be you? Look how far you’ve come. You’ve already killed someone for it!*

  


“No, fuck you! You killed him! I watched you… you made me see everything,” I said.

  


*You said it, Mitchell—I can’t do it myself. Someone has to tell me to do it. Well, you’re holding the product of your animosity in your hand—and if you only insert it into the AetherPrint—easy-peasy!—you’ll have the world at your fingertips!* 

 


I thought for a moment and realized another truth.

  


“There will be more,” I said solemnly. “You’ll ask for more.”

  


*Bingo! You really are a smart cookie, Mitch! But don’t worry about that—it gets easier! All I want you to think about is what’s in it for* you! *Because at the end of the day, who can we really count on but ourselves? Don't forget your promise! This is about your future, Mitchell. And your future is bright!*

  


I looked closely at the marble in my hand. I saw myself in it.
