[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1hmhe/the_night_shift_at_the_diner_pays_400_i_wish_id/)

I went back to the diner. 

Some of your comments got to me, and they made me realize that the best decision a mature and responsible woman would make is to see the debt to the rude vampire through. Because that is the right thing to do. 

Ok, no. I’m lying. 

Sunday morning came like a beacon in the dark. I woke up early and paced through my room for a few hours before gathering the courage to actually walk through the door. I hadn’t left my room in days, and even Roger had given up on trying to talk to me. He wasn’t even bringing food by anymore. 

But that day I had to leave. The bus that only came on Sundays was my only escape route from this town, and I was going to make it out. No matter what. 

I packed everything I owned into my back pack, and I left the uniform with which I had left the diner in a hurry last week neatly folded on the bed before leaving the room. (On a completely separate note, I really want to know what this is made out of. It didn’t tear with all of the… you know, and the blood stains washed right out of it). I didn’t even check out. That’s how desperate I was for this to go well. 

I walked quickly to the bus station, flinching at every shadow and at every noise. I’m a little bit embarrassed to admit that I even let out a tiny scream when a pigeon flew by me, but you all have to understand that I was terrified out of my mind. I didn’t know much about… anything at all really. I only knew that a crazy vampire who sucked so much of my blood that I passed out and claimed that I owed his some sort of life debt was running around loose in the town where I was staying. I couldn’t afford to let him get to me. Not even after he saved my life. 

So yes, I admit it. Despite the warnings and despite knowing deep down that leaving wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had, I still did it. 

Tried to, at least. 

The bus was running late. I knew that that wasn’t uncommon for small towns, so I still waited. I waited for an hour. And then two. I tried to blend in with my surroundings, I didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention to myself. But it didn’t really work out like that because at around the two hour mark, someone sat down next to me. 

“Hi!” 

I flinched, cursing at myself for not paying enough attention to my surroundings. But, when I finally dared to look I finally allowed myself to feel *some* relief at the fact that the person sitting next to me wasn’t that particular vampire. Or any vampire at all. It was Roger, the cook from the diner, and possible unconfirmed werewolf.

I tensed up for a second, but I still sat back down next to him. 

“Hi,” I muttered, picking at the skin around my fingernails.  

We sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes before he decided to speak. “Waiting for the bus?” He teased, but I didn’t respond. What if they were all in on it?

“How did you find me?” I asked instead. 

He laughed a little bit, slightly amused. “It wasn’t hard. You’re the only human here,” he teased, bumping my shoulder lightly. “I was just walking to my shift at the diner and saw you sitting here by yourself,” he continued after I didn’t say anything to his comment from before. 

I nodded, choosing to ignore the fact that I was the only human in a town full of monsters. Which probably meant that my every move was noticed by everybody else. 

“Come on, let me buy you a drink at the diner. You must be cold.”

“No, thank you,” I replied, staring at the end of the road, praying that the bus would make its appearance. 

“You’re still waiting for that bus?” He nagged, but I just nodded. “Well, you’re going to be waiting a while—” he smirked, not maliciously but in amusement—“last night’s storm trashed the road. No buses in or out the town.”

“What?!” I whipped my head around so fast that my neck hurt a bit. 

“Yes. It’s pretty common,” he explained. “Nobody really cares much for this stretch of road, and it typically stays like this for months.”

“No, but—”

“You don’t have to believe me,” he shrugged. “You can stay here indefinitely. But there’s another storm coming, and you’ll be much more comfortable at the diner. ” He didn’t even wait to see if I decided to follow. He just started walking toward the diner, more than likely already running late because of me. 

My brain was still reeling from the news that I was essentially trapped here until the road was fixed, but I still ran to catch up with Roger anyway. Because, what else could I really do?

The diner didn’t look much different in the daylight. The only noticeable change was that a different woman stood at the counter taking orders. I hadn’t seen her before, but she nodded when she saw me, as if she already knew me.

I returned the nod and sat at an empty booth, my stomach rumbling with hunger. 

It didn’t take long for Roger to appear from behind the kitchen doors with a plate of eggs and bacon and a big mug in hand. Without a word, he placed both objects in front of me and he sat on the opposite side. 

I wanted to complain, to tell him that I hadn’t ordered anything, but the hunger won and I began eating my breakfast. 

I eyed the coffee cup distrustingly, though, as it was the same type used for blood, but I relaxed when the familiar scent of coffee hit my nostrils. 

I wrapped my hands around the warm ceramic, but did’t say anything for a few minutes, content to be in silence with Roger by my side. 

“So… I’m stuck here?” I finally asked, awkwardly. 

“If it’s of any consolation, we’re all stuck here.”

“It’s REALLY not,” I replied, half joking and half serious. 

The bell above the door rang, and I shot my head toward it, and then I found myself relaxing when it wasn’t… him.

“So…you’re all monsters?” I asked, the last part mostly a hushed whisper. 

“Monsters?” He pressed a hand to his chest, and for a moment I was terrified that I’d actually offended him. “How dare y—” he stopped when he noticed my genuine look of worry. “Sorry, sorry. I was kidding. But you should’ve seen the look on you face,” he laughed. “Yes, we’re all monsters, as you put it. Although we do prefer the term inhuman.”

I nodded, suddenly very interested in the coffee mug. I asked a question I wasn’t ready to have answered, and he answered it. That was on me. 

“And what are you?” I asked before realizing that I was doing it. My eyes widened with surprise at the fact that I’d actually said it out loud. 

He laughed. “What do you think I am?” He teased. 

“Right now? An asshole.” What was wrong with me? Did I want to get killed? I instantly stiffened, slamming my hands on my mouth. “I’m sorry! I—”

He burst out laughing. “Fair enough,” he shrugged. “I’m a werewolf.”

I nodded again, but I wasn’t surprised. At least my theory had been confirmed. 

“So, what do you say? Are you coming in for the night shift tonight?” He asked after a moment of silence, smiling in his usual friendly manner. 

“Um—” I shuffled nervously.

“You don’t have to decide right now. But I do have to go to work. Maybe I’ll see you there.” And with that, he left me alone to finish eating my breakfast. 

Later, I made my way back to the motel. After getting confirmation that the bus wasn’t coming, I reluctantly handed the man at the counter the $400 that had cost me literal blood, sweat, and tears in exchange for another week in the motel from hell. And just like that, I was back down to $550.

So, my options were clear: sleep in the streets of a town full of monsters, or work at the diner. Obviously, option number two was the only sound one. 

At seven I began getting ready for my shift, planning to grab a quick meal before it started. 

I put on the faded pink dress and I was just putting on that ridiculous hat when the lights flickered. 

I paused for a moment, but ultimately continued giving myself a pep talk, preparing for another night at the diner. Surrounded by monsters. And maybe even… him. I was grateful that I hadn’t seen him since the previous week, but I knew that I would have to see him again. 

Then the lights flickered again, and again after a few more seconds. And then, finally, the last flicker erupted into a spark, and the entire room was swallowed by darkness.

Through the blinds, the last rays of the setting sun illuminated the wall. The plaster suddenly bulged, molding itself into the shape of a woman’s face, pressed from the inside, like the shape of a baby’s hand on its mother’s belly. A screeching sound went through the wall as the woman tried to tear through it with her hands.

I bolted from the room, only to find other guests doing the same. There were five of us, all stumbling in the dark. A boy, not much older than me, slid out of his room screaming.

Then the man who owned the motel appeared, coming out from behind the booth for the first time since I’d gotten there. The appearance of his legs gave me some pause, as they were goat legs instead of human ones, but I told myself that there were bigger issues to worry about than a—satyr?. 

“Everybody to the diner! Now!” He screamed. We all scurried there, and the place became crowded quickly, as all the other houses on the block were also succumbed in darkness. 

“Everybody calm down!” Linda shouted, trying to quiet the screaming crowd. “We can’t do anything until you are calm!”

Behind the counter, Roger was doing his best to keep a few furious customers from forcing their way into the back.

More people kept pouring in. The diner was quickly becoming even more packed, and it was obvious why. It was the only place in sight that still had power. The room was in utter disarray. 

The man leading the people trying to get to the back raised his arm in attempt to punch Roger, and I acted out of instinct. I jumped up on the counter and just yelled.

“Enough!” 

Somehow, it actually worked. The noise died instantly, and every head turned toward me.

My stomach twisted, and I was suddenly feeling self-conscious, but I couldn’t back down now. Not even from the shudder that went down my spine when I saw one vampire flashing his fangs at me. “You all need to be calm so that we can fix this,” I continued Linda’s words. 

Roger took advantage of my intervention, shoving the guy backward and slamming down the metal gate that separated the dining area from the the back. Then he grabbed me by the waist, lifted me off the counter, and set me back on the floor with a grin that was half amusement and half pride.

“I knew you would come,” he winked at me. 

On the other side, Linda was smiling at me too. 

“Thank you, Susan,” she said before turning to the crowd. “Now—” she looked at the people angrily—“I know that we all want to deal with the lady in the walls, but as I said before, our iron rod is still in place. It must have been the one at the motel.” She explained. 

“The lady in the walls?” I whispered to Roger. 

“I’ll tell you later,” he muttered back.

“That can’t be right,” a woman said stepping forward in anger. “That rod hasn’t moved in since it was placed. Every time this happens, it’s the one here that fails! Do you really expect us to believe your lies?”

“Why would I lie, dear?” Linda’s voice turned malicious, and for a second I stiffened as if the anger were directed at me. “Our iron rod is perfectly fine, and we have never had a reason to lie about it in the past. So watch your mouth.” 

The small woman opened her mouth to protest, but one look from Linda made her retreat back into the crowd.

“The lady in the walls?” I asked Roger again, this time through gutted teeth. 

He sighed, and while Linda was still dealing with complaints and questions, he grabbed me gently by the arm and led me into the kitchen, closing the doors behind us.

I just stared at him waiting for an explanation. 

“Yes. The lady in the walls.” He scratched the back of his head. “About a century ago, when the town got its electric grid and the diner was built, a bunch of us started to come here. When my grandmother was young, this used to be a normal human town. But when she came here through the electricity, the humans started to go missing. Eventually, they were all taken by her or they fled. We thought we were safe because she hadn’t targeted us yet. But when she ran out of humans to consume she turned to us.”

“Consume?” I asked.

“She pulls them into the walls with her. Nobody knows what happens with the victims,” he explained. “All it takes is a touch.”

A wave of nausea washed over me, followed by a dizzying realization. I had been inches from that wall. If I had been slower, if I had frozen… I would have been consumed. The word itself felt foul. Consumed.

“Ok, ok…” I said, fidgeting with my fingers and trying to calm my racing mind. “What about the iron rods?”

“We had to place them into the walls,” he explained. “One here, because the diner is that lured her in, and another one at the motel, because it’s the first place that got electricity in town. And since iron is like poison to us, we use it to keep her away. But both rods need to be in perfect condition for that to work. And sometimes they move, or corrode. Or maybe the storm caused more damage than we initially thought it did.”

I shuddered, but nodded. 

We both walked back out of the kitchen, where Linda was still arguing with the crowd. 

“Fine,” The satyr from the motel barked. “Let’s say it is the motel’s rod this time. What do we do, huh? The roads are closed. No one’s coming in or out.”

Another voice added, “ Eugene is right! And who’s gonna fix it? We can’t touch the damn thing.”

Before Linda could respond to the panicked woman, a broad-shouldered man stepped forward.  

“I have an idea,” he said, staring straight at me. For a second, I could’ve sworn his eyes turned yellowish. “She can do it.” He pointed right at me, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. And looking back… I guess it kind of was, wasn’t it?

All eyes turned to me again, and I froze. 

“Oh no. No, no, no, no, no,” I whispered, stepping back. My stomach did a weird flip.

Roger’s hand grabbed my arm. “Don’t worry, you won’t have to do anything you don’t want,” he whispered. 

“She’s human,” the man said, raising his voice. “So she can touch the rod. Turn her over right now, boy.”

“Let’s be sensible. The girl wouldn’t even know what to do. And I’m not endangering anymore of my staff,” Linda exposed. 

“She has to!” someone shouted.

“She’s the only one who can!” another added.

“Let’s see how she likes not doing it!” someone else snarled from the back.

The diner erupted into chaos while Linda and Roger were trying to defend me. I was panicking, everybody else was panicking.

And, before I could even process what I was doing, I said it. 

“I’ll do it,” my voice barely over a whisper

Oh no. What did I just do?

I hoped for a second that they hadn’t heard me. But of course they had, because they all got dead quiet before suddenly erupted into cheers. 

My mouth was dry, my brain was blank, and my heart was somewhere in my throat.

Roger’s hand was suddenly on my shoulder. “Come on,” he muttered, steering me toward the back. 

“I didn’t… I mean, I don’t” I tried to explain, but my brain was short-circuiting. My mouth had just done that thing where it acted before I’d given it permission. “I just said it because—I—I don’t even know why I said it!”

“Because you’re scared,” Roger said trying to calm me. “And people do dumb things when they’re scared.”

“I have to do it now,” I said automatically, panic bubbling back up.

“No, you don’t,” he said firmly. “This isn’t on you.”

“I said I would,” I argued, though even as I said it, my voice shook. “Doesn’t that mean I have to?”

He gave me a long look, then sighed and smiled sympathetically.

“Hey. You can do this. It’s not hard,” he said, tone steady enough to make me almost believe him. “Just stay away from the walls, and you’ll be fine. I promise.”

I nodded, though my legs felt like jelly.

“I was going to suggest it myself, really. But I was scared you were going to punch me,” he joked, and I let out a little laugh too. 

Before I could say anything else, the kitchen doors opened and Linda stepped in.

She looked straight at me and, to my horror, she smiled. “I’m proud of you, darling.”

She hugged me and I was speechless. Proud?

Linda turned her attention to Roger this time. “Make sure she knows what to do. I’ll be gone soon.”

Roger nodded. 

“You’re leaving?” I asked. 

“Yes, dear. It’s almost eight.”

 Right. She can’t be here after eight. 

"I need to tell Martha what to handle while you and Roger sort this out. Don’t worry about anything else.”

I nodded again, assuming that Martha was the waitress I saw in the morning (It was.)

After Linda left, Roger and I went into the supply closet, where he pulled out a worn briefcase out of a box on the top shelf. 

I wanted to open it to see what was inside, but he stopped me because even being close to the replacement rod could end up draining him. 

Then, Roger brought Eugene, the owner of the motel, to the back because we needed his help to get in. 

“Over my dead body am I going in there before that nut job in the walls is gone!” The satyr exclaimed. 

“That can be arranged,” retorted Roger. 

“I’d like to see you try, wolf boy.”

Some more choice words were exchanged between the two, but for the sake of brevity, let’s just say that he was less than helpful. 

Thankfully, Roger knew Lucas, a fellow werewolf and his best friend. But most importantly, he had worked at the motel for a few years and knew the layout like the back of his hand. 

The three of us made our way to the motel. The screeching could be heard all the way from the outside, and it made me shiver.

I froze for a second, but I forced myself to keep moving.  

“I’ll stay outside,” Roger offered. “I’ll move through the rooms to call her to me. To distract her from you.”

Lucas hesitated, but ultimately nodded. 

“It’s a good plan,” he admitted. “But be careful.”

We went through the front desk and Lucas led us through a narrow corridor all the way to the boiler room. 

The hallway was so tight that he accidentally brushed his shoulder against the wall when he tried to get past me. Instantly, the face of the lady in the walls bulged from beneath the plaster. 

“Move!” I shouted, grabbing his arm. I yanked him toward the center of the hall, but the space was so small she almost brushed his shoulder. I pulled harder, and we ran, sprinting until the screeches faded. I couldn’t help but wonder if Roger was ok. 

But the lady was smarter than we thought, as she moved down the hallway and extended her clawed hand through the wall, blocking our path. Her other arm also came through, followed by her screeching face. Her eye sockets locked with my eyes and, taking advantage of my fear, she managed to brush the edge of my dress. 

I stood deathly still, prepared to be transported wherever it was that she took her victims, but Lucas tackled me to the ground just in time. 

I managed to get up with his help and we made the last sprint to the boiler room. 

We slammed through the boiler room door, relieved that the satyr hadn’t bothered to lock it, and we finally allowed ourselves some respite and time to breath. 

“Here—” he handed me a key—“the iron rod is inside that little panel behind the boiler. I can’t go any further or it’ll hurt, but I’ll try to distract her while you’re close to the wall.” 

I forced myself to ignore the rational side of my brain that screamed danger, and made my mind blank. If I thought too much I ran into the possibility of giving up and running in the other direction. 

I swallowed hard and stepped forward. 

My hands trembled as I inserted the key into the keyhole. Just as I twisted the key, I had to immediately jump back because a hand shot out of the wall, clawing at the air. 

I bumped my head on the boiler, but luckily my hair protected it from the burn. 

“Hey!” Lucas shouted, slamming his palm against the wall to draw her away. It worked, and she left me alone to do my work. 

I took a deep breath and slowly opened the panel, not sure about what I would find inside. I hoped it would be a dislodged rod so that I wouldn’t have to waste time by getting the new one out. But I was fully prepared to find a corroded one instead. 

However, when I finally opened the panel, the spot was empty. 

There was no other rod.

I didn’t allow myself any time to process that information or ponder the implications and I just opened the briefcase quickly. I got distracted for a second when Lucas screamed behind me. I turned, panic coursing through me, but he just flashed me smile, so I went back to work. 

Thankfully, I turned around just in time because the lady in the walls shot for me next, but I just swung the iron rod from the briefcase at her and she instantly disappeared. 

Lucas screamed again, but I didn’t bother look back, too focused on the finish line. I shoved the rod into its slot, twisting until I felt it click.

Finally, light flooded the room.

I exhaled shakily, looking over my shoulder in triumph to Lucas. 

But there was no Lucas. 

He was gone.

The room was empty and I was alone. 

I entered into a state of shock, just staring at the spot where I’d last seen him when Roger burst through the door, breathless. “You did it!” he said, grabbing me into a hug before I could even speak. “You did it, you’re amazing!”

I made an attempt to shove him off me, but my hands felt pathetically weak. Still, he retreated, and his eyes followed mine’s direction. Then he looked around the room and then back at me. 

“Where’s Lucas?” He asked, tearing up. Because he already knew the answer better than I did. 

I tried to apologize, but he told me that he knew that it wasn’t my fault. He knew how stubborn he was. There was nothing I could’ve done. He knew that. 

I still blame myself, though. 

We just walked out of the motel in silence and back to the diner. 

The rest of the night blurred into a haze. I can’t remember exactly what happened, mostly because I was too exhausted and dazed to be able to recall. 

I just remember that after dawn came, I collapsed into bed. 

So yes, I went back to the diner. And I’ll keep going back. 

Because, for now, I’m trapped here. 

At least, it help me feel safer that everybody seems to think of me as some sort of town hero, despite not feeling like much of a hero myself. 

And, to make matters worse, I burnt my hand on the boiler sometime during the whole ordeal, and I can barely use it properly at my job. 

Oh, I almost forgot. 

Yesterday, I finally told Linda and Roger about the missing original rod. They asked me not to mention it to anyone else until they figure out what happened. But I figure it’s fine to tell you, since none of you even know where this town is.

Because if I’m going to have to stay here, I need to make sure it’s safe. For both my sake and everybody else’s. 

I feel like I owe them that much, after Lucas died helping me.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Maybe that way, one day [I’ll stop feeling this guilt. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ocdzun/i_almost_became_a_human_sacrifice_after_my_night/)
