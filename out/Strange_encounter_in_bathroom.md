This happened quite a long time ago, I think I was around 12-13 years old at the time I don’t remember exactly.

I used to travel to the US a lot with my family during school vacations which is from December to February in my country. Every year we travelled to Florida and stayed a few days in Miami and a few days in Orlando. 

In South Miami there is this small mall called Sunset Place. On this day at some point I needed to go to the bathroom and I specifically remember I went to the one on the ground floor, my mother was in another floor with my sister and my dad was with me. He told me to go to the bathroom and he would wait right outside for me. I entered the bathroom and there was no one inside it, so I just picked the last stall and sat down on the toilet.

A few seconds later someone walks in the bathroom and the person stopped in front of my stall, I don’t remember how the restroom was displayed but I remember assuming the guy was using a urinal, a few seconds after I hear him coming closer to my door and when I looked forward the guy was peeking through the gap of the door and of the structure of the stall. I didn’t know what to say or do so I just looked down and pretended I didn’t see him. After that, he proceeded to enter the stall besides mine, and today I’m pretty sure he was touching himself, I was sitting on my stall as I had no idea on what to do because even though I didn’t fully understand what was happening I was scared. A few seconds after he moaned loud enough for me to hear “Ay que rico”. After that I remember talking to myself to just get out of there fast, so I just pulled my shorts up and ran out the bathroom.

At the time I didn’t fully understand what was happening or what he said but I knew that for some reason I shouldn’t stay there longer.

As I got older, and started understanding what happens in the real world and that not everyone is a good person, I realized what had really happened in there and understood what the words he said meant. I feel really lucky because I now know that that situation could have ended in a much worse way.

Today when I remember this situation I get a little bit pissed with my dad for staying outside and not coming in with me to the bathroom. But this was one of the few times in my life where he didn’t do it. 

I guess this serves as a reminder for all current and future parents, don’t ever leave your child unattended even for a second, my heart sinks a bit every time I think of this and what could have happened in there if I didn’t immediately run out.

Ps: In case anyone asks, the reason I could remember what he said and later look for its meaning is because I am from South America and although my main language is not Spanish, it is quite similar to my language so it was easy to remember.
