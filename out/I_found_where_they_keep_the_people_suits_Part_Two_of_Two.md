[PART ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1808rrw/i_found_where_they_keep_the_people_suits_part_one/)  
  
I was really upset on my drive back to my parents, but I kept everything to myself despite my mother’s questions about how the trip had gone.  I didn’t know what I believed, and I didn’t want my grandmother thinking I went back saying that she was crazy or something.  So instead I went back home the next day, and after that I’d call and check on my grandmother every couple of weeks.   
  
Neither of us ever mentioned what we’d talked about that day, and my grandmother never questioned why I was suddenly calling her with some regularity.  We’d just chat a few minutes, she’d tell me she was doing okay, and that was that until the next phone call.  
  
And then she stopped answering the phone.  
  
I could of called my parents, of course.  They were way closer, and if I’d let them know I was worried, they’d have driven over right away.  Yet something stopped me from doing that.  They didn’t know I was calling and checking on her, after all, and there’d be more questions if they suddenly found out.  It might sound silly, but that felt like a betrayal.  She had trusted me with her fears, and I owed it to her to check on things before I started announcing her strange stories to the world.  
  
So I got on a plane and flew back in that night.  It was after nine before I made it to her house, and the street was dark aside from the occasional streetlight or lit windowpane in some neighbor’s house down the street.  Just like before, I saw no people out, and when I reached my grandmother’s house, it looked as dark and quiet as a tomb.  
  
Stomach clenched, I went up on the porch and knocked on the front door.  I hoped for shuffling footsteps or at least Junie barking up a storm, but there was nothing.  Part of me wasn’t surprised.  I’d called ten times since first missing her that morning, after all.  
  
Turning around, I looked out at the dark rows of houses.  Still, what did that leave?  Did I call my parents?  The cops?  She could be laying in there dead, but wouldn’t the dog at least make noise?  And what if she was right about the neighbors?  It seemed impossible, but what if she was right?    
  
I gritted my teeth.  No, that was crazy.  These were just people, and wherever my grandmother was—a doctor’s appointment, the hospital, the grocery store, it wasn’t some sinister plot.  That was stupid.  So I was just…I was just going to go over and ask one of them for help.  
  
I realized I was holding my breath and forced myself to let it go.  Shit.  Fuck.  Okay, I was going to call Mom before I went over.  
  
“Hey, honey.  Everything okay?”  
  
“Um, yeah, probably.  Look, I got worried about grandma, so I came over and am checking on her.”  
  
“You…what?  You’re back?  Since when?”  
  
“Just now.  Like, tonight.  I know, it’s weird.  I’ll explain later.  But I’m about to go ask the neighbors if they’ve seen her, because I can’t get her to the door.”  
  
“We’ll start coming right…”  
  
“No!  No.  Just let me check.  It’ll take you too long to get here.  I’m just…I’m about to go ask one of the neighbors.  Um, the Rosens.  They’re across the street.  If I don’t get an answer, I’m calling you back and heading that way.  But if you don’t hear from me in thirty minutes, you call the cops and send them over here, okay?”  
  
“I don’t…”  
  
“Just do it, okay?  Promise?”  
  
“Yes, I promise, but I…”  
  
“Okay.  Going now before I lose my nerve.  Love you.  Talk to you in a few minutes.  The Rosens.  Remember.”  
  
My skin was prickled and tingling as I stepped out onto the asphalt and started crossing over, walking faster through the patches of shadow despite my resolution to stay calm and not freak myself out until I knew something was really wrong.  The exterior of the Rosen house was fresh and clean, with a well-manicured lawn and healthy, trimmed bushes lining both sides of the walk up to the front door.  I hesitated for a moment when I raised my hand to knock, my fist trembling like a question mark before finally coming down once, twice, three times.  
  
I waited, straining to hear something, anything, from either behind the door or somewhere out in the night surrounding me.  At first there was nothing, and after what felt like a full minute of waiting, I was debating either knocking again or going ahead and running back to my car.  But then I heard it.  A distant creak of wood, like someone walking up steps, and then a door squeaking open and then shut.  Then softer footfalls as it approached the front door and opened it.  
  
“Hello, my dear.”  
  
I blinked as I stared at the woman standing in front of me.  I didn’t know what Anna Rosen looked like, but this wasn’t that different from what my grandmother had described—attractive, older, long brown hair.  And her expression wasn’t unpleasant—politely inquisitive came to mind.  And yet…I suppressed a shiver as I forced a smile.  
  
“Hello, ma’am.  Are you Anna Rosen?”  
  
The woman quirked a smile.  “That’s what they call me.”  
  
“Um, my grandmother, Mrs. Springer?  She lives across the way, down at the end of the street there?  I think you know her, right?”  
  
The woman nodded, her smile falling away.  “Oh yes.  I love Mathilda.  Is everything okay?”  
  
“I just…well, I hope it is.  I just haven’t been able to get ahold of her, and with um, with her being older and all, I just wanted to make sure she was okay, but she didn’t answer the door.”  
  
Her eyes widened slightly as she nodded.  “You poor dear.  Come in, come in.”  
  
I felt a level of fear and revulsion at the invitation as I took an involuntary step back.  “Oh, I don’t want to be a bother.”  
  
She shook her head.  “Nonsense.  No bother at all.  Come in and I’ll help you find out what’s going on.”  
  
This was stupid.  This woman was a little weird maybe, but she was being perfectly nice.  Stepping forward, I couldn’t help but add.  “Just for a moment.  I called my parents and told them I was coming over here, and if I don’t call back with…um, with news about my grandmother soon, they’ll get worried and send someone.”  
  
I thought I saw the woman pause as she was turning to move further into the hall, but if so, it was only a moment before she flashed me another smile.  “Of course, we wouldn’t want that.  Give me just a minute.  Your gran gave me a key to her house in case of an emergency.  This was years ago, so I have to go find it, but it won’t take too long.  It’s upstairs.  If you can just wait here.”  
  
“S-sure.”  I clasped my hands to keep them from trembling as I watched her go down the hall and turn into what must be a stairwell, as I heard her footsteps creaking as she went up to the second floor.  I needed to chill out.  This was all just some kind of mis…but those hadn’t been the stairs she used before.  My mind was jittering fast and sharp, jumping tracks from placating me to pointing out something I’d missed at first.  
  
Those sounds of her coming to the door, they had come from the left.  And from down.  A basement maybe.  
  
Looking down the hall, I saw a closed door on the left side.    
  
So what.  I can’t go check it.  What if she comes back?    
  
If she has nothing to hide, at most I’ll get scolded for being rude.  
  
Another part of my mind piped up.  And if Grandma is right, you’re trapped down there if she finds you.  
  
This was followed by a third thought, each word piercing me as it sounded in the caverns of my brain.  If you’re right, Grandma and Junie need your help.  
  
Fuck.  
  
Walking quietly as I could, I eased over to the door and tried the knob.  It opened easily, squeaking softly even with my efforts to be slow and gentle.  Wooden steps led down into a dark abyss.  Fucking basement.  Turning on my phone’s light, I started down, leaving the door partially open for the light, even though I knew it would be obvious if I didn’t beat her back up to the main floor.  Just a quick look and I’m done.  
  
“Grandma?  Junie?”  I kept my voice a harsh whisper, but it sounded loud in the black, and the small light from my phone barely reached the wall at the bottom of the stairs.  Still, it looked like a normal basement.  I walked on down to the bottom, panning around at the rest of the space.  
  
Washer and dryer.  Shelves of books.  Cardboard boxes.  A giant hole in the far wall.  
  
What the…  
  
Heart hammering, I stepped closer.  It wasn’t normal construction, but it wasn’t normal decay either.  Instead, it looked like someone had torn out a five by two section of wall…no, maybe pushed it in from the outside, because I could still see bits of concrete and dirt scattered across the floor like there had been a small explosion at one point…and beyond that hole…it was a tunnel.  
  
“Where’d you go, dear?  Down into the dark?  Do you think your sweet granny is down there?”  
  
There was no real thought in what I did next.  Just fear, blind panic and fear and instinct that said the tunnel, unknown and terrifying as it was, had to be better than staying where I was.  It wasn’t until I was plunging into it that I realized something had briefly caught my hair—the hand of some second creeping stranger, maybe, before my speed and momentum tore me free.  Glancing back with the light, I caught a glimpse of movement even as I heard her coming down the stairs quickly.    
  
Oh God.  There really were two of them.  
  
I turned back to running, hunched and gasping through the tunnel as it twisted some one way and then another before splitting into several branches.  It…It goes all over.  All over the neighborhood.  And I didn’t know which way to…  
  
Reaching into my pocket, I pulled out my keys.  I didn’t know how far away I was exactly, or if the signal would go through that much earth, but I had to try.  Maybe it would get someone’s attention at least.  
  
I hit the panic button once, twice, three and four times, looking behind me for pursuers while straining for any sign of my alarm.  I couldn’t wait here any longer or they’d just…wait.  I heard it.  
  
I picked the tunnel that seemed the closest to the direction of my car alarm, moving faster and faster as I heard myself pass the alarm overhead.  The tunnel opened into another room, though this one wasn’t entirely dark.  At both ends were little duck nightlights, after all.    My grandmother had put them down here after I got scared in the basement once when I was eight or nine.  I remember her hugging me as grandpa put the nightlights in the next day.  She told me I never had to worry again, because the ducks would always be down here to protect me.  
  
Now the farther duck lit a length of cloth—some kind of thick canvas maybe—and on it, were two spread out mounds of skin and hair.  Shaking, I held up my flashlight’s light to see it all clearly.  One mound was much larger.  The skin was pale and wrinkled, like that of an old woman.  The other?  Was just the color and texture of fur—the fur of a little terrier that my grandma had named Junie Mae.  
  
“Oh Jesus.”  
  
There was sound in the tunnels now, a slow, stealthy sound, but clear and coming closer.  Forcing myself to turn from it, I ran to the stairs and up them.  I slammed into the far wall when I went through the door up top, bouncing off it and running to the front door.  Twisting the bolt and undoing the chain, I was opening it when I heard a voice behind me.  
  
“Where are you going?  Didn’t you come to visit?  Come here so we can talk.”  
  
Turning back, I saw my grandmother’s face peering from around the edge of the basement door.  Her cheek was drooping slightly until something underneath twitched it into place.  Behind her, I heard a watery sound that slowly became the excited bark of a small dog.  
  
“You fuckers.  Go fuck yourselves.”  
  
I slammed the door behind me, leaping off the porch and getting into my car as fast as possible before punching the button and throwing the car into reverse.  I sped out of the neighborhood as fast as my car would go, and I didn’t slow down until I was on the interstate and making a crying phone call to my mother.  
  
I don’t blame her for being confused.  I was hysterical and sobbing, and anything she could understand would have sounded crazy.  So she said they’d meet me halfway at a gas station in between.  I was still terrified of being run off the road or snatched at any moment, but I didn’t want to lead them to my parents’ house either, so I agreed.    
  
When we got there, after I hugged them and calmed down enough to explain what happened, to explain all of it, they called the police.  The version my father told them was very pared down from what I’d said, and I could tell they thought I was in shock and talking out of my head, but they could also see by how dirty and upset I was that something had happened, and they’d had no luck calling my grandmother either.  So instead my father said his little girl had gone over to see her grandmother and she couldn’t find her, and something had happened while she was there.  That maybe I’d been attacked.  
  
He told me and Mom to go in their car to the police station while he went out and met the cops at grandmother’s house.  I tried to get him not to go, but he insisted, and he was about to leave when 911 called him back.  They told him to go with us to the police station instead of coming there.  When he asked why, there was a pause and then the woman on the other end of the line said it was because there was a fire there now, and it was too dangerous.  
  
We found out a couple of hours later that the fire wasn’t just confined to my grandmother’s house, but was the entire neighborhood.  Less than an hour after I left, a chain of explosions linked to bad gas lines had detonated several of the homes, as well as large portions of the street, as significant damage was done via underground lines as well.  All told, every house on the block went up, and it was hours before the firefighters were able to get the flames under control.    
  
While it’s presumed that many people may have died, it’s been a month and no bodies have been found.  Weirdly enough, after my initial statement, no one has questioned me again or accused me of being involved.  I don’t hear anything about it on the news, and no one seems overly troubled that an entire streetful of people seems to have up and vanished.  Instead, everyone is calling it an accident and seems very interested in moving on.    
  
Well, almost everyone.  
  
Because last week I got a call from a Detective Morris.  I didn’t answer at the time because I’ve been screening all my calls lately, but when I heard the voicemail, I looked him up before calling back.  It was weird.  He was a detective with the police department investigating the fires, but he was assigned to sexual assault cases, not murders or property crimes.  On a whim, I googled his home address before calling him back.  
  
“Hello?”  
  
“Hey, Detective Morris.  You called me about the fire on my grandmother’s street?”  
  
“Yes.  Yes, I did.  I was hoping I could meet with you soon.  Show you something of interest.”  
  
“Mmmhmm.  What’s that?”  
  
“A tunnel.  A partial underground tunnel that seems to run underneath your grandmother’s neighborhood.”  
  
“Yeah.  I bet.  Detective?”  
  
“Yes?”  
  
“Do you live at 415 Jasmine Street?”  
  
“Um, well, yes I do.”  
  
“The Jasmine Street that is like less than 500 yards from the street my grandmother lived on?”  
  
A pause and then.  “Yes, that’s right.  That’s why I’ve taken a personal interest in the case.  I need to show you what’s in this tunnel.  It’s…ah…it’s really something.”  
  
“I told you before.  Go fuck yourselves.”
