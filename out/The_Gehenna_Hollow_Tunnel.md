A few years ago, I started researching some of the history and lore of Southeast Ohio. It's on the edge of Appalachia, where the traditions of the mountains and the farms and factories of the Midwest overlap. The roots of this place run deep, and the stories I've uncovered are as varied as the people who call these hills home.

I've tried to avoid those stories that have already been told, and to find people and places who haven't yet shared their experiences outside of warnings to children or after a few drinks around a bonfire. It took some time, but the rumors and tales eventually led to discoveries - some of which I'm still trying to wrap my head around. The following is one such discovery.

\---

Garrett showed up 15 minutes early, right as I was wheeling the old Magnavox into one of the media viewing rooms, and trying unsuccessfully not to disturb the handful of other students watching me struggle. He waved sheepishly and slid the bag from his shoulder onto the folding plastic table. I shook his hand and gestured for him to take one of the rolling chairs after it became clear that he wasn’t going to offer to help me move the television.

Over half of the Haning Library basement was dedicated to the school’s collection of non-print media - photographs, film, audio recordings and the like. When Garrett Roberts had reached out to me about sharing some video of an “unexplained event”, he’d specified that we needed access to some more “vintage” equipment to make it work. Thankfully, I’d known just the place to suggest. Like most small schools, Atwood College was slow to upgrade their tech, and when they did, it ended up in Media Equipment Storage. Which is where I’d found this 20-inch CRT beauty–complete with matching VCR–and signed it out for the evening.

I gave up once the TV cart’s castors dug into the old uneven carpet of the booth and refused to budge. Deciding it was good enough, I wiped the sweat from my brow and began extricating my tripod from my backpack. "Do you mind if I record this? I'm not the fastest note taker, and it helps to go back and review for anything I might have missed."

Garrett’s tired eyes studied me for a moment, then he gave a weak shrug. "I guess I don't mind. Though...if you're going to try to record the TV with that," he said, pointing at the phone I was mounting to the tripod, "it's probably not going to work."

"Yeah, the rolling blur from videoing these old tube televisions means I probably won't capture much detail with this, but maybe after--"

"That's...not really what I meant," Garrett interrupted. "You'll...well, you'll see what I mean." From his bag he produced a chunky camcorder, in mint condition despite its age, along with a power cord and composite cables.

"Damn, blast from the past" I remarked.

Garret hooked the camcorder to the old TV. Once we were settled in, I turned the lights down in the listening room and started recording. "This is Cole James, and here with me is Garrett Roberts, who reached out to me regarding his video of a recent...ah, what did you say you were doing when you shot this?"

"A research project on the iron industry in Southeast Ohio," Garrett said. “Mostly about the old furnaces and the derelict railroads still found around the region. Have you ever been to any of them?"

I nodded. "I like to go kayaking at the local lakes sometimes. I've seen the furnaces at Lake Hope and Lake Vesuvius."

"Hope Furnace was the one I specifically wanted to visit, because it also has the Moonville and Kings Hollow railroad tunnels nearby."

"Moonville? Isn't that the one that's supposed to be haunted?" I phrased it to sound like I wasn't entirely familiar, but of course I'd heard of it. Anyone who's studied paranormal happenings in Southeast Ohio knows about Moonville. Supposedly, there have been multiple sightings of an apparition holding a lantern, or the unexplained roar of a train at night. It's easily accessible, photogenic, and they even host annual ghost tours.

"Yeah. I suppose so," Garrett said, shifting uncomfortably in his chair. "We...well, Josh and Ally thought it'd be a good spot to take pictures for their photography class. They were doing a group project on documenting abandoned places. So I invited them along.”

"Josh and Ally are friends of yours?"

"Yes. We all went to high school together. Josh and I were friends back then, and Ally--Alyssa--we took some classes together last year and started hanging out."

"And the video you have, that was you recording the day you spent together? Going to the furnace and the old train tunnels?"

"Yes."

"How long ago was this?"

"Just a few weeks ago."

I made a few notes in my journal. “Ok, whenever you're ready, Garrett."

Garrett pressed the play button on the camcorder. It whirred and clicked as the TV screen went from static to blue, then to black, and then suddenly:

"--even still works, does it?"

The image on the screen whipped up to slowly focus on a smiling young man with a scruffy dark beard and ponytail. He's driving while Garrett is filming from the passenger seat.

"No, it's recording right now,” I heard Garrett say from behind the camera. “Say hi, Josh.”

"Hi, Josh."

"You're a fuckin' dweeb." A female voice comes from behind Josh and Garrett. The camera pans to show a young woman in a baggy neon green hoodie with short purple hair and piercings. Next to her, another young woman is giggling. She's the opposite of the first--petite, blonde, wearing a North Face jacket and yoga pants.

"This is Ally and Maddie. Say hi, girls,” Garrett says. Maddie gives a chipper "hi!" and a wave. Ally says, "Sup, bitches!" while flashing mock gang signs.

"And the party is here in the back, fools!" A younger, clean-shaven version of Josh leans over the middle seat, between the two girls. He gives dual-fisted middle fingers to the camera.

"Annnnd that's Noah," Garrett sighs. "Ok, seriously now guys, I do actually need to show some of this to my professor at some point, so when I say so, you'll need to–"

"Not be a bunch of dicks?" Ally quips.

"Yes, exactly. And I'm going to record a segment right now, so if you all could just be quiet for a few min–”

“Why wouldn’t you just record it on your phone?” Noah asks. “You’ve got an iPhone, don’t you? That’s going to give you way better quality than that dinosaur.”

“Because I’m going to use some of the video for my own project,” Josh says. “I think that camera is sick. I offered to buy it off of Roberts, but his asking price was too high.”

“How much?” Maddie asked.

“Three hundred bucks! Well I said I wouldn’t go any higher than two, and I’d massage his nipples for five minutes.”

“Come on, Josh…”

“I already told you, Roberts, take it or leave it.” Josh grins widely. “But no, seriously, those old Sony Handycams kick ass. That one’s a Hi8, good ol’ fashioned analog. You know that 25 years ago, they recalled a bunch of them because they can see through clothing?”

“Bullshit,” Noah groans from the back.

“He’s right,” Alyssa says. “I saw a YouTube video about it. Some of them had night vision, and the infrared light would, like, show a girl's nipples and pubes if they wore the right kind of clothing.”

“Gross!” Maddie says, making a face.

“That explains why Roberts won’t let it go!” Noah cackles.

“Can we stop talking about nipples?” Ally groans. “Josh, tell me why you invited your brother along again?”

Josh rolls his eyes. “Because I’m supposed to keep this dipshit entertained for some reason. It was the only way I could borrow this sweet ride for all of us,” he adds, patting the steering wheel.

“More room for shenanigans,” Ally smirks. “So how close are we to Lake Hope now?”

Josh looks at the phone mounted on the dash. “Um, about 20 more minutes.”

“And I still need to record my intro before we get there,” Garrett says. “So, please, can I just have a couple minutes, guys?”

“Come on now, everyone,” Josh reprimands. “Let the man do his thing.”

“Thanks, Josh,” Garrett says sarcastically, then he clears his throat. “‘In the decades before the Civil War, thousands of tons of iron ore were mined, processed, and shipped out of the dozens of furnaces that dotted Southeast Ohio, fed by the hard-working men that came looking for prosperity and the virgin timber that covered these hills. Linking them all was a vast, hastily-constructed network of–”

Garrett stopped the video, then hit the fast forward. “We can skip this part, it’s not that exciting. Just more of this for a while. Me talking, them goofing off.”

I scribbled a few notes. “So Josh had to bring Noah, and what about Maddie? Is she Ally’s friend?”

“Cousin,” he corrected, but gave no more information. Things were quiet for a minute before Garrett stopped the tape again. “This is when we were at Moonville.”

I leaned forward in anticipation. The video showed the group at the opening of a large brick tunnel, over 30 feet high and nearly as wide. Graffiti covered the arched brick walls up to about ten feet. Panning across the several tourists crowded inside, Garrett had focused the camera on a young man holding the leash of a massive, shaggy Leonberger, who was getting much attention from Ally and Maddie.

“What did you say the dog’s name was?” Josh asks.

“Gunther,” the man says. “He’s a ham, loves attention. He’s got quite the following on Instagram and Tik Tok.”

“I’m adding him right now,” Ally squeals.

“It’s goodboygunther17, all one word. Yeah, that’s me,” the man adds, looking over her shoulder.

“Oh my gosh!” she squeaks even higher. The camera wanders up to the stone sign over the tunnel engraved with the word “Moonville”.

“So do you live around here?” Maddie asks, her hands still buried in Gunther’s fur. “We’re from down in Grand River, near Lafayette.”

The man nodded. “I’m in Logan, so not too far. It was way too crowded at the other parks today, so I came down here. But it’s honestly not much better. We might end up walking all the way to King’s Hollow if he’s up to it.”

“How far is that?” Josh asks, snapping pictures.

“About three miles. The rail trail is great for walking, nice and flat and paved. Is that what you’re doing today?”

Josh straightens up and checks his Nikon. “Well, we’re not sure. We were supposed to be getting photos of abandoned places, but like you said, too many people. That’s what we get for coming on a Saturday when the weather’s this nice.”

“You’re trying for shots of old rail tunnels?” the man askes.

“Any old railroad or iron furnace stuff, really.” Garrett says from behind the camera. “But there’s not that many left that you can easily get to.”

The man’s face lights up. “Have you been to the one out on Gehenna Hollow?”

Maddie stands, giving Gunther a final scratch behind an ear. “Where’s that?”

“Not far from here. I just went a few weeks ago. It’s not marked on the maps, I sort of just found it by accident. Take 183 west from here for ten minutes, then take Sauder Road. Gehenna Hollow is the second left. The tunnel was maybe a mile or two out, right next to the road. Can’t miss it.”

“Is it haunted?” Noah asks.

The man laughs. “Maybe! All these old tunnels have a ghost story or two, don’t they?”

Garrett suddenly started fast-forwarding the tape again. He’s visibly uncomfortable, but before I can think of a question to break the silence, he stops the tape and presses Play again. Garrett is back in the passenger seat of the van, filming a dusty gravel single track lined with trees so thick, they could have been driving through an abandoned tunnel by accident.

“God, I hope I don’t meet anyone on this fucking road,” Josh can be heard saying. “You know how good ol’ boys in jacked-up trucks like to drive.” He begins singing in a nasally twang. “Drinkin’ beer, shootin’ deer in my big truck! Back roads, lickin’ toads in my big truuuuck!”

“God, shut up!” Noah yells from somewhere in the back.

“Hey, that was good, you respect your elders. Driver controls the music, that means you–*shit!*”

There are the sounds of shrieking and tires scrabbling against gravel. The video blurs as the camera tumbles to the floor.

“What the fuck was *that*, Josh?” Ally hisses.

“Did you see it? We found it!”

Garrett picks up the camcorder and swings it around to the passenger window. There, almost completely shrouded in foliage, is a massive black hole in the hillside.

Josh maneuvers the minivan onto the opposite shoulder. The crew exits into the dappled light barely breaking through the dense canopy above, made all the more ethereal by the cloud of glittering road dust now hanging in the air.

“Alright everyone, I brought extra flashlights.” Josh tosses a small toolbox to Ally before turning dig his camera bag and tripod from the rear of the van. “Garrett, are you going to need extra light in there? I’ve got an LED stand and a battery pack if you want it.”

“Maybe,” Garrett replies. “But this does have night vision. I might try that out first.”

“Just don’t aim that at me,” Maddie says, tying her jacket around her waist.

“Oh, no, I would never do anything like that, don’t worry.” Garrett lets the camera linger on her for several seconds.

“This place is badass,” Ally exclaims, jogging in and out of view towards the black maw of the hollow.

Unlike Moonville, this tunnel completely lacks masonry or supports of any kind, appearing more like a natural cave than something carved by hand. The beams of the group’s flashlights sweep the rough sandstone walls, stained by iron ore and crusted minerals that seep out of the multitude of cracks in the rock. The floor of the tunnel is an uneven mixt of sand, mud, and broken stones–some rather large–dislodged from the ceiling nearly three stories above.

A flash briefly illuminates the cavernous space. Josh is snapping away with his Nikon as Ally passes him, pushing deeper into the darkness. A half-circle of light from the other end of the tunnel can be seen in the far distance, perhaps a hundred yards or more, though it’s hard to tell as the camcorder struggles to maintain focus in the dim light.

“Hey guys, come check this out,” Ally calls, her voice sounding unusually distant despite her only being a few dozen feet away. Chalk it up to a poor microphone and the tunnel’s unique acoustics, I figured.

The camera moves closer, occasionally tilting down as Garrett navigates around the rocks and puddles. Ally’s flashlight sweeps across a pool of water that stretches from wall to wall in front of her. “Look,” she says as she points the beam in front and away from her. The water kept going until the light could no longer reach it.

“Looks like this is as far as we can go,” Garrett says.

“That sucks,” Ally pouts, tossing a pebble into the water. It disappears immediately under the rippling surface. “I wonder how deep it is. If it’s not that far–”

“There’s no guarantee there aren’t any big holes further out. This tunnel seems unfinished. I didn’t see any signs of the old railway outside leading up to it.”

“It could just be buried under all the trees and shit,” Ally shrugs, stepping away from the water’s edge. “This has gotta be, what, 150 years old?”

“At least, so it’s possible. But I checked all the maps I have on the way here. They don’t show any rail lines going through this area, and their records were pretty good. Kinda hard to lose a railroad.”

Garrett walks back towards the light of the entrance, passing Josh and Noah. Maddie is at the mouth of the tunnel, poking around at the ground with a trekking pole.

“What do you think?” Garrett asks as he approaches her. She looks at the camera with a wan smile and a shrug before turning back to flipping rocks over with the pole. “It’s alright, I guess.”

“Not a fan of the dark?”

“Not really.”

Garrett coughs. “So, you, uh, you’re staying with Ally at her place?”

Maddie nods. “Her dad is my uncle. My parents are on a cruise for two weeks.”

“Oh, cool. I mean–it sucks that you, uh, that you couldn’t, uh, couldn’t go with them. That they just left you behind. Do you, uh, do you go to Atwood?”

“No”, she says, flipping another rock. A few black beetles scurry off to find other hiding places. “I was going for teaching at Marshall but I kinda hated it, so I’m taking a year off.”

“Oh, ok. Cool.”

There’s a long, awkward moment where Garrett continues filming Maddie as she continues flipping stones. I looked over at him as we watched. He was still, though I thought I could see his lip quiver in the light from the TV.

“Hey, check this out,” Maddie says suddenly. She bends over and brushes leaves aside to reveal the corner of what appears to be a rectangular sheet of thick metal. She strains to pry it loose from the ground. “It’s really heavy. Can you help me?”

“Uh, yeah, hold on.” The video stopped, then immediately picks back up, but now the sign is lying uncovered on the bare ground in front of the tunnel. It’s roughly the size of a poster board, and though the patina of soil and rust, I can just make out the raised lettering:

**GEHENNA TUNNEL 1857**

“This is…this is really amazing,” Garrett says reverently. “We might be the first people to see this sign in a really long time.”

Maddie brushed more of the dirt and rust off the sign. Below the date, there appeared to be deep gouges in the metal. It was hard to make out on the video, but apparently they were more letters.

“‘*Don’t follow them*’,” she reads. “That’s weird. Don’t follow who?”

“Hey!” At the sudden voice, the camera lurches up to reveal Ally at the mouth of the tunnel.

“Jeez, Ally, you scared us!”

“‘Us?’ You’re the only one that jumped,” she smirks. Then she notices the sign. “Woah, sick! Did you guys just find this?”

“Yeah. Well, Maddie found it, over there in the weeds.”

“That’s dope. Wait, what does that say…” Ally mouths the words dug into the metal and her eyes grow wide.

“Kinda creepy, isn’t it?” Maddie says quietly.

“Yeah…” Ally bites her lip nervously, peering back over her shoulder into the tunnel.

“So, I was all about this place at first, right? But like, the longer I look around…have you noticed that this place seems a little bit…off?”

“Well, it’s a big dark tunnel in the middle of the woods, what did you expect?” says Garrett.

“It’s not just that…I mean, you know how you said it’s not on your maps? Well I tried to look it up online before we ran out of service. I couldn’t find anything.”

“Maybe just not very many people know it’s out here. If it was abandoned before it was used, then it was probably just forgotten about. We’re pretty far out in the boonies.”

“That’s another thing,” Ally continues. “Places like this attract rednecks like a NASCAR barbeque. And they always leave shit everywhere. But there’s not a single piece of trash in that tunnel. No beer bottles, no condom wrappers, not even graffiti.”

“This is probably private property, right?” Maddie suggests. “Someone might’ve cleaned it up recently.”

“But why? And also, if the tunnel was abandoned before it was finished, why make a sign for it?”

“Maddie’s probably right,” Garrett says, somewhat defensively. “There’s probably someone that looks after the tunnel. They could have made the sign, we have no idea how old it actually is.”

Ally sighs. “Maybe. It’s just…sorry. I’m probably being stupid.”

“No…no, I don’t think you are, Ally,” Maddie intones. “I don’t like this place either. We should get Josh and Noah and tell them we want to leave.”

“Yeah…yeah, OK,” says Garrett. “I’ve got enough footage, I can record the rest later. Do you think it’d be alright to take the sign?”

Ally chews on one of her nails. “Maybe not. If someone actually does take care of this place, they’ll want their sign back. And if not…” she trailed off.

They make their way back into the cave. The video was too dark to make out much, just the occasional flares from someone’s flashlight. Then the muddy screen turned to shades of green and black. With the camcorder’s night vision active, I could now clearly see Josh recording Noah with his phone in one hand and flashlight in the other. Noah, meanwhile, has his ear pressed against the wall of the tunnel, his eyes shut and brow furrowed in concentration.

“Dude, what are you–”

Noah holds up a finger to shush Ally. Josh looks at the camera and gives an exaggerated shrug. Finally, Noah speaks. “Come on, someone else put your ear up to the wall. Tell me you don’t hear that?”

“Hear what, dork?” Josh snarks, though he continues videoing.

“I’ll do it,” Maddie says suddenly, and marches over to where Noah is listening. She pulls her long hair aside and presses an ear against the rough stone. After a short time, she turns and looks at Noah, then at everyone else. Her eyes are huge and black on the screen.

“It…it sounds like a train.”

“I fuckin’ told you, man!” Noah exclaims, jabbing a finger at his brother. “You can even *feel* it. Like a low rumble coming from somewhere.”

Ally crosses her arms. “Seriously? You’re just…you’re both making this up.”

“No, Alyssa, I hear it. I really can. You try it, please?” Maddie implores.

“Fine,” Ally huffs before placing her own head against the wall next to Maddie. She stands motionless for about a half a minute, then pulls away shaking her head. “All I hear is maybe some wind. Something dripping. Caves make weird noises sometimes, you know.”

“Maybe there’s another railroad not far from here. Sound can carry pretty far through the ground,” Josh suggests.

“None that are still operational,” Garret notes. “The closest one still in use is at least 20 miles away.”

I certainly couldn’t hear anything that sounded like a train–not surprising, given the old TV’s single speaker and the camcorder’s terrible microphone. What I *did* notice was that the picture seemed to be degrading as the video continued. This was to be expected, as the tape was likely as old as the camcorder itself. But it was a rather interesting coincidence that the static had only started increasing right as Noah told everyone to be quiet.

Maddie steps away from the tunnel wall, sharing an anxious look with Ally. “Hey Josh, some of us are getting some serious creepies from this place.” The camera trained on Josh’s face, revealing a raised eyebrow. “What I *mean* is,” Ally continues, “Is that I want to get the fuck out of here.”

Josh looks around the group and gives a resigned sigh. “Ok, fine. We’ll call it a day.” A minute later, he could be seen packing up his camera gear, and Ally was already making for the tunnel entrance. Garrett jogged to catch up with her, the green-and-black screen flaring to nearly white as even the heavily-filtered sunlight overwhelmed the sensor. They were nearly to the opening when Josh called out from behind them.

“Guys! Hey–*shit!* Guys! Get back here! Hey *stop!*”

In the next instant, Garrett and the camera were running back into the tunnel, the video bouncing wildly. Josh was still yelling, quickly joined by Ally and Noah. Once the jarring motion stopped and the night vision caught up, I could see that Garrett was now standing next to Josh. Noah was in front of them, just beginning to step into the dark pool that flooded half the tunnel. And several yards in front of them was Maddie, walking slowly through the water.

No, not *through* water. *On it*.

Each footfall made only the slightest ripple, as if the pool were only millimeters deep. Noah, meanwhile, was nearly up to his waist. His waves caught up to Maddie, lapping at her ankles, though she didn’t seem to notice. She just continued onward, step after dry step.

The camera abruptly switched back to normal color. It was dark, but as Garrett zoomed in, I could easily see Maddie silhouetted against the far opening of the tunnel, the bright green sunlit forest just beyond. Josh and Ally continued to yell, their voices distorting. A low buzzing hum filled the listening room, the static still steadily increasing. Maddie had nearly reached the end of the tunnel and so had Noah, now in dark water nearly to his armpits. He was nearly to her, shouting something unintelligible as the screen became a smear of interference.

I turned to look at Garrett, but he made no motion to stop the tape or indicate that it was over. Then the static and hum abruptly ceased. The video was crystal clear again, except now it showed Josh and Ally walking towards the tunnel entrance, talking excitedly.

“Did you see those crystals I found? I got a good picture of them I think.” Josh looks back over his shoulder at Garrett and the camcorder.

“They were pyrite. From the iron deposits,” Garrett informs him. “There’s a seam of blue clay back there. I wonder if that’s why the tunnel looks unfinished, it might have made it too unstable.”

“It’s lasted this long,” Josh says. 

“I’d love to know how deep that water is, so we could go all the way to the end,” Ally says cheerfully. “Maybe I’ll borrow my dad’s fishing bibs and check it out sometime.”

“Now I’m picturing you holding a trout in some mountain stream, grinning like an idiot.” Garrett jokes.

“Hey, I have a picture of that! For real, Dad and I used to go trout fishing with Uncle Matt all the time back in the day.”

“We should totally go fishing sometime. It’s like bowling, but worse,” Josh laughs. The three exit the cave. Josh stops to pick up the sign, lifting it with some effort. “I can’t believe you found this.”

“Me either,” Garrett says. “I just saw the corner sticking out of the weeds over there.”

Josh unlocks the SUV and opens the back hatch. “If you’ve got mud on your shoes, please try to scrape it off before you get in. Mom would not be happy with me getting mud in the new Toyota.”

“Ok. Hey, do you think we’ve got time for me to record one more thing real quick?” Garrett asks. “Wait–shit, this thing’s almost dead. I’ll have to charge it before it–”

The tape stopped. We sat there in silence for a while, bathed in blue light from the television. Garret stared down at the Sony camcorder in his lap, still tethered to the TV by its umbilical cord of cable.

“Ok. Well,” I finally say. “Can you…can you explain to me what just happened there?”

Garrett shook his head slowly, not looking up.

I coughed. “So, Maddie and Noah heard something peculiar while you were all in the tunnel, and then when you went to leave, Maddie…uh, well, she…”

“She walked on water, and then disappeared. Noah, too.”

“Well, with the lighting conditions and the degradation, I can’t be sure–”

Garrett shook his head.

I leaned forward in my seat. “Ok, I’m very confused. At the end of the video, I only see you, Alyssa and Josh leaving the tunnel. Maddie and Noah are completely gone, and yet none of you seem concerned about it.”

“We weren’t concerned about it.”

I shut my eyes, pinching the bridge of my nose under my glasses. “And also, you were driving a gray minivan. But when you left, you got into a white SUV, so how–”

“...Because we didn’t drive there with Noah and Maddie.”

I opened my mouth to say something, but closed it again. Seeing my continued confusion, Garrett continued.

“Noah and Maddie, they were in the video, yes. But neither me, nor Josh, nor Ally remembers them being with us that day.”

“So what, they were somewhere else, like Noah was actually back at Josh’s house the whole time?”

Garrett exhaled loudly. “He wasn’t at Josh’s house, because Josh doesn’t *have* a brother.”

I blinked. “Wh–what?”

“Josh doesn’t have *any* siblings. And Ally’s uncle doesn’t *have* a daughter named Madison. None of us remember them being with us that day, because neither of those two people *exist*. Never did.”

“Then how–”

“I don’t *know* how!” Garrett moaned, running both hands through his hair. He stood up, causing me to lean back in my chair reflexively. “Josh borrowed his mom’s SUV–she never had a van–and he, Ally and I went to Hope Furnace and the Moonville tunnel. We met the guy with the dog and he told us about the Gehenna Tunnel. We went there, took some pictures, I shot some video, and we left. That’s what I remember. When I got home, I played back the video and…there were strangers in it.”

“Did you show this to Josh and Ally?”

“Of course I did! They both thought it was a prank. But they couldn't explain how I did it. Like, I don’t have the skills to pull off something like that, and I sure as heck don’t know anyone or have the money to pay someone to insert two non-existent people into a Hi-8 tape and fake all of us interacting with them. Like, how would anyone even *do* that?”

“I–I don’t know.” I stammered.

“And Ally and Josh both took lots of pictures and video with our other cameras and phones. All of them show exactly what we remember. Which was just the three of us.”

“But why only *your* camera? How come it recorded them, and not the others?”

“The only thing I can figure is because it’s analog, not digital. When I tried to upload the video to my computer, the file corrupted. I took it to the Visual Media department here on campus to see if they could convert it, but nothing they had would do it. Do me a favor and check your phone.”

I had completely forgotten about the iPhone recording video behind us. I opened the Camera app and stopped the video, then played it back. It had captured Garrett and myself well despite the darkness of the room. However, the TV showed only as a blank, black screen. There was no audio at all.

Garrett watched over my shoulder and nodded solemnly. “See? Whatever actually happened," he said, picking up the camcorder, "The tape in this is the only proof I have. And I won’t have it for long.”

He dropped heavily onto his chair. “The first time I watched the video, there was almost no static, except at the part where they disappear. The second time, when I showed it to Ally, it was worse. It’s gotten worse each time I’ve watched it." He paused, then added, "I do want to play one part of it for you again. Just one more time, but that's it. Understand?”

I nodded slowly. Garrett removed a pair of headphones from a hook over the table. He plugged them into the camcorder, then rewound the tape for a few seconds.

“Just listen...”

I slid the headphones on. When the tape started playing again, Noah had just entered the water  after Maddie. Buzzing filled my ears, causing me to recoil. But hearing it for the second time, I picked up a distinct rhythm…one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four, rising and falling in a pattern. There was also another sound, higher pitched, long and drawn out. Kind of like a whistle.

I strained to listen, pushing the cups of the headphones tighter. Barely discernible through the hum, and Ally and Josh's cries to Maddie, I heard Noah’s voice–so much like his brother’s in tone–and I could just make out what he had been shouting to her right as they both vanished.

“Don’t---ook at---light! Don’t fol---her, Maddie! Don't----light, Mad---don’t---”

There was also something else I hadn't noticed before. Just as Maddie reached the end of the tunnel, for the briefest moment, there was a dark shape. A *human* shape, so obvious that I'm not sure how I missed it the first time. And it was holding a light. Then it was gone, along with Maddie and Noah, lost in the dancing flecks of black and white that would, eventually, consume the only hard evidence that any of them ever existed.

I handed the headphones back to Garrett. I thought by now that I’d seen and heard enough through my research and my own experiences that I wouldn’t be surprised by anything, but this was….whew. I exhaled the breath I didn’t realize I was holding.

“Garrett, I…I’m not sure what to say, except thank you for sharing this with me. I will do what I can to find out more.” I stood up and turned the listening booth’s lights back on. “In the meantime, I suggest you put that tape somewhere safe. Maybe try putting in something metal, like a faraday cage. Do you know what that is?”

He nodded and put the camcorder back into his bag. “Ally and Josh say they just want to forget about the tape, and that I should just get rid of it. It’s harder for me, though. For a lot of reasons.”

I gave him another handshake and told him to feel free to reach out to me if he had more information. As he left the room, he stopped, not turning to look at me as he spoke. “The part that bothers me the most about it? I just stood there and videoed them. I didn’t try to stop them.”

After Garrett left, I packed my gear in a daze and dragged the TV cart back to the Media Equipment Room. Back at home, I reviewed the video from my phone. I tried a couple of different filters and programs, but the screen on the old Magnavox remained black. I did manage to pick up some of the hum in the audio, however it lacked the rhythmic quality I’d heard through the headphones.

I spent a week scouring the interwebs, posting to several sites and forums asking for any information. Strangely, all of my posts disappeared within a few hours or a few days of making them. I had no problem finding Sauder Road on any of the print or online map services I checked, but not a single one of them showed Gehenna Hollow. I easily found Josh and Alyssa on social media. No mention of Josh's brother, no Madison in Ally's family photos. I was about to move on when I found an image that I must have scrolled past--a photo on Josh's Instagram showing Ally petting a shaggy Leonberger, tagged with the caption, "Got to meet the famous goodboygunther17 today!"

After following Gunther, I sent a PM to his owner. Andrew Jurgis, as expected, had nothing posted mentioning a trip to Gehenna Hollow. I informed Mr. Jurgis that I was investigating area tunnel hauntings and folklore, that Garrett had found out about Gehenna Hollow from him. He responded that he remembered Garrett, but couldn’t remember who told him about the tunnel. I asked if he had any more information; he said that unfortunately, he did not. I figured that was that. 

Then a few days later, I received a PM with an image. “I’d posted this  a while back,” he explained. “But it got taken down for some reason, so I just took a new pic to show you. I have all of these Polaroids of a woman that I don’t recognize. I just got the camera from a thrift store a few months ago, but these photos are already fading badly, maybe it was old stock? I want to figure out who this person is. Also, check out the one in the upper right. What do you think’s going on?”

In the image, there are several Polaroids lying on a desk. Each is of either Andrew by himself, Andrew with his dog, or they're devoid of people. There is no woman in any of them. The photo at the upper right shows what looks like a large cave in a heavily-forested hillside. Or perhaps a tunnel. I asked Andrew if he wouldn’t mind mailing me the physical photographs so that I can study them for a short time. That was eight months ago, but I've never heard back from him. 

I’ve debated sharing this for a while, knowing that it’s likely this account will disappear shortly after it’s posted. During that time, the temptation to find out if there really is a second left off of Sauder Road haunted me. But I moved on to other projects, other research. What finally led me to post this is what happened just a few days ago. That afternoon, I returned home to find a large package at my front door. I’d been expecting a delivery and thought nothing of it, though I was surprised at how heavy it was. I carefully opened it and removed something flat in bubble wrap, roughly the size of a piece of poster board. I checked the box–no post markings or shipping labels. Just a plain cardboard box.

As I type this, it’s leaning against the wall behind me, physical proof of a place that doesn’t seem to exist. Hell, I’m not even sure why the sign itself exists, but, well, I don’t make the rules. I wish I could share a picture of it–you can guess what happens each time I’ve tried. For now, I will just ask that you take this story as truth, and to heed the advice gouged below the words “GEHENNA TUNNEL 1857”:

*Don’t follow them*.
