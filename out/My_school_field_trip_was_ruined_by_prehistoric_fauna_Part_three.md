Nobody screamed at first. Strangely, they seemed a bit smaller than the one I saw when I first found the mango tree. They must be adolescents. We turned to the other exit, the one that led to the main interior. A Deinonychus had positioned itself in front of that door. At least 5 more had come through the glass door when we looked back. At that moment, I realized what was happening. This wasn’t a hunt. These were experimental teenagers willing to commit mass slaughter.

Deinonychus, despite common perception, was not a pack animal. They were occasionally found in groups during fossil digs, but it was likely due to a mass feeding frenzy. They likely died fending off each other around a kill. Seeing Deinonychus work together to slaughter us was not only terrifying, but also concerning. Were scientists wrong about how they acted, or did Deinonychus change its behavior to adapt on the island?

Screams echoed through the cafeteria. The pack near the main entrance advanced, jumping into the mob and clawing at anyone they could find. The raptors at the door snapped at anyone trying to push their way through. I dove under a table and noticed many others had done the same. I watched in terror as bodies piled on the floor. Blood began to pool throughout the cafeteria. A man crawled under the table to try and reach me, but a raptor had plunged its claw into his spine, paralyzing him. It stomped down on his neck, ripping his trachea. In the chaos, I had lost sight of Matthew and Zeke.

The Deinonychus discovered through trial and error their strategy of killing humans. Their strategy consisted of jumping on someone’s back, biting onto their neck, and plunging their sickle claws into the spine, causing paralysis. Calling it a massacre wouldn’t be doing it justice. Mass murder caused by animals was almost unheard of in modern times. The worst part about the incident is that the raptors probably planned their hunt, learning the location of the escape routes. The screaming eventually died down as more and more bodies piled. Eventually, a group mustered the courage to push past the Deinonychus guarding the door. Alarmed, it retreated back to its comrades.

The raptors reevaluated their plan. They didn’t expect people to actually push through. All seven raptors charged at the fleeing crowd. I remained under the table, left almost completely alone in the silent cafeteria. A man next to me pushed himself out from under the table. As his head disappeared above the table, I heard a snapping sound. His body collapsed limply onto the stool connected to the cafeteria table.

I held my breath, my heart racing. I heard the clicking of claws as the dinosaur walked across the table above me. it sniffed a few times and leapt down. It crouched and made eye contact with me.

“Over here.” It said to me, its fiery orange eyes studying me with newfound curiosity. I clenched my fists in anger. It noticed my expression change and flared its eyebrow feathers. The room was empty besides me and the animal. If I killed it, its comrades wouldn’t notice. However, if it gained the upper hand, I wouldn’t have backup. I didn’t like my odds, no matter how strong I was. Even if I killed it, I wouldn’t be able to leave the confrontation without a fatal injury.

The Deinonychus directed its gaze behind me and puffed up its feathers in an attempt at intimidation. I turned around to see the scaly legs of a new animal. It was at least six feet tall and bipedal. It crouched down, giving me a good view of the animal. It had a bright orange crest. No, two bright orange crests. It had quills surrounding its neck and upper torso. Its arms were tucked under its stomach. The creature stood tall, its head lightly banging into a ceiling fan. The Deinonychus snarled and ran off.

The Dilophosaurus watched as the Deinonychus fled. It turned to the dozens of fresh carcasses and tore into flesh with its oddly shaped mouth. I crawled out from under the table and crept away. I stumbled over the corpses. I realized that I could be stepping over Matthew or Elizabeth. The thought made me shudder. I didn’t know why it took me this long to care. People were dying and I stayed silent. I timed my movements with the Dilophosaurus’s eating patterns. I eventually made it through the door into the main facility. I stood up and began walking.

I don’t know where I was going or why. I just needed to find someone alive. I heard a loud gunshot go off somewhere up ahead. What followed was an ear piercing screech of agony and desperation. The wounded Deinonychus fled and slammed into a wall. We both made eye contact at the same time. It sprinted towards me and collapsed, succumbing to shotgun wounds. Its lifeless orange eyes glassed over as it looked up at me. it coughed blood onto my foot as it died.

Professor Princeps hurried around the corner, panting and covered in blood. His expression softened as he saw me. “Lucas.” He smiled. “You’re alive.”

Professor Princeps was an interesting man. I couldn’t tell whether I hated the man or admired him. He had the ability to motivate anyone to do anything he found fun. Sure, he was self-centered, but his unshakable will to keep moving forward was inspiring. I smiled, a wave of relief washing over me. I pointed at his shotgun. “Do you have any extras of those?”

“I have the next best thing.” he said, pulling a handheld pistol out of his bag. I expected some form of argument opposing my possession of a firearm. Either he didn’t care or was too desperate to worry about safety.

“Just, uh, don’t point it at anybody or yourself.” he said hastily, reloading the double barrel. This wasn’t an act of heroism anymore. Too many have died to call it one. We were simply defending anyone who still managed to live.

“Many fled into the jungle.” Princeps said as he rushed through the hallway. “But… I’m sure there are still some here.”

I nodded when he looked back at me for a look of understanding.

“Should we capture one alive for research purposes?” I asked.

“I’m going to kill every last overgrown buzzard on this campus.” he said unexpectedly.

“I should probably tell you this.” I began, “There is a new animal in the cafeteria eating the corpses.”

“I’ll kill that one too.” Princeps said, discouraging further elaboration on my end.

I thought back to the cafeteria where I was almost murdered. The Dilophosaurus had no idea I was there, but scared off the Deinonychus so it could eat. I felt like I owed it, although it is just an animal.

“Let’s focus on the others first.” I said, trying to sway him away from the idea of killing it.

“I apologize, I just don’t feel like myself right now.” he said.

“None of us do.” I responded.

Smoke billowed out into the halls. “There must be a fire nearby.” Princeps noticed.

We rushed to the source of the smoke. The wooden ceiling had been engulfed in a raging flame. A Deinonychus ran into view with a charred stick in its mouth, the end bleeding smoke. It looked me dead in the eye and dropped the stick on the ground before fleeing. I ran over and stomped on the stick before the fire could spread.

“They’re forcing us out of the buildings.” Princeps said, his voice shaky. “They’re actively trying to kill us!”

“They’re doing it for sport. Think of it like teenagers going on dangerous joyrides on the highway.” I explained.

“God damn it.” the professor said, clutching his shotgun. His hands shook as he clenched his fists. “Zeke and Dr. Harding should be near the dorms evacuating people.”

An idea came to my mind. “The Deinonychuses could be waiting outside for people to escape, so we have time to find survivors inside before this place is razed.”

Princeps looked at me morosely. “Then that is our plan.”

We continued searching through the burning facility. We passed the animal room and opened all the cages. We were already there, so not freeing them would be plain scummy.

“You guys are here to save me, right?” Elizabeth said out of nowhere.

“Where have you been?!” I asked, panicked and confused.

“Here with the animals.” She responded like I was supposed to know that. “But not that one.” She said, pointing to the Deinonychus perched on the broken windowsill. It craned its head and looked at us. It stretched its wings and scratched the back of its neck with its claws. Princeps grabbed his gun. The Deinonychus turned to face the cage where we contained the baby vulture. Then it turned back to me. Its pupils dilated and made eye contact with me.

I lightly pushed down on the end of the professor’s shotgun. “On the day the vulture chick hatched, it imprinted on me. That is the same vulture chick.” I said.

Princeps looked at me with an expression I could only describe as concern. “Are you sure?”

The Deinonychus stared at me, its piercing eyes illuminated by the flames. It jumped back outside. I turned to the other two.

“We need to get to the tree.” I announced.

“Why should we go back there?” Princeps asked. “You nearly died last time!”

“I am aware. The tree is the embodiment of this virus. This is just a hunch, but I think if we destroy the tree, it will stunt the transmission of the virus. Most of the virus is being transported into the tree, causing animals to eat the fruit laced with the mutation. Destroying the tree would stop the virus from spreading via fruit.”

“Even if all of that is true…” Princeps said, “Why destroy it? What would we gain?”

“We gain nothing.” I replied. “However, the animals can no longer eat the forbidden fruit, stopping any more anomalies from appearing.” Although I sounded knowledgeable, I was grasping at straws. I didn’t even know why I wanted to go back to the tree anyway.

 

We hastily escaped the burning building. Rushing through the thick jungle, we heard the distant call of an unknown animal. I expected to see a Baryonyx, Carnotaurus, or Carcharodontosaurus any time I ran past a tree. The thought terrified me, but there was a small part of me that wanted to see them. At least I think so.

After safely traveling through the jungle, we finally made it to the tree. The ground was completely clear of any liquid waste. The organic pit of flesh emitted a foul odor as it contracted like a breathing lung.

“It smells of methane.” I say, pulling out a box of matches I stole from the lab.

Elizabeth turned to me. “You’re doing this? Right now?”

I didn’t want to seem like a hotshot action hero. I just wanted to minimize the outbreak of this new substance. Suddenly, the Therizinosaurus crept out from the trees. An entire arm was missing from it, the wound still bleeding. It must’ve run from something larger. As soon as it locked on to us, it wasted no time chasing. I tried to evade, but the claws swiped the matchbox out of my hand. The Therizinosaurus stomped them into the ground.

 

“Get the hell out of here! I can handle this!” Princeps said, shotgun in hand.

“You can’t kill it with a shotgun, are you insane?!” I screamed.

“Just get back and I’ll prove I can!” He yelled, his voice becoming desperate. “I’m not going to ask you again.” he scowled and aimed his shotgun at the towering beast. It cocked its head curiously.

The Therizinosaurus slashed the professor’s back. He collapsed to the ground. Blood dripped from his mouth as he looked up at me. “I’m sorry. I knew all along.” He coughed. “Please forgive me… Lucas.” I looked back at Professor Princeps one last time. Bleeding badly, he lodged the shotgun into the organic hole. The Therizinosaurus swiped at him, but it was too late. The professor pulled the trigger. The heated sparks of the gun made contact with the trapped methane. The underground buildup caused a massive explosion. The Therizinosaurus was engulfed in hungry flames that wrapped around its body.

The tree started to burn as the ground below it collapsed into fire. Blood and tissue from the unknown lifeform were flung into the sky from the blast. Chunks of flesh and blood rained down on us. The mango tree started to snap as the sunken ground gave way. Hundreds of melon-sized mangoes plummeted from their branches and into the flame. The tree bled the purple liquid from every pore. The scorching Therizinosaurus screamed in agony as it desperately tried to claw its way out of the collapsing pit. I could’ve sworn I heard a scream from somewhere in the fire. One that wasn’t human.

Elizabeth lost her footing and began to sink into the ground. Without thinking, I grabbed her hand and pulled her back before the ground below her collapsed. She smiled and laughed. “Thanks!”

“Yeah.” I said, still rattled by the explosion. The ringing in my ears didn’t seem like it was going to stop soon. I respected how unshakable her character seemed. “You impress me.” I told her.

She chuckled, confused. “What do you mean?”

“It’s nothing.” I said awkwardly, my experience talking to others rearing its ugly head.

Covered in blood and tissue, Elizabeth and I headed back to the camp. Along the way, we were greeted with the gruesome sight of Matthew’s upper body. His flesh wasn’t sliced or crushed, it was ripped and pulled apart. His face was contorted into a silent scream. The color had been drained from his body.

“I’m sorry.” I said, my voice barely a whisper. Elizabeth remained silent. I tried not to look below his torso. Although I wanted to give him a proper burial, I knew that whatever attacked the Therizinosaurus and killed Matthew was still at large. I could feel the ground vibrating with a slight hum. Something was out there. The vibrations were similar to the communication sounds of an elephant, which means whatever is out there is not alone.

Navigating through the dense forest reminded me of a game of chess. I made sure my moves were as precise as possible. Whenever I heard a branch snap, I knew something was nearby. Whatever was hunting us knew where we were. However, they could not reveal themselves too early for an unknown reason. As our opponent made their move, we crossed a shallow stream. I guided Elizabeth to a different bank to distort our footsteps and scent. A heavy footstep signaled us to get moving.

The smoke rose through the trees from the camp. Suddenly, a massive ship horn blared through the jungle, startling birds. Without hesitation, we made our way towards it. A tree frog watched me from a branch. I noticed a few Homalocephalids watching from under a large leaf, their beady eyes glistening in the sunlight. They chirped and clicked their beaks nervously as I walked past.

Looking back, I realize that we could have very well been dealing with a large pair of carnivores. They were not eager to pursue us, as the horn probably scared them. We weren’t worthy prey anyway. Even still, the thought of us being silently stalked by an intelligent being make my blood run cold.

Although every dinosaur I’ve seen is a therapod, not all of them were carnivores. As less and less birds showed up every day, I guess more species of dinosaurs emerged. To this day, I have no clue how long this event was happening. If there is a god out there, I want to know why this happened. I have to. 

We kept our pace steady as we trekked through the jungle. The usually bubbly Elizabeth was unnervingly silent. If I wanted to say something, the thought of me speaking would just get snuffed out. As I walked, I stepped on a hard object. I looked down, expecting a rock. It was a tooth the size of a banana. It was slightly yellowed and worn.

“If we’re planning on eating, I’m allergic to those.” Elizabeth said, pointing to the tooth.

“You’re allergic to teeth? Hold up, why would we eat teeth?” I replied.

“That isn’t a banana?”

“Yeah? Why would it be?”

She shrugged. “I dunno…” she said, looking down at her feet. She scratched her once colorful sweater now caked in ash and soot. I examined the tooth. It could be Alioramus, Bistahieversor, or maybe even Tarbosaurus. It was definitely some type of Tyrannosauroid. The problem was the size. Could it actually be the Tyrannosaurus?

“Do you think we killed their spawning ground?” Elizabeth asked, ripping me away from my inner nerd theories.

I calmly answered the previously ludicrous question. “I doubt it.” I said, not telling her about the Homalocephalids. There was no chance any of them came from that pit. That wasn’t some sort of queen from a sci-fi movie. It was just another unknown animal mutated by the substance. It was like a flower waiting for bees to pollinate and spread its seeds.

We made our way out into a clearing. A large ferry boat had docked on the island. I noticed a few familiar faces as we got closer. Isaac pointed at us and waved as he leaned off the bow of the ship. We made it to the dock and boarded the boat. We were greeted with towels, bandages, and food. Starving, I scarfed down a loaf of sourdough bread. Elizabeth held up a mango, studied it, and put it back into the basket nervously.

We were guided to a windowed room with more survivors. I looked down and saw Zeke  sitting against the wall, arms wrapped around his bent knees, cradling himself. His eyes were bloodshot and staring blankly into the distance. He clutched onto the towel wrapped around him. Zeke looked up and noticed my presence. His shell-shocked expression faded as he exhaled with relief.

As I sat down, the weight of my emotions finally caved in on me. I didn’t wail and sob, I just stared out into the void as tears streamed down my cheeks. I screamed internally, trying my best to maintain my poise. My eyes stung. My throat felt like I had swallowed something sharp that I couldn’t cough out.

After a few days of waiting, the boat set sail back to the mainland. I stared through the foggy porthole at the island as it shrank from view. Suddenly, something caught my eye. A smaller boat was heading to the island. It was a research boat.

It’s been a few months since the incident. I’ve gone to therapy, both physical and emotional therapy, and I think I’m getting better. My therapist told me to get this story out to the world as soon as I felt comfortable. I’m glad you all could hear my testimony, whether you believe me or not. I doubt anyone believes me, even my therapist, but if even one of you out there believes in my story, I’ll be overjoyed. I think Costa Rica is closed down to the public now.

I applied for a job overseas. They pay very well, but they don’t give me too many details on the actual job. I just know its on an island somewhere. I got lucky, as this job doesn’t take everyone. I’m thrilled to do research for my job somehow. Anyway, I’ll update this page in a few months when I go home for the holidays.
