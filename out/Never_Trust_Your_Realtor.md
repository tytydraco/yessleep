The house looked even prettier in person. Sunlight glowed against the windows like a postcard - too perfect to be real. The porch swing moved slightly, though there was no wind - just enough to make the chains creak like someone had just stood up from it. I can't believe I got this house for such a cheap price.

The realtor, Mr. Lowe, had texted me last minute: 'Sorry, can't hand you the keys! Left them under the doormat.' At the signing yesterday, he'd kept glancing at his watch. His cufflinks kept catching the light - tiny silver skulls that seemed to wink at me each time he moved. "You'll love how quiet it is," he'd said. "Last owner was practically a ghost." I wondered what happened to the last owner.

I lifted the doormat. The key was black and strangely warm. Mr. Lowe must have been here recently then.

Inside, the air smelled like cheap cologne—the kind old men wear too much of. The scent was strongest near the recliner, where the leather was worn smooth in the shape of a body. I opened every window, but the smell clung to everything. In the kitchen, the fridge hummed despite the power supposedly being off until move-in. A single beer bottle stood empty on the counter. The cap lay beside it, the metal still damp with condensation. Mr. Lowe must have been drinking in celebration of selling this house.

That's when I noticed the landline phone. The receiver was off the hook, the dial tone buzzing faintly. I hung it up, but it immediately rang, making me jump. The caller ID simply read: "HOME". No one should have had this number yet. Maybe the old owners forgot to disconnect it?

I distracted myself by unpacking, but kept catching movement in the corners of my vision. The bedroom closet door wouldn't stay closed, and it appeared to be swinging open an inch every time I turned away. I realized I was probably hungry, so I decided to order pizza.

The man who answered had a voice like gravel. "Hello?"

"Yeah, I'd like to order delivery to 142 Elm Street."

"Elm?" A long pause. Heavy breathing. "You're at... that yellow house on Elm?" His tongue clicked wetly between words. The way he said it made my skin crawl.

"Yes," I said, suddenly wishing I hadn't called. "Just a large pepperoni, please."

"You shouldn't be there." A metallic clatter came through the receiver - the sound of a gun being picked up. Suddenly, the line went dead.

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang. My blood turned to ice. The pizza place was across town - no way they could deliver that fast.

I opened the door. An old man stared at me, his yellowed eyes burning with anger. His shirt collar was frayed, the same cologne smell rolling off him in nauseating waves. He had no uniform. And no pizza box.

Just a gun and a set of black keys dangling from his finger.

"Trespassers get killed," he rasped. His voice matched the man on the phone - same ragged breath. The cologne rolled off him, identical to the stench in the house.

I stumbled back. "I bought this place! The realtor—"

"Lowe?" He laughed, a sound like bones cracking. "That bastard shows my home every month to fresh meat." He stepped inside. Then the door clicked shut behind him. Through the window, I saw Mr. Lowe's car parked across the street, his silver skull cufflinks glinting as he lit a cigarette.
