[Part 2: The Retched Hunger of Parting](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fd5cxf/i_miss_you_i_cant_stand_the_hunger_when_we_arent/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Before I start there is one thing I have to say. Anyone who is annoyed, you are full well capable of scrolling past so I don't want to see any complaints. 

Mags, if you are reading this you have to know that I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I am, I know you hate when I apologize and this is probably driving you crazy, but I have to say it in case I never get to tell you. I know we agreed that this was our secret to keep but we aren’t all that little anymore and I would rather you be safe and hate me than die still loving me the way you have for the last fourteen years. God, it's crazy that it's been fourteen years already. We're still so young, and yet we've already had more of a life together than most married couples. 

I wish your mom was different, or maybe just that we were different. More and more I am scared that she was right, that we are some kind of godless abominations. At least I am, you are perfect. I am so sorry for dragging you down with me, but I don't regret anything. I wish we had done it sooner. 

We deserved more than stupid gel pens and conversation hearts and frivolous remnants of sheltered girlhoods hidden away from true femininity. 

Mags if you're reading this I am sorry for a lot of things but loving you will never be one of them. I hope you're safe wherever you are. I hope you got out of that dead-end town and you find a nice girl with curly hair, who loves daffodil gardens and Luna moths half as much as you do. I hope she buys the right kind of peanut butter and never gets bored of your nutty jokes. I hope you can get those matching tattoos and taste every inch of her without that stupid fucking crucifix hanging over you. I wish I asked back when I still knew you if that thing was always up above your bed or if your mom only put it up when I came over. I hope your mom likes the girl you find.

I hope she tastes like sunshine, apple wine, and good radio songs, but never too sweet. In fact, I hope everything in your life is so perfectly mild that you never crave sugar on the teeth again. I hope you can call her your wife one day, instead of just a friend. I hope you have a daughter so you can teach her how to dance with her friends on the patio, and to find Orion's belt after dark. I hope she never has to worry about scrubbing off her candy shell pink nail polish before coming home for family dinners. I hope she finds someone whose nails look perfect next to hers when their hands are joined. I hope you find the god we spent so many summers searching for between the saccharine lemonade station and the church lady’s ridiculous hat. I hope your dad gives up preaching and becomes a country singer and that your mom finally throws caution to the wind and marries Mr.Wilcox down at Black Bay Street.

Mags, Maggy, Margaret I hope you never find these posts, or me again cause finding you once was my spend of divine intervention for this lifetime. 

You were perfect and that made us perfect, but that didn't make what happened to us at all okay. I am sorry we could never fully understand each other in that way, but I am done keeping our secrets. Hate me if you want, but know that I am waiting in the same town where you left me. In that little house we picked out back in elementary, three streets from your parents, married to Johnny like we always talked about. Hell, we're even having a baby, gonna name him Max and everything, a little nephew you will never get to meet. I am living the life you always hated.

If you never want to see me again, then don’t come back. Stay out there, in the real world. I'll always be here guarding the life that so nearly killed you. Mags, you got out. Don’t come back for me. Please.

With all my love,

Your friend,

 Josie

If I’m being honest I don't know how to start this story, Mags was the more poetic of the two of us, and as any of my teachers could tell you I was always a bit better suited to the visual arts than the literary. I like to think I have gotten better in my handful of years since high school English, but that's up to you I guess. 

It might be easiest to start with the things that I know for certain and work backwards starting with the most fundamental part of me and this story which is that as a child I lived for Halloween.

I was not my parents' first child. I was simply the only one who made it the farthest. I had three brothers and four sisters. Two were stillborn, another two died in infancy and those who remained were slowly picked off by a series of unfortunate, but unavoidable accidents. 

I never knew any of them, they were gone long before I came around. My parents had all but quit trying by the time I was born. My mother was forty-one and my father was close to fifty when they conceived me. I was their miracle, and like any good miracle, they fought tooth and nail to keep me safe.

My childhood was uniquely devoid of other children. I think something about my birth must have broken my parents. They didn't think they deserved another try after failing so miserably the first seven times. It was a final chance they never wanted. 

With nothing else to do they threw themselves into paranoia. For my mother, everything was an unseen vector for disease. My earliest memories of her are of the surgical gloves and mask she used to wear to hold me. I found out later that one of my brothers had died of an illness she passed to him. She must have internalized the sickness as an inherent evil, or as she loved to call it “her hunger”. In her mind, everything in the world was hungry for me, including her. If hunger was love then my mother was a woman on the brink of starvation and I was her most precious sweet— liable to melt in the sun or be picked to bone by ants on the grass— I had to be protected from others before I could be enjoyed. I suspect my mother must have gotten her candy stolen a lot as a child because no sane person is born knowing how to covet something as deeply as my mother was without having first had their sweetness stolen.

Where my mother obsessed over the tangible dangers, my father devoted himself to the spiritual. He left his marriage in all ways but legal after I was born cloistered himself away with no one but the Lord to keep him company. I hardly ever saw him. We had enough that he didn't have to work which gave him all the more reason to spend his every waking moment in the church pews. He actually checked me out of the hospital two days after I was born. while my mother was still in recovery, to take me to my first sermon. It probably would have been sooner if I hadn't already been baptized. He had the priest wait outside the delivery room so I could be baptized as soon as the connection between me and my mother was severed. As often as he could he would take me with him to church, and because neither of my parents was the type to value education that turned out to be all the time.

Thankfully I don't think I missed much from skipping out on half of my classes in Kindergarten. I'm sure some psychiatrist in the comments could probably tell you all the ways in which disrupting a young child's social routine is harmful, but to be frank I didn't have much of a social routine being homeschooled. Every so often I would ask to go to school, or the park, or even just down the street. It didn't matter where as long as I could see other kids. They didn't even have to be my age, they just needed to not be my parents.

The only time I was ever able to play with other kids was on Halloween. 

My parents' first child, and the one who had made it the furthest other than me was a boy named Max. Max loved Halloween more than anything in the world. Even before he was born he always loved candy, making my mom crave the stuff like mad apparently. The boy even had the commitment to go on and be born on Halloween, several weeks early, while my mom was still in her costume.

My parents had him young, my mother was barely seventeen and my dad was still working his first dead-end construction job trying to keep food on the table. Despite their financial struggles, they both made sure to set aside enough money to make the day special for him, homemade costumes, full decorations, and all the candy he could eat in lieu of a real cake. Guess candy was cheaper anyway. 

When he died they kept the tradition to remember him. Used to have a wake with all his friends in the neighborhood every Halloween before their lives became too filled with dead babies to care about one memorial. They still have his baby-hood costumes pressed and framed in the attic along with all of the mementos of the other children they pretend to remember.

Halloween might have been the only experience that I shared with all my other siblings. No matter how bad things were Halloween was the one sacred day a year when the whole family would go out and pretend to be normal for a night. Thinking about it now, it's kind of ironic that Halloween was the one day a year when my family was free from our ghosts.

I was a lot like Max in many ways, maybe even too many for my parents' broken minds, but that was hardly my fault. I was born October 29, not quite Halloween, but close enough to revive Max’s birthday rituals. I was born a bit early, but otherwise healthy just like my brother, and I had the same horrid allergy to peanuts as my brother, or at least I thought I did.

I only found out that that had been a lie the Halloween of my sixth birthday. Everything had been perfectly usual leading up to that Halloween. I had spent the first half of my “birthday”/sixth Halloween in church with my father, and the second half at home eating over-baked cake and listening to my mother read various excerpts from Harry Potter that she had printed and laminated at the library next to our house. (For those of you wondering why she didn't just buy the book like a sane person, the lamination made the pages easier to disinfect)

 I got a pack of glitter gel pens as a gift, and to this day I think that may have been the best and worst gift I ever received. I was dressed as the cat from Barbie: Princess and the Pauper which had come out earlier that year and quickly became my favorite movie, mostly if not entirely due to the sophisticated feline. We did two laps around the neighborhood going door to door with Max’s old embroidered trick-or-treating bag. We stopped at every door to say hello, and to reintroduce myself to friends who didn't remember me from the previous Halloween. We never kept the candy I got trick or treating— too many risks— but when we got home my parents would pull out a huge bag of salt water taffies as my final gift. 

That night I laid on my stomach on the living room floor meticulously unwrapping only the prettiest stuff. The ones painted in pastel hues with blue and pink swirls that looked like butterfly wings or princess crowns. I remember trying to stick my pinky out as I unwrapped each one because it made me feel like an elegant lady enjoying sweets with her tea. After an hour or so I was surrounded by piles of wax paper wrappers like the molted husks of a bug after the soft wiggling thing inside had been expelled. It struck me that the little papers were the perfect medium to test my new pens on. So I ran to the kitchen to find them amongst the piles of scattered gift wrapping that sat neglected from earlier in the day.

I chose my first pen carefully, it had been my favorite from when I had torn through the first layer of tissue paper, a light ballet slipper pink shot through with iridescent sparkles. The tube was pearlescent with soft sunset pink accents on the cap, and it nestled perfectly in my palm turning my whole hand into a work of art. I carefully pressed the tip of the pen to the first wrapper and drew my best little cartoon heart right smack in the center of it. Once I was satisfied I capped the pink pen and set it aside, so as to not waste its wonderful potential on something as trivial as doodles. I carried on covering that wrapper in technicolor hearts and stars of all sizes. I tried my best to draw flowers on the next, though my mom thought they looked a bit wilted. I loved them with their little heart-shaped petals. I was lost in my own world of mint green forest and chocolate brown earth, and before I knew it I had run out of wrappers. Without thinking I began unwrapping another taffy and then another, not even tasting the sugar on my tongue as I chewed furiously trying to force the gooey masses down into my stomach to free up more drawing paper. I was so engrossed in the process that I almost didn’t catch it.

A plain, white milk taffy that looked as though it had been clumsily rewrapped by unskilled hands. I knew I should probably tell my mom about the strange taffy considering the hasty wrapping and the fact that my parents only ever bought me colorful ones, but something told me that she might try to take it away. It was one of the few things in the world that really belonged to me and I feel good about inviting my mother’s scrutiny to my little haven of childlike bliss.

I held my breath and willed the paper not to crinkle as I carefully unwrapped sweet, sniffing it before popping it in my mouth. It was warm, creamy and only had the barest hint of a honeyed sweetness to it. It was inconceivable, infinitely more enjoyable than the bright achingly sugary taffies I had been enjoying moments before. I shut my eyes and chewed it slowly until there was nothing more than an impressionable residue coating my mouth and only then did I look at the little wrapper I had clutched in a fist against my dancing heartbeat.

Written on the wrapper in a cerulean colored pencil I could make out a little heart that had been only partially colored in and the words “i lik yer drawng” written by an endearingly messy hand. Her “i” was not capitalized like mom had taught me it should be and instead of a polite dot it had a huge looping circle with a crooked smiley face in the center. I giggled and wrote my own message back on one of the blank wrappers in my best pen. It was simple, but in fairness, I was six and only just learning how to write without my mother's guidance. “I lik yers to”

It took me fifteen minutes to sort through the huge bag of taffies, but I was able to find a full handful of suspicious candies. Most were taffies, but intermixed were mints and fruit chews. 

I learned that whoever I was talking to was not a good artist, but her notes were funny. She apologized for running out of taffies and hoped that the other candies would be okay. She asked why I only seemed to like taffies and called me weird. Until that moment it had never really occurred to me that most children’s lives didn't look anything like mine. I never gave any thought to what happened to the candies that my parents confiscated after trick or treating, or why none of my friends remembered me year after year when all I could do was think about them and wait for the next Halloween when we could play together again. I told her everything, how it was my birthday, and how I never got to see other kids. She asked me about shows and flowers, and what my favorite candy was. She was intrigued by the fact that I had never tried peanuts before, Reese’s were her favorite. She said she was sending me something new.

I thought it would be harder to find, but when I glanced back at the taffy bag once cherished and now lying forgotten in front of the TV, it was right there at the top. It took me a second to recognize the little rectangular shape from the grocery store checkout line. To my horror and delight her gift had been a single Snickers bar. It was enticing and dangerous and everything I knew I would never be allowed to have. I set the treasure aside and decided that I would keep it just to know I had it. 

But maybe unwrapping it couldn't hurt, how else am I supposed to continue our conversation? It wasn’t as though I was going to eat it. 

On the inside of the wrapper she apologized for not sending a Reese’s, but she had already eaten them all. It didn't matter in the slightest to me, I already thought the little chocolate square sweating in my palm was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. 

Surely this was the temptation which Eve had faced, the unknown and previously unobtainable knowledge placed right in her waiting hands. I knew that Eve was wicked for her actions from my father’s rants, but in that moment I wished to be with her in the garden and to take a huge bite of the fruit before she ever could. I would have fallen to damnation willingly and with a grin on my face if it meant I got to know what lay outside the confines of my perfect little garden. I was starving for experiences, on the brink of a monotonous death and I think I honestly would have told god off for being a meanie if he had tried to stop me in that moment. 

I popped the candy in my mouth without a thought and waited for all of the terrible things my mother had promised would happen, but they never came. I chewed the candy suspiciously, pulverizing the little nuts and rolling the fragments over my tongue as if trying to provoke them into hurting me. I felt cheated. Where was my divine sacrifice, where was the drama I had been promised? I felt betrayed and swore to myself that I would stop trusting my mother then and there. Then the taste hit me, golden and sunny and rich in a way I had never experienced and I wondered if that is how she would taste. It was perfect and I may have given her a genuine tear. I was going to write to her but before I could I saw a tiny glint of neon orange at the bottom of the taffy bag. I plunged my fist into my own personal bag of wonder feeling blindly until my fingers curled around the flimsy but sharp corner of something that was decidedly not taffy. I knew then what it was, a king-sized Reese’s with three huge peanut butter cups, on the wrapper was the following message.

\*Note I have removed the spelling mistakes and cleaned up some of the grammar to make it intelligible\*

“Hello! I am sorry I lied. I did have another Reese's. I just didn't want to give it up. I never get the big ones. But Mama says sharing is a good thing to do. I also felt mean for lying and I could taste how happy you were when you tried the Snickers. Can you taste how happy I am when I try your taffies? I never get taffy. They are very sweet and sooooooo pretty!!!! Anyway my name is Margaret. I am 8 years old. What is your name?”

Like I said before, I can't decide if those stupid pens were the worst or best gift I have ever received, but I can't bring myself to hate them, cause well they gave me my Mags. We kept up our little notes for a while after that but eventually, we ran out of candies and I was heartbroken to find that the new bag of taffies my mom got me didn’t work to pass our messages. God those early days were so good, the little heartbreaks of losing contact and having to wait another year for another round of treats, spending months noting every odd taste of pineapple or ham in my empty mouth and wondering if she was tasting it too. Why couldn't it stay that way? 

Mags I miss you. I am so sorry I don't know where it all went wrong but I think it might have been rotten from the start. I don't know why we trusted those strange tricks, I hate myself for not seeing it sooner, but we were kids, and you loved every second of it so I never thought to look a little closer. Maybe if I figure out what me and Margaret missed I can leave this town. I probably shouldn't though, if anything I just want to be able to give her some answers. We tried looking for others with similar experiences before, but nothing this in-depth, just some simple searches through Reddit for anything about strange candy messages. All that we were able to turn up back then was some stuff about weird candy grams on Valentine's Day and over-eager admirers turned stalkers. Please if any of you know anything, let me know.

I'm going to keep posting the bits of the story that I think are important, but if we can figure this out now that would be best. To be frank, there are parts of this story that I really don't want to tell, so I hope we can put an end to this before we have to unearth the more vulnerable parts. I think I'm running out of time, I'm going to be a mom soon. I have to end this before it can hurt my son. I can not lose him, not after Mags.

I don't have any proof, but I think whatever entity connected me and Margret through the candy messages might also have had something to do with my parents’ misfortunes. 

Max wasn’t allergic to fucking peanuts. He loved them. You can’t die from a peanut allergy you don’t have. Something is wrong with the picture. I don't know if it's this town, or something in it but there is something very wrong.

I’ll post again as soon as possible but it's hard to find times when my husband isn’t home. He can’t know about any of this.
