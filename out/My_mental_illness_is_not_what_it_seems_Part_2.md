I sat in silence, alternating my gaze between the room outside and Toby. Since the woman was shot, and Toby saw her with a gunshot wound, is it just a coincidence, or does it have a deeper meaning?

"Clark, this can't be just a coincidence," he said.

I didn't know what to think about it; I knew Toby had his periods, just like me, when he believed in absurd things. Once he tried to convince me that pigeons were small government robots, and that he knows what he is talking about, without any proofs, but after many visits to his caregivers and proving to him by various metods that what he said was nonsense, he simply gave up. But it was never like this. What he said had its basis.

"I know it seems like I'm panicking, like im delusional, but it's not like that," Toby said. "Usually, I'm scared of my hallucinations, but this? This is some worse shit."

"Okay, we'll see how it unfolds. For now, I have to go back. I'm telling you, paperwork," I said indifferently.

"You don't believe me... You just don't believe me," he said.

"It's not that I don't believe you, it's just... I don't know. I'm leaving now, thanks for the invitation," I replied, getting up.

As I left the room and took a step on the dubious planks of the second floor, he said:

"This... Our illness, it's not an ordinary illness. You have to believe me, stop taking the meds, see what I mean," he said convincingly.

"Sure, I'll see what I can do," I said, with another hint of indifference in my voice.

"Even if you don't do it, you'll find out sooner or later."

As I got into the car and closed the door, I kept thinking about what he said, that this illness is not something normal. Of course it's not normal. Delusions? Hallucinations? Frequent speech problems? Psychotic states? I'm not saying we're abnormal, but this illness certainly interferes with our lives.

As I drove home, I went into the store to get groceries for dinner, then went home to attend to, ahem, "paperwork." In reality, it was just an excuse; there was no paperwork, and there never would be. I can't do them, and I get lost in them, not knowing what is for what. After returning, I left the groceries and sat down exhausted on the couch, the soft mattress and pleasant fabric of the sofa lulling me to sleep while watching TV, even though it was 5pm. I was very sleepy; after 15 minutes, I was already embraced by the arms of Morpheus.

I had a nightmare; I stood in darkness, in a void so dark I couldn't see where it began and where it ended, and in front of me stood a person... It was Toby. He stared deeply into my eyes as if he wanted to read what I was currently thinking. I didn't feel like I was dreaming, more like in a lucid dream; I knew I was asleep. We stood like that for about a minute, after which Toby said:

"You will believe me, and I know how to do it, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds, stop taking the meds," he repeated.

In the void, in the catatonic sound of Toby's voice repeating to stop taking the meds. In the distance, I saw a lots, lots of bright silhouettes, all of them started approaching me at a tremendous speed until I was surrounded by all of them, all repeating one thing to me... "Stop taking the meds."

I woke up, jerking up and falling off the couch onto the hard floor, hitting my head.

"Fuuuck..." I cursed at the fall.

I sat up on the couch, pondering the dream. I considered it just a nightmare, but... I will never forgive myself for not thinking to call Toby.

The next day, while preparing food for work, I received a call. It was a friend from the circle, the name doesn't matter; what matters is what I heard.

"Toby is dead; they say it was a suicide."

The pan, along with what was on it, slipped from my hands, crashing loudly onto the tiles. I stood in silence for a moment that seemed like an eternity.

"He... He what?" I asked, still stunned.

"What you heard, see you around," he replied.

His voice contained not an ounce of emotion; I know he also had a good relationship with Toby, most likely he was also going through this.

After half an hour of sitting in the chair, staring only at a small point on the wall, I snapped out of it. I called my boss to say I was sick and couldn't come to work. I work in IT, as an automated tester; they often have replacements for me, so it wasn't a problem.

For a few hours of sitting and not knowing what to do and wondering why, I remembered the dream.

"You will believe me, and I know how to do it."

"There is no fucking way..." I said incredulously.

I got up, opened the medicine cabinet, and stared at them for God knows how long. Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, painkillers for mood stabilizers because of headaches and such, all to alleviate symptoms. Of course, not fully; sometimes I hear things that aren't there, I fall into sudden depressive states, psychotic states, but I manage with them; hallucinations are limited only to sounds.

After staring at them, I realized that I didn't take them yesterday, and nothing happened. I decided... I took everything, threw them in the trash, and closed it. "Nothing will happen to me; it's not something I haven't already experienced. I'll manage." I convinced myself.

I turned towards the living room, after the first 3 steps on the icy cold tiles, because I forgot to turn on the heating through all this, I heard... The first sign of what was to come...

"Well done."
