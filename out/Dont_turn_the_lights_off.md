It’s a nice normal day in June. My Dad asks me if I want to house sit our neighbors friends for couple days and I will get paid. I didn’t hesitate to say yes. I’m a teenager and need money, no I don’t have a job at the moment so whatever I can do to get money count me in. 

The next day my dad drives me over to the house and I meet the owners and there house is beautiful. It isn’t too big and isn’t too small, but bigger than my house. The owners tell me how there going away for business trip for a few days and they gave me some rules. They said there’s a guest bedroom upstairs that I could sleep in and there is food in the fridge that I could eat whatever I want. The last few rules were kind of sketchy. They said after sunday keep the lights on throughout the night. All the lights on. No matter what and to lock the fridge after 10pm and make sure the basement door is locked and closed at all time. I said okay and kind of brushed it off and thought made they are superstitious about monsters in the dark or something. They gave me there number if something was wrong then they left for there trip. 

I sat on the couch and put on netflix but I couldn’t help but think why they wanted that door locked and why to keep the lights on. I tried to clear my mind with netflix. I started binge watching the shows. The parents already had all the lights on already and locked the door. So I was chillin. 9:50 comes around, I put a timer on my phone to lock the fridge. I watched my show till it was almost midnight. I went upstairs and went to the guest bedroom. I went into bed and tried to make myself go to sleep with the lights off. I put my airpods in and listened to music and I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and went downstairs to see fridge lock almost open. I don’t know if it was opened then closed or just still closed. I went over and grabbed the key from the pocket and opened the door and all the food was there. But that’s when I noticed in the corner of my eye there office light was off. My heart dropped to the bottom of my stomach. I remember she told me about security cameras in each room and to download the app so I can see it. I go back to my room and close the door. I go back to the time where I went upstairs to bed. As i’m fast forwarding I see at 3:07 am the office lights off then screen goes blurry for a second but you can hear the sound of the fridge lock being played with then it gets un-blurry and the office door slams shut. 

Holy… so someone or something is in the office and the light switch is in the room… Is this five nights at freddy’s or something?!? Or some prank they are playing? Because it sure ain’t a fun prank. I keep fast forwarding through the night and nothing else happens. But right as I walk downstairs when I look over at the fridge I pause the camera and zoom into the office door. There’s two glowing eyes and little shaped head that you can just see the outline of then before I turn my head to the office the thing goes away. Aw hell nah. But I remember that i’m going to get $200. I now see why she pays so much. Because of whatever this is. How do they even live here with that?!? I would’ve moved out of there day 1. I look through the cameras nothing more. I see that there is a office camera. Why didn’t I see that before?? But the strange thing is that the light was now on. I don’t want to know who or what turned on but i’m glad I didn’t have to turn it on. The rest of the  day I was on edge, constantly checking the cameras. I decided to get tape and tape the office light on. Just to keep me calm. 

Later that night same routine. Lock the fridge, make sure basement was locked and make sure all lights are on. I tried to go bed earlier and hopefully this nightmare ends. I close my door and lock it just to be safe. I check the cameras one more time and they are all off but right as I go to put my phone down I get an alert on my phone from the app saying there is movement. I gulp and get chills. I flip through the cameras. Everything looks fine until I get to the hallway where the basement is closed the lights went off and the basement door… it’s now open like someone opened from the outside which made no sense. I switch to the kitchen and now the fridge is open and the light keeps flickering. Then I hear a crash of thunder than lightning and for a split second the power goes off then the generator comes back on but I notice pots, pans, plates all on the floor. I guess whatever is there its afraid of the light. Like a vampire I guess. 

I get another notification that there is movement down the hall. My hall.  I pull out the pocket knife I keep in my pocket. Not like it’s going to do much since it’s like 3 inches long. Then a voice starts talking. “Michael, sweety it’s your mother. I got your call can you let me in?” it sounds like my mom but i’m not stupid. That’s like horror movie rule 101, don’t let people in. “Michael let me in” it repeats but in a lower tone of my mothers then it starts banging on my door. Then there is roaring noise. A high pitch roar that I have to hold my ears. Then I hear loud stomps followed by my lights flicking. No no no no. I take my phone flashlight out. Then there is loud banging scream “LET US IN” being said over and over. With the sound of the rain hitting my window loudly I can’t help but scream to go the f away. That made the thing laugh turning into the neighbors laugh then imitating my fathers laugh then my laugh. This is no ordinary creature. It’s a shapeshifter. 

I thought those were only in movies and tv shows. Then the power in my room goes out. I gulp. Then I hear rattling from the closet and low voice say “You cant hide from us forever, Michael.” Then the closet door opens and a thing that looks at least 7 feet tall, with brown skin, big glowing white eyes with a wide open smile and drooling and repeating “You can’t from us forever” then I shine my light in its face an hisses at a loud tone where I have to cover my ears. Then the sun rises and shines right on the shapeshifter. And it runs to the closet and all the lights turns on. I check the cameras and everything is normal. Looks as if nothing was touched. Fridge was locked, no mess on the floor. I walk downstairs and get some breakfast before the owners come home

Few hours later the owners walk in. “How were the nights? All good?” the owner asks. “Yes perfectly fine” I say and give a small smile. “Great! Well here’s your 200” he hands me the money.” he hands me 200 in cash. “Thank you!” “Want me to drive you back?” he offers. “Sure let me get my stuff.” I wonder if all this time I had been hallucinating everything. I grab my stuff and we go in the car. We get to my house I grab my stuff from the back. “Thank you for driving me” I look at him through his mirror and he looks back at me and his eyes glow white. “No problem Michael” he says then smiles and I close the door and go inside and go to my room. I think, if shapeshifters are real then what else is real…
