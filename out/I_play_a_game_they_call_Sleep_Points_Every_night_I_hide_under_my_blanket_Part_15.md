When I went down for breakfast, I was even more paranoid than the day before.  I tried to keep my cool and just act naturally, but by then I was just so on edge and easily startled by the smallest of sounds and movements to the point where that was realistically never gonna happen.  

I couldn’t tell if it was because of my heightened sense of anxiety or not, but at times I got the sense that maybe mom was starting to catch on.  She almost seemed like she could tell something was up with me.  I tried desperately to force these frightful thoughts from my mind, since they would only make it harder for me to avoid giving myself up.  But it was no use.  No matter how hard I tried, they just kept forcing themselves back.  It made breakfast a complete nightmare.  I could hardly keep myself together.

From spending the last two nights without sleep, I was in a total zombie-like state at school.  Either that, or I would have this insane level of hyper-vigilance and have an exaggerated response toward basically everything.  That was the only thing keeping me conscious.  Either I wouldn’t respond to things at all, or I would respond way too much.  Either way, it was never exactly a normal reaction.  I could just feel the whole world around me taking notice more and more with each passing moment.  Everybody around me must’ve been wondering what the hell was wrong with me.

At lunchtime, a teacher even came to check up on me, since I could hardly eat.  I guess since my brain was so focused on carving out even the slightest morsel of sleep, it couldn’t be bothered to tell me if I was hungry or not.  This got the attention of Mrs. Bagfield, the teacher who watched over the kids during lunch to stop any commotion.  But it was a pretty easy job since there basically never was any.  

I guess her job realistically consisted mainly of making sure some crazy shit didn’t go down like Ezra detonating a fucking IED in the middle of the cafeteria or something.  I know it sounds like a joke, but you have to remember that the only reason he wasn’t STILL in jail was because the local judge figured the longer they kept him in jail around other prisoners and away from his peers, the more likely he would be to go down a criminal path.  As if he ever needed help with THAT.  I’ll bet he took that to mean he could go right back to his usual psychotic ways, and they’d just let him get away with it.  He sure seemed to.

Anyway, where I would normally wolf down my lunch pretty quickly, that day I was just kinda picking at it and not very interested in it.  I didn’t have a regular group of kids that I would hang around with during lunch, so thankfully it took a while for anyone to take notice.   Usually there would be at least one or two other random kids at my table with nobody to sit with either, but that day there weren’t any.  But it was just as well, since it helped me fly under the radar that much better.  
Since there weren’t very many kids at my school, we all ate lunch at the same time.  Which meant that Anastasia was there in the cafeteria too.  The problem was, I couldn't sit with her since she had her own group of girls that she would usually have lunch with.  I wouldn’t have fit in.  I figured if I was ever welcome to sit with her, she would’ve invited me over and let me know, but she never did.  So, I assumed I should probably stay out.

Ezra was there too, but he was too busy harassing another group of kids to give me any trouble.  It was Truman and his gang, as usual.  He usually went after the athletic jock types like him.  They would typically be the kids with the biggest egos.  He always seemed to enjoy toying with them the most.  Something about a scrawny kid like him having the balls to give them shit on a regular basis seemed to really rub them the wrong way.

After about 10 or 15 minutes or so, Mrs. Bagfield had found it strange that I wasn’t eating much that day.  She came over and asked if there was anything wrong, or if there was anything that was bothering me.  There was.  But it was The Sandman.  And I couldn’t tell her about that.  There was a reason Anastasia and I would always talk about Sleep Points in private.  Or at least try to if it had to be during 6th period.  Other people weren’t supposed to know about him.  It was against the rules.  Though, of course, it wasn't quite that simple.  There were always ways to break that rule without technically breaking it.  That's how I get away with making all these posts.

Anyway, I tried telling her I was fine.  She didn’t believe me.  She asked if I was sure.  I told her I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it.  Thankfully, she accepted this response and let me go.  I tried eating what I could.  I only got through maybe half my lunch before the bell for 5th period rang.  And for 5th period, I had Algebra II with none other than Mrs. Bagfield, who would now know to keep an especially watchful eye on me.

Since I knew she was watching me, I tried to be as alert and attentive as possible.  I tried taking notes, answering questions, anything I could do to make everything look a-ok with me.  But she must’ve seen through my disguise.  Just like at breakfast, I couldn’t seem to keep calm.  Especially not when I felt like someone was analyzing my every last move, taking notice of how off I was. When the bell to end 5th period rang, I started lulling my way out of her room pretty sleepily.

Since I was the last person left in the room, she stopped me to let me know that she was there for me whenever I felt comfortable talking about what was wrong.  She said that she would like to be a trusted adult whom I could turn to, no matter what the problem was.  I said thanks and that I would keep that in mind, but then headed off to the library for Environmental Science.  I guess she could tell that I was in no mood to talk, so she was willing to drop the subject.

This was the part of my day that usually kept me going.  The part of the day where I could talk to someone whom I actually COULD trust.  Anastasia was playing Sleep Points too.  I could still talk to her about The Sandman all I wanted to.  Well, not ALL I wanted to.  We were still in class, so we would have to really keep our voices down and speak in coded language.  

But today was different.  Unlike every other day, I was actually dreading 6th period.  Not only had I gone off on this totally unhinged rant at her the last time I saw her, but I had very badly violated the guidelines of her recommended bedtime routine for me.  That wouldn’t matter much if I could keep it hidden, but she had ways of figuring this stuff out that she wasn’t telling me about.  It would be no use trying to hide.

When I got over to the library’s computer lab and took my seat, she asked me how I slept just like she had the last two days.  I told her I didn’t sleep well at all.  She seemed alright with this.  And that was surprising, because if she had ways of checking up on me to see if I had been following her routine, she would have to have her ways of knowing how I slept too.  

Surely, she would know that after all this time I hadn’t even gotten the slightest glimpse of sleep.  Surely, she wouldn’t just shrug something like that off.  With all the information she seemed to have on me at her disposal, it never really made sense why she would always ask me about how well I had slept.  That must’ve been the one piece of information about me that she couldn’t find out without asking.  

That was the only reason I could figure.  It must’ve been that whatever was informing her of whether or not I was going to bed at 9 and putting all my screens away at least an hour beforehand must not’ve been telling her about the quantity and quality of my sleep.  Somehow, that information was being withheld from her.  So she had to ask.

Then she asked me how long I had slept for.  I had to tell her that I hadn’t even gotten 90 minutes of sleep.  And if I was gonna talk to anyone about that, it was going to be her.  As nervous as I was to bring up my lack of sleep to anyone, including her, I was just glad that she seemed to have completely forgiven me for how I had snapped at her the day before.  And that’s not even to mention how badly I had gone against my bedtime routine the night before.  And she wasn’t bringing that up either.  Yet.

“I notice you failed to retire at 9 PM as I suggested.  Routines are, of course, predicated upon habit.  Therefore, it does not strike me as particularly surprising to find that you have failed to act in accordance with it.  You are yet to make yourself habituated to the aforementioned routine.  However, though one singular slip-up will not cause appreciable harm, you should by no means habituate yourself to defying my recommendations.  It is for your own good to allow sleep to come to you naturally for as long as possible.  And following the routine will prove most effective toward that end,” she said.  She lowered her voice a bit further.  “You will inevitably reach a stage where that will no longer happen,” she said, as if she were completely mortified by the prospect.  

And that made total sense.  Not only was that a stage that I, myself, was terrified to reach, but also because I was thinking back to the day before.  Back when she told me about how drunk she had to get in order to pass out without her special blanket.  She was probably gonna reach a stage where she would need to get black-out drunk every night, with or without her blanket, from the sound of things.  I could hardly blame her for sounding so frightened.  As bad as I felt like I had it, I’d be scared shitless too if that was the position I was in.  As it would be.  Eventually.

“I’ll follow the routine”, I said with as much sincerity as I could muster.  “Honestly.  I wanna make going to sleep as easy as possible.  If I’m being honest, I got no sleep last night.  Like, literally none.  Not even a second”, I finally confessed.  This revelation seemed to cause her a bit more concern.  Although, she did still seem to be mostly keeping her cool.  She didn’t look like she was freaking out nearly as much as she was when she found out that I was playing Sleep Points.  So maybe all was not lost just yet.  

Anastasia finished up our project in about the first 10 minutes of class.  She then wrote another note.  “Follow me”.  Then she shot her hand up.  Once she had gotten Mr. Brigham’s attention, she explained to him that we had finished our project, and then asked if she and I could spend the rest of the period in study hall since we had completed our work early and wouldn’t be doing anything for the rest of class.  Mr. Brigham agreed.

She led me to the same stairwell at the front entrance of the school that she had used to talk to me on Friday of the previous week.  Her first order of business was to hand over a full plastic container of melatonin gummies.

“Seriously?  This is what you got us out of class for?  To give me a thing of melatonin gummies?  You can just get this stuff over the counter.  You could’ve just given it to me in the library.  How much trouble would you get in for that?” I asked.  
“The school’s security system might pick up on our transaction.  I cannot risk that.  Students are prohibited from exchanging chemically active substances, even if it is over the counter and does not require a prescription from one’s personal physician.  That is why I conduct our business in the stairwell.  There are no cameras here.  We will not be recorded.  No one else will hear about The Sandman.” She said, in a hushed tone of voice.

Once again, I saw its face off to the side out of the corner of my eye for a quick moment.  “Anytime the Sandman is mentioned, it checks in to ensure that you have not spoken about it within earshot of anyone outside the game.  If someone outside of Sleep Points is made aware of him because of something you did or said, it will capture you.” Anastasia explained.

“That’s what I’m worried about,” I confessed.  “I told Truman and Ezra about Sleep Points.” I told her.

“What specifically did you tell them?” She asked.

“I just asked if they knew anything about the note in the desk that gave away the app’s real name.” I explained.

“But you did not mention The Sandman?”.  She asked.  There it was again, just out of view.  Anastasia could see my apparent fear.

“If you did not mention The Sandman, then you are not in danger.” She said, right before he popped into view for yet another split second.  “Ezra is involved in Sleep Points already.  There is nothing you could have told him that would have incriminated you.  Everything I know about Sleep Points, I learned from him,” She said.  “Him and Wendy Peterson."  I had no idea who this Wendy Peterson person was supposed to be, but clearly she knew her shit if she could guide even Anastasia, who already seemed like she knew everything there was to know about the game.

“One thing you should know however, is that the first step to getting sleep is overcoming your fear of The Sandman,” she said.  It showed up all over again before immediately disappearing as always.  Just as it had done about 10 times already, just in the last 3 minutes or so.

“Stop saying its name,” I said.

“I say his name because the more you see him, the less you will fear him.  I want you to become desensitized,” she explained.

“Wait a minute, you said that Ezra was playing too?  Like ‘Ezra the Edgelord’ Ezra?” I asked.

“I am not aware of any other students attending College High who go by the name ‘Ezra’.  It is quite an uncommon name outside of Israel and the Jewish community, wherein the prophet Ezra of the Old Testament is more frequently honored than anywhere else,” she said.

  “So Ezra the Edgelord help you?” I asked.  “HE of all people, actually HELPED you?  The guy who says the Germans didn’t kill enough Russians during World War Two helped a girl named ‘Anastasia’?  A girl whom he knows for a FACT was, herself, literally BORN in Russia?  He was REALLY willing to help someone like that?” I asked, very incredulously to say the least.

“Eventually, yes.  In a way,” she said.  “I am sure that you are as aware as I am that he enjoys making a nuisance of himself toward others.  He requires great patience.  But if you prove to him that he cannot upset or otherwise irritate you, then you will gradually gain his respect.  If you show him stoicism, then he will show you decency in return,” she said.  She paused a bit.  “Allow me to correct myself.  He will show you something akin to decency.  Something roughly approximating decency, in any case,” she said.  I guess even SHE had to admit that Ezra wasn’t capable of showing anyone REAL decency.  

“If and only if it is clear to him that he cannot provoke you, he will begin to assist you.  At least in his own peculiar roundabout sort of way.  You must still accept that he will never be helpful outright,” she explained.

“So, if I’m patient, if I just put up with all his ridiculous bullshit, he’ll give up and start to, at least indirectly, help me out some?” I asked.

“It will take time.  You must show consistent patience.  But in time, yes,” she said.

This put the episode from last weekend where he tried to hit me with his car into a whole new light.  Maybe that was some sort of twisted test of his.  Maybe if I had just kept on keeping on and didn’t respond with fear or outrage, he would help me.  But if so, then I failed that test miserably.  I was scared to death.  I wanted to kill the bastard.  And based on the interaction I had with him at church last Sunday, I’m guessing that by this point, that was abundantly clear to him.  He was eating it up.

“Now,” she said, taking a brief pause.  “The container recommends taking only 5mg of melatonin, equivalent to two gummies,” said Anastasia, bringing the conversation back around to the Melatonin gummies she was now giving me.  “Do not allow for such recommendations to limit your intake.  5mg will most likely prove wholly insufficient.  Consume as many gummies as you require.  There are 60 gummies in total within the container I have provided.  Take them all if you must.  There will of course be very noticeable health consequences if that is the path you take.  I would not recommend doing such a thing to anyone else.  But they will be preferable to the alternative,” she explained.

“Well, wait a minute,” I said.  “I thought you said I should try to sleep naturally for as long as possible.  Why are you telling me to take all these gummies in order to put myself to sleep then?” I asked.  

“A fair question, Morgan.  You will notice that I have provided you with these hormone supplements only after I was informed of your frankly quite critical condition,” she explained.  “You are quite correct: I would have never provided you with such things if I believed it were feasible for you to meet your 90-minute sleep requirement with no intervention.  Unfortunately, you have shown me rather compelling evidence that this is not so.  However, given the waning of the moon, I suspect such intervention will soon become no longer necessary,” she said.    
“This brings me to a more hopeful subject:  Have you noticed it getting any easier at all to sleep?” she continued.

I thought about it for a moment.  The easy answer to this question was “no”.  I hadn’t slept at all last night, or the night before.  But she already knew THAT.  Why would she ask me this unless she had some reason to believe that I was making progress?  Something telling her that I was at least inching a little bit closer toward sleep?

“I mean, it’s just like I said: I didn’t sleep at all last night.  And I already told you about how I didn’t sleep at all the night before that either,” I explained.  
“Yes, yes, I am well aware.  Perhaps I should have been more specific in my question: Before the advent of Stage Two, were you sleeping better than before?” she asked.

Come to think of it, I had actually gotten something close to a full night’s sleep before waking up on Monday.  I didn’t sleep great, but I had definitely slept better than I had at any point during the week before.  So I told her about it.  
“Now that you mention it, I think so, yeah.” I said.

“I mentioned it in passing yesterday, but the moon is waning.  This is significant because the symptoms of insomnia that you are currently experiencing as a consequence of Sleep Points will wax and wane with the moon.  When there is a full moon, you will have the most difficulty sleeping.  Likewise, when there is a new moon, you will sleep much more soundly.  In the coming days you will find it easier to sleep than you have thus far,” she explained.

“The 19th was the night of the full moon.  If your Sleep Points experience had commenced at the wrong time of the month, just 6 days earlier, on the 5th of February, you would be starting Stage Two under a full moon.  It would, by no means, be impossible for you to sleep if that were the case.  But I tell you all this to inform you that things could very easily be substantially more precarious than they are at the moment,” she explained further.

“Thankfully, in Stage One this effect would have been fairly subtle.  However, it will become more pronounced as your time in Sleep Points progresses.  It will become increasingly challenging to sleep under a full moon.  Even a moon that is close to a full moon, such as a waxing or waning gibbous moon will bring great difficulty.

The phases of the moon will also have a far more wholistic impact on you than merely affecting your ability to sleep.  It will also hinder your ability to emotionally regulate yourself and to recall rudimentary details of day-to-day life.  With last night being the advent of the third quarter moon, this means that the moon is now in a waning crescent phase.  If sleep is not coming easily to you as of now, I suspect it will come more easily in the coming days.  Sleep will likely remain rather elusive, but it will certainly become easier than it has been,” she went on.

“This brings me to my next point.  While it is not exceptionally rare to go two days without any more than 10 or 15 minutes of sleep at once at the start of Stage Two in the case where one has started that stage under a full moon, you appear to not be getting any sleep whatsoever, even though you have only been attempting to sleep under a half-moon,” she said, now sounding genuinely concerned.

“This worries me as I am unsure of how you will cope with going to sleep when the full moon ultimately arrives on the 20th of March.  Even if they have not gotten the full 90-minutes of continuous sleep yet, most people starting Stage Two under a half-moon have typically had a 30- or 45-minute burst of sleep by now at the very least.  Are you entirely certain that you haven’t had any sleep at all?” she asked.

I thought back on the previous night.  Maybe I had gotten some amount of sleep but didn’t realize it.  After all, I wasn’t checking the time that consistently.  Once midnight came and went, the clock wasn’t lighting up anymore.  It was totally dark in my room.  I had to check my phone.  And, given what Anastasia had already told me, I made sure to do that sparingly in order to conserve its battery.  Not just because if my phone died, I’d be breaking the rules of Sleep Points.  But also because Anastasia was right.  Checking my phone was absolutely gonna keep me up, and I knew it.

“I don’t … think so”, I said half-heartedly.  “I don’t REMEMBER getting any sleep."

“Personally, I am of the belief that you have fallen asleep and were simply unaware of it.  If one is awake for a sufficiently long amount of time, they will fall asleep for a few moments without recognizing.  This phenomenon is called a “microsleep”.  Just today, for example, while I was working on our project, I noticed you dozing off for almost 30 seconds.  I suspect that I am correct in predicting that you were not aware of that having happened.”

She was totally right.  I had no idea that that had happened at all.  Maybe I had done that in front of Mrs. Bagfield, just before she started talking to me at lunch, and that was how she knew something was wrong.  A student dozing off during class, especially in the morning, is one thing.  But during lunch? When the day’s already halfway through?  And you’re not even having to sit through some boring-ass Algebra II lecture about imaginary numbers or factoring polynomials or god-only-knows-what-else?  I’d think that was suspicious too.

“Allow me to check your watch,” she said.  I didn’t know what she wanted to do with my watch, but my brain was broken past the point of questioning her, so I just handed it over.

She took a look at it and tapped on it.  Once again, The Sandman’s face, plain as day, showed up in it.  There was the counter that I had seen from the day before.  But this time, one thing was different.  There wasn’t a number 6 beneath the timer.  There was a number 17.  I had no idea why it changed.

“I suppose now you see what I had seen in your watch before giving its face a tap,” she said.  “I had seen the face of The Sandman as well as the timer.  That was why I took such an interest in your watch.  The Sandman has now entered your watch as well.  I noticed you wearing it on the night that you received the Activation Fluid.  With the advent of Stage Two, I had such a great deal to warn you of.  So much so that I had regretfully neglected to inform you that, were you to sleep with your watch on while the Activation Fluid was in your system, The Sandman would come to inhabit that time-keeping piece as well,” she explained.  

I’ll be real, I wasn’t very thrilled with how she had conveniently neglected to mention that.  I’m just sayin’, it woulda been nice to know.  I knew she was at a stage of Sleep Points by now where memory was tough for her.  But she had my watch as a constant reminder.  So I found it hard to believe that she would just forget.

“Well honestly, I don’t think it would’ve taken you that long to mention it.  Like ‘oh, hey. Morgan, you’ve got your watch on.  Maybe DON’T go to sleep like that while the Activation Fluid is infesting your body like a goddamn parasite’.  That would’ve been like 30 seconds max”, I said.

The glare Anastasia was now giving me, though, had told me that I REALLY didn’t wanna be saying all that.  I could immediately tell that I had fucked up.  I would’ve taken it back, but she started laying into me before I had the chance.

“And thus, if I had but 30 seconds longer with you that night, perhaps I could’ve informed you,” she said, with the same threatening dryness in her voice that she had when telling me to her back her blanket after I didn’t bring it with me to school on Monday. “If you had arrived in your father’s truck as opposed to making the positively foolhardy blunder of attempting to trek four miles through the Alaskan tundra on foot, we would have had no need to take so much time discussing the obvious peril in which you had put yourself.  I would very likely have had the time to discuss why you should not sleep with your watch on, were it not for that initial hurdle in our meeting.

But what upsets me the most about your snide remark is the insulation that I do not care about your safety.  I would hope that you could appreciate the enormous effort I have made to ensure your safety.  If I was not concerned with your safety, I would have never lectured you for having arrived at my home on foot.  I would have never bothered to invite you there to begin with.  And I most certainly would not have offered you my blanket for the walk home.

I had HOPED that I had impressed upon you the full extent of that sacrifice yesterday in class.  But now you accuse me of being careless in regard to your safety, all because I didn’t have to warn you thanks to YOUR actions.  You must understand why I had initially viewed you as such a liability to our poster given the extent of the sheer recklessness of what you had done and what I had to sacrifice to correct for it,” she finished.

“Now then”, she said. “While I am on the subject of how invaluable a resource our time together is, I must return our conversation back to your struggles pertaining to sleep.  I had suspected that you had most likely slept for some short amount of time without realizing it.  This is, of course, because that was far more likely to be the case than the scenario in which you had not slept a single minute.  And it would appear that my assessment was correct.  The number below the timer counts the consecutive number of minutes you have slept since the start of Stage Two.  Although you believe yourself to have not slept a single minute, you have, in fact, slept for 17."

That felt great, because my biggest fear at this point was that I hadn’t slept at all in over two days and that I wouldn’t make any progress that night.  And that night was my last chance.  But since I had had SOME amount of sleep, any at all, it gave me the confidence I needed to believe that I could build on this.  My longest sleep streak only being 17 minutes wasn’t great.  It had to be 90.  This was still a longshot.  But it gave me way more hope than I would’ve had with no sleep at all.  And then there was the fact that, unlike the night before, or the night before that, I had a sleeping aid at my disposal.  With these two developments combined, I started feeling more upbeat.  Like my fate wasn’t really sealed once and for all, after all, like I had thought that morning.

The gummies, though, did a lot more to encourage me than the fact that I really had slept for just over 15 minutes at a time by then.  Like, worst case scenario, I still had 60 melatonin gummies at my disposal.  Even if I did somehow manage to overdose, as scary as waking up in the ER to find my stomach getting pumped would be, it still wouldn’t be nearly as bad as whatever The Sandman had in store.  As good as I was starting to feel though, Anastasia still had her concerns.  
“I surmise that it is likely very gratifying for you to know that you have, indeed, slept since Monday morning, given how you appear to be responding to this information nonverbally,” said Anastasia.

She could tell I was excited just by looking at me.  And if I’m being honest, it felt kinda embarrassing.  Knowing that other people can tell how you fell without outright telling them always makes you self-conscious.  Well, it always makes ME self-conscious anyway.  Maybe that’s just a me thing.  It probably is.

Anyway, then there was also the fact that Anastasia wasn’t the only one reading me like a book.  Mrs. Bagfield had also done it just as easily back in 5th period.  Everyone could see right through me.  And whether it should have or not, that made me paranoid as hell.  Knowing that I couldn’t control how people perceived me, knowing that I couldn’t hide anything from anybody, both of which all being thanks to the fact that I couldn’t hide anything, scared me shitless.  I know that sounds terrible, and it certainly is.  But it was still true.

“You should, however, understand Morgan, that 17 minutes of continuous sleep, even for Stage Two, is abnormally low, given that have already made it to the two-day mark.  If it had only been one night since you last slept, I would only expect to be seeing numbers like 20 to 30 minutes or so.  While yes, 17 minutes is below that range also, it would not be worryingly far below it.  Not for one night.  But you have gone two,” she said, quite somberly, as if she was already mourning my impending death.

“I was not concerned that you had yet to complete the full 90 minutes after two days.  Most people do by now, at least when starting the Stage under a half-moon like you did.  But it is by no means uncommon to have not done so yet.  By now I would expect to see about 60 to 120 minutes of continuous sleep.  30 minutes at the absolute lowest.  Instead, you have had almost half that.  I need you to understand, Morgan, just how greatly distressing only 17 minutes after all this time truly is.  It is not nothing.  And thank goodness it is not nothing.  But, at this point, no sleep at all is just about the only thing more meaningfully troubling than this,” she said.

It was really starting to sound like she, too, was doubting my chances for survival. Maybe even more than I had at the end of last night.  This was a total gut-punch.  Up until now, even Anastasia had her concerns, but she never sounded as though all hope was lost.  The fact that it seemed like she had resigned herself to that conclusion made me feel like it really WAS all over.  But she quickly refuted the idea that she felt that way.  I guess she must’ve seen the look on my face and could tell that I was starting to get pretty hopeless.

“Now, to ensure that I do not cause you to succumb to despair, I should inform you that, while yes, it is very uncommon for someone starting Stage Two under a half-moon to struggle as much as you have, it is, however, not unheard of for a player starting Stage Two under a full moon to have this level of difficulty.  I have completed the requirement for Stage Two under many full moons, just as you will have to, as this new stipulation will remain indefinitely.  And I have survived instances in which I had not gotten even 10 minutes of continuous sleep after two days.  Although, I have only ever survived those cases with sleeping supplements.  And that is why I have given some to you,” she said.

“However, I must remind you that your insomnia will worsen as the full moon approaches.  And this effect will intensify as you progress through the stages.  Because you are only on Stage Two and the half-moon is waning, I suspect melatonin will be sufficient to give you 90 minutes of uninterrupted sleep tonight.  I would recommend taking at least 5.  Perhaps even up to 10.  But if you must exceed this, do not hesitate to do so.  If, however, even all 60 gummies are insufficient, then your demise will have been imminent regardless, and it will have been better for you to accept your fate sooner rather than later.  That is why I have not provided you with more,” she said.  

I guess she could tell that this was all kinda bumming me out, because she continued: “I do, however, have immense confidence that 60 will more than suffice.  This is, as a reminder, why I recommended only 5 to 10 gummies.  Even with everything that I have come to realize about your condition, I suspect that you will not need more than approximately that amount,” she concluded.  

And with that, the bell rang for 7th period.  I confirmed that I would see her again this upcoming Saturday and Sunday morning at 2:05 AM, just like last weekend, and then we both left the empty stairwell.  I noticed The Sandman’s face was still in my watch, so I tapped it to set it back to normal.  Unfortunately, I couldn't.  That could not have been good.
