I have always hated women.

God, why didn’t they ever shut up? Women’s rights this, women’s rights that. Honestly, we men gave you the freedom to even like, do shit. They should be like my mother, who always obeyed my father without question and never dared to say anything that would upset him. A caring, shy, submissive woman. A real treat to the eyes. But of course, modern day females boiled my blood- I wish I could teach them all a lesson.

The chance came quite soon, coincidentally.

Nora.

That bitch.

She joined the university as an assistant professor where I taught. On the first day, she charmed the entire office by her antics (pissed me off so much). Firstly, she didn’t even deserve to be here, what kind of family did she have that allowed her to behave this way? She should have stayed at home and waited to get married to serve her husband. Instead, she laughed and talked loudly with male colleagues like it was no big deal. I, however, being the sensible man, refrained from speaking to her. Moreover, she held a higher position than me. I despised that fact.

Anyways, final exams were around the corner. The lively university environment was replaced with anxiety-filled students frantically going over their notes, discussing expected question patterns in the library or rushing to faculties for last minute consultations. I had just finished submitting my finalized question paper to the department coordinator when Nora came up to my desk. 

“Mr. Rashid?” She said, smiling.

I immediately stiffened. She obviously saw that I always avoided her, then why was she here? These types of women never failed to find an excuse to talk to men. Disgusting.

I stared straight ahead at my computer, not answering her. Maybe she would go away if I didn’t say anything.

Nora’s smile didn’t falter. “I was wondering if you would join us-”

“No, thanks”, I responded curtly. 

“Oh, alright! Sorry to disturb you”, she nodded and walked back to her cubicle. I sighed. Ever since this woman came here, I noticed a few subtle changes. Colleagues started to give me side eyes and some who used to greet me didn’t bother interacting with me now. I figured it out after some thinking- Nora had bewitched them. They saw that I never engaged in conversations with her (to be frank, I didn’t communicate much with others, just strict business) and assumed something foolish. I couldn’t care less.

However, it was slowly getting on my nerves. Despite me being a reputable member in the department, all the attention went to Nora. Never did I imagine that a woman would outshine me. I felt ostracized. 

Something had to be done.

I formulated a plan. I would invite Nora somewhere under the pretense of discussing an academic matter that I had trouble understanding. Of course, I didn’t want anyone to see the two of us together, so I decided to settle at my house. When the opportunity came, I would make her remember where she belonged. 

The hardest part was actually talking with her, but I attempted to dissolve the tension gradually without drawing much scrutiny. I could sense Nora’s internal astonishment. Fair.

She agreed to meet me on the weekend for an hour. I lived in a secluded single-story house on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by low mountains. There was a forest around 4 miles away from here. I sometimes visited that place to cool off.



Who knew it would come to use one day.



I paced around the living room impatiently, waiting for the clock to strike 5. Nora was quite punctual, that I knew. I had to be very careful with how I conducted everything. No rush.

As the doorbell rang, I took a deep breath and opened the door, letting Nora enter. She donned a bright salwar suit, beaming. I frowned momentarily. Always flashy. 

Ugh. 

Handing me a packet of sweets, she remarked, “You live in a beautiful place!”

I tried to smile. “Yeah, thanks.”

I motioned for her to sit on the carpeted floor lined with cushions. She looked around, admiring the space. I brought a glass of water and light snacks, putting them on the table before her. After some small talk, I described the issue to her. She listened attentively and listed down my problems, thoroughly explaining them. I hate to admit it, Nora was pretty good. 

“So,” I cleared my throat. “Are things between you and the coordinator okay?”

Nora’s face turned pale. “Why this sudden change of topic?” She smiled weakly.

I drummed my fingers on the table. “You can tell me.” Huh, as if I would do shit.

Nora shifted uncomfortably.

I knew that our coordinator had said something to Nora that really upset her, leading to whispers and hushed rumors circulating. She didn’t clear any doubts- she displayed a stoic expression when a colleague brought it up. I could guess what happened, I just needed to confirm it.

Nora exhaled. A cloud of uncertainty shrouded her features.

“Nothing much.” She took a long pause, then went on. “He said that I wasn’t doing my job properly. That I was too friendly and couldn’t handle criticism. My emotions came in my way when making formal decisions. Yada yada.”

Yep, I hit the bull’s eye. I was a bit taken aback at how she spilled everything, but good for me. This was my chance to break her morale.

“I worked so damn hard for this”, Nora’s voice broke slightly. “No one understands. After my divorce, I gave up everything just to make myself reach this position today. Why is it difficult to-”

I snorted. Nora stared at me, dumbfounded. 

“Sorry”, I said between bouts of laughter. “Do you know what you sound like?” I imitated a crying baby. “What, you think you can gain sympathy by telling your sad story? Load of bullshit.”

The disbelief in Nora’s eyes further fueled my hatred. 

“Oh please, drop the act. Women like you are bound to be without men, suffering all the while. Your life’s so pathetic it makes me wanna throw up. I have loathed you since you came in. I hate every single one of you who fucking pretend to be independent or whatever but can’t survive without-”

“SHUT UP!” Nora screamed, her face contorted with anger. “You prick, shut your damn mouth. How DARE you speak to me like that!”

She stood up and gathered her belongings, sobbing. 

“Wait, I’m not finished. You better stop competing with me-”

“Who the hell wants to compete with a loser like you? I don’t even consider you as a colleague anymore. Leave me the fuck alone.” Nora turned to leave.



The next few seconds happened in a blur.



I picked up a heavy vase. 



I swear it was on impulse.



And it came crashing down on her head.



She let out a cry, holding the place where I hit her. She swayed a bit before losing her balance. Blood started oozing out, filling the room with a coppery smell. Her body convulsed once before going still. 



I froze. 



I had killed her.
