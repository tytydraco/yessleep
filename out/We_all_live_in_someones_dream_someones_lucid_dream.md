Lucy woke up with a start. She had just had the most vivid dream of her life. She was in a strange world, full of colors and sounds and sensations that she had never experienced before. She felt alive and free and curious. She met people who looked like her, but also different. They spoke a language that she understood, but also didn't. They told her stories that she believed, but also doubted. They welcomed her as one of them, but also warned her of dangers.
They called themselves the Dreamers. They said they were the inhabitants of this world, which was not a world at all, but a mind. A mind that belonged to someone else. Someone who was asleep in another reality. Someone who had the power to create and destroy everything in this world with his thoughts and emotions.

They said they were his children. His creations. His experiments. His toys.

They said he rarely visited them. He usually forgot about them when he woke up in his own world. He only came when he lucid dreamed, when he became aware of his own dreaming and decided to explore it.
They said he was unpredictable. Sometimes he was kind and generous, giving them gifts and wonders and miracles. Sometimes he was cruel and capricious, taking away their loved ones and memories and hopes.

They said they never knew what to expect from him.

They said they called him God.

Lucy didn't know what to make of all this information. She felt confused and scared and fascinated all at once.

She asked them how they knew all this.

They said they had learned it from the Elders.

The Elders were the oldest Dreamers in this world. They had been here since the beginning, since God first dreamed them into existence.

They said they had seen him many times over the centuries.

They said they had talked to him sometimes.

They said they had secrets that only they knew.

Lucy wanted to meet them.

She asked them where they were.

They said they lived in the Temple.

The Temple was the most sacred place in this world. It was where God first appeared to them when he created this world out of nothingness.

It was where he still came sometimes when he lucid dreamed.

It was where they hoped to see him again someday soon.


Lucy decided to go with them to the Temple.
She wanted to see God for herself.
She wanted to ask him questions.
She wanted to know why he made this world.
She wanted to know why he made her.

The journey took several days.
Along the way, Lucy saw more wonders and horrors than she could ever imagine.
She saw mountains that touched the sky and valleys that hid secrets.
She saw forests that sang and deserts that whispered.
She saw rivers that flowed with fire and oceans that glowed with light.
She saw animals that flew and plants that walked.
She saw cities that rose from the ground and ruins that sank into it.
She saw people who loved
and people who hated
and people who died

Lucy learned more about this world from the Dreamers who accompanied her
and Lucy taught more about herself 
to herself 
and others 


Lucy felt more connected 
to this world 
than she ever did 
to her own 


Finally 
they reached 
the Temple 

The Temple was a massive structure made of stone
and metal
and glass
and something else
something Lucy couldn't identify
something alive
something divine


The Temple radiated power
and beauty
and mystery
and danger


The Temple called out to Lucy
and Lucy felt drawn to it


The Dreamers led Lucy inside

The interior of the Temple was even more impressive than its exterior
It was full of rooms
and corridors
and halls
and chambers
each one different from the other
each one containing something new

something old

something borrowed 

something blue


Lucy followed 
the Dreamers 
through a maze 
of passages 
until 

they reached 

a large door 

at 

the end 

of 

a long hallway


The door was carved with symbols 
symbols Lucy recognized 
symbols Lucy understood 
symbols Lucy used 


The door opened by itself as soon as Lucy approached it 

Behind it lay darkness 


Darkness so deep 
so thick 
so heavy 
that Lucy could feel it pressing on her skin 
on her eyes 
on her soul 


Darkness so silent 
so still 
so empty  
that Lucy could hear it ringing in her ears  
in her mind  
in her heart  

Darkness so vast  
so infinite  
so eternal  
that Lucy could sense it stretching beyond her reach  
beyond her sight   
beyond her imagination  

Darkness so absolute   
so complete  
so final  
that Lucy could not resist it  
could not survive it  


Lucy stepped into the darkness  


And then she woke up  


She woke up in her own bed  
in her own room  
in her own world  


She woke up with a gasp  
with a scream  
with a cry  


She woke up alone  


Or so she thought  

As she opened her eyes  
she saw someone else in her room  
someone she had never seen before  
someone who looked like her  
but also different  


He had dark hair and pale skin and blue eyes  
He wore strange clothes and carried a strange device  
He looked confused and scared and curious all at once  


He looked at Lucy and said something in a language that she understood but also didn't  

"Who are you?" he asked  

"Where am I?" he asked  

"What is this?" he asked  

Lucy was too shocked to answer  

She was too afraid to move  

She was too curious to look away  

She stared at him and he stared back at her  

They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity  

And then he said something else in the same language that she understood but also didn't

"I'm dreaming," he said

"I'm lucid dreaming," he said

"I'm exploring my dream," he said

And then Lucy realized something that changed everything

Something that made her question everything

Something that made her fear everything

Something that made her hope for everything

He was not dreaming

He was not lucid dreaming

He was not exploring his dream

He was awake

He was awake in her world


Her world which was not a world at all but a mind


A mind that belonged to someone else 


Someone who was asleep in another reality 


Someone who had the power to create and destroy everything in this world with his thoughts and emotions 

Someone who was his child 


His creation 


His experiment 


His toy 


Someone who rarely visited him 

Someone who usually forgot about him when he woke up in his own world 

Someone who only came when he lucid dreamed 

Someone who was unpredictable 

Someone who could be kind or cruel 

Someone who could give or take away anything from him 


Someone who called himself God 



Lucy realized that she was God's dream



A dream that became real



A dream that became aware



A dream that became lucid



A dream that became a nightmare.
