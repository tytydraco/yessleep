I’ve lived in this hovel of an apartment for three weeks now and that’s enough to scare me out of here. Why you may ask? Well it all started the very first night here. 

 I brought my suitcase holding a very sparse amount of clothing because the looks of the apartment scared me enough so I planned for it to just be a temporary home. The receptionist was kind enough and gave me a keycard to room 22 on floor 3. The place screamed unprofessional so I didn’t expect much. I pressed floor 3 on the elevator and that’s where the nightmare began. 

I spent the rest of my day lounging in my room on my phone. My fingers ached from scrolling on TikTok by the time there was a knock on my door at maybe 8:00. I stood up tiredly and pulled open the door to a man. His silver eyes had heavy bags under them and twitched every few seconds. He wore clothes imbedded in dirt and slouched as he stared at me. His receding hairline spoke for itself. He looked like he was maybe in his 30’s. I looked at his chest for maybe a name tag of sorts in case he was an employee. He held my gaze for a good minute before I spoke up “Hello?” I muttered staring at his blank expression. “Hello?” I say more roughly but the man just stared. I blinked and the man was just gone like that. I bit my lip unsure what to think. Maybe I was imagining things, maybe I needed my daily coffee. Whatever it was I decided to let it go and went to lay on my bed. But that wasn’t the last I was seeing of him. 

I fell asleep at maybe 9:00 and woke up at 6:00 to a loud banging on my window. I was sure it was going to shatter into millions but it didn’t. It held its place until the banging stopped. I don’t know what I was thinking not to get up and look at it. But that entire time I just laid in the bed my eyes winced as the sounds shot through the air. I was tired and needed my coffee. I headed down to the breakfast buffet, if you’d even call it that, the options weren’t very… Plenty. I grabbed the thing that looked the most like breakfast food, a turkey sandwich with a butt load of mayonnaise and an odd side of, ketchup? Yep that’s right ‘the most breakfast food’. The other options were French fries just French fries and a burger. No coffee not even tea. God I was bound to go crazy in here. 

I sat down at a table full of crumbs and sighed placing my plate down. I began eating when the same man from earlier sat down in the seat next to me. His breath was on my neck, he was close, too close. I scooted away and said, “Sir, I’m sitting here. You’ll have to find another seat.” The man said nothing and scooted closer. “Sir!” I almost yelled out, I had a very serious thing about personal space. I got pissed off with the man’s antics and stood up with my plate to sit somewhere else. The man followed. I got a new seat he followed. I growled standing up and leaving the buffet. The man continued behind me like a ghost. I got onto the elevator and he followed. I started to run down the hallway to my room. I unlocked the door the man an inch behind me, his breath on my shoulder. I slammed the door in his face and laid down onto my bed. Loud banging sounded on my door he just wouldn’t get a hint, would he? The same schedule continued for two days. Why was he following me everywhere I went? I got tired of this and just accepted I had a shadow. I went to the store, he came with. I went to the laundromat, he followed. 

As I sit here writing this on my bed I’m wondering if I should post this. One second, I just got a notification. I just opened it. It says, room 22 on floor 3 is now following you on instagram. Why is he following me? I’m so sorry this was short I just need people to understand this situation I’m in….

He’s outside my door now 

Oh god, he has a knife…
