It’s going to be a long story so get ready. 

I came to this house during the beginning of 2016. At first everything was fine and then months laters I felt like this house was weird. I was young so I couldn’t explain it but I was joking with my mom saying that my house was haunted. 

I always felt I was being watched by someone in my living room, my garage and my bed room. I does not feel safe anywhere except my mother’s bed room. 

My first paranormal thing that happened is one day years ago (before covid, I think it was 2019 or 2018), it was late at night because I always go sleep late and I always take a shower before going to bed, and when I left the bathroom and I was going to climb the stairs (I also want to specify that the stairs have "holes" ie I can see below (I don't know what it's called) so I can see part of the stairs from below and a bit of my ground floor) and when I was about to take my first step to go upstairs I saw a man with a bit coat, a hat and a suitcase almost like if someone was going home after a long day of work. It was so realistic and the man was so chill that it was really scary. He walked the stairs below me and he was going to arrive to where was so I was so scared that I run to my bedroom. I never saw his face and never saw him again. Now I regret it because I would have wait to see his faces or anything else. But he was just so chill and it was almost like it was his house and he came back from work after a long day.

Almost feel like he didn't notice me and it was him coming back to his house after work. I heard people saying that if you see that men, it means someone is gonna die soon and my grand pa died months after this.

I also have a hatch that is sealed on the floor above on the ground floor next to the bedrooms and in front of my attic, my mother has never had any info on that and why it is sealed. I will try to post a photo.

I had also recently my door of my garage unlocked and opened when she is always locked. My mom thinks she forgot to lock it but trust me, she never does. 

During this summer, a lot of stings were found death in front of the bed of my mother in her bedroom. It was not just one, it happened a lot of times but then it stopped. She was never stung by one of them, she just woke up and every day for a couple of days she found death stings. Doors, windows were locked and no holes in the wall. 

The people leaving in this house before were an old couple but none of them died there.

I also remember to have a cold wind in my shower on my body with a shiver when my door and window were locked and it happened a couple times and then one recently. 

I also had a dream with my teddy bear and I think he is haunted. So in my dream, I was in an old house (it was my house that I shared with my mom and my sister) and we decided to pack stuff to throw away. We went to the attic with my mom and they were toys (old dolls (porcelain, mid 1900's) and teddy bears) and I said to my mom « We'll sort them out and throw them away » and I was looking to the left and I saw a teddy bear and his head is turning towards me, I was scared and then all the toys jumped on me and my mother and I wake up terrified.

That's not the only thing I wanna share. have the same teddy bear that I had in my dream in real life. I saw it months ago in a store and I really liked him so I decided to buy it online from the same company. But even if I find him really cute, I always had bad vibes since I had him.
Firstly, when I was on my computer and he was on my bed I always felt like something was watching me (I never had that feeling before even with my other dolls (because I have also dolls)) and I couldn't sleep with him in my bed so I was so scared that days later receiving him, I put him in my attic. So it is related that I got attacked in an attic by the same teddy bear in my dream ? The same teddy bear is currently in my actual attic so it’s almost like it’s a meaning. 

Also wanna mention that the house in my dream have two identical rooms of my real house. The ground floor and living room.

If someone can help me with this and have any advices or anything else, I will love to hear from you.
