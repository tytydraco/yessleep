Someone broke into Victor's apartment. 

The first word out of his mouth when he found his front door unlocked was, “*Shit.*”

The place was ransacked, but the TV and other big ticket items that burglars usually go for were still there. The salt lines on each of the windows had been broken. That meant a human had come in on behalf of a Neighbor. 

I'll give yinz one guess which Neighbor it was.

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

While searching the apartment to make sure that the intruder was gone, I asked Victor if he knew if the mechanic had figured out where Reyna lives, careful not to say her name in case anyone was listening. 

To which, he responded, “He hasn't said anything about it, but… something is telling me that we need to get to her.”

As if on cue, my phone began to buzz. *Reyna.* I answered it quickly, but before I could say anything, she shushed me. There was banging coming from her side of the line. 

I muted my phone and told Victor we had to get to her *right now.* 

He drove at breakneck speed. Her apartment is normally a fifteen minute drive away. Too much could happen in fifteen minutes. 

And I heard every second of it. 

Through the phone, there was a crash as her door was broken down. I heard small, muffled sniffles as she tried to stifle her crying. My hands shook as I held the phone, praying that we'd get to her in time. 

There were more bangs as whoever was in her apartment tore the place up. Glass shattered. There was a yell from a male voice I didn't recognize. The door to whatever room she was hiding in flew open, slamming against the wall. Reyna went silent, most likely holding her breath. 

*Don't let them find her don't let them find her don’t let them find her…*

Reyna started screaming. Whoever was in her apartment swore loudly, then yelled, “Crazy bitch has a knife! She's under the bed!” 

Reyna shrieked, “*GET THE FUCK AWAY! GET AWAY!*”

I heard the mechanic's voice then, smooth and calm, “Get out. I'll take it from here.”

The moment he spoke, my heart stopped. Where was her hagstone? Did someone take it? Unconsciously, I put a trembling hand over my mouth, staring at my phone helplessly. Victor sped up. 

Reyna screamed again and there was a muffled thump as her phone was dropped. The mechanic chuckled in a way that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. 

Victor hurriedly said, “As long as he needs her, he won't kill her. She just has to hang in there.”

The mechanic laughed again, “Now now, there's no need for that.” 

There was a metallic clatter. He'd taken her knife. I could hear her hyperventilating, along with small thuds as if she were struggling. 

When she begged, my heart shattered. “Please! I don't- I don't want to-”

Victor shook his head, gripping the steering wheel so hard that his knuckles were white. 

“Open your eyes and this will all be over.” He told her. 

I wanted to unmute it to say or do *something,* but Victor stopped me, “If he knows we're listening, it’ll be worse. He'll put on a show.”

With a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes, I prayed again. I prayed that I wasn't listening to Reyna's final moments, helpless to do anything as he butchered her. 

The mechanic sighed, “Listen here, witch doctor. I was gonna leave you alone, because, let's face it, you're the weakest link. You know it, your coworkers know it. Ordinarily, easy pickins’ ain't worth my time, but then you had to overstep. Stick your nose where it don't belong. You gettin’ me?”

*That's not true, Reyna.*

She started to plead again, but he continued, “Now, the deal was that you and ol' blue eyes stay out of it, yet I have it on good authority that you're hiding the damn ledger. I suppose it makes sense. You are the most expendable. Orion can't very well run without the other two.”

*God, I should've hit you harder. Hell, I wish I could've shot you.* 

“So, witch doctor, I'm going to give you a chance to be useful, for once in your life. You can find your tongue and tell me where it is, or I could find your tongue for you.”

For a moment, all I could hear were Reyna's sobs. The shuffling had stopped. She wasn't fighting anymore. The mechanic clicked his tongue, then Reyna shouted desperately, “Wait! *Wait!* Please! I'll open my eyes, alright?! *Please!*”

“Thought so.” The mechanic replied, the smile evident in his voice. 

*We’re almost there. We’re almost there.*

Reyna suddenly went silent. For a horrible moment, I feared the worst, then she whimpered. 

Victor skidded to a stop in the parking lot, jumping out with his keys still in the ignition. I followed, both of us sprinting in. The door had been busted off of its hinges. 

Victor seized the man who'd aided the break in. This man didn't appear to be enchanted, his eyes clear as he quickly lost his wrestling match against the furious draugr. Meanwhile, I raced through the apartment to find that the mechanic had Reyna pinned on her bedroom floor by the throat. His pliers sat on the ground next to them. Whatever he was making her see made tears stream from her open, vacant eyes. 

By that point, I was only on my second day of the Z-pak and was already out of breath from the mad dash there. My back and shoulders were killing me. When I raised the fire poker to swing it at him, I was gritting my teeth against the harsh ache.  

He was on the other side of the room before I could clock him with it. With the shape I was in, I was far too slow. 

Unfortunately, the bruise on his cheek was already almost all the way healed. It hadn't taken him long. I should've hit him harder.  

The moment their eye contact broke, Reyna snapped out of it, scrambling away, looking around the room in a mixture of confusion and terror as if she didn't know where she was. 

The mechanic grinned at me, “You're lookin’ a bit tired. You feelin’ alright, pup?” 

Truthfully, I felt like shit. Just that one swing had been grief. It was to the point where Victor had forced me on exclusively phone duty at work that day. If I had to try to put up a fight like I did in the church, I'd be done. 

I tried not to let any of that show, resisting the urge to cough as I stared him down. I moved to stand in front of Reyna, not wanting him to get his hands on her again. She sat with her back against the wall, eyes closed, shaking. 

As I neared her, the mechanic circled around me towards the bedroom door. With a wink, he told me that he'd see me in three days. 

*I swear on my grandmother's grave that I’ll ruin you.*

Reyna muttered something, but I couldn't hear her. I quickly knelt next to her, watching the door in case the mechanic came back. From the other room, he commanded Victor to let his accomplice go, stating that the man had ‘earned his wings.’ 

Victor would explain later that the Huntsmen like to trick humans into bad deals. They’ll promise to recruit the victim to the Hunt as long as they can prove themselves. However, the bastards never specify *how* they intend to make the victim a part of the Hunt, allowing the victim to think that they'll have the same status, power, and benefits as a high ranking Hunter. 

As such, that man became a crow later that night.   

After the mechanic led his unwitting accomplice to his fate, I let Reyna cry in my arms until she was able to calm down enough to tell us what happened. She'd shoved both Fireball and her hagstone into the closet with the safe so that the mechanic couldn't get to either of them, sacrificing her own safety to keep the ledger - and all of our records - hidden. 

The skunk had started scratching at the door, making concerned weed whacker noises. When released, she immediately curled up in Reyna's lap, seeming to sense as all animals do that her caretaker could use a good cuddle.

“I'm sorry,” She whispered. “The moment he put his pliers on me, I just- I just *broke*. I'm not strong like you two.”

Seemingly without thinking, she curled her fingers, hiding her nails. It wasn't hard to imagine what he’d intended to do with those pliers. 

“Everything he said about you was bullshit.” Victor reassured her. “You risked your life to protect our only chance to stop him. That's pretty damn strong to me.” 

Still shaking uncontrollably as she held Fireball, she quietly continued, “I thought that… if I could let him into my head while I was thinking about- about my mom, he wouldn't be able to resist. He-he'd focus more on that, use it to torture me. I was right.”

I held her tighter as she broke down crying again, “I was ten years old all over again. I was in that house-”

“You're here, now.” I soothed. “Whatever it is that he made you see is in the past.”

I told her to look around the room and tell me everything she saw. It's a technique a therapist taught me when I was having trouble readjusting back into civilian life. She did it as she absent-mindedly stroked Fireball's fur, eventually calming down again. 

“We need to hide it somewhere else.” Victor said. “He’s getting impatient.”

“I’m taking it to the Weeper.” I announced, then immediately started coughing. 

“Not right now, you're not.” Victor retorted. “You're not in any condition to be traipsing around the woods.”

“He's not going to wait-” I started to protest. 

“So I’ll have to buy us some time. He’s going to be busy with that poor dumbass he used to get past the salt. While he's distracted with that, I'm going for that fucking banjo.”

I blinked at him in shock, “Are you *serious?*” 

He nodded, eyes blazing. “You two stay together. Hagstones on, both of you. Even if this doesn't work, he’s going to be pissed. And I’ll let you two decide where to put the safe. With what I’m about to do, it's probably better that you don't tell me. He’ll try to pull whatever information out of me that he can.”

“Won't you be breaking your agreement?” I argued. “And mine as well?”

“You heard what he said over the phone. As far as he’s concerned, we’ve already cheated just by helping you hide the thing. In his mind, if we bend the rules, he can, too, which means he might recruit another Hunter. And if that happens, it'll be one like him.“ He explained. “If I can get his weapon away from him, they’ll have no choice but to deal with me first.” 

Reyna piped up, “Take my stone. You'll need it more.”

“You keep it. I'm already dead. The worst they could do is-” 

“A lot.” She interrupted. “The worst they could do is a lot.”

“You know what he did to my father.” I added. “I guarantee he'll find a way to one up himself with you.” 

He went quiet, lowering his eyes. 

I followed that up with, “Besides, if something happens to you that leaves one of us to become manager and personally, I don't think either of us is up for that responsibility. You really want *me* running the place?”

That earned me a small smile. 

In the end, we convinced him to take the hagstone. Reyna agreed to be glued to my side until he returned. In the meantime, she and I brought the ledger with us with the intent to hide it later. 

While he set off on his mission, I helped Reyna pack up a few things for herself and the skunk before we took her car to my place. On the drive there, she opened up about what the mechanic had made her see. 

When Reyna was ten, her mother had disappeared without warning, leaving Reyna alone with her six-year-old brother. They'd thought that she would return the next day. She didn't. 

A week passed. They ran out of food. Reyna had to steal and thought she was going to Hell, like her mother had told her she would. She tried her best to keep herself and her brother clean and fed, hoping that if she was good enough, her mother would return. She'd convinced herself that her mother had left because of her.

Two months passed. Trash was piling up in the house. Her brother got a fever, so Reyna ended up going to a neighbor for help. The old man called child protective services when he saw the conditions that the children were living in. Reyna and her brother were separated. To this day, she doesn't know what happened to him. 

A third month passed. According to what  the old man told Reyna's guardian, the woman she called her ‘lola,’ Reyna’s mother reappeared like nothing had ever happened, apparently angry that her home was in disarray. She never tried to get Reyna or her brother back. 

As an adult, Reyna had reached out, wanting to understand why she'd done what she did. Her mother told her that it simply wasn't her problem anymore. And she'd said it without any emotion, with no regard to what she'd done to her kids.  

So… if Reyna's mother ever happens to read this, drop your coordinates. I just want to talk. 

We didn't end up hearing or seeing anything from Victor the next morning. Naturally, that made us both nervous. 

To make matters worse, a black tow truck painted with dramatic blue lightning bolts was parked across the street from my apartment complex, the side of it reading ‘Dubnos Towing’ in big white letters. Its driver left once to smoke. 

Reyna noticed him, too. 

“Well, he's obviously evil; he has all the red flags I love most.” She joked anxiously.  

Before I looked through the hagstone, I saw a man who had the sides of his short dark hair shaved. Tattoos swirled along his muscular arms. The stone revealed that it was the thorned Hunter I'd encountered in the library. 

“What the hell is he doing here?” I wondered aloud. 

Did that mean that Victor had succeeded? I texted him, telling him to avoid that road. A few minutes later, he called me.

Judging by the noise in the background, he was driving as he urgently asked, “What does the Hunter look like?”

My description went as follows: “Without the hagstone, he looks like an edgy TikTok fuckboy. With it, he's got antlers, thorns, bat wings, and goat legs.” 

He sighed, “Fuck me. That's Briar.”

“Briar?” Reyna repeated, glancing out the window again. “Is he better or worse than Psycho Mantis?”

“Between the two, I'd rather deal with Briar, but that's not saying much. He's terrible in his own right. The mechanic probably sent him over there to intercept me.”

“So, you have it?” I asked hopefully. “You actually stole his banjo?”

“Yes.” He replied to my and Reyna's relief. “I’m not sure where I’m going yet, I’m just trying to get some distance on them, at the moment. Once that happens, I'll figure out what to do with it from there.”

“Is the mechanic pursuing you right now?”

“Not yet. But if Brair's out, that means it's only a matter of time.” He answered gravely. 

“Listen,” I started. “I know I'm still not a hundred percent after the church incident, but I think as long as they're preoccupied with you, that'll give me the chance I need to get to the Weeper. We'll just have to hope she's willing to help.”

Victor hesitated before responding, “I don't like that idea. But I know you. So if you do end up trying it, arm yourself to the teeth and make sure that Briar doesn't see you.”

Looks like I was going to be crawling out of my bathroom window. It was the only room with an exit facing away from where the Hunter waited. 

We wished each other good luck, then hung up. I remember hoping that it wouldn't be the last time I spoke to him. 

Before I left, I warned Reyna that when I'd encountered Briar in the library, he'd threatened her. She didn't react much, eyes empty as she admitted that she was burned out, unable to have the capacity to be afraid. I've been there. To be safe, I left the fire poker with her in case Briar made a move on her. Meanwhile, I’d take the shotgun. With all that's been going on, we haven't had much time to train her with firearms other than basic gun safety, so that arrangement seemed safest for everyone. 

Before setting out, I placed the ledger on some saran wrap, sprinkled salt all over it, then sealed it. I don't know if that would help, but in the off chance that either one of those bastards caught me, I wanted to make taking it back as difficult for them as possible. 

I took some ibuprofen along with my next round of antibiotics, grabbed a handful of cough drops, told Reyna to pray for me, then pulled myself through the window. She handed both the ledger and my gun out to me before shutting it.

Sliding the shotgun onto my back, I hurried towards the river as quickly as my tired body would allow, looking over my shoulder the entire time. If I was followed by something, I couldn't see it. I sucked on one of the cough drops to keep myself quiet. The last thing I needed was for the pneumonia to give me away. 

It took a while of following the river until I found the Weeper. She was seated on a large rock in the water, humming softly to herself. When I approached, she stopped, looking alarmed.

“You shouldn’t be here!” She whispered, eyes flitting about. “Not yet. You haven’t recovered.”

“I don’t have time for recovery.” I replied, withdrawing the ledger from below my arm. 

The Weeper eyed the ledger, her expression unreadable as she breathed, “You are going to ask me to read it, aren’t you?”

I couldn’t hide my guilt. “I don’t want to put you in this position. Believe me, the last thing I want is to drag anyone else into this nightmare, but the situation is dire.”

“He was supposed to give you more time.” She commented.

“The Huntsman has been targeting those I care about in my stead.”

She shook her head, eyes lowering onto the water rushing around her ankles. “I should've known. That one is ruthless.”

I waited for her to say something else. She simply stared into the river, face drawn in a contemplative frown. 

The Weeper eventually uttered, “If I helped you, there'd be repercussions. The Hunters don't just reserve their cruelty to the humans they set their sights on.”

Feeling desperation clawing at my chest, I worded my question carefully, “What would I have to offer you to make the risk worth it?” 

Her gaze lifted, pale eyes scanning me as if seeing me for the first time. “You know that's a dangerous thing to propose for us both.”

I swallowed back the lump in my throat, “What he did to my father was a preview of what I have to look forward to if I can't learn his name. I only have three guesses and I've been too afraid to use even one of them. And in the meantime, he's terrorizing everyone associated with me. So I'm going to ask again: will you *please* name your price?”

The Weeper's face softened, her red lips drawing together. My heart raced, terrified that I was making the wrong choice, but also knowing that whatever she could do to me wouldn't be anywhere near as horrible as whatever the mechanic had in mind. 

Eventually, she uttered, “I can't leave this river. I'm only able to go as far as the bank; it always pulls me back. I've known nothing but death and cold water for the entirety of my existence. I just want… *more.* I don't know exactly what I want, but I know that there must be more than this. Can you give me that if I do this for you?” 

My mind raced as I told her that I would do everything in my power to help her leave the river if she translated the ledger. 

Face solemn, she asked me to unwrap the ledger. Once it was free of the salt and saran wrap, I passed it to her. The Weeper’s pink fingers traced the unknown words on the page, her lips moving subtly as she read. 

She shook her head. “So far, it's just… transactions. The first is a transfer from Caer Sidi to the Wild Hunt. Perhaps if I can find the page where they signed off on it, I can find his signature.”

I did a double take. “Caer Sidi? If my understanding is correct, doesn't that mean he served Arianrhod?”

“That appears to be the case. This Huntsman had been a guard of the fortress before swearing his allegiance to the White Son of Mist.”

So I was right: the mechanic is an old bastard.  

She continued to thumb through the pages. Her eyes suddenly widened, “There it is.”

My heart raced. This was it. After all of this turmoil, I was *finally* about to learn his name. She clutched my shoulder to pull me close, her skin so cold that I could feel it through the fabric of my shirt, and whispered it into my ear, careful that nobody but me would hear it. 

She asked me if I was ready. Even though I wasn't sure, I nodded anyway. The Weeper’s fingertips slid down from my shoulder to comfortingly trace the back of my hand delicately as she began her song. I took her hand in both of mine, trying to warm it. It was no wonder she wanted out of the river. Being cold and wet for eternity seemed like its own special version of hell. She seemed taken aback by this gesture, but made no move to retrieve her hand. 

Once again, her voice captivated me. The first time I'd heard her, the song had seemed mournful. This time, even though I couldn't understand the words, the tone of the one she sang to me then struck me as hopeful. 

*”Teann a-nall 's thoir dhomh do làmh,
Teann a-nall 's thoir dhomh do làmh…”*

The Weeper glanced around warily as she sang each word, as if anticipating that the mechanic would appear at any moment. I did my best to focus on her and not the frantic beating of my heart. Her hand was beginning to feel like it was warming up. 

While I listened, my thoughts were racing, thinking of the next steps. I'd have to find him before he found Victor, not just for the boss’ sake, but to keep the mechanic from getting his banjo back. I wouldn't put it past him to try to kill me off again before I could utter a syllable. 

*“Tha 'n cuan mar sgàthan gorm gun sgleò,
'S bu mhòr mo mhiann bhith 'n dh' Uibhist leat…”*

As her song came to its end, I was surprised to find that nobody had appeared to come after me. Definitely have Victor to thank for that. 

The Weeper looked equally concerned and shocked, seemingly reluctant to pull her hand away as she urged me, “You need to hurry. Go. Now!”

I grabbed the ledger and started to head back the way I came. First things first, I had to find Victor. Make sure that they hadn't caught up to him. 

With the ledger tucked under my arm, I wrestled my phone out of my pocket to call him. The call was answered, but he didn't say anything. There was just dead air. 

Something wasn't right. 

“Hit ‘1’ if you can't speak.” I whispered. 

There was a chuckle that didn't belong to the boss, “I was hoping you'd say his name. And I gotta say, it's a shame he doesn't have any of his contacts saved. Just numbers. He's a son of a bitch, but he's smart.”

Not the mechanic either. Briar. How did he get Victor's phone? Shit. 

“Where is he?” I demanded as dread settled within me. 

“Are you asking about my superior or yours?” 

“First mine, then yours.”

“The thief of Orion can't speak now. Not until he returns what he took.”

Keeping the fear out of my voice, I asked, “What have you done to him?” 

“Nothing yet. We're at a bit of a standoff. Better hurry, though. Captain'll be here soon enough.”

“Where are you?” 

They were by the lake. I just had to follow the river and I'd end up there. It was just a matter of if I could get there in time.  

“If I give you the ledger, will you let him go unharmed?” I asked. 

As long as I knew the mechanic's name, I could afford to let it go, especially if it meant that I wouldn't have to lose someone I care about  

Briar clicked his tongue. “That's not my call to make. I'm just a hired gun.”

Trying not to sound as desperate as I felt,  I asked, “Will you please let the mechanic know I'm on my way?”

Briar snorted, “I'm not his secretary.”

Resisting the urge to curse at him, I hurriedly explained, “He'll want to know that the Weeper sang her song. I'm fair game, now. He'll want to wait.”

There was a pause. Briar sighed as if I was asking the world of him, then said, “I'll pass it along.”

Fucker hung up on me. 

Alright. Follow the lake. No problem. On another note, I should've brought more ibuprofen. 

My hagstone shivered. There was a low hum deep within my chest, followed by whispers. 

*You've got to be kidding me. Now?!*

I looked through the stone to see that the whispering thing was on the other side of the river. It wasn't moving, orange eyes trained on me. 

“Well, you're just gonna have to wait!” I snapped, trudging towards the lake. 

It followed me from the other side of the bank, the whispers growing more frantic. It kept pace with me perfectly, eerily silent for how big it was, not stepping on a single twig. 

Hold on. Could it cross the water? I tried to recall if it had during its fight with the crows. I'd been running, so I didn't see. 

As it followed me, the whispering thing didn't attempt to get anywhere near the water. As I approached the lake, it paused, realizing that it was going to lose me soon if it couldn't get to my side of the bank. It let out another hum, reaching a leg towards the river, then withdrawing it before it could touch the water's surface. 

Up ahead, I could see that there was a wall of black thorns. Briar, turned away from me, paced in front of it, arms crossed over his chest. No sign of the mechanic,  though I doubted that it would take long for him to get there. 

Through the gaps between the branches, I saw movement. Victor. He was surrounded by those thorns, not able to escape while Briar was unable to reach him thanks to the hagstone. That made me glad that we’d forced the boss to take it. I don't even want to think about how things would've gone if Briar could've gotten to him. 

The whispering thing's huge eyes followed me as I approached the thorn wall. Briar paused his pacing to look me up and down in disdain. 

“You brought trash with you?” He said, eyes narrowing at the whispering thing as it started to circle the lake, searching for a way around that didn't involve water. The voices made my head pound. 

“I didn't bring it, it came along.” I said flatly. 

The mechanic's voice made my muscles tense, “It wants trouble. Best give it what it wants, Briar.”

Briar gave the whispering thing a nasty smile, “You got it, sir.”

With that, he disappeared. The whispers ceased, leaving me with a dull ache behind my temples. Because I *really* needed to be in more pain. 

The mechanic came to stand at my right side, commenting, “Can't stand that thing. Been trying to get rid of it for a while.”

I didn't waste any more time. I spoke his name. “Iolo ap Huw.”

I don't think it hit him at first. He blinked in disbelief, then all of a sudden, his eyes lit up with realization. Once it truly sank in, his jaw tightened and his eyes slitted with fury. 

At his expression, I dropped the ledger to the ground, standing over it so that I could properly aim with the shotgun. 

He let out a quick, harsh exhale before muttering, “I see you found someone to translate it.” 

“It’s over.” I said, even though I had a bad feeling that it wasn't, in fact, over. “Relinquish your claim on all of us, as promised.”

Unexpectedly, he began to laugh. I kept my gun on him. 

Still laughing, his cheeks flushed, he shook his head slowly as he said, “I've been around for over a thousand years. In all that time, no one has named me. Then some fucking rat catcher from Pennsylvania comes around…”

He flinched when I said his name again, “Iolo. It's over.”

His sardonic smile stayed as he said, “Well, I guess I got what I wanted. This is fuckin’ exciting, alright!”

I'd never seen him like this before. It scared me more than the rage he'd displayed when he'd chased me down. 

He shook his head again, chuckling breathlessly, “Alright. I relinquish my claim on your souls. Now, we both get what we want.”

Distantly, the whispering thing hummed again. 

Between clenched, grinning teeth, Iolo hissed, “And Briar still hasn’t killed that fucking thing.”

I wasn't sure where this interaction was going at the time, but I knew it wasn't going to be anywhere good. We had to get away *now.*

“My boss. Let him out of the thorns.” I requested firmly. 

His eyes were strangely bright, “And then what? You waltz off with my instrument? Drive me out? Is that how you think this’ll go?”

Victor spoke through the thorns, his tone even, “I’ll return it, along with the ledger. After that, you’ll have no reason to stay.”

Iolo’s gaze scalded me, “Oh, no. You're plenty wrong about that. Do you really not see it after all the time you spent with us, blue eyes?”

Naturally, that threw me for a loop. I spoke without thinking, “What are you talking about? And if you try something, I'll put your name on a billboard!” 

Iolo chuckled again, his grin devious, “You really don't see the opportunity you have, do you?”

“Whatever you want to say, just say it.” I spat. 

Iolo's glare made my skin crawl as he explained, “The White Son of Mist stationed me here for a reason. If I go, another will take my place. ‘Cept, they'll be prepared to deal with you Orion fucks, which means there'll be more of ‘em.”

I glanced at Victor as best as I could through the vines, locating one blue eye, “Is he bullshitting?”

He replied, “I don't think so. He's manipulative and a scumbag, but he can't lie, so he at least believes that to be the case.”

More Hunters? Jesus Christ, that's the last thing we need. I still have to figure out what the hell is going on with those worms and a million other things. 

Iolo continued, a wicked look in his eye, “The reason why I say this is an opportunity for you, pup, is because you know my name. That grants you some power over me, power that you wouldn't have over my replacement. And I guarantee whoever fills my spot will be wantin’ you just as badly as I do. You'll be right back to square one. At least with me, ya got some leverage.”

“Hold on, our deal was that no other Hunters would be able to come after us *except* for you!” I reminded him. 

He laughed darkly, “Yeah, funny thing ‘bout that.”

I cocked the shotgun.  

Iolo’s eyebrows raised, the wickedness in his eyes growing along with his smile, “Our deal was that no one else from the Hunt would pursue you or anyone else *while* our bet was on. Thing is, deal's over. You *really* shoulda been more specific.”

Victor voiced my thoughts on this revelation perfectly: “God damn it!”

“Like it or not, pup, if you wanna live to see the end of this year or any others after that, you're stuck with me. But if you want to see how much worse it can get, go right on ahead! Put my name on a billboard! Hell, spray paint it on the side of my fucking shop! See just how much worse it can get!”

Sounding more calm than I felt as it dawned on me that I might not be able to fully get rid of this fucker, I asked, “So, what do you get out of this? You're making it sound like I benefit from this the most, which I *know* can't be the case.”

Each word that this evil bastard spoke next made my heart pound harder, “Every time you look at me, you think of what I did to your father. To you. To your colleagues. I know you do. I can see it. I can tell that just looking at me is torture for you. You get *all* wound up like a spring when you hear my voice. All I have to do to make your life hell is just be here. That's a prize in itself.”

I shot him. It knocked him onto his back. 

Iolo groaned, sitting up painfully, his chest covered in blood. With a grimace, he spat blood out and sneered at me, “We both win. And we both lose. How's that for a fairy tale ending?”

I was about to shoot him again when thorns appeared in a circle around me, just outside the hagstone’s limits. *Fuck.* I'd forgotten all about Briar. 

Iolo raised a hand. The thorns slunk back into the dirt, their master stalking up to frown at him. Iolo said something to him in the same language that the Weeper sings in. I think it might be Gaelic. After they spoke, Briar waved a hand, then the thorns trapping Victor slithered into the ground like snakes. 

The boss held the banjo in his hand, looking just as concerned about me as I was about him. Thankfully, he didn't appear to be harmed. 

Briar grunted, “Return what you stole and be on your way.”

I pointed my gun at him, “How do I know you're not going to just send Briar after us?”

Briar turned to him, silently asking for permission. 

Using his thumb to wipe blood off of his lower lip, Iolo answered, “I've considered it. And I still might, dependin’ on if my name ends up on a billboard or not.” 

So this was the real reason he brought Briar along: insurance. He'd anticipated that there was at least a chance that he'd be identified. Fucker. 

Iolo then said, “Tell ya what. Give back what's mine and keep my name amongst yourselves. In return, Briar won't be a threat.”

“Then what?” I snapped. “We just let you go back to collecting souls like nothing happened? And I’m supposed to believe you're not going to try to take revenge on me?”

Iolo spat again before explaining, “Like I said, if I can't do my job, I'll just be replaced with someone else. And whether you like it or not, the Hunt has a purpose. We're part of a whole afterlife ecosystem that can't be disrupted. And once again, you have my name. You and yours are as safe from me as you'll ever be.”

Even though I wanted to demand what the hell he meant by that, Victor answered before I could, “Please give us time to decide. I'll give you the instrument back, just so there's nothing tying me to you anymore.”

*What?* He couldn't actually be considering this, could he? 

Iolo rose to his feet, gritting his teeth as he got upright, muttering, “Hoo, that salt *burns.*”   

*Good.* 

Iolo whistled as he looked down at his bloodied torso, then raised his head to grin again, “Alright. You do that, blue eyes. But going forward, I can't wait to see how you deal with those blood cravings on your own. We kept you pretty well fed.”

Victor tossed the banjo to the ground, the strings letting out a dramatic *twang* as they hit the ground. Despite how hard he threw the instrument, it was unscathed. 

Briar glanced at Iolo again, practically foaming at the mouth for a chance to continue what he started with Victor, but one stern look from the captain of the Wild Hunt kept him in line. 

I left the ledger as well. It wasn't useful anymore. Though, I did leave the salt wrap on it. Hope they had fun with that. 

Victor and I have discussed it at length. What's horrible is that he thinks Iolo has a point. Of all people, I would've thought Victor would want that bastard gone the most. That leads me to believe that at the very least, the boss doesn't think that Iolo was bluffing. 

We got with Reyna to explain the situation. She stated that she's rightfully terrified of Iolo, but at the same time, she was worried about things getting even worse. Of us having to spend the rest of our lives dealing with the Wild Hunt until one of them eventually got to us. 

It brings to mind that old saying: ‘Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.’ Unfortunately, the devil we know is pretty damn awful. 

I'll be honest with yinz, I don't know about this one. I really don't. The idea of him being around forever, even with his name to keep him in line, makes my blood boil. However, if he is telling the truth, getting rid of him could prove to be more trouble than it's worth. I know Victor confirmed that the Neighbors can't lie, but Iolo is manipulative as hell. His word isn't trustworthy. 

I've got some time to figure it out. Pushing myself so hard made the pneumonia angry at me, so I'm taking some time off to wallow in mucous and dread.
