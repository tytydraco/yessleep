It was told by my mom...I don't remember anything about this. So it goes like this-

I had an Uncle who would play with me everyday and take me to playground and we had many fun together. He worked as a referee. he dreamt of me being a footballer in the future and that he would take me to school when I join the elementary school. He called me his princess. He stayed in my aunt's house and would come to our house everyday to take me with him. 

I was 2-3 at that time.

Anyway, one day when my mother went to my aunt's house for whatever reason to meet with the uncle, she saw that the person had a stroke from blood pressure. My mom and big brother( Aunt's son) took him to hospital quickly so that he would be saved. 

Upon arriving in the hospital, the doctors said that he would not make it in front of his face even though he was still alive. Hearing that, uncle panicked and passed away. 

I was told nothing regarding the news that he had apparently passed away because my mom thought that I'd get huge shock from it as he was very dear to me. 

The funeral came and we went to his house, i still didn't know anything. It was kinda dark when one of his brothers came in the room we were in and I thought that it was the uncle whom i played with. So I ran up to him and hugged him tightly. 

"I missed you very much! Where did you go?!" Were the things i said to him. He bent down to be on height with myself and said, " I'm not the one you're looking for, i'm his brother. He went out somewhere but would come back within some few days." When i found out that it was not the uncle i was looking for and that I hugged the wrong person, It bacame awkward.

My mom said that it was few days later that I vegan to act differently with her. When she would go outside of the house for a bit, she could hear that I was playing with someone but there was no one and that i'd always ignore the questions about who my playmate was. 

One night when my parents and I came home from dining in a hotel, I suddenly looked up at the cocomelon tree in front of my house , pointing out something with my finger and exclaimed happily ," Ma! Look, look ! Uncle!"

Mom confessed that when the words slipped out from my mouth there was an instant regret on my face and when my mother asked to repeat that , I answered it was nothing and It was probably how the leaves of the tree made it look like a person was sitting on the tree. 

My mom held my hand tightly and took me inside of the house and forced me to tell her everything that was happening. She said that i would not tell her first but when she made me swear her life to tell her about all the things, I started crying and told her that my uncle would visit me everyday when she would be gone and play with me. But he had a rule that if i would tell my mother any of this things, he would stop coming to play with me. 

Mom then confessed that the uncle I was playing with already died one month ago and he was gone forever. He never came to play with me anymore.

I don't remember any of it except the part that i told her about all this.
