\*\*Head Down, Eyes Shut\*\*



There are two things about me that are important to know. The first is that I've always been highly imaginative; not too prone to day-dreaming, mind you, just able to drive myself into nightmares. The other thing is that I cannot function in a quiet environment; so far as I'm aware, there's little reason to this aside from me being neurotic. There it is - all you need to know.



Over the years, these two facts of my life have taken more of a back seat. Neither have caused me any problems to date, though I believe they're starting to. This is why I've decided to write this down, to document what I think is happening as opposed to what professionals know is happening; hopefully this will find someone who might require reassurance like I do.



Beyond this paragraph, I will document everything for you.

I woke up late and missed my alarm. Today I'll blame the AM radio station I left on all night. Yes, I'm aware noise disrupts sleep, but I cannot be without noise, otherwise I'd get less sleep than I already do.



First things first, to start tackling whatever is going on with me, I figure it best to call a doctor and so I will.



\*\*\[October 9, 1997 || 10:56 am\]\*\*



A Dr. Johannson was kind enough to offer to see me within the next few weeks to assess whatever is going on. I won't bore you with my appointment details or go over the whole conversation. I will, however, mention that she was kind and seemed to think my issues weren't severe or anything to worry over. Good, I say.



\*\*\[October 9, 1997 || 10:59 am\]\*\*



I neglected to turn the radio back on and I could've sworn I heard Dr. Johannson telling me to shut my eyes tight. Imagination, see?

All but the floor in the hall was in complete darkness. I stood on one end, back to a solid, black surface. I could hear nothing at all, even when testing the back wall for a percussive response. I didn't feel panicked, but could tell I shouldn't be wherever I was, so I began to slowly probe forward.



From the other end of the hall, though I couldn't tell how far away it was, I heard something speaking. I strained hard to hear, but couldn't, so decided to move closer. This seemed like something very important for me to hear.



As I moved toward the whisper, the wall to my back came with me, almost pushing me with every step I took. Quickly, I realized I wasn't taking steps forward, I was attempting to step backwards, but the wall was catching me between steps and throwing the movement ahead. The wall wants me closer to hear. Do I want to be close?



I felt the flat of a large palm press against the whole of my back and the darkness in front of me gained mass. Suddenly, I was being pressed into the whisper, but the whisper was a thick gel, filling my eyes, my mouth, my lungs.



Darkness. Complete and total.

Over the last few weeks, I've had to bide my time one way or another. Other than the one nightmare I've described between my last entry and now, nothing of note has really happened.



I've had to switch from my usual AM radio station to leaving my television on overnight. Perhaps I'm unable to deal with darkness anymore as well as silence, though I'd be more apt to blame the AM host's recent habit of launching into whispered conspiracies about the dark around 3 am every night.

The whisper rushed to me and enveloped all of my awareness before I could do anything.

\*\*\[November 3, 1997 || 10:03 am\]\*\*



I woke up late and missed my alarm. Today I'll blame the AM radio station - no, not the radio station, right? I had to look back through the notes I've taken to be sure, but I transitioned to using the TV overnight. Odd, especially since the TV is off and the radio is currently on the old station. Perhaps I altered things in my sleep to adhere to old habits. You and I will just need to remember this.



The visit to the doctor is today and, unfortunately, I've no time to dwell on this right now. I'll bring this up at the doctor later on.



\*\*\[November 3, 1997 || 12:47 pm\]\*\*



My appointment is at 1:15pm, but I like to be early. It allows me to have some time to consume my surroundings, so to speak.



It's far too quiet and dim in the waiting room here. It's almost like the entryway into a darkroom crafted and held by a serial killer - there's that imagination. Opposite me a young woman is sitting with her legs tucked underneath her in the chair. She notices me looking, gives a friendly smile, and looks away towards a dark corner. Her eyes widen, so my gaze follows. I can't see a corner there.



\*\*\[November 3, 1997 || 3:52 pm\]\*\*



The doctor visit was uneventful and, honestly, quite the waste of time. My neurosis are getting worse as I age and my imagination isn't helping anything. If anything, according to Dr. Johannson, it's exacerbating my issues. I see darkness where there is none and hear whispers where there are none. It could be schizophrenia rearing its ugly head, but we'll have to watch and see what happens.



There is one thing that stands out and it's the recommendation I was given at the end of my appointment. It was almost if she'd forgotten to mention something so obvious, I went along with it thinking it was a natural course of action to take. We've scheduled some time for me in a sensory-deprivation tank.

The hall was darkness. The whispers were the darkness.

I've arrived at the facility where I'm to be subjected to sensory deprivation early to check some things out, but it seems they've prepared for this. I have requested that Dr. Johannson add details to this notebook, since I will be unable to within the chamber. Adieu.

Patricia Johannson taking notes for patient.



\- Patient hesitant to enter chamber - coercion required.

\- Patient enters chamber.

\- 15 minutes, no change at all of any kind.

\- 72 minutes, note below:



At the 72 minute mark, patient brain waves are completely abnormal and show no discernible patterns. The chamber room has grown dim, though all lights remain on. A shadow is spreading from the chamber entry door. We have succeeded.

\*\*POLICE INCIDENT REPORT - DEC 13, 1997\*\*



At around 3pm on December 13, 1997, a civilian called local police to report strange sounds coming from a warehouse building. The building in question has been under the ownership of a small, eccentric group of individuals calling themselves "The Beckon". Group has no known criminal ties or members who have been involved in any police reports dating back within the last 15 years.



On arrival at the scene, my partner and I cleared the outside of the building, noting nothing of significance. Entry to the building was not barred in any way. All rooms were empty save for one labeled "Dark Room".



Within this room, multiple bodies were found in very late stages of decay. The lights in the room were all on, but we could hardly see through some sort of haze or shade present. We could not find the source nor did we stay too long to search.



The chamber in the center of the room was untouched and open, but completely dark inside. Further investigation revealed an individual inside, their chin pressed down to their chest and their eyes closed tight, clearly in an advanced state of shock.



My partner and I attempted to communicate with the individual, but all attempts got us nowhere. We placed the individual back within the chamber and shut the door; it seemed the right thing to do. Before sealing the chamber shut, I thought I heard them say thank you, but my partner claims they heard nothing.

\*\*\[RECOVERED NOTE FROM OFFICER JAMES PURRAL'S BODY - DEC 14, 1997\]\*\*



I'm sorry.



There was one thing I should never have done in my life and I didn't know what it was until yesterday. I did it. They thanked me for it, too.



The whispers won't stop until they have me, I think. I've heard them ever since I put that thing back into the chamber in that room. They want me now, because I listened. I know what not to do.



Keep your head down, honey. Keep your eyes shut. And, no matter what, don't listen.
