Part 18- [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17zm72h/trapped\_in\_the\_dollar\_general\_beyond\_pt\_18/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17zm72h/trapped_in_the_dollar_general_beyond_pt_18/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

We came out in a familiar monochrome landscape, and I could already hear Gale having a small panic attack.

We were back in his nightmare, the place he had nearly been trapped for until he was used up, and when Celene hissed a me to help her, I tried to catch Gale as he went down. Buddy barked a little, confused and unsure of what was happening, but I quieted him down as Celene tried to get Gale moving again. He was mumbling to himself, at odds with what he knew he had to do, and when I yoked him up beside me, I think it surprised him as much as it did me.

"You can have a mental breakdown once we get out of here. For now, I need you on your feet. You've lived through too much of this place to let it snatch you at the very end."

He shook himself, my words getting through to him, and after a few more reassuring pets to let Buddy know it was okay, we headed into the blank and endless aisles of the final store.

The place was just as ghoulish as I remembered it. The shelves seemed to hold the ghosts of old products, and it wasn't long before we encountered the ghosts of explorers who'd come before us. Buddy made a whining noise as we skirted them, the hollow after images troubling him as went about the last moments of their lives in silent monotony. Celene looked troubled too. This was her first time here in the Miasma's home, and watching the quiet ghosts as they went about their time seemed to make her anxious.

We were reminded that they weren't the only residents of this place a few minutes later as the rumble of a Miasma grated against our ears.

It was on the next row over, thankfully, but we pressed against the shelves like it still might be able to see us through the slab. If it sensed us at all it gave no sign. It just kept its course and moved down the infinite aisles on whatever work it was about. I was already sweating under my covering, the lights getting a little hot beneath it, and I was hoping this wouldn't take too long.

The last thing we wanted to do was catch fire.

"I can't believe you came here by yourself," Celene said to Gale, "And you either," she added after thinking about it.

"I didn't," I said quietly, ruffling Buddy's ears, "I had Buddy with me."

He looked up happily, nuzzling my hand.

"We better get moving," Gale said, "Who knows how many of them there are around here."

We went faster then, taking departments at random as we tried to find the exit we all knew had to be here. I think, even then, I suspected it would be in the crystal area, but we couldn't use Buddy to find it this time. I had been using Gale's scent last time, but Buddy didn't have anything to fix on this time. He was flying as blind as we were, looking around frantically as if expecting to see something that would help us. If he was finding any landmarks, he kept them to himself. It all looked exactly the same to me and Gale, and as we ran, I kept an ear out for the rumbling footsteps of our captors.

The Miasma always sound gigantic when they walk, they are pretty huge, I suppose, and it made them easy to hear in the otherworldly quiet of this place. For such a huge place, the silence that surrounded us was almost deafening. Nothing seemed to exist in this place, aside from us and the Miasma, and I was very aware of the noise we were making as we beat feet. Given what I've told you, it must sound odd to hear that nothing seemed to exist here, but that's all I can do to describe it. The "ghosts" made no sound, the store had no ambiance, and even the music that was present in many of the others was silent here. This place was so effortlessly oppressive that it made sense for it to serve as a cage for those the Miasma captured.

This place felt like a tomb more than anything, and I prayed it wouldn't be ours.

For all his talk of hurrying, Gale was almost the reason we got caught the first time.

We were hustling down an aisle, trying to find some sign that we were getting close when Gale stopped dead in his tracks.

I had seen the ghost guy, the one holding hands with the woman as they ran, but when Gale stopped and Celene put her hands to her mouth I knew who we must have found.

I had to admit, there was a resemblance between the two of us.

No wonder Gale got us mixed up so often.

He was young, probably in his early twenties, with thick hair and glasses. He was on the heavier side, but not fat. His face was round and boyish, and I imagined he had an infectious smile. I would have to imagine because the look on his face was full of terror. The girl was younger than him, probably nineteen or twenty, but she looked no less terrified. I liked to think that maybe they had tried to make an escape too, the way Gale and I had, but they hadn't quite gotten out.

In the end, he had managed to find her, but it had gotten him caught too.

"Rudy," Gale said, reaching out and wincing as his hand passed through the kid's face. Rudy was saying something to the girl, Margo, I assumed, and he took no notice of Gale as he stood stuck in his last few moments of freedom.

"Gale," Celene said, her own hand resting on his shoulder, "I know it's rough, but we have to go."

"How?" Gale asked, his eyes locked on his lost son, "How can I just leave him here? He's my son, Celene? How can I just abandon him?"

Celene was crying, but as she tried to comfort him I could already hear the rumbles getting closer and closer.

"You didn't abandon him. He's been gone for a long time, hun. Even if we found him, it wouldn't be him anymore. He's been used up by now."

"You don't know that, you can't know that. He could still be here, just trapped in the crystals. We could still save him, we could,"

The slow rumbles were building, like thunder on the horizon.

"He's gone, Gale. As much as I wish it were otherwise, he's gone. We have to get out of here, though. We have to get out so we can ensure that no one else gets trapped here and suffers a similar fate. If we escape then we can warn people, but if we stay, we'll be gone too."

Buddy whined deep in his throat, and I turned to the two of them as Gale seemed to dither before the image of his precious son.

"Guys, one of them coming. We've got to move, or we're going to get caught."

Gale couldn't seem to pull himself away from the image of his lost son, but as that terrible darkness appeared at the end of our row, I took him by the arm and led us all the the end of the aisle just as it turned in our direction. Peaking from the end of the end cap, I could see it looking around, clearly expecting to find something here. Maybe it had heard us, maybe it had sensed us, but either way, we had escaped again.

As it moved away, I turned and finally recognized something from my previous trip.

The older woman in the floral print dress was still hunched where we had left her, and I grinned as I realized that I knew where we were.

"Come on," I whispered, and the four of us set off.

If Gale looked back, I missed it.

All I knew was that the four of us were off like a shot.

I took corners as I remembered them, Buddy also moving with an ease that made me hope he too remembered where we were going. The rumbles never got very close, and as we came to the edge of the crystallin garden, I felt a surge of joy rush through me.

If there was an exit, it had to be here.

Celene's eyes went from the flinty fear of a hunted animal to the bright sparkle of enchantment. The crystal forest, while mostly sharp angles and strange geometry, were still hauntingly beautiful. It was hard not to look at it as a thing of beauty until you realized its purpose. The ones on the outskirts wouldn't have more than bits floating in them, I assumed, but the ones in the middle could have mostly whole people in them. As we walked amongst the crystal giants I clutched my wooden club a little tighter.

The Miasma would definitely come if we started smashing them, but how long would that take them?

One look at Gale told me that he had to be thinking the same thing, and was barely containing the urge to start swinging.

"Do we know what we're looking for?" Celene said, keeping her voice low.

She seemed afraid to talk too loudly, afraid of what might hear her, and I leaned down a little so I could whisper too.

"I'm guessing it's something we'll know when we see."

"Maybe," Gale said as we trudged, "We might have already walked past it and not realized it. I can't imagine it's here for them, or they would be all over our world."

"Then why is it here?"

Even as I asked it, I knew it was significant. I had been in the DGB for...I don't really know, but its purpose had never really occurred to me. It was like that thing in the backyard my mom used to catch wasps in. You just sort of stopped thinking about it after a while and kept existing. You knew the wasps in there were suffering before they died, but they were just wasps, after all. Was that how the Miasma saw us? We were just humans, after all. Why not trap us in their version of a jar until they were ready to shake out all the corpses and start again? Hell, they wouldn't even have to do that. They, much like Native American hunters, used all parts of the prey.

These things were efficient if it was their doing in the first place.

"We should spread out a little," I said as the crystal forest spread out before and behind us, "We can cover more,"

"That sounds like a great way to get snatched," Gale said, cutting me off, "We need to stay together, otherwise we're just asking to get picked off."

"If we stay here too long,"

"If we stay too long, we might get grabbed. If we split up, we might get grabbed. No matter what we do, there's a chance we're going to get grabbed. I didn't come this far to get grabbed out of hand. With any luck, we'll get close to whatever the exit is before we get seen."

"Guys," Celene said, but I cut her off.

"We've gotta be smart about this, Gale. We need to get out as soon as possible. We can just stay close to each other, like within ten to twenty feet, so we can call out if something,"

"Guys," Celene said again, and Gale turned just before he could fire back.

We were deep in the grove, strange crystal trees all around us, and the black door that floated a few feet off the ground was hard to miss. It was about six feet tall, the surface made of dark wood with a handle of blackened metal. I could see markings on the surface once I got close and the swirls looked old and kind of angry. The door stood out like a sore thumb amongst the alien plant life and I felt like it might be a little too obvious.

"Think this is what we're looking for?" I asked, reaching out shakily to touch the surface.

"Only one way to find out," Gale said, reaching for the knob and twisting.

"Wait," Celene said, "What if it's a," but Gale had committed to the action now, and as the door came open with a harsh grind, a shriek arose from deep inside the monochrome store.

It was a noise I had heard before as I lay in the Outside and tried to make myself as small as possible.

"They're coming," I told him, taking my flashlight in the other hand as Celene threw off her cloak, "We gotta get in there."

I turned to find Gale struggling with the heavy door, the muscles on his arms standing out as he strained at it.

"I can't imagine how that old man got this open by himself," he said through gritted teeth, "This thing feels like it weighs a ton."

I saw the problem as the rust began to flake off the hinges. The door had stood here for God knew how long, and the hinges had calcified. Whenever it was the Hermit had been here, the door had seen very little use since. Gale was pushing against it with all his might, but he was having trouble getting any headway.

The crystalline trees shuddered under the footsteps of the Miasma and I braced for a fight.

"Almost," Gale grunted, heaving with all his might, and I saw he had managed to get it open a foot.

Three dark shadows were coming through the crystal forest, and as I threw off my cloak too, reaching down to snatch buddies off, we shone like beacons. I looked up to find a fourth trying to come in from our left, a fifth from our right, and I was sure there would be others trying to come in on our backs. They must have some way to know when the door was opened, and as the beam of our flashlights grated out, I heard Buddy bark as he pulled at his leash.

The lead Miasma reached out with a pair of hands the size of manhole covers, but when it tried to grab Celene, its hands lost their fullness. They passed harmlessly through her, through me and Buddy too, and the Miasma seemed confused. It lifted its hand and looked at it, not sure why it couldn't grab us. The five of them seemed unsure of how to approach us, and when the door creaked open with an almost painful grinding noise, we all turned to find Gale waving us inside.

"Come on, before they," but stopped as something grabbed him from inside the portal.

It was a hand made of living darkness, a black so dark it made the black of the monochrome world look dull, and it snatched Gale inside before we could take so much as a step toward it.

"Come on," Celene yelled, barreling inside as Buddy and I followed afterward.

I stopped long enough to catch the door, not wanting the Miasma to follow us somehow, and we stepped out into a strange new place.

As the door slammed behind us, Celene, Buddy, and I found ourselves in a place we had only read about.

It was dark, like a child's room without a night light, and the only light seemed to come from the slightly glowing floor tiles. They were the same pattern as the linoleum in the Dollar General Stores, and they floated in the air like phantom steppingstones. Everything floated here, as a matter of fact. The shelves, the floor, the weird glowing fungus that grew on everything, it all seemed to float in the void that hung around them.

Amidst it all was something else, something different.

In the midst of the floating space was a green glowing stone, and it pulsated with unknown power.

We looked around, trying to find Gale, and saw him hovering amidst a cloud of deep midnight. The cloud had fixed it's too-large eyes on us, smoldering coals the size of meteors, and it wafted towards us with boundless confidence. Gale was struggling, trying to tell us to run, but he was shivering with every labored breath. Whatever the cloud was, it was cold, and that cold was slowly killing our friend.

It billowed toward us right up until it hit the lights we held, and then flinched away with an angry hiss.

We reached for Gale as it passed, but he was too far away to grab.

Celene called for him, trying to get to the cloud, but I held her back as it swirled and moved about the space.

"It's clearly guarding that gem, which is probably how we get out of here. If we go towards it, it's likely to come down and try to stop us. When it does, we can get Gale and the gem and get the hell out of here."

Celene thought about it for a minute, taking another glance back at Gale, before nodding and following behind me.

The way wasn't easy, especially not while being menaced by that cloud, but we hopped from one tile to the next as we made our way toward the gem. I wasn't much help, carrying Buddy and still jumping, but Celene had her light out and on guard for the cloud as we traveled. The cloud, the true form of the Miasma, I'm sure, kept trying to dive-bomb us off the tiles, but the lights we wore and our flashlights kept it far enough back that it never really got close enough to do more than buffet us with cold air. We kept an eye on Gale, his shivering letting us know he was still alive, and as we came within two easy hopes of the platform, I started making my plan to rescue him.

"Grab the gem!" I shouted, and as Celene made a break over the last two squares, I watched the cloud.

It made a beeline for her, swarming like a fogbank of angry birds, and as it got close, I made a break. Buddy made a nervous noise from my side, seeming to understand the importance but not liking the jostling, and as the cloud passed over the platform, Celene rushing for the emerald, I jumped as passed into the cloud.

It was like plunging into a cold shower, and for a moment I just floated inside that chilly abyss.

When I bumped into something solid, however, I locked my free hand around it and carried it with me as we fell out the other side.

Gale and I both gasped as we landed in a heap on the platform, and I could see the cloud retreating into the murk.

Too many lights, I supposed, and I ripped off Gale's covering as I added his lights to ours.

Celene helped us up, Buddy shaking off imaginary water as we got our barings.

I had eyes only for the gem, however.

It was right there, sitting feet away and pulsating dully on its pedestal.

It was our ticket home, I could feel it.

"What now?" asked Celene, her hand already inching towards it as she tried to keep it at her waist.

"Well, I said without much assuredness, "If it's anything like the doors inside the stores, we can use it to travel out of here together. We just have to be touching."

"Do you think destination is important?" Celene asked, readjusting as she hefted Gale.

He was shivering and coughing, the cloud really having done a number on him, and Celene had thrown an arm around him as she tried to keep him on his feet.

"I don't know," I said, "I don't think I could picture the store I came from anyway, could you?"

She shook her head.

I lifted Buddy into my arms, my other hand reaching for Celene as we stepped forward. I took some of Gale's weight onto myself, the two of us looking like friends carrying a drunk home, and freed up one of her hands for the gem. The arm under Gale grabbed her shirt as well, putting us in contact as we prepared to, hopefully, travel one final time.

"See you on the other side," I said, her hand stretching to grab it.

"I hope so,"

She reached out, and as her fingers came into contact with the surface, everything went dark.

For a little bit, I didn't know anything.

I was blind, mute, deaf, senseless, adrift, just waiting to land.

It felt like hours.

It felt like seconds.

Then, slowly, I became aware of something.

It was wet and rough and slapping against my face as a worried whine accompanied it.

I opened my eyes and saw Gale and Celene lying on the floor of a generic bathroom that could have belonged to any big box store in the country. The lights were on, Buddy had set them off when he got up, and as I sat up, I could already hear a low growl from my two companions. Buddy was dancing around happily, barking with excitement as I rubbed my head and tried to shoosh him.

Despite the pounding headache, we had made it.

We were somewhere different, somewhere new.

"Where are we?" Gale graveled out, rubbing his head as the two of them blinked owlishly at me.

I looked at the bathroom door, hesitant for a moment, but when I pushed it open, I couldn't help but laugh as the signage for our new location came into view.

"The farthest place for Dollar General, and also often the closest."

Gale looked out the door, and after a few seconds, he too began to laugh.

We walked out onto the floor of the very closed Family Dollar and found ourselves stepping back into our world at eleven seventeen on December fourth, two thousand twenty-three.

I had been gone for less than six months, Gale and Celene for a little less than twenty-five years, but we were home at last.

When the blue and whites started pulling up a few minutes later, I realized our adventure wasn't over yet.

Now, we had some explaining to do.
