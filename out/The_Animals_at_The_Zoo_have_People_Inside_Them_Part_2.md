My heart races as I near the zoo's entrance. What if they aren't there anymore? What if I'm just sick in the head? 

I'm sure that's the prevailing theory of some people. The reason why so many act like I don't exist anymore. 

Well, look where I am now. I'm outside. I'm in public. I'm ‘stimulating positive mental activity’ all on my own. And this time, I'm prepared. 

I didn't have my phone on me yesterday since it distracts from ‘family bonding’, but with Dad's absence this go around, Phone is my new family. 

If I can get some footage of the animal imposters, I'll have proof that I'm not crazy.

I immediately beeline to the safari section, making sure to stay out of view of any judgmental prying eyes. Hopefully nobody recognizes me from yesterday. 

To my relief, the zebra is still there, looking as eerily fake as ever. It hasn't even left the tall grass. 

Unfortunately, it's pretty early in the morning and there aren't any other visitors in this section right now. I'll come back on my way out when it's hopefully busier, so I can observe people's reactions. 

I take a few pictures for posterity and continue retracing my steps. The hideous lion, chimp, and python imitations are also right where I left them. 

I must say, I feel pretty vindicated. I'm not closer to figuring out what this is all about and I'm not sure I ever will, but I at least have photos. 

In theory, I should be at least somewhat relieved; why do I still feel off? This overwhelming dread hasn't lifted. In fact, it’s only getting heavier. A voice in the back of my head is telling me that there's something terribly wrong here that even my ever-perceptive eyes have yet to perceive. 

Where are the other animals? 

I don't recall noticing any; I was too focused on retracing my steps. Guess I'll retrace again. This time, sweeping the other enclosures for life. Just to be sure. 

I take note of a tiger, a gorilla, a pair of crocodiles, a few gazelles, some penguins, a giraffe, an elephant, and a group of flamingos. 

This confirms there are indeed other creatures here besides the people in suits. But these aren't normal animals either. There's something unmistakably uncanny about each of them. 

The gorilla and tiger stand perfectly motionless. Not in a relaxed, lackadaisical way. Stiff. Like they're not even breathing. Thick strings of saliva drip from their gaping mouths.

The crocodiles, on the other hand, move too much. They jankily slither back and forth in their tank; their nonstop swimming pattern a fixed loop like a train set. 

And the giraffe’s legs are too long. I know they're tall, but this one has two or three extra knees; like a daddy-longlegs. I can see its looming silhouette from several sections away.

As for the gazelles and penguins, I'm not convinced they aren't just cardboard cutouts. I'm really starting to freak out here. The world is spinning. 

I swear I heard one of the flamingos loudly cough and clear his throat right as I walked by. It sounded just like an old man. 

I whip out my phone, frantically explaining on video that the yonder elephant’s legs are clearly four people in body paint, when two figures appear before me on the sidewalk. 

These guys aren't painted, but they are dressed the same. Zookeepers. They apparently sense my distress and amble straight for me. 

“What's going on bud? Is everything alright?” 

I feel cornered and on the spot, but I recognize that this is the best chance I have to demand the truth. So I muster as much courage as I can and ask what on earth is going on? Why are they all fake? Why is everyone pretending like they don't notice? The zookeepers chuckle. 

“Everyone phones it in every now and then, man. You know what I mean.” 

The one speaking pats me on the shoulder and the other nods in agreeance. I'm in shock. Do they seriously expect me to find this a satisfying answer? They're blatantly brushing me off. They didn't even acknowledge everyone's lack of acknowledgement. 

Either they're fully in on it or they're under the same spell of ignorance and apathy. Regardless, they're part of the problem. I feel so frustrated and overwhelmed. I can't hold it in any longer. I start to scream. 

“Are you guys listening to what I'm saying? I'm telling you something's super wrong here. Can you even hear me?” 

In my fervor, I notice too late a third colleague of theirs has joined the fray. But wait. My goodness, I know this guy. 

His name is Andy. 

We were friends in highschool. Well, we were friendly. Somewhat. I would've really liked to have been friends with Andy. 

He's taking a while to speak, but I see recognition on his face, as well as something else. Embarrassment? Unease? Fear? His friends begin escorting me firmly towards the exit. I desperately look back at Andy for help, pleading for his reticence to pass. And it does. 

He tells his friends to wait. He asks me why I'm so upset. He calls me by name. 

“Andy, right?”

He remembers me. I am absolutely stunned he recalls anything about me after all this time. And now so many memories and feelings come flooding back. So much relief. So much longing. 

“You didn't forget me?” 

I can barely get the words out, but I manage to hold his gaze. 

“It's pretty hard to man, we have the same name.” 

It's been so long since someone has talked to me like this; like they actually understand and care about what I say. It sounds silly, but hearing him say my name soothes my soul in a way I never felt possible. He really sees me. We share something special. 

But this bliss doesn't last. This sweet taste of friendship that I've been starved of for eons has soured into self-awareness. The lifting of my invisible curse has left me naked. A stinging sensation undulates across my body; the photons from Andy's eyes burn my skin. 

Why did we have to reconnect here of all places? While I'm having a public meltdown? I know how disheveled I look. How deranged. I'm trembling, for goodness sake. 

I can't be seen like this. Overflowing with embarrassment, I shamble to the exit and leave without a word. Andy doesn't say anything either. Why would he? 

I despise myself too.
