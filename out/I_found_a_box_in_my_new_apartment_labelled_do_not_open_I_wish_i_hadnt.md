When I first moved into my new apartment, it seemed perfect great location, affordable rent, and just the right size for me. The landlord mentioned the previous tenant had left in a hurry, but I didn’t think much of it. People move for all sorts of reasons, right?

It wasn’t until my first weekend in the apartment that I decided to do some deep cleaning. I was organizing the closet in the bedroom when I found a small, dusty box tucked away in the farthest corner. It was plain, with no markings or designs, except for a piece of old tape across the top with three words written in faded ink: “Do Not Open.”

At first, I thought it might be something the previous tenant forgot to take with them, maybe something personal they didn’t want anyone else to see. But the curiosity got the better of me. After all, how dangerous could a little box be?

I sat down on the floor and carefully peeled back the tape. Inside, I found a stack of old Polaroid photos, a journal, and a small, intricately carved wooden figure. The photos were strange, each one was a picture of the apartment, but it looked different. In some, the walls were a different color, in others, the furniture was arranged in ways that didn’t make sense. And in every photo, there was a person standing in the background, facing away from the camera. It looked like a man, but his features were always blurred, even though everything else in the photos was perfectly clear.

The journal was filled with entries that were unsettling to say the least. They were written by the previous tenant, who described hearing strange noises at night, seeing shadows move in the corners of rooms, and finding things in the apartment that they didn’t remember buying. The entries became more frantic over time, with the tenant describing feeling like they were being watched, even when they were alone.

Then there was the wooden figure. It was small, about the size of my hand, and carved to resemble a person, but with exaggerated features large eyes, elongated limbs. Something about it felt wrong, like it wasn’t just a simple carving. I placed it back in the box, suddenly feeling uneasy.

That night, I started hearing things quiet, almost imperceptible noises, like whispers coming from the walls. I chalked it up to an overactive imagination after finding the box, but the feeling of being watched didn’t go away. I began noticing things out of place in the apartment, things I was certain I hadn’t touched.

A few days later, I decided to get rid of the box. I put it outside, hoping that would put an end to the weirdness. But the next morning, the box was back in the closet, as if it had never left. The tape across the top was perfectly intact, just as I had found it.

That’s when I knew something was seriously wrong. I contacted the landlord, asking about the previous tenant, but all he would say was that they had left abruptly, without much explanation. He sounded nervous, like he knew more than he was letting on, but I couldn’t get any more out of him.

I’ve tried to ignore the box, leaving it untouched in the closet, but the noises have gotten worse. The shadows seem to move on their own now, stretching and shifting in ways that don’t make sense. And last night, I woke up to find the wooden figure from the box sitting on my nightstand, facing me.

I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to leave, to abandon the apartment and never look back. But I’m terrified that whatever is in that box won’t let me go that easily. I keep thinking about those photos, about the man standing in the background. I’m starting to wonder if he’s still here, watching, waiting for something.

And I’m terrified that I’ll be the next person in the background of those photos.
