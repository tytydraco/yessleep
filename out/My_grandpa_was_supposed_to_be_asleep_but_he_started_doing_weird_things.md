Hey, Reddit. I’m really freaked out and need to share this with someone. Last night was the strangest night of my life, and I don’t know what to make of it.

My grandpa moved in with us about a month ago. He’s always been the quiet type, keeping to himself mostly, but since Grandma passed, he’s become even more reserved. The doctors said he’s just grieving and needs time. So, we set up a room for him on the first floor, right next to the living room.

Last night, I stayed up late playing video games in the living room. Around midnight, I heard a creaking sound coming from Grandpa’s room. At first, I thought it was just the house settling, but then I heard footsteps. I paused my game and listened. The footsteps were slow and shuffling, like someone trying to move quietly.

I called out, “Grandpa, you okay?”

No answer.

I got up and walked to his door. It was slightly ajar, and I could see a faint light coming from inside. I pushed the door open a bit more and peeked in. Grandpa was standing in the middle of the room, facing the wall. His bedside lamp was on, casting long, eerie shadows.

“Grandpa?” I called again, a bit louder this time.

He didn’t respond. He just stood there, completely still. I was about to step into the room when he slowly turned around. His eyes were wide open, but there was something off about them. They looked... empty, like he was sleepwalking or in some kind of trance.

“Grandpa, are you okay?” I asked, taking a cautious step forward.

Suddenly, he started muttering under his breath. I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded like a chant or a prayer in a language I didn’t recognize. His hands were trembling, and he was clutching something tightly. I squinted to see what it was and realized he was holding an old, leather-bound book. I’d never seen it before.

I took another step closer, and that’s when he let out a low, guttural laugh. It sent chills down my spine. I’ve never heard him laugh like that before—so unnatural, so... inhuman. Then, without warning, he snapped his head towards me and screamed. It was the most blood-curdling scream I’ve ever heard. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest.

He started walking towards me, still muttering and laughing, his eyes locked onto mine. I panicked and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind me. I could still hear his eerie chant through the door, and I backed away until I was against the far wall of the living room, shaking.

I don’t know how long I stood there, but eventually, the chanting stopped. I heard the bed creak and then silence. I waited for what felt like hours before I finally mustered up the courage to check on him again. When I opened the door, he was lying in bed, fast asleep, the room dark except for the moonlight filtering through the window. The leather-bound book was nowhere in sight.

This morning, I asked him if he remembered anything from last night. He just looked at me, confused, and said he slept like a baby. I didn’t mention the book or the chanting. I’m not sure what to think. Was it just a bizarre episode of sleepwalking? Or something more?

I’m genuinely scared and don’t know what to do. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Any advice would be appreciated.
