Hey, Reddit. I’m really freaked out and need to share this with someone. Last night was the strangest night of my life, and I don’t know what to make of it.

My grandpa moved in with us about a month ago. He’s always been the quiet type, keeping to himself mostly, but since Grandma passed, he’s become even more reserved. The doctors said he’s just grieving and needs time. So, we set up a room for him on the first floor, right next to the living room.

Last night, I stayed up late playing video games in the living room. Around midnight, I heard a creaking sound coming from Grandpa’s room. At first, I thought it was just the house settling, but then I heard footsteps. I paused my game and listened. The footsteps were slow and shuffling, like someone trying to move quietly.

I called out, “Grandpa, you okay?”

No answer.

I got up and walked to his door. It was slightly ajar, and I could see a faint light coming from inside. I pushed the door open a bit more and peeked in. Grandpa was standing in the middle of the room, facing the wall. His bedside lamp was on, casting long, eerie shadows.

“Grandpa?” I called again, a bit louder this time.

He didn’t respond. He just stood there, completely still. I was about to step into the room when he slowly turned around. His eyes were wide open, but there was something off about them. They looked... empty, like he was sleepwalking or in some kind of trance.

“Grandpa, are you okay?” I asked, taking a cautious step forward.

Suddenly, he started muttering under his breath. I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded like a chant or a prayer in a language I didn’t recognize. His hands were trembling, and he was clutching something tightly. I squinted to see what it was and realized he was holding an old, leather-bound book. I’d never seen it before.

I took another step closer, and that’s when he let out a low, guttural laugh. It sent chills down my spine. I’ve never heard him laugh like that before—so unnatural, so... inhuman. Then, without warning, he snapped his head towards me and screamed. It was the most blood-curdling scream I’ve ever heard. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest.

He started walking towards me, still muttering and laughing, his eyes locked onto mine. I panicked and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind me. I could still hear his eerie chant through the door, and I backed away until I was against the far wall of the living room, shaking.

I don’t know how long I stood there, but eventually, the chanting stopped. I heard the bed creak and then silence. I waited for what felt like hours before I finally mustered up the courage to check on him again. When I opened the door, he was lying in bed, fast asleep, the room dark except for the moonlight filtering through the window. The leather-bound book was nowhere in sight.

This morning, I asked him if he remembered anything from last night. He just looked at me, confused, and said he slept like a baby. I didn’t mention the book or the chanting. I’m not sure what to think. Was it just a bizarre episode of sleepwalking? Or something more?

After that night, I kept a close eye on Grandpa. For a few days, everything seemed normal. He was his usual quiet self, reading books, watching TV, and taking short walks in the garden. But the sense of unease never left me. I couldn’t shake the memory of that eerie chant and his empty eyes.

Last night, I decided to stay up again, just to see if anything would happen. Around 1 AM, I heard the familiar creak of Grandpa’s door. My heart rate spiked, but I forced myself to stay calm. I quietly got up and moved to a spot where I could see his door without being seen.

The door opened slowly, and Grandpa stepped out. He was holding that same old, leather-bound book. This time, though, there was something else. He had a small, silver knife in his other hand. I watched, frozen, as he moved silently down the hallway towards the basement door.

I followed him, making sure to keep a safe distance. He opened the basement door and disappeared into the darkness. After a moment of hesitation, I grabbed a flashlight from the kitchen and followed him down the stairs. The basement was pitch black and cold, the air thick with dust and mildew.

I kept the flashlight beam low, not wanting to alert him. I heard his muttering again, the same unintelligible chant from before. As I moved closer, I saw him kneeling in the far corner of the basement, the book open in front of him, the knife resting on the ground beside him.

He was drawing something on the floor with a piece of chalk—an intricate pattern of symbols and shapes that I didn’t recognize. The air around him seemed to hum with energy, and I felt a pressure in my chest, like something was pushing down on me.

Suddenly, he stopped chanting and looked up, directly at me. His eyes were glowing faintly in the darkness. I stumbled backward, almost dropping the flashlight.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said in a voice that wasn’t his. It was deeper, resonant, almost like multiple voices speaking in unison.

“What... what are you doing, Grandpa?” I managed to stammer.

He ignored my question and stood up slowly, the silver knife now in his hand. “Leave now, before it’s too late,” the voice said.

I turned and bolted up the stairs, not daring to look back. I locked the basement door behind me and ran to my room, my mind racing. I didn’t sleep at all last night. This morning, I checked the basement, but there was no sign of the chalk drawings, the book, or the knife. Everything looked as it always did—old and cluttered.

I confronted Grandpa again, asking him about the basement and the book. He just looked at me with those same confused eyes and said he had no idea what I was talking about.

I don’t know what’s happening. I’m scared for him, but I’m also scared of him. Whatever is going on, it’s not just sleepwalking. I need to figure this out before something terrible happens. Any more advice or insight would be really appreciated. I’m at a loss here.

After the incident in the basement, I decided to do some digging. I found the leather-bound book hidden under Grandpa’s mattress. It was filled with strange symbols and what looked like ritual instructions in a language I couldn’t read. Desperate for answers, I took pictures of the pages and posted them on various forums. Someone eventually identified the language as a mix of Latin and something older, something almost forgotten.

The symbols and rituals were for summoning and binding spirits. I couldn’t believe it at first, but given everything that’s happened, I had to take it seriously. One of the rituals, in particular, caught my attention—it was a ritual to communicate with the dead, but it required a sacrifice.

I decided to confront Grandpa one last time. I waited until evening, after dinner. I showed him the book, demanding to know what was going on. To my shock, he started to cry.

He told me he found the book years ago, hidden away in a chest in the attic of his childhood home. He’d never used it until Grandma died. He was so grief-stricken that he turned to the book in desperation, hoping to contact her. He didn’t remember anything about the nights I described, but he admitted that he sometimes woke up feeling strange, like he’d been somewhere else.

He agreed to destroy the book. We took it to the backyard and set it on fire. As it burned, Grandpa seemed to relax for the first time in weeks. I thought that was the end of it.

But I was wrong.

That night, I woke up to the smell of smoke. The house was filled with it. I ran to Grandpa’s room, but he wasn’t there. The basement door was wide open. I grabbed a flashlight and rushed down the stairs.

Grandpa was there, standing in the middle of the basement, surrounded by the same symbols he’d drawn before. But this time, they were glowing, pulsating with a sickly green light. He was holding the silver knife, and his eyes were glowing that eerie, faint light.

“Grandpa, stop!” I screamed.

He turned to me, and for a moment, I saw him—the real him, scared and desperate. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, tears streaming down his face. “I thought I could bring her back. But it wants more.”

Before I could move, he plunged the knife into his own chest. I screamed and ran to him, but it was too late. He collapsed, the life draining from his eyes. The symbols on the floor flared brightly and then went dark.

I called 911, but there was nothing they could do. They ruled it as a suicide brought on by grief and dementia. No one believed my story about the book and the rituals.

I’ve been trying to come to terms with everything. I still hear whispers at night, and sometimes I feel like I’m being watched. I don’t know if it’s just my mind playing tricks on me or if something was truly awakened.

Grandpa’s gone, and I’m left with more questions than answers. I destroyed the remnants of the book, but I don’t think it’s over. I think whatever he called is still here, lurking in the shadows, waiting.
