My friend and I saw something in the water.

My friend and I saw a strange being on the beach at night.

We had been using the Randonautica application, which randomly generates nearby coordinates for users to explore, often with mysterious or serendipitous results. It marked a beach in our city, which piqued our curiosity. The idea of an impromptu adventure seemed thrilling, even though it was already 1 a.m. 

When we arrived at the beach, the scene was eerily desolate. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was the only noise breaking the silence. The moon hung low in the sky, casting a silvery glow over the sand and surf. As we wandered closer to the water's edge, we began to notice something unsettling.

In the dim moonlight, we saw several purple, bald beings with bright eyes. They were humanoid in appearance but far from human. These creatures were emerging and submerging in the water, moving with an eerie fluidity. My heart pounded as I watched, transfixed and terrified. One of them came out of the water near us, exposing half its torso. Its eyes, glowing like small, bright beacons, seemed to pierce the night and sent shivers down my spine.

We counted around twenty of these beings. They moved in an almost synchronized manner, as if part of some otherworldly dance. Their skin shimmered with a strange luminescence, reflecting the moonlight in a way that seemed almost magical, yet deeply unsettling.

In a state of shock and fear, we quickly backed away, our minds racing to make sense of what we were witnessing. Could these beings be some kind of undiscovered marine life? Or perhaps, as the creeping fear in my mind suggested, something far more sinister?

The beach, once a place of solace and relaxation, now felt like a portal to another world, one that we had accidentally stumbled upon. We decided to leave immediately, our sense of adventure replaced by an urgent need to get away. As we walked back to our car, the sensation of being watched intensified. It felt as though unseen eyes were tracking our every move, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

Even after we left the beach behind, the feeling of being watched persisted all the way home. Every shadow seemed menacing, every sound amplified by our heightened senses. We locked the doors and windows, hoping to keep whatever we had seen at bay.

Since that night, I haven't been able to shake the fear that those creatures might come out of the water and find their way to my home. I live very close to the beach, and the proximity now feels like a threat rather than a blessing. I've been scouring the internet and asking around, trying to find any information that might explain what we saw.

Could these beings be some kind of aquatic animal that has managed to remain undiscovered? Or is there a more supernatural explanation? The idea of sea monsters or extraterrestrial visitors seems far-fetched, but after that night, I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

I'm hoping someone out there might have an answer. Perhaps a marine biologist or an expert in folklore could shed some light on our experience. Were we the only ones to see these creatures, or have others encountered them too? The need to understand what we saw is consuming, as the fear of the unknown continues to haunt me.

I don't plan to go to that beach at night again. The memory of those glowing eyes and shimmering, purple bodies is too vivid, too terrifying. For now, I'm left with unanswered questions and a lingering sense of dread. If anyone has any information or theories about what those creatures could have been, please share them. I'm desperate for some peace of mind and a way to reclaim the sense of safety I once felt living near the beach.
