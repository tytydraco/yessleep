After Sophia’s disappearance in March, I couldn’t stay in Sausalito anymore. *Everything* reminded me of her. 



Taking our dog, Theo, on walks together each evening to the pier to watch the sailboats pass by. Sophia frequently tried convincing me. “One of these days, we have to learn how to sail,” she’d say. “Maybe you forgot why they call this section of the ocean the red triangle,” I’d respond snarkily. 



She was always the adventurous one.



We’d grab lattes from our local coffee shop, just a short walk down the street from Harbor Drive, where we lived. We swooned over the scent of espresso mixing with steamed milk and the sweetness of reduced sugar in the cup.



When available, we’d snag our favorite table nestled into the bay window, overlooking the water. We’d sip and watch pedestrians pass by while making up stories about their conversations to see who could get the other person to laugh first. This was also the exact spot and theme of our first date.



These memories used to be sweet and warm reminders of the foundation of our relationship. Now weeks after she disappeared, it felt more like an invasion leaving me feeling empty and alone. Flooding over me in waves, attacking me unannounced and uninvited, like a ghost haunting me. How could she have left without saying goodbye?



No text. No phone call. Her clothes were still neatly folded in the dresser and hanging in the closet. Even her toothbrush was left in the bathroom. 



She just *vanished*. 



It was mid-July when I received *the* phone call. It was the detective. He had a solemn tone in his voice. Shit.



“There’s no easy way to say this. We… um, found Sophia.” He paused, the air still, my heart pounding. 



“She was just a few yards off the entrance of Muir Woods. A hiker called it in just this morning. We’d like you to come by and positively identify her body.”



Her *body.*



I dropped the phone, sending it crashing to the kitchen floor, and broke down crying.



A few hours later I met the detective at the morgue. He led me to a cold room with blinding fluorescent lights. There in the center of the space was a gurney covered with a white sheet and a body underneath. I couldn’t breathe. He pulled the sheet back exposing her face.



With tears streaming down my face, I acknowledged, “That’s Sophia” 



The detective led me to another room just down the hall. As we sat down he opened a folder revealing a few pictures captured at the scene.



“They’re a bit… graphic,” he warned as he handed them over.



Sofia was tied to a large redwood tree, her clothes removed exposing her body. Her feet and hands were bound. Dirt and dried blood under her cracked nails. Signs of a struggle.



Her face was covered by a mask crafted from a wolf’s head with jet-black fur. Its mouth gaping open showing rows of jagged teeth. A strange, cryptic symbol had been carved into her chest with some kind of sharp object. Blood had streamed down her torso and legs from the wound, pooling below her feet. 



I wish I hadn’t looked at the photos. *Why* the hell did I look at the damn photos!?



“This has all the signs of occult activity,” the detective stated. 



I sat speechless, bringing my hands to my face, and started to cry, the images of Sophia’s mutilated body fed to the forest burned into my mind.



••



The first time I heard it was a year ago… the ***whispering***\*.\* 



It was the end of September, a year after Sophia’s body was found in Muir Woods. I’d made the move to Chicago. A fresh start away from the routines and familiar surroundings that constantly stirred up painful memories. 



The first cold front of the season was moving in so the wind off the lake was sure to bite. I’d better dress warmly for the walk. 



I grabbed my favorite hoodie before heading out the door. It’s Thursday night which means takeout from Silver Spoon Thai and I wasn’t about to let the weather get between me and Pad See Ew.



“I’ll be back in a bit!” I exclaimed to Theo, who wagged his tail, a sign I take as understanding.



It was starting to get dark earlier these days, but I had a good hour before darkness consumed the park. Plenty of time. 



As I made my way down the hallway, rounding the corner, a sign posted to the elevator reading, “Out of order.”



“Ughhh,” I muttered with a deep sigh, surprised having said it out loud. It’s down five flights of stairs again tonight. Fine, I needed to clear my head after a long day anyhow. Not to mention, Thai food would be worth the extra effort.



I made my way to the entrance of Olive Park, one of my favorite spots in the city and the quickest way to the restaurant. The park was just a ten-minute walk from the front door, a key selling point for moving into the building, and a specific request from Theo, who loved a nearby green space. 



The park's paths are lined with dimly lit lamp posts and surrounded by massive oak trees creating a canopy over the walkway on three sides, quarantining the park from the city, just steps away. The remaining side, an abandoned water treatment plant that’s been out of commission for decades nestled between the park and the lake.



I move beyond the first section of trees toward the water treatment plant. There was a heaviness to the air tonight. The kind that made you look twice at all the shadows dancing in the distance through the darkness of the woods. The ever-present feeling of someone, no… *something* watching you from the shadows. 



From just beyond the tree line, a sharp crack of a branch captured my attention. 



***Crack!!***



That’s when I heard it\*.\* An almost unnatural raspy sound coming from the woods. A long, drawn-out *whisper.* 



*“aAaAaH-hhLll-lll”*



I stopped abruptly, startled, holding my breath, and scanned the surroundings. What the hell was that?



I looked around to see if the sound might be coming from a nearby park-goer. A friend playing some cruel prank, a*nyone.* But there was no one within 50 yards of me, just the ominous thicket of trees, the flickering of the street lamps above, and the decrepit water treatment building towering above the trees. 



“Hello!?” I asked nervously, unsure I wanted to hear a response.



*Nothing.* 



The hair on the back of my neck immediately electrified, defying gravity, standing on edge. Something felt off. Something felt… *wrong.* 



Breathe in, breathe out.



The wind picked up from the inbound storm which was predicted to engulf the city later tonight. The ancient oak trees’ branches extended like long twisted fingers, grasping at me from the gusts of wind angrily howling through the thicket, threatening to swallow me whole.



“Just my imagination,” I said, attempting to shake the sense of dread and convince myself that everything was okay, a feeble attempt to calm my nerves and stay focused. 



I picked up the pace through the remainder of the park, careful to not look back, finally arriving at Silver Spoon.



“Hey, Dhalia. Good to see you.” I’d frequented Silver Spoon enough that we were on a first-name basis.



“Oh, hey,” an unusually short, tense response. I must have looked uneasy because Anong gave me a strange glance.



“Everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 



What was I going to tell her? That I’m freaking out because I heard whispering from the woods but no one was there? That I felt something *watching* me?



“Yeah,” I anxiously responded, “everything’s fine.” 



Not convincing. 



“Just trying to get home before dark or it starts raining. Not sure which is worse,”  I stated with a slightly uncomfortable, nervous laugh. In truth, I wanted to get home as quickly as possible, open a bottle of wine, devour my Thai food, and forget that haunting whisper in the park ever happened. 



I grabbed my food, held out my phone to pay, added a generous tip, and headed out the door. “See ya next week, Anong.”



I began the walk back with my to-go bag in hand. Careful this time to avoid the park and instead take the waterfront home with a renewed sense of purpose. It wasn’t quite as fast as the direct route through the park, but there was no way I was going back the way I came. 



Not after hearing that *voice*.



I passed Oak Street Beach making my way to the opposite side of the water treatment plant. I nearly reached the end of the park off the waterfront, almost home. I must have lost track of time because now the trees had fully devoured the remaining daylight, the sun swallowed by the horizon. It was impossibly dark now and raindrops had begun to fall. 



Abruptly, I started to feel that heaviness again. An ominous presence, like someone just out of sight was watching me. No… *stalking me*. 



My nerves were again electric, sending warning signals to my brain like wildfire. Again I heard a branch crack loudly just off the path near the edge of the woods.



*Crack. Craack!*



I looked toward the sound of branches snapping, my eyes finding the only dead tree in the copse when I saw it. The same symbol that had been carved into Sophia’s chest was carved deeply into the trunk of this tree. 



A wave of dread came over me as my heart began to race. Suddenly, I heard the same whisper, this time more pronounced, louder, *sharper*.



*“aaHhHhhA-aaaLLii-iIAaa”*



I froze in place. I felt my blood pressure spike as adrenaline coursed through my body. My nerves again electrified as the color drained from my face.



No. No. No. Not *again*.



My heart was pounding now, trying to escape my chest. *Escape.* That’s precisely what I needed to do… *run.*



••



For the next week, I tried to make sense of what happened that night. I wasn’t able to sleep, self-medicating with a couple of glasses of wine each night to calm my nerves. I couldn’t get the whispers, the symbols carved into Sophia’s chest, and the dead oak out of my mind. 



One thing was certain: I sure as hell wasn't going back to that park anytime soon.



That Friday night, after tipping back my third glass of red, I was ready to call it a night. I crawled into bed after washing my face and brushing my teeth. I was tossing and turning, trying to find a way to get comfortable. 



I’d finally dozed off when I was abruptly jolted awake by a loud, sharp noise.



I scanned the darkness. The room was cold, heavy\*… ominous\*. My heart was racing and I immediately felt uneasy, as though someone… no, *something* was in the room with me.



Crack. *Crack*. ***Craaack***\*!\* 



Suddenly, I see something move abruptly, unnaturally in the left corner of the ceiling.



My eyes began to adjust to the pitch black. The shadowy figure stared directly at me with milky white-filled eyes, clinging to the ceiling just feet away, inching closer with unnatural movements. I could see its jet-black hair falling toward the floor. Its mouth gaping open, displaying its needle-sharp, thin, gnashing teeth, *shrieking my name.*



***“DHHALIIIAAAAAAA!!!!”***



I screamed in terror as it continued advancing toward me. My eyes having fully adjusted to the darkness, I could now clearly see the shadowy figure was wearing a mask: *Sophia’s face*.
