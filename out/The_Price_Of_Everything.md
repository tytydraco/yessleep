I didn’t know how much I wanted. Until I started having it all.

It started subtly, creeping into my life with the quiet itch of something I couldn’t scratch. Temptation, need. At first, I thought it was ambition. Who wouldn’t want more? I worked hard, earned my place. But with each achievement, with every new thing, hunger grew. Desire turned into compulsion. It gnawed at me. Nothing was ever enough.

I had money. Enough to buy anything. Enough to control everything. But even then, I kept staring at my reflection. It looked unfamiliar.

The day I felt it? It changed everything. The moment I realized I wasn’t in control anymore, I was just a passenger, speeding toward something I couldn’t see. It was when I bought my house. Not just a house — a mansion. Velvet walls. Marble floors. High, grand ceilings. Perfect. Yet, when I stepped inside, something felt off. Empty. Silent.

That night, I heard things. Whispers. Soft, echoing in the halls. I told myself it was the house settling. But the whispers didn’t stop. They grew louder. They weren’t just noises. They were voices. Calling me. Pleading with me. Begging me to listen.

I ignored them. I convinced myself they were nothing. But then, the dreams came.

Each night, I woke up gasping. Drenched in sweat. In the dreams, I was in the house. But not my house. The walls shimmered with gold, the floors were silver, and the air was thick with the smell of paper. And something else. Something wrong. Figures lurked in the shadows, just out of sight, whispering promises — promises of power, wealth, more.

I had it all. But it wasn’t enough. I felt like I was losing myself.

The dreams got worse. Vivid. Urgent. I woke up with the taste of metal in my mouth. Like I had been chewing pennies. My reflection in the mirror changed. My eyes hollowed. My face grew gaunt. Something was eating me from the inside.

And then the whispers stopped being whispers. They became a voice. Clear. Sharp. It echoed through every corner of my house.

“You wanted more. You took it. Now, it’s mine.”

I spun around, searching the room. But there was nothing. Just the vast, silent emptiness of my mansion.

But I knew. Something had been taken. Something I couldn’t get back. I didn’t just crave more anymore. I was it. The hunger, the endless desire — it was turning me into something else. Something insatiable.

I tried to leave. But the house, the walls, felt too familiar now. Too comfortable. Each room, each piece of furniture, each object promised more. It didn’t matter what I was losing. Only that I could keep getting more.

I couldn’t stop.

I started buying again. Not just houses, but businesses. People. The more I took, the emptier I felt. Deep down, I knew I was giving away pieces of myself. My identity. My soul. But I didn’t care. There was only more.

In the end, I was nothing. Just a shell. A vessel for endless hunger. And then one last night, I woke up in my mansion. But it wasn’t mine anymore. It was something else.

I saw it in the mirror.

The reflection. Not me.

It smiled.
