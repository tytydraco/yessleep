I started a new job a couple months ago as a warehouse associate for a pretty large shipping company here in Arkansas.  I got certified to drive a forklift, load trucks, and move pallets back and forth.  It’s a pretty easy gig and the pay’s more than I’ve ever made before.  I’d say things were looking up but I’ve been having some trouble fitting in with my new coworkers.  I’m not the most outgoing or confident dude in the world.  In fact, making myself into one of the guys has been pretty damn near impossible for me all my life.  

With every new job, you wander into a pre-determined work culture with cliques, social hierarchies, and a whole history that you’re not a part of and try to glom onto it.  Maybe one day you do.  With this job, it was worse than that.  These fellas were mostly 20-40 years older than me.  They’re the stereotypical gruff, shit kicking, beer swilling sort.  They take their coffee black, their Marlboro’s red and their jokes off-color (to put it gently).  They wake up at the ass crack of dawn and it sure as hell ain’t to make friends with the 20 year old newbie that wears pokemon and demon slayer tees to work.  They just weren’t the sort of work friends I felt like I wanted or needed and the feeling was mutual.

Suffice to say, the first few weeks had me feeling pretty much like an outcast at work.  I told myself it was better that way rather than trying to force myself to conform to their whole built Ford tough vibe.  But after a while, I’d gone from feeling okay as an outcast to feeling more like the invisible man.  I hate to say it but it was getting to me.  

It’s not so much that I wanted these old shitbirds to like me.  I didn’t.  It was more that I was beginning to feel dissociative from the sheer lack of human interaction.  Like I was on autopilot, watching myself go about my day from the 3rd person perspective.  Working 10 to 12 hour shifts without so much as hearing your own voice can really affect a person.  

To make it worse, headphones and earbuds were strictly not permitted, especially for those of us behind the wheel of the forklift.  I began to look forward to my lunch break as the only part of my day where I could enjoy myself or anything at all.  It was the only time where I wasn’t just this background actor in my own life.  I cherished it.

Instead of sitting in the cramped cafeteria or at the old table on the shop floor where the lifers took their lunch, I’d always jump in my car and take off.  Sometimes, I’d stop off for a soda or a taco.  But most of the time, I’d just find a place to park up on the street a few roads over from the warehouse.  I’d made it a habit lately to park in this shady secluded little area with a dead end where I’d watch some youtube videos, scroll, and just decompress a bit.  It was peaceful until the day she showed up.

I was relaxing and watching a stream when I thought I heard footsteps on gravel.  It’s a busy industrial park with people and vehicles coming all the time.  I glanced around and didn’t see any security guards looking to ask me to move my car or anything so I went back to my phone.  I honestly thought nothing of it.  

All of a sudden, I was shocked out of my comfort by a hammering thud at my window.  I spun to look and saw this old lady with thin grey hair in a black dress.  She was smacking my driver’s side window with her geriatric palm over and over.  She had a look in her eye like she wanted to set me on fire.

“I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!!!!”

She stared into the window, her long nose pressed hard up against the glass with an absolutely unhinged look in her eyes.  Her heaving breath fogged my window as she yelled.  I tried to say something back that actually made any sense.

“I’m…I’m really sorry!  I’ll move right n-”

She reeled back and punched my window.  I saw the wrinkled skin on her fist go red and white against her arthritic knuckles as they thumped the glass.  I heard a sickening crunching sound as she connected, making the window shake in place inches from my face.  

“Ma’am, I’m moving the car!  I’m…”

She screeched at the top of her lungs as she pulled at my door handle with both hands.  No words, just an ear piercing wail.  My door swung open momentarily before I pulled it back shut.

Instinct took over as I locked the doors and put the car in reverse, backing up abruptly a few feet.  I tried to position the car so I could flip a u-turn and get the fuck out of the dead end.  But she stood there in my way, fuming.  She looked thin and sickly but something about the rage behind her beady black eyes made her look unnatural.  She was still screaming although now her furious words were muffled.  

I peeled forward coming within a foot of her leg as she advanced again toward my car.  She threw her slender frame against the hood.  For a second, she tried to cling to the hood like a scene from an action movie.  I yanked the steering wheel as hard as I could to the left and stepped on the gas.  She rolled off the front of the car, taking one of my wiper blades with her in her bony fingers.  I’m pretty sure I heard her scream something about killing me as I gunned it out of there.  

I drove back to work in a daze not knowing what the hell had just happened.  Worrying that maybe she’d chased me or called the cops, I hid my car between two large box trucks at the furthest end of the parking lot.  I was shaking like a leaf as I walked in through the back door.  I hurried to the restroom.  I couldn’t stop thinking about her.

What the fuck did I do?  I hurt some old woman, maybe badly.  But she was fucking nuts wasn’t she?  She was crazy.  I splashed my face with cold water.  The icy water running across my forehead made me feel ill.  Hot vomit scorched my tongue and came rushing past the back of my teeth as I spewed into the sink.

They sent me home for that.  As I collected my things from my locker, I heard some of those old dickheads making fun of me from across the room.

“Widdle baby got a tummy ache.”

That got some serious laughs.  Fuck those assholes.  I left as quickly as I could, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.  

I slipped out the back door, looking from side to side to see if…idk…to see if she was out there.  The sun was just starting to go down as I opened the door to my car.  I drove out of the lot slowly with my head on a swivel.  No old woman.  No cops.  I thought maybe it would all be alright.  Maybe there was no other boot waiting to drop on my neck.  My stomach settled down a bit as I turned onto the highway.

It got dark quickly as I made my way towards home.  When I was about 30 minutes into my drive, my body and mind had begun to relax.  As often happens on those long trips, the quiet hum of the road gave way to my wandering mind.  My imagination flew long down the highway ahead of me.  I could see myself cozying up in my favorite blanket on my living room sofa, playing some Switch, and watching YouTube.  

A smile had just begun to creep across my face when it suddenly stopped in its tracks.  I got a gnawing feeling in my gut.  You know that feeling you get when you’re being …watched.  I didn’t want to turn my head and look but my body acted on its own.  I looked out the driver’s side window and there she was, staring back at me with a look of malice as we cruised alongside one another.  I held her gaze for what seemed like forever.  I was petrified.  

My mind reeled.  Had she followed me?  I sped up.  I dangerously weaved from the right lane into the middle, cutting off an SUV.  I could see her old black sedan edging to the right and left of the vehicle between us.  The sallow headlights of her old car bent around the sides of the suv as she pushed for an opening to overtake.  She was boxed in on both sides but that didn’t stop her from honking and flashing her lights frantically.

I put the pedal to the floorboard and didn’t let up until I was 15 miles down the road.  I’d overshot my exit but I didn’t care at that point.  I was so overcome with panic that I decided to get off at the next exit just to collect myself.  I found a small gas station a mile or so down the road from the exit.  I pulled in and parked behind the small storefront so that my car couldn’t be seen from the road.  

I turned off the engine and slumped down in my seat.  I cried.  The stress had clenched my heart and I guess my body needed some sort of relief.  I couldn’t understand why this was happening to me.  Who was this insane woman and why the hell was I her prey?  I wrung my hands, banged my head on the steering wheel, slapped myself.  Anything I could do to pull myself together, I did.  I wiped at my eyes, got out and went into the convenience store.

The door bell went off as I entered the musty old shop.  A friendly country voice rang out from the big man behind the counter, welcoming me to the store.

“H-hey!”  I tried to sound normal.  “How’s it going?”

“Doing good!  How’s abouts yourself?”
Hearing that deep fried country drawl somehow felt like a connection back to reality.

“Brother, you wouldn’t believe me if I told ya,”  I called back as I pulled a cold soda from the cooler.

“Hell.  Try me.  I done heard it all before and twice on Sundays!”

I told him everything as I stood at the counter across from him.  I told him about work, how I took my lunch breaks, and of course about the crazy old bat I couldn’t seem to shake.  It felt good getting it off of my chest.  He laughed it all off until I got to the part about the highway.

“Ye say she was driving an old black 4 door?”  He looked puzzled.

“Uh-huh.  Like an old 80s…”

“Towncar?”

“Yeah, I think you’re right.”

“And this ol gal, she was real skinny-like?  White hair and a black dress?”  A look of concern had replaced his formerly giddy expression.

“That’s right…”

“Son.”  He spoke in a whisper.  “She’s in that washroom right back there you need to-”

The sound of the bathroom door’s lock opening behind my back cut him off in stride.  The cashier flicked his eyes to his right.  I followed in kind, moving behind the shelves of snacks.  My heart thumped out of my chest.  How could this be?!  I heard slow, unsteady footsteps on the vinyl floor in the aisle adjacent to where I was crouched.  

The old woman was making a low guttural wheezing sound as she slowly made her way towards the front.  She smelled like ammonia and something sickly sweet.  I could see her in the reflection of the mirrored dome near the door.  If I could see her, all she had to do was look up at it and she’d see me too.

“Anything I can help you with there, ma’am?”  The cashier spoke with his natural southern charm.

She didn’t reply.  She stared at him, her eyes lingering on him in that terrifying way I knew too well.

“I said’s there anything I can help you with, darlin’?”

She opened her mouth and made a sound like a choking bullfrog.

“Ma’am, are you alr-”

She tilted her head.

“You followed me here, didn’t you?  DIDN’T YOU?!”

“Uh, ma’am, I work he-”

Before he could get the words out, she was across the counter, with her long fingernails clawing at his throat.  The cashier yelped like a hurt dog.  I could see blood in the reflection.  I wasn’t sure whose it was as they struggled behind the counter.  Cigarette packs and bottles crashed to the floor.

“FUCK OFFA ME, YA OLD BITCH!!”

The cashier swung out from behind the counter with the old woman clung to his chest like a monkey.  Her old withered fingers clawed at his face leaving thin red streaks of blood leaking down his cheeks.  He tried to push her off of him.  As the cashier backpedalled with the rabid woman still clawing at him, he tripped over a knocked over display.

The pair crashed into the shelf that I hid behind knocking cans of soup and bags of chips across the room.  They went down hard.  The smell of iron burnt my nostrils as I looked into the security mirror.  A crimson pool was forming around the back of the cashier’s head.  He laid there still fighting as the old woman’s fingers ripped and tore at his face.

“NOT MY FUCKING EYES!!  HELP!!” He called out desperately.

I ran.  I didn't even think.  I just ran to my car and turned the key in the ignition.  The engine roared to life.  I took off into the night, driving as fast as I could.

I know.  I'm a fucking coward.  I wanted to call the cops but in all my panic I couldn't even remember what sort of gas station it was.  I couldn't even remember where it was.  What was I going to do, call 911 and say be on the lookout for a killer old woman - she could be anywhere?

I drove back home.  I circled the block first of course, looking for any sign of her.  I was so drained.  I couldn't even bring myself to get out of the car.  I sat out front for 20 minutes or so just staring at my door.  I thought about the cashier.  I thought about the crazy look in that evil old woman's eyes.

I thought about home and my daydream of spending a comfy safe night in front of the TV.  I thought about walking right in, locking the door behind me, and living that dream out.  The only problem with that was…

As I looked through the window of my home, I was fairly sure that when I left the house that morning, I didn't leave the living room light on.
