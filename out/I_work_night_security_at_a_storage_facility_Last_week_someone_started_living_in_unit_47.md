I've been working night security at SecureSpace Storage for three years now. It's off Highway 22, about fifteen minutes outside of town—one of those places you pass a hundred times without really noticing.

Orange and gray building, chain-link fence, rows of identical garage-style units. Nothing special about it, which is exactly why I took the job. After my divorce, I needed something steady, something that wouldn't ask too much of me.

The shifts run 10 PM to 6 AM. Most nights, I do maybe four rounds, spend the rest of the time in the office watching Netflix on my phone or reading. The pay isn't great, but it's enough for my studio apartment and my truck payment. Plus, I actually like the quiet. After twenty years in retail management, dealing with angry customers and corporate bullshit, sitting alone in a silent office feels like meditation.

The facility has 200 units spread across five buildings. A through E. Each building has forty units, twenty on each side of a central corridor. Climate-controlled, which means they stay at a steady 65 degrees year-round. The hallways have motion-sensor lights that click on when you walk through, creating this wave of fluorescent brightness that follows you around.
Last Monday started like any other shift. I got in at 9:45, Jerry from the day shift was finishing up his paperwork. We shot the shit for a few minutes—his kid's baseball team, the weather, nothing important. He mentioned that unit 47 in Building B had been rented that afternoon.

"Paid six months in advance, cash," he said, pulling on his jacket. "Didn't bring anything to store though. Just signed the papers and left."
That wasn't too unusual. Sometimes people rent units preemptively, planning for a move or inheritance or whatever. I made a mental note to check it during my rounds, then forgot about it.

Around midnight, I did my first walk-through. Starting with Building A, like always. The motion lights clicked on ahead of me, clicked off behind me. Everything normal. Building B was the same until I hit the corridor where unit 47 was located.

The light above unit 47 was already on.
Now, these lights are supposed to turn off after five minutes of no movement. I figured maybe there was a short in the sensor or something. I made a note in my log to tell maintenance, then continued my rounds. Buildings C through E, all clear. Back to the office.
At 2 AM, second round. The light above unit 47 was still on. I stood there for a minute, watching it. The other lights in the corridor had clicked on when I entered, creating their usual progression, but that one light had never turned off. I walked up to the unit. Standard orange roll-up door, secured with a disc lock. No sounds from inside. I touched the door—cold metal, nothing unusual. Shrugged it off, finished my rounds.
By the third round at 4 AM, I was getting irritated. Broken sensor or not, the constant light was bugging me. That's when I noticed something else. There was condensation on the inside of unit 47's door. You could see it beading up where the door met the concrete floor, these little droplets catching the fluorescent light.

Climate-controlled units don't get condensation. The whole point is to prevent moisture.
I crouched down, touched one of the droplets. It was warm.

That's when I heard it. This soft sound, barely audible. Like breathing, but not quite. More like... whispered counting. Very quiet, very steady. "...forty-three, forty-four, forty-five..."
I stood up fast, my hand going to the flashlight on my belt. The counting stopped immediately. I waited there for maybe five minutes, listening. Nothing. Just the hum of the climate control system.

I went back to the office and pulled up the rental agreement for unit 47. Name: M. Carpenter. Address: 1447 Maple Street, Apartment 2B. The address seemed familiar, so I Googled it.

1447 Maple Street had burned down two years ago. Four people died, including a woman named Margaret Carpenter who lived in Apartment 2B.

My hands were shaking a little as I typed her name into the search bar. The obituary came up immediately. Margaret Carpenter, 34, died in the Maple Street fire along with three other residents. But here's the thing that made my stomach drop—the photo in the obituary showed a woman with long dark hair and distinctive heterochromia. One brown eye, one blue eye.
The woman who rented unit 47 had one brown eye and one blue eye. Jerry had mentioned it specifically because it was so unusual.

Tuesday night, I called in sick. I know that makes me a coward, but I needed time to think. Maybe it was a relative, someone who looked similar. Maybe the whole thing was a coincidence. Yeah, I know how that sounds.
Wednesday night, I couldn't call in again without risking my job. I got to work, and Jerry looked tired.
"Everything okay?" I asked.

"Weird night yesterday," he said. "That new unit, 47? The lady came by around midnight. Tina said she just stood outside it for like an hour, didn't go in or anything. Just stood there."

Tina covers my shifts when I'm out. She's sixty-eight, tough as nails, been doing security work longer than I've been alive.

"She say anything else?"
Jerry shook his head. "Tina left her alone. You know how she is—doesn't bother nobody if they're not causing trouble."
After Jerry left, I sat in the office for an hour, trying to convince myself to do my rounds. Finally, at 11:30, I grabbed my flashlight and headed out.

Building A, clear. I approached Building B slowly. Before I even entered the corridor, I could see the light above unit 47 was on. But this time, as I got closer, I could see shadows moving underneath the door. Not walking shadows—writhing shadows. Like multiple people crawling over each other.

The counting was louder now. Multiple voices, all whispering numbers, but they weren't in sync. "Twelve, thirteen..." "Ninety-one, ninety-two..." "Thirty-seven, thirty-eight..."
I should have left. Should have gone back to the office, called the cops, quit on the spot, something. Instead, I knocked on the door.
The counting stopped instantly. The shadows froze.
"Security," I said, my voice cracking. "I need you to open up."

Silence for maybe ten seconds. Then, a woman's voice, muffled by the door: "I'm the renter. I have every right to be here."
It sounded like Margaret Carpenter's voice from the rental agreement signature—she'd said "thank you" when Jerry had given her the keys, and Jerry had mentioned her unusually raspy voice. But there was something wrong with it now. Like she was talking through water.

"Ma'am, I need you to open the door. Multiple people in a unit is a violation of the rental agreement."
"I'm alone," she said. Then, after a pause: "We're alone."
My flashlight beam was shaking. "Open the door, or I'm calling the police."

The lock clicked. The door started rolling up, that mechanical grinding sound they make. It stopped about a foot off the ground. Darkness inside, complete darkness despite the corridor light that should have illuminated at least part of the interior.

"Come in," she said from somewhere in that darkness. "We want to show you something."
I bent down, shined my flashlight through the gap. The beam just... stopped. Like the darkness was solid, eating the light about a foot into the unit.
Then a hand shot out from under the door. Bone white, fingers too long, nails caked with something dark. It grabbed my ankle before I could step back. The skin was hot, burning hot, and wet.

I yanked my leg back, fell on my ass, scrambled backward. The hand retreated into the darkness. Laughter from inside—not one voice, dozens, all slightly out of sync, creating this horrible echo.
The door rolled back down.

I ran. Didn't finish my rounds, just ran back to the office, locked the door, and called the police. Told them I'd heard someone breaking into a unit.
Two officers showed up twenty minutes later. I led them to unit 47. The light above it was off. The door was locked. They cut the lock, rolled up the door.
The unit was empty. Completely empty. Not even dust on the floor.
But the walls—the walls were covered in tally marks. Thousands of them, scratched into the metal. And they were warm to the touch. The officers felt them too, exchanged looks.

"Kids, probably," one of them said, but he didn't sound convinced.
They wrote up a report, told me to call if anything else happened, and left.
I went back to the office and pulled up the security footage. We have cameras at the entrance to each building, though not in the corridors themselves. I rewound to earlier that night.

At 11:15 PM, the camera for Building B showed me entering for my rounds. At 11:18, it showed me leaving, walking backward. Then it showed me entering again. Then leaving, walking backward. Over and over, the same three minutes looping while the timestamp kept advancing normally.

I checked the other nights. Monday, when I first noticed the light—same thing. The footage would loop whenever I was in Building B. But Tuesday, when Tina worked, the footage was normal. It showed a woman in a long coat standing by the Building B entrance from midnight to 1 AM, never going in. Just standing there, facing the door.

I looked closer at the woman. The coat was burned at the edges. Her hair was dark, matted. She never turned toward the camera, but at one point, she tilted her head, and I could see her profile.
She had no eye on that side of her face. Just smooth, melted skin.

I quit that night. Sent an email to my supervisor, packed up my few personal items from the office, and left. Didn't even finish the shift.
That was a week ago. I found a new job, overnight stocking at a grocery store. The pay's worse, but I don't care.

Here's the thing though—the thing that made me write this all down:
I still have the access codes to the SecureSpace security system on my phone. I know I should delete the app, but I can't help checking the cameras sometimes. Building B, specifically.

Every night at midnight, the woman in the burned coat stands at the entrance. She never goes in anymore. She just stands there.
But three nights ago, she turned toward the camera for the first time. Both eyes were there now—one brown, one blue. She smiled and held up a piece of paper.
Even on the grainy footage, I could read what it said:
"Unit 48 available soon."

I looked up the current renter of unit 48. Jennifer Price, 1447 Maple Street, Apartment 1A.
She died in the same fire as Margaret Carpenter.
Last night, the woman held up a different sign: "Unit 49 available soon."
Michael Chen. 1447 Maple Street, Apartment 2A. Died in the fire.

Tonight, she held up another sign. Not about unit 50. This one just had an address.

My address.

I'm writing this from my truck, parked outside a motel three towns over. I've been driving for two hours, but I swear I can still smell smoke. And every time I check my rearview mirror, I see the same pair of headlights, keeping pace exactly three cars behind.
They've been there since I left my apartment.
The strange thing is, those headlights? One is yellow-white, normal. The other is slightly blue.
I'm going to keep driving.
