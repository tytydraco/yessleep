When I was a kid, I used to play these “games” to scare myself. I know, it's weird, but I was a bit of a loner growing up and I needed some way to entertain myself while my mom was working her overnights at the hospital. I was actually incredibly brave as a child.

It’s funny how time changes a person.

It wasn’t until I moved in with my fiancé that the memories of my childhood games came back to me. Our new house was perfect, a two story fixer-upper with a basement in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. We had been moved in for about a week and were sorting out some boxes in the basement when Adrienne noticed the time.

“You promised we’d be in bed by midnight.”

I checked my watch, it was nearing one in the morning. We had been unpacking for nearly four straight  hours. The unfinished basement was dimly lit by a singular fluorescent bulb, one of those ones that is attached to a pull chain. The hopper window in the back was covered with a thick bush that I hadn’t gotten around to trimming down yet, so time had completely slipped away.

“Yeah, you’re right. Not sure why we’re organizing Christmas stuff - we won’t need it for months. Let’s get to bed and pick this up in the morning.”

I went to head up the stairs, but was stopped when Adrienne grabbed my hand.

“Hey! Don’t you dare leave me here. This basement creeps me out.”

I chuckled as I scanned our basement’s mostly vacant walls. Unimpressive certainly, but I didn’t think anything about it was explicitly creepy. I should have known better. Adrienne is the type of person to look away from a movie at the first hint of blood. I love her with all my heart, but she is possibly the biggest scaredy cat that I know.

“Alright, go on up. I’ll get the light.”

I let Adrienne get halfway up the stairs before I pulled the chain on the bulb, leaving me in near total darkness. At that moment, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. Alone, in the shadow-filled basement, I was transported back in time to one of my favorite childhood games. 

I smiled to myself as the repressed memory bubbled up. 

I would play the game, one last time. 

I loitered in the basement, casually and confidently. I *knew* not to turn around. I knew exactly how to play from when I was a child. It was like riding a bike. I felt the monster behind me getting closer. My instincts told me to run, but that would be cheating.

The way to win the game was by waiting until the very last possible moment before fleeing and bursting out of the basement door into the light of the kitchen. I must have played this particular game at least a hundred times when I was a child. I always won.

It wasn’t about knowing what step to start running, it was about feeling the fear and adrenaline. That was the only way to know for certain how close the monster was. 

My fully grown body caused the wooden steps to creak in a way that I had never had to account for before. Would this change the game? 

When I was about halfway up the stairs I knew the monster was close. My heartrate quicked and I *wanted* to run. My smile widened as I experienced the same fear and adrenaline that had powered me as a child. 

Don’t turn around. Don’t run. Not yet.

One more step.

My body went into motion faster than my brain had time to register. I sprinted up the remainder of the stairs and slammed the basement door behind me out of pure instinct. I smiled at Adrienne who stared at me with wide eyes. 

Once again, I beat the monster.

“What was that?” Adrienne asked quickly.

She raced for her phone and I stared at her, confused.

“I didn’t mean to scare you! It was just a game that I used to play when I was a kid. I would turn off the basement lights and walk up the stairs, until the very last moment. Then, I would run.”

What Adrienne said next will forever be etched into my memory as one of the most haunting things that I had ever heard.

“Then why did I hear two pairs of footsteps?”
