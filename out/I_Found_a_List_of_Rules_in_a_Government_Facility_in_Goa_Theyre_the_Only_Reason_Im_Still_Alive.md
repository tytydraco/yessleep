They don’t tell you what you’re volunteering for when you sign your name on the clipboard at 3 AM under a flickering tube light, high on desperation and two years of unemployment.

They tell you you’ll “help humanity.” That you’ll “see things no one else has seen.”

They don’t tell you that you’ll never sleep the same way again.

I’m writing this from somewhere deep below the Konkan cliffs. A place not found on any satellite image. The air tastes like damp stone and iron fillings, and the only light comes from a pulsating red emergency beacon. I’ve been hiding here for nine hours, maybe more. The tranquilizers distort time. They wanted me sedated. They didn’t want me *lucid* enough to remember.

But I remember everything now.

Especially the rules.

# The Rules Were Scribbled in Blood and Ink

His name was Naveen. They said he went mad, but I don’t believe that anymore. They dragged him out of our shared cell three nights ago, his eyes twitching, muttering numbers. The next morning, under my pillow, I found a note scrawled on a torn page of a facility protocol binder.

Some rules were underlined. Others scratched out. All of them... were *weird*.

And I think he meant for me to follow them *only when the lights turned red*.

# The Rules to Survive in B.H.D. Sector-5 (Do Not Share. Do Not Ask.)

**Rule 1:** When the ceiling begins to *breathe*, do not look up. Close your eyes. Count to 11 using your *heartbeats*. Not seconds. **Sub-rule 1A:** If you lose count, press your thumb hard into your left eye. The pain will reset your perception.

**Rule 2:** If you hear your mother calling your name—*ignore it*. Your mother is not here. She died in **Incident: 3.14.72**. This includes any voice using her tone, even if it knows your childhood nickname. **(Conditional Clause: If the voice apologizes for your father's death, recite the phrase: "Goa never forgets.")**

**Rule 3:** The guard in blue with one brown shoe and one black is not a guard. Do not speak to him. If he smiles, *run*.

**Rule 4:** When the intercom says “test concluded,” hold your breath. For as long as you can. Even if it makes you pass out.

**Rule 5:** You are not twenty-five. You are **seventy-three**. They’ve made you *young again* so your mind would be malleable. If you stare too long into your reflection, it will age accordingly.

**Rule 6:** If you smell lemons, *bite your tongue*. Blood masks you. Lemons draw them.

**Rule 7:** There is a door marked B-33 in the lower labs. If you find it, enter only at **03:44 AM**. Not before. Not after. Inside, count backward from 99 in multiples of seven.

**Rule 8:** If you see Naveen again, **do not let him touch you.**

**Rule 9:** They are going to ask you for your "true name." You don't remember it, but they think you do. When they ask, answer with this:  
**“Δ-13.AZUL-552”**  
(Yes, that's a code.. I think. Somebody, anybody, please crack it.)

# The Facility Wasn’t Built for Experiments. It Is the Experiment.

The Goa coastline hides many secrets, but B.H.D. Sector-5 isn’t just hidden—it’s *forgotten*. I’ve read files in the abandoned data terminals (yes, I hacked them—thank you, two semesters of electrical engineering). This facility used to be a Portuguese-era salt mine. But that’s just the surface.

They've built deeper. *Much deeper.*

I’ve gone down fourteen floors underground. Each level is colder than the last, but the cold doesn’t touch your skin. It touches your *thoughts*.

I think the guards aren’t protecting us from the outside. They’re protecting the outside from *what we become*.

I saw myself walking in the hallway. Not a reflection. Not a trick of light.

A version of me, older. Or younger. Skin stitched where no wounds had ever been. He looked at me and said:

>

I hadn’t even seen a Rule 10. Not until I flipped the note over, behind the ink stains and old blood. There it was. Half erased. Barely readable.

# Rule 10 (Final): If you ever meet yourself in the facility, ask them this:

**"What did you write in the margins?"**

If they answer with anything other than "**Not yet**", then they are *not* you.

Kill them. Quickly.

# The Sedatives Don’t Keep You Down. They Wake You Up.

They dose you every twelve hours. They say it’s for anxiety. But I’ve stopped taking the pills. My veins burn with something else now—clarity.

I see what’s wrong with this place.

It’s not the guards. It’s not the endless white corridors or the camera eyes that blink when you’re not looking.

It’s not even the versions of myself that whisper through the vents.

It’s that I was never meant to wake up here.

Not mentally. Not spiritually. This place was built to explore what’s *beneath* human consciousness. What sleeps *below the self*.

They’ve opened a door in my mind. And something has walked through.

# Code Break: Hidden Message

In case someone finds this, I embedded a fail-safe in this log. Each of the first letters in the Rules spells something. Look again.

* **R**ule 1
* **I**f you hear your mother…
* **T**he guard in blue…
* **W**hen the intercom says…
* **Y**ou are not twenty-five…
* **I**f you smell lemons…
* **T**here is a door…
* **I**f you see Naveen…
* **T**hey are going to ask…
* **I**f you ever meet yourself…

Put it together: **RITWYITTI**

Look familiar? Rearranged, it spells: **IT IT WRITY**  
Still sounds strange—until you shift the letters using the sequence from Rule 7 (**99 down in multiples of seven**) as a cipher. That’s your puzzle, Mr. Somebody. I’ve given you the key.

Because I may not survive the next cycle. But maybe you will.

If you find the rules... **follow them.**  
If you hear your name whispered in your sleep tonight—  
**don’t answer.**

And if the lights in your room suddenly turn red...

**Close your eyes.**  
**And start counting.**
