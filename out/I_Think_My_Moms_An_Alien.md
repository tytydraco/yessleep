The hum was back, a low thrumming that vibrated in my bones. It had started subtly, a background noise I could almost ignore, like a distant electrical transformer. But lately, it was growing, becoming insistent, demanding attention. Just like before. Just like every time *they* came.

Ever since *that night* when I was seven, the night the lights took me, things hadn't been right. It wasn't a clear memory, more like fragments of a dream, a jumble of sensations: weightlessness, cold metal, a high-pitched whine that made my teeth ache. I woke up with a mark behind my ear, a small, raised scar that my parents dismissed as a scratch. They told me it was a dream. Everyone did. But I *knew*. I knew something had happened.

We moved to Iowa shortly after. Dad’s dream, he called it. His ancestral land. All I knew was it was the middle of nowhere, miles of cornfields stretching in every direction, swallowing the horizon. I missed my friends, my life back in the city. This farm, this isolation, it felt like a punishment. The hum started around then too, or maybe I just started noticing it more in the quiet. It was a lonely kind of quiet, the kind that amplifies every creak of the old farmhouse, every rustle of the corn stalks.

The years passed, and the memory faded, becoming a hazy, unsettling dream. But the fear remained, a low, constant hum beneath the surface of my life. Sometimes, I'd catch a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye – a flicker of light, a shadow that moved too quickly. I’d hear a strange rustling in the cornfields at night, a sound that wasn't the wind. And then there were the animals.

It started subtly. A chicken found dead in the coop, seemingly untouched. Then a calf, its skin… wrong. It was like it had been turned inside out, the raw flesh exposed, no sign of predators. The sheriff dismissed it as some kind of freak accident, but I knew. I knew it was them. The way the other animals acted, too, that unsettling quiet, the way they huddled together, their eyes wide with fear. It was like they knew something was coming.

Then, when I was sixteen, the dreams returned, clearer this time, more vivid, more *real*. I saw them. Those… *things*. They weren't just vaguely octopus-like anymore. They were nightmarish parodies of cephalopods, bloated and grotesque. Their skin wasn't just shimmering; it was slick, oily black, like a freshly spilled oil slick reflecting a sickly moon. And the suckers… God, the suckers. They weren't just smooth discs; they were lined with tiny, chitinous hooks that scraped against my skin in the dreams, leaving phantom sensations that lingered even after I woke. Their tentacles… they writhed and pulsed with a sickening life of their own. They weren't just limbs; they were prehensile horrors, tipped with razor-sharp barbs that dripped with some viscous, iridescent fluid. They stretched and contorted in ways that defied physics, reaching into places they shouldn't, *touching* me in ways that made my stomach churn even years later. Their eyes, multifaceted and cold, saw right through me, stripping away my defenses, exposing my deepest fears, my most vulnerable shames. They didn't take me then, not physically. But they were there, in my dreams, probing my mind, planting images, whispering suggestions. I woke up each morning with a feeling of violation, a sense that something had been taken from me, something *corrupted*.

The hum intensified after that. It was almost constant now, a low thrumming that seemed to vibrate in sync with my heartbeat. The bruise on my arm reappeared, the dark, purplish-black mark with veins that snaked beneath the skin like blackened roots, pulsing faintly. Exploratory surgery revealed a foreign biological substance present within the tissue. It wasn't just *in* me; it was *part* of me, woven into the muscle and nerve fibers like some alien parasite. Analysis confirmed the presence of nucleic acids, but the structure and composition were inconsistent with known terrestrial DNA. It was… wrong.

The strands were too long, too complex, coiling in ways that defied our understanding of biology. Under high magnification, the cells seemed to flicker, almost as if they were phasing in and out of reality. It was as if they belonged to some other dimension, some place beyond our comprehension. And it was spreading throughout my entire body yet no effects; other test subjects that had samples of this DNA in them; upon death, the human body, so fragile and dependent on the delicate balance of Earth's environment, undergoes rapid and dramatic changes.

Without the atmospheric pressure to contain them, the body's internal fluids begin to boil and vaporize, a phenomenon known as ebullism. The lack of oxygen leads to a swift loss of consciousness and, within minutes, brain death. The skin becomes severely sunburned and begins to swell. It's a gruesome process, a swift and brutal reminder of our terrestrial limitations, which is literally the same as dying in outer space. Now, I know what you're thinking. Sunburns? In a lab? It's not the sun as we know it, that big ball of gas billions of miles away. Think of the sun as a massive energy source. It emits energy in many forms, including light and radiation. That radiation, specifically ultraviolet (UV) radiation, is what causes sunburns. Well, this DNA… it seems to be acting as a conduit for a similar kind of energy, only it's not coming from outer space. It's coming from… somewhere else.

This foreign DNA is somehow converting something within me, some kind of energy, into something that's mimicking the effects of solar radiation, right down to the cellular level. At least, that's what the scientists and doctors told us. But then again, how does this all help me? This is actually fucked.

Then, Dad… He tried to protect me. He saw the lights that night, the same lights that took me when I was seven. He grabbed his shotgun, his face a mask of fear and determination. "Stay inside, Henry!" he yelled, his voice cracking. He ran out into the yard, just as the ship descended.

I watched from the window, my heart pounding in my chest. The violet light washed over everything, making the cornfield look like it was underwater. Then I saw them. The… *things*. They were even more grotesque than in my dreams. Their tentacles writhed, dripping that iridescent slime. They surrounded Dad, their movements too quick, too fluid. I saw one of them, its tentacle snaking out, forcing something… *gooey*… down Dad’s throat. He gagged, his body convulsing. Then, he went still.

"Dad!" I screamed, running out of the house. The ship was gone, leaving only the eerie silence and the lingering smell of ozone. Dad lay on the ground, his eyes wide open, staring at nothing. I rushed to him, my hands shaking. "Dad? Dad, can you hear me?"

His eyes didn't focus. His skin was clammy, cold. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. He was gone.

"No… no…" I sobbed, pulling his body closer. "Please, Dad, no…"

Mom came running out, her face pale. "Henry, what happened?" she whispered, her voice trembling.

"They… they…" I couldn't speak. I just pointed at Dad.

Mom gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. Tears streamed down her face. Together, we managed to drag his body back into the house.

We laid him on the living room floor, covering him with a blanket. Mom sat beside him, rocking back and forth, her sobs filling the room. I sat there too, numb, trying to make sense of what had happened.

Then, something moved under the blanket.

Dad’s hand twitched.

Mom and I exchanged a terrified look.

His body began to convulse, a sickening shudder running through him. His eyes snapped open, but they were no longer Dad’s eyes. They were cold, empty, filled with a malevolent intelligence.

He sat up, his head lolling to the side. His mouth opened, and a guttural growl escaped.

"Dad?" I whispered, my voice trembling.

He lunged.

He moved with an unnatural speed, his body contorting in ways that were physically impossible. He wasn't Dad anymore. He was a… a *thing*… using Dad’s body as a shell.

He grabbed Mom, throwing her against the wall. She screamed, her arm twisting at an unnatural angle.

I ran to the shed, adrenaline coursing through me. I grabbed the axe, its weight heavy in my hands. I ran back into the house, my heart pounding in my chest.

He was coming for me. 

I swung the axe, the blade sinking deep into his shoulder. He didn't even flinch. He just kept coming, his eyes fixed on me, filled with a terrifying hunger.

I fought, scratching, clawing, desperate to survive. But it was like fighting a machine, something relentless and unstoppable. I was both injured, bleeding, terrified.

Then, Mom screamed, "Henry, the axe! You have to!"

I knew what she meant. *They aren't just dead, Henry. They're… repurposed.*

I knew what she meant. *They aren't just dead, Henry. They're... repurposed.* Her words echoed in my mind, a chilling mantra that fueled the rising panic. This wasn't just about survival; it was about... desecration. Preventing *them* from using Dad's body any longer.

I swung the axe again, this time aiming for his head. The blade connected with a sickening *thunk*, a jarring impact that vibrated through the handle and into my bones. His head snapped to the side, a wet, sickening *crack* accompanying the blow. He fell to the floor, his body jerking and twitching in a grotesque parody of life. A dark, crimson stain bloomed on the floor beneath him.

But it wasn't enough. He was still moving. That alien presence, that *thing* inside him, clung to life with a tenacity that defied reason.

I understood. We had to go further. We had to... *violate*.

The next few minutes were a chaotic dance of desperation and dread. The axe, heavy and slick in my hands, became an instrument of necessity. Each swing was a desperate act, a visceral struggle against the unnatural force that animated Dad's body. I focused on the mechanics, the swing, the impact, trying to block out the horror of what I was doing. The metallic tang of blood filled the air, thick and cloying, mingling with the strange, almost sweet, scent of that iridescent slime. Bits of… *Dad*… flew with each swing, spattering the walls and floor. I saw bone, white and stark against the crimson. Severed limbs twitched on the floor, fingers still clenching and unclenching. Even after… even after… the flesh seemed to writhe, as if trying to reassemble itself, pulled by his own blood, congealing and clinging to tendons and muscle, a grotesque, biological imperative driven by the alien presence within.

We buried the pieces separately in the cornfield, under the pale light of the moon. We didn’t speak. We couldn’t. We were broken, shattered, haunted by what I had done. Mom was never the same after that. The grief was a physical thing, a weight that bent her over, stole the light from her eyes. She started drinking, heavily. Whiskey, mostly. It numbed the pain, she said, but it also made her mean. She’d look at me, her eyes filled with a mixture of grief and resentment. “It’s your fault,” she’d slur. “They came for you. Your father… he sacrificed himself for you.” Now, at thirty-three, the hum is back, louder than ever, a constant thrumming in my bones. And the lights… they're not just lights anymore. They're like nothing I've ever seen, even in my nightmares. They’re a sickly, pulsating violet, shifting and swirling in the sky like living things. They don't just illuminate; they *probe*. They pierce the darkness, casting long, distorted shadows that dance and writhe like mocking figures. They seem to have a life of their own, these lights, almost sentient, watching, waiting. 

One night, she was on one of her drunken stupors again, but this hostility was expected. It was Dad’s death date, after all. I was grieving too, but for once, I needed to make a stand for myself.

"It wasn't my fault!" I shouted, my voice cracking. Mom just stared at me, her eyes bloodshot and unfocused. A half-empty bottle of whiskey sat on the table between us, the amber liquid sloshing precariously. It was the same argument we’d had a hundred times, the same accusations, the same raw, gaping wound of grief that never seemed to heal. It had started, like it always did lately, with Mom staring at Dad’s picture on the mantelpiece, a flicker of something dark and accusing in her eyes. Then the whispers began, barely audible at first, about how Dad had died because of me, how I was cursed, a bringer of darkness.

“He died because of you!” she slurred, pointing a shaky finger at my chest. “You brought this on us!”

“That’s not true!” I insisted, but my words felt hollow, even to my own ears. “They came for Dad too, don’t you understand? He was trying to protect me!”

She laughed, a harsh, brittle sound. “Protect you? He died because of you!” she repeated, her voice laced with bitterness. “You were always different,” she whispered, her gaze drifting to some unseen point in the distance. “A strange child. And now… look what’s happened.” She gestured vaguely around the room, littered with empty bottles and overflowing ashtrays. “Your father is dead, and this… I gotta deal with this shit.”

“Mom, please,” I begged, tears stinging my eyes. “I’m scared too. I miss him too.”

But tonight was different. Something inside me snapped. Years of bottled-up frustration, of guilt and fear and the crushing weight of her accusations, finally boiled over.

"Actually, no, fuck this!" I roared, slamming my fist on the table, making the whiskey bottles jump. "I'm not taking this anymore! It wasn't my fault! I didn't ask for any of this!"

She stared at me, momentarily stunned by my outburst. Then, her face contorted with rage.

"You ungrateful little—" she started, but I cut her off.

"Ungrateful?" I shouted. "I watched them kill Dad! I had to... I had to..." The memory of that night, the axe, the blood, the sickening crunch of bone, flooded back, making my stomach churn. "And you blame me? You push me away? What kind of mother are you?"

She lunged at me, her nails raking down my face. But it wasn't like fingernails at all. It felt like talons, sharp and impossibly strong, tearing through skin and muscle. I recoiled, the searing pain a white-hot flash across my face. My vision blurred, and I felt something warm and wet trickling down my cheek. It wasn't just scratches; it was worse. Strips of skin hung loose, peeled back like the rind of a fruit. And then, a sickening crunch, a blinding pain that made me scream. She'd gotten my eye. I stumbled back, crashing against the wall, my hand instinctively reaching for the gaping wound on my face. She stumbled too, falling against the wall with a sickening *thump*. The whiskey bottle slipped from her grasp, shattering on the floor, the amber liquid splashing across the dusty boards like spilled blood. A strange scent filled the air, acrid and metallic, nothing like her usual perfume. It wasn't just body odor, it was something stronger, something familiar yet unsettlingly *different*. It clung to the back of my throat, making me gag. It was her, but… *more*. This was the first time she'd ever laid a hand on me. And somehow, this… this *human* violence, this raw, animalistic rage in her eyes… she was starting to scare me more than the fucking aliens.

"Get out!" she screamed, her voice raw with fury. "Get out of my house!"

The smell of whiskey and stale cigarettes clung to her, a constant reminder of the woman she used to be, the warm, loving mother who had vanished along with Dad.

I wandered into town, a ghost in my own life. I had no money, no food, no place to go. The townspeople eyed me with suspicion, whispering behind their hands. I was the boy from the farm, the one whose father had died… violently. They knew something was wrong, something dark and unsettling. I could see it in their averted gazes, in the way they crossed the street to avoid me. Before leaving the farm, I’d managed to call the ambulance, a frantic, whispered plea for help that felt utterly inadequate in the face of what had happened. The ER had been a blur of antiseptic smells and hurried questions. I’d lied, of course. Told them I’d been attacked by some animal outside, a wild dog maybe, or a coyote. They’d patched me up, stitched the torn flesh on my face, but the look in the doctor’s eyes… he hadn’t believed me. No one would. The hum, I could still feel it, a low vibration beneath my skin, a constant reminder of the horror I carried inside.

I slept in the park, huddled under a thin blanket, the hum a constant reminder of the terror that was coming. It was a cold, gnawing hum, a vibration that resonated deep within me, like a tuning fork struck in the hollow of my bones. It was the sound of *them*, the sound of the void.

Then, I met Silas. It was in the park, a rare sunny afternoon. I was sitting on a bench, staring blankly ahead, trying to disappear into the anonymity of the crowd, when I saw him. Silas. He was an older man, with a shock of white hair and eyes that seemed to pierce right through you. He wasn't just looking at the sky like other people might, admiring the clouds or whatever. He was *searching* it. Scanning it, almost like he was looking for something specific. But it wasn't just the way he looked, it was what he was doing with his hands. He held them up, palms out, as if he was trying to… catch something. Or maybe block something. It was strange, unsettling. Something no other old man in the park was doing. It was the kind of thing people whispered about, the kind of thing that earned you the label of "crazy." But there was something about his intensity, his focus… it resonated with me. He was a recluse, living in a dilapidated cabin on the outskirts of town, with a reputation for being eccentric, a local historian with a fascination for the unexplained. But he wasn't crazy. He was just… different. He saw the world in a way that others didn't, a way that, deep down, made sense to me.

He listened to my story, his eyes wide with a strange mixture of fear and excitement. He didn't dismiss me as delusional, like everyone else. He understood. He knew about the farm, about the lights, about the things that happened in Iowa. "The Umbral Beings," he whispered, his voice hushed with reverence and dread. "They're ancient, powerful. They travel between dimensions, between *times*. They are not of this world, not truly."

“They’ve been here for centuries,” Silas continued, his voice raspy, like dry leaves skittering across pavement. “Long before your family, long before this town, even. They’ve been… observing. Waiting.” He gestured with a gnarled finger, tracing patterns in the dust on his cluttered table. “They’re not interested in our technology, our resources. They’re interested in… us.”

“What do they want?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Silas leaned forward, his eyes glinting in the dim light of his cabin. “That’s the question, isn’t it? Some say they’re harbingers. Messengers of something… greater. Something… beyond.” He paused, a shiver running down his spine. “Others… others believe they’re something far worse. That they’re… shepherds. Guiding us towards some… unknown destination.”

He told me about the local legends, about the creatures that had been seen in the area for decades. He spoke of grotesque figures, their forms shifting and indistinct, their presence heralded by the hum and the violet lights. He said they were drawn to the farm, drawn to *me*. He said my altered DNA, that *thing* they put inside me, it was like a beacon, calling them back.

Silas had a plan. A crazy plan. He wanted to use me as bait. He thought if we could lure them out, we could finally understand what they wanted, what they were doing. He believed they were connected to something vast, something ancient, something that existed beyond human comprehension. He called it the Awakening.

“They’re not just… aliens,” Silas explained, his voice hushed with awe. “They exist outside of our linear time. They slip between moments, between realities. They’re what some call… prophets of simulation. Beings who manipulate the very fabric of existence. They travel not through galaxies, but through *matrices*. Through layers of reality, between moments in time. They are… beyond our understanding.”

I was terrified, but I was also desperate. I needed answers. I needed to know why they chose me, why they destroyed my family, why they filled my life with a dread that never left me, a fear that burrowed into my soul and made a home there.

"So, tonight, we’re going back to the cornfield," Silas said, his voice barely a whisper. He stared out the window, his gaze fixed on the darkening sky. "We’re going to face them."

I knew who he meant. The *aliens*. The things that had haunted his life for decades. The things that had taken his family.

"You think they'll be there?" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

Silas nodded slowly, a single tear tracing a path down his weathered cheek. "They took my wife," he said, his voice thick with grief, each word a heavy weight. "And my daughter. Emily… they never found her."

He turned, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered pain that had driven him for all these years. "Do you know what it's like, Henry?" he asked, his voice cracking. "To see… to see what they did to her? It wasn't… it wasn't just death. It was… violation. The pull… it was so strong. They… they *ripped* her out of her skin. Like… like pulling a sock off inside out. That's what fell on me. Just… the skin. A wet, bloody… *thing*."

He closed his eyes, his face contorting in a silent scream. "But that wasn't… that wasn't even the worst part. The… the *screaming*… Henry, I can still hear her screaming. Even after… even after her skin was gone… her body… it… it just… *combusted*. Exploded. Like… like a balloon filled with blood. Just… *poof*. A mist. A red rain… all over me."

He opened his eyes again, and they were filled with a desperate plea. "And then… the men in black. They were there so fast. Like they knew. Like they were waiting. They told me… they *warned* me… to keep quiet. Said it was for my own good. For Emily's memory. But how can I… how can I honor her memory by pretending she just… disappeared?"

His voice dropped to a whisper. "Emily's gone, Henry. I know that. But… maybe… maybe I can find some answers. Maybe I can finally understand… why." He looked at me, his eyes filled with a desperate resolve. "And maybe," he added, a chilling edge to his voice, "maybe I can make them pay." He paused, a dark premonition hanging heavy in the air. "But I have a feeling," he finished, "that this time, I won’t be coming back."

The corn stalks tower around us, a whispering labyrinth in the inky blackness. It's a different kind of dark out here, a thick, suffocating darkness that swallows the light of our flashlights whole. The air hangs heavy and still, charged with an unnatural electricity that makes the hairs on my arms stand on end. Above, the stars glitter like a million icy eyes, but it's hard to tell which ones are stars and which ones… aren't. The silence is unnerving, too. Not a cricket's chirp, not a rustle of leaves, just the faint, almost imperceptible hum that vibrates deep in my bones. It's as if the whole world is holding its breath. Then, the lights appear. They descend silently, impossibly, piercing the darkness like malevolent stars falling from the sky. They're too bright, too focused, too… *wrong*. And then, they take Silas. It happens so fast. One moment he's beside me, his hand gripping my arm, the next he's gone. There's no scream, no struggle, just a sudden, violent *snap* as he's yanked upwards, vanishing into the blinding light as if he's been plucked from the earth by an invisible hand. It's like… like he was never even there. But I can hear him. 

He screams, a raw, animalistic sound that’s cut short as he’s yanked upwards, his body twisting and contorting in the violet light. He’s silhouetted against the underside of the craft, a writhing, struggling form that’s pulled inside with terrifying speed. Then, silence. An unnerving, absolute silence that’s broken only by the low hum of the ship.

My breath hitches in my throat. I know I should run. Every instinct screams at me to turn and flee, to put as much distance as possible between myself and whatever horror just claimed Silas. But my feet are rooted to the spot. I can’t move. I’m transfixed, paralyzed by a terror so profound it transcends fear. It’s a morbid curiosity, a dreadful fascination with the unknown that keeps me rooted to the spot.

The ship remains hovering above the cornfield for what feels like an eternity, the violet light pulsating like a diseased heart. Then, with a sickening thud, something falls from the sky. It lands in the cornfield, a few feet away from me. It's Silas.

But it’s not Silas. Not anymore. His skin… it’s like it’s been peeled back, revealing the raw, glistening muscle beneath. His eyes are gone, just empty sockets staring up at the sky. And from his mouth, a thick, viscous ooze spills out, shimmering in the moonlight. He’s still alive, somehow, his chest rising and falling in shallow, ragged breaths. But he’s not Silas. He’s a puppet, a grotesque husk animated by something alien.

A low growl rumbles from his throat, a sound that’s not human. He tries to sit up, his movements jerky and unnatural. He looks at me, or rather, the *thing* inside him looks at me, and a wave of pure, unadulterated terror washes over me. Those empty sockets… they see me. They see *through* me.

I back away, my heart hammering against my ribs. I want to run, but my legs feel like lead. I know, with a chilling certainty, that I’m next.

And then, I hear it. A whisper in the wind, a voice that’s both familiar and utterly alien. It’s my mother’s voice, but twisted, distorted, corrupted.

“Henry…” it whispers. “Come home…”

I don’t know what’s waiting for me at the farmhouse. But I know, with a certainty that chills me to the bone, that whatever it is, it’s not human. And it’s waiting for me. It’s always been waiting for me.

I run, my heart pounding. I don't look back. I run as fast as my legs will carry me, the image of Silas's mutilated body and the sound of my mother's corrupted voice driving me on. I run until I collapse, gasping for breath, my lungs burning. But the voice… it lingers. *Henry… come home…* It’s a siren’s call, a twisted promise of comfort that tugs at the frayed edges of my sanity. I know it’s a trap, but the loneliness, the gnawing ache for some semblance of family, is too strong to resist.

I force myself to my feet and start walking. Back towards the farmhouse. Back towards the darkness.

The house is quiet when I arrive. No lights, no sound. Just the hum, louder now, a constant vibration that seems to emanate from the very walls. I push the door open and step inside.

“Mom?” I call out, my voice trembling.

“Henry?”

Her voice. It sounds… normal. Relieved.

“I’m home,” I say, stepping further into the house. The moonlight spills through the living room window, casting long, eerie shadows. Everything looks… normal. Almost too normal.

“I’m in here, honey,” she calls, her voice coming from the kitchen. “I’m making some tea. Come on in.”

I walk towards the kitchen, my footsteps echoing on the wooden floor. “Mom, I—” I start, but the words catch in my throat.

She’s there, standing by the stove, her back to me. She’s wearing her old robe, the one she always wore when she was reading before bed. She’s humming softly to herself.

“Mom?” I say again, my voice barely a whisper.

She turns, and smiles. It’s Mom’s smile. Or, at least, it looks like Mom’s smile. It’s… almost perfect.

“Henry,” she says, her voice warm and welcoming. “I’m so glad you’re back.”

“I… I missed you,” I say, my voice choked with emotion.

“I missed you too, honey,” she replies, her eyes glistening in the dim light. “I was wrong. I’m so sorry.”

I take a step towards her, and she reaches out to take my hand. As our fingers brush, I notice something. Something… off. Her skin. It’s too smooth, too… seamless. And her eyes… they’re Mom’s eyes, but they’re also… different. Colder. More distant.

The hum intensifies, vibrating through the floorboards, through my bones. *Henry… come home…*

I take another step back, my heart pounding in my chest. “Mom… what’s wrong with your skin?”

Her smile falters, just for a moment. Then, it widens, becoming something… predatory.

“Nothing, honey,” she says, her voice now a low, guttural purr. “Everything is… perfect.”

And then, right before my eyes, she *peels* it off.

It’s like watching someone shuck an ear of corn, only instead of kernels, it’s… flesh. Mom’s skin, perfectly preserved, comes away from her body in one sickening piece, revealing the… *thing* beneath. It’s not human. It’s not even close. Its form shimmers, the edges blurring, shifting. It’s something alien, something monstrous.

The last thing I hear is the hum, growing louder, drowning out everything else. Then, darkness.
