I awake in consuming darkness.

In sheer panic, I tried to sit up and banged my head off something hard.

Dazed, I held my head until my bearings were calmed.

Feeling around, I found nothing but more of the hard walls, but I also felt jagged edges.

Once my mind had cleared, I had enough sense to dig into my pockets and find my phone. I clicked on the flashlight feature and discovered I was covered in a heap of debris. My body was also slashed in several places and I was splattered with dried patches of blood.

What the fuck happened? I said out loud, groggily searching for a way out.

I tried to push up on the debris but it didn’t budge – not even a centimeter of give.

Another thought dawned on me, and so I checked my phone for a signal. The shattered screen showed that there was nothing – zero bars, and my battery was on fifteen percent remaining charge. The debris must be blocking it, I reasoned.

Shining my flashlight around again, I searched for any way to get out of this mess. Down by my feet, I saw a gap. Broken pieces of wood and cement blocks were down there. Logic determined that if I moved them, they’d either crush my legs or I could get free. My survival instinct said, “Fuck it. I have to get out of here by any means necessary.”

I kicked at the wood… and nothing happened.

Another kick and I could’ve sworn that it budged, or was I just that delirious?
One more harder kick, the hardest of all, and the wood went flying.

I tensed, waiting for the overwhelming sensation of my legs being crushed by the tons of whatever was above me, but nothing happened.

There was now a gap that was large enough to set me free. My legs had no room to bend, so I grabbed onto whatever was by my sides and used that as leverage to scoot. Inch by inch, I carefully maneuvered my body through the carnage.

After several of these scoots, I was underneath a jagged piece of thick glass. The very point of the glass scraped the tip of my nose, causing a slow trickle of blood to run into my eyes. I didn’t have enough space to wipe it, so it just had to keep pouring. Hot blood burned my eyes and I squinted hard to try to stop it, but the liquid eventually found a way in. I exclaimed in pain and frustration, but I continued onward.

My arms were scraped and bleeding from forcing my way through this narrow passage, and it felt as if I had no skin left on them, only torn meat and blood.

I scooted again and realized that I could hear something. Is that… an ambulance? A police car? Is that help finally arriving?

I felt invigorated with hope and I scooted further, faster, not caring about the sharp sensations of ripping flesh on my legs and arms. Finally, fucking finally, I could feel that my feet were free!

Another scoot and my legs were free. I could bend them! I sang praises to whatever gods were watching over me.

Then I suddenly recalled why I was underneath that rubble.

A beast, standing taller than any building in the city, was walking toward the bay, back to its lair in whatever hell it came from. Other buildings around mine sat in the same shape.

The air was filled with the sounds of sirens and crackling fires. I surveyed my body and found that I was even more mangled than I thought, but I would survive. Later that day, I stumbled across a group of rescue workers, who whisked me and a dozen other people, most in far worse shape than me, away to a hospital on the other end of the city that had remained untouched.

The doctor there was exhausted. Her hair was once in a bun but was now hanging in her face, while one side remained in a shape that resembled the original bun. Still, though, it did not break her spirit. Her smile had lost its glow but not its warmth.
“I think someone should be examining you, doctor,” I said as she examined my newly acquired stitches and cast.

She grinned wide, “That is probably true, but no time for that now. We are packed and some of my peers were unfortunately killed in the disaster. We can’t save everyone, but I sure as hell will try.”

“What was that thing, doctor?”

“Nobody knows. What little bit of news I’ve heard said that the government is baffled, but had little time to prepare once it was spotted on their radar deep in the ocean,” she said as she sat on the edge of my bed, attempting to fix her hair. She groaned as she lifted her arms but I stopped her.

“Don’t worry about this. I’ve got you. As I said, doctors also deserve to be taken care of.”

She obliged. I fixed her hair into a semi-neat braid. It was long and wavy, reaching midway down her back.

“You have such beautiful hair. I’m jealous.”

“Thank you,” she said, smiling once more. “I’m sorry to rush, but the city needs me,” she said sheepishly. With that, the door clicked behind her, and I was left alone with only the beeping equipment as company.

I turned on the television for the first time and clicked over to a news station. On it was nothing but fire and chaos. My section of the city had been reduced to piles of rubble. They showed photos of the beast as well; its crocodile-like face filled the screen—a nightmare made reality. The massive maroon-red eye glared as if it knew the camera had been looking at them, its slit-shaped pupil tiny and focused.

Following that, they played a clip of it spewing acid from its mouth, resulting in a building collapsing within seconds. People fleeing around the beast's feet resembled ants, and were being stepped on or swiped away by its gigantic tail - the beast had no patience with us human pests. They then broadcast a clip showing a closeup, a rather gross one for cable news, of it squashing people underfoot, some of them popping out a congealed mass of human innards.

The beast spewed more acid onto a group of soldiers, their vehicles parked in formation, but they stood no chance. Their guns and missiles had little effect on the creature’s thick hide. The military vehicles melted into humps of goo, and the soldiers who hadn’t immediately been evaporated, were running around like scared rodents.

They reported that the government had tracked the beast near the Mariana Trench but had lost it beyond that point. Congress had just finished voting and the decision was that nuclear weapons would not be deployed. I wondered what else we could use to stop such a thing from attacking again.

My cast is itchy. They gave me a long wooden thing to scratch with, and that helped, but God forbid I accidentally hit a stitch with it. All in all, though, I escaped with a broken leg, a broken nose, and seventy-eight stitches in total. My apartment, all my possessions, and two dead cats are all gone – I am left with nothing. Even the clothes I had been wearing were torn so badly that the hospital disposed of them and left me in a paper gown. My parents live halfway across the country and I’ve decided that once I am discharged, I will join them to get as far away from this place as possible.
Oh shit.

No.

No, I’m not.

The ground is shaking again and the sirens have started too.

Fuck!

They’re evacuating the hospital!

I have to go.

If you’re reading this, please, stay away from the Pacific coast!
