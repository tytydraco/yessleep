It’s a new day. It’s not [better than yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2cqy2/i_am_a_banisher_the_snails_are_holding_on_but_i/).

I woke up to movement under my shirt. Not *on top of*, under. 

Something slow and cold, dragging itself across my stomach, then another further up, then a dozen more.

For a little while, I was too dazed to move. Definitely too tired to be scared. Just a little confused and uncomfortable, trying to wrap my head around what the heck was going on. Then, I felt the little teeth-things of each and every one, all at once: tiny little ribs, chewing or kissing or whatever that was in rhythmic motions all over my torso. 

I sat up so fast the room spun and black dots danced in my line of vision. As I stood up, they poured out: dozens of them, maybe hundreds. *Snails*. Sliding, chewing, mumbling motions with their mouth-bodies. A living, glistening tide, covered in slime both wet and dry.

It’s impossible to describe exactly what it feels like, to be covered in snails like that. *Wrong* is probably the closest, *disgusting* a contender. I swear I could hear the soft clicks of their shells knocking together as I stood up, the tiny wet pops as their suction let go. Skin, against my skin. The trails cool and sticky and tacky, and you can *feel* it drying. You can smell them, and their disgusting slime. Cold and earthy, damp needles on leaf-covered ground and dirt after rain, slightly sweet underneath.

I ran. The shirt hit the floor with a wet *thump*, bringing most of the snails with it. Then my pants were off, then the rest strewn about as I made my way into the bathroom. I frantically scratched and dusted them off with my hands, each soft pop a new kind of torture mixed with the sound of them hitting the ground behind me. I made it into the shower, and as I stood there shivering in the morning cold and reached for the shower knob I—

The pipes. 

What if that’s where they came from?

What if I turned the water on and it was just *snails*?

So, I stood there for a longer than acceptable amount of time with my hand outstretched, tiredness like sand in my eyes, contemplating.  Waiting for something. I don’t know what.

Finally, I twisted the handle, still expecting a torrent of slime and shells and crunch and clicks to come raining down on me, but there was just water. Cold as shit, but just normal water. Clean. I stayed for a long time, with my hand on the temperature knob, turning it up every few seconds until the water was burning my scalp and back, leaving my skin raw and red.

As I made my way back through my apartment, the snails were exactly where you’d expect them to be, I think. Not static in place, but not very far away from where they had been violently thrown off, either. It was most obvious around my bed, and the soggy shirt on the floor. A couple of dozen snails of varying sizes were scattered around, most of them centralised close to the shirt, a few further off. A yellow and black striped one had made it the furthest, its little eye-things curiously pointing out as it was munching its way up my nightstand.

As I flicked it off, reaching for my phone, the idea hit me that I had *definitely* seen that fucking snail before. I let my eyes wander back down, traced the pattern on the shell. A soft spiral of colours. I stared at it for a long time, trying to take in any detail. Any discrepancy, anything *unique*.

I don’t think snails come in a lot of variations, to be fair. Not these “normal” ones. I can’t really quantify this, but that fucker, I had definitely seen him before. The *exact* same one, and I am unhealthily certain this is true. 

I did what anyone in my position would do. I grabbed a black marker from my nightstand, forcibly plopped him into a small glass dish I keep spare batteries in, and drew a large dot on his side. An identifiable splotch, definitely not meant to be there. If I am wrong, well, nothing lost. If I am right? I don’t know. I really don’t.

I collected a handful more of varying colours, dotted their sides numerically. Two, three, four, five dots. Then, I threw them out the window. Didn’t even feel bad about it. Good riddance.

I washed my hands thoroughly, then went back for my phone. I had a new text message from Henning, but honestly it wasn’t very helpful. Part of it is probably due to what I sent him last night, which in hindsight reads as crazy ramblings about snails. Don’t know how much he could do with that.

Handlers are… what they are. Part therapists, part dispatchers, part insurance adjuster. They just kind of, show up, when you’ve seen enough. There’s just a text message or a call one day, matter-of-factly. They are useful most of the time, though. Connecting us lower peasants with the other departments, even if hardly ever directly. 

They disappear in the same manner they appear, by the way. One day the texts just stop, their numbers not reachable. *The number you have tried to reach cannot take your call right now*. I don’t think it’s anything nefarious, by the way. I think it’s just retirement.

Okay, I guess that sounds *very* nefarious. I mean in the sense that, there’s only so much a person can take. There will be things that get to you, and I assume the handlers work the same. Since it’s all assignment based, to the best of my knowledge at least, it makes sense. One day you just, stop.

Not Henning, though. He’s been with me for over six years, and even though he’s… the way he is, he’s *really* good.

Well, normally. The text message wasn’t that useful, like I said. 

“Never heard of ghost snails. Can reach out to the archive and ask. Doesn’t sound related to the assignment though, so you probably fucked up.”

Thanks, I guess. I wasn’t expecting any follow-up questions or reassurance, not really his thing, but I felt a bit offended he insinuated quite bluntly that I’d somehow let a haunting hitch a ride home in my backpack, and the undertone that I tend to fuck up (not true, by the way). 

Still, one line stuck with me. *Doesn’t sound related*. I told you I haven’t really ever heard of “ghost snails” (I think I prefer trans-dimensional snails, by the way), but maybe the *snail* problem can be broken down into simpler parts. Maybe it’s not about snails at all. 

So, while I had breakfast I brought out my collection of notebooks, trying to find any cases that shared *something* with this… situation. Tried to define the problem.

There are snails. They act like, well, snails, except for the fact that they are appearing randomly in my apartment. I’ve crushed a few, and that didn’t seem to change anything in either direction. They don’t seem to care about the iron or salt in the doorways, but I figure I can’t be certain yet. It’s possible the snails are *the same* snails, and that probably changes things. Or, maybe I am just going crazy. It sure feels like it.

The more I tried to break it down, the more almost all of my previous cases feel like they shared some similarity, so I tried to focus on one thing at a time. Snails, like most things, need to follow the laws of physics, in the case they *are* normal snails. They shouldn’t just, appear out of nothing, yet that’s what they’re doing.

I had a case that was semi-similar in that sense, things appearing out of seemingly nowhere. I am a bit embarrassed to share, but I have it noted down as “The Things That Stayed Behind” in my notebook. I can be poetic when I want to be, I guess. I’ll try to stay concise as I tell you about it, maybe you can help me connect this crap into something more useful. I have *nothing*. Here goes.

It was maybe eight years ago, before my knees started sounding like un-oiled hinges.

A university town in the middle of the country, known for its state-of-the-art archeology program and its ludicrously expensive coffee. My then-handler Jessika connected me with the curator of a small regional-items type museum, running shop outside of the city centre. Items shown were mostly stuff taken from the excavation site a few miles outside of the city, an old and semi-preserved bronze-age settlement found several years prior when some company had blown open the side of a mountain to lay roads. Jewellery, blobby figurines, broken sword pieces. That kind of stuff. Just remnants, mostly nothing known about them except the age and type of item.

This case was marked as suspicious from the get go. The museum wasn’t doing too well, and had done its own little job spreading rumours about haunted or holy items to try and gain traffic. I think whoever summarised the assignment to begin with thought it was a big bowl of nothing, and that reflected on the commission. My dad had just passed away, though, and I was trying to keep busy at this time, so it was perfect for me. 

The curator, I think his name was Sven, said things had begun appearing inside the display cases. Things that were *not* part of the collection.

It had started small: a cheap ring, discoloured green, or a broken watch. A single leather glove, torn around the edges. Initially, Sven thought they were the victims of a prank of some kind. Either a visitor, or maybe one of the interns trying to spook the others.

But it kept happening, and the items weren’t as random as they first seemed. One day, a teacher touring the museum with her students saw her cashmere scarf used as a blanket for a curvy bronze figurine and lost her shit audibly enough to startle the curator. As she was telling her young students off, Sven became suspicious. The museum had just opened for the day, and he *knew* that scarf hadn’t been there when he had done the rounds that morning. The case was also *locked*, and at that time he was the only one with a key, safely around his own neck. A few days after, a woman made a police report as she saw her diamond wedding ring laying next to some chiseled and cracked bowl remnants, and I guess that’s when Sven reached out. Like I said, they weren’t doing well and getting written up for theft wasn’t exactly… well, needed.

When I arrived, the museum had been closed to the public for a week or so. Every case was sealed in plastic, but “new” objects kept appearing. Sven just left them there. No one saw them appear, and the curator swore he had slept in the building since they closed it and hadn’t heard a thing.  

“They just show up”, he said. I remember he sounded defeated. “Like they’ve always been here.”

I took his key, which he swore was the only one, and sent him home. 

It was a small place. Two floors, no basement. Every surface was clean, and the air smelled of old wood polish and pine. 

I did a full circuit, trying to feel for tethers. The sealed cases were normal enough, glass and plastic and laminated notes on the items inside. Each held a mix of the real artefacts — ancient pots, decorations, bronze and bone and wood — and the newer intrusions. An expired metro ticket. A disposable lighter with the plastic case half-missing. A cracked iPhone, black, old enough to *almost* be considered an antique itself. All tagged and displayed as carefully as if they had been dug up alongside the old stuff. 

I checked for drafts, traps, tricks. Nothing.

I stayed the night. The air inside got stale and warm. At this point, I could feel the tether, if ever so loosely. It was hard and rough, strung tightly. As the night passed, its pressure made the stillness feel like a facade, as if it was all staged for someone. I don’t know if it was for me.

Around two in the morning, as I was doing my fourth round, I found the anchor. I could *feel* the tether clearly, could almost taste the tension. A small gleam in the corner of my eye from one of the cases, and I knew it. I had found the anchor.

The reflection in the glass looked wrong: where it had been as meticulously polished as everything else in there, the glass looked almost double now. Between the two panes, smudges; soft and fatty against the slick surface, as of small fingers in the space between. It shimmered like oil when I moved around, giving the illusion that the smudges were prints, pressure points from somewhere else. As if there was a hand, right there, fingers pressed up curiously at the glass.

Only, it wasn’t looking at the artefacts from outside. It was looking at *me*.

The idea startled me enough to jump back a little, and when my eyes got back to the case the smudges were gone. Inside the case, nestled neatly between two knife fragments, a wallet. 

I recognised it instantly. The black, worn leather, a faint burn mark in the left corner where I had dropped a cigarette years earlier, sometime before, when I still went to the pub. 

I hadn’t carried that wallet in over a decade. Lost it sometime in my late teens, probably on a bus, never found it again. Now, there it was, behind the glass. With a neat tag, displayed flatly. Neat handwriting: Artefact 347B: Contemporary Personal Item. Donor unknown.

I unlocked the case. The key felt warm. With one hand clutching my protective charm in my pocket, I slowly opened the case with the other and reached for the wallet. The inside of the case was chilly. The moment my fingers brushed the worn leather, I felt it *pulse*. 

A slow, deliberate thump against the tip of my fingers, like something small and fragile and patient was beating inside. Waiting. 

I yanked my hand back. 

The air around me felt like it was shimmering with excitement. All the display cases vibrated softly in the waves, a deep and throat-less sound that rattled through the floor and into my bones. Every tag fluttered. For a second, all the bronze and bone and plastic and gold in the room shifted in place, like they *knew* they were not in the right place. 

Then, just as suddenly, silence. It felt as if I was breathing syrup, and I could hear my blood rushing in my ears. I looked down. The wallet was in my hand, now, my fingers tightly grasped around it.

The case wasn’t the anchor, anymore. The wallet was. The laminated tag was gone, replaced with a torn piece of paper, tied around the spine with a yellowed piece of string. It was blank.

It wasn’t pulsing anymore, but it radiated an uncomfortable heat that almost made my skin feel cold. 

I grabbed a small plank of willow from my bag, and ruthlessly spiked the wallet to the board with a thick iron nail. The head bit the board with a satisfying little moan of metal on wood. The wallet gave a little shiver, and I felt the eyes that had been burning into me from the case fade away. It settled fast, and the room felt less stuffy in an instant. 

Afterwards, I sat with my back against the case for a bit. Trying to settle myself, I guess. I don’t know what the presence was, but it hadn’t felt like the angry kind, nor vengeful in any way. If anything, the only *emotion* I had gotten out of the tether was *annoyance*. At me, and my actions. Like a stern parent scolding you for something when you should’ve known better.

I put the wallet and the plank into an envelope together with some cleanse, sprinkled a little salt on the glue before closing it. Straight to the archive with that shit; just needed a drop-off point. My phone was in my pocket. I called Jessika.

Straight to voicemail. I left a clipped message. Hey, it’s me, I am on this assignment, I think I solved it but I don’t know what it was. That type of stuff. I told her about the *donor unknown*, and that the anchor was secured. To please call me back so I can get rid of it.

I tried again at four, at five, and finally at six. When I felt confident enough that I didn’t feel any remnants of the tether, I left. 

Since it was still early, I drove by Sven’s house and just put the key in his postbox, left a post-it next to the door. Good enough.

With the envelope on the passenger seat, I stopped for coffee I didn’t really want three times. By the last traffic light out of town, the smell of hot milk made me so nauseous I almost threw up.

Back at the hotel, I jotted some quick notes down: the date, what I touched, what happened. I underlined “Donor unknown” several times, drew a bad sketch of a hand with long fingers in the margin. Then I closed the book and moved on, because that’s what we do.

Jessika never did call me back. 

I got a new handler, of course. In due time. Got that stupid envelope dropped off. I don’t know what happened with it after that, bit above my pay-grade. 

The case did stick with me, though. I guess most of them do, in some ways. Small bruises on my soul. 

What gets to me is that I am pretty sure the anchor was *moved*. For me. I don’t know why.

But yeah, I think Henning may be right. The snails are not related to the “Lady of Death” or whatever, no more than I am related to the museum and the random shit that appeared there. This *isn’t* about snails. It’s about the anchor.

I turned around in the dark because this took a lot of time to write and I had that feeling I was forgetting something stupid and domestic, like a light on somewhere or a tea cup. The painted snail was back.

Halfway up the nightstand, right where I had scooped him up this morning. Unbothered. Same shell color, same little blotch on the side, now a little smudged into the yellow and black pattern.

I don’t know whether I should be angry, relieved or terrified at this point. Honestly, I just feel defeated. I am only certain of one thing as of right now: That the fucker came back, and that he somehow knew *to put himself where I would definitely see him.*
