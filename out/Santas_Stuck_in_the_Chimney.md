My sister and I woke up before the sun on Christmas morning.

I had to push her to make her stop snoring. We shared one bed, our feet cold on the floor when we climbed out. I held onto her hand, it was cold and wet and sticky.  We ran into the living room.

“I want, ummmm I want a barbie and um a barbie house but a big big house. Oh and I want actually two barbies so our barbie’s can play with eachoffer” my sister whispered.

She was only a year younger than me, and we were both in the first grade at the same time.

When we looked in the living room it was too dark to see anything. I tried to turn the light on, but I couldn’t reach good. 

I jumped real high and hit it. 

**smack!**

We didn’t have a tree, well not a real one anyway. It was *almosssst* a tree.  Mama made it all by herself using taped up paper towel rolls and green tissue paper she saved from my birthday present. Mama said it was because trees belonged in the nature. That it wouldn’t be nice to take them away from their families. I thought she was very nice for that.

We looked at the tree super excited- except- *except there was nothing under it.*

I smacked my head with my hand like I saw Mama do some time. 

*Santa must have hidden the presents real good.*

We checked for gifts hiding away in the corners of the house. Opened up the closet, looked inside the dark dusty fireplace, and checked under the smelly couch cushions. 

They weren’t under there but Sissie found a piece of chocolate- I let her eat it because I was being nice and it was Christmas.

After twenty minutes I ran into the only other room in the apartment. That’s what we called our house. It was still all dark out, my uncovered feet pressed against the carpet. My toes were cold and tingly feeling but my socks had holes in them and I wanted to save them for later. 

I pushed mama awake a few times. She must have gotten home from work only a hour ago. She worked as a “server” at something called a bar. That meant she helped everyone eat yummy food. Sometimes she’d bring some home for us. Those were special nights where everyone would laugh more. Mama wouldn’t look so sad and she would smile with her pretty teeth.

Mama woke up, she was still sleepy.

“Mama I think Santa put the gifts somewhere tricky. They’re not under the tree or in the tv room or in the fireplace. I even checked the fridge!”

Mama’s face got all scrunched up. Her eyes looked wet. She made a *“mhm”* sound to get the crusties out of her voice. 

Her voice was a tiny little whisper. *Like she was in trouble.*

“Baby I think Santa got lost this year again, he tried very hard to come. He was trying all last night but I.. I mean he couldn’t- *he couldn’t find us again.*”

My eyes starting burning. I felt embarrassed like the time I had an accident at school in my big girl clothes. My face was all hot and my throat felt tight like I wanted to cough really hard. 

**Santa got lost again.**

⸻

The rest of Christmas felt bad. I felt like I was grounded for something I didn’t do. My sister cried the whole entire day. 

Mama told me not to cry or I’d make Sissie sadder, and to be a good girl.

She said if I was extra nice this year Santa would definitely find us next time. That he’d feel *all my goodness* and our apartment would **glow up** for him nice and bright.

I didn’t cry in front of them like Mama asked. Instead, that night, I covered my head with a blanket so Santa wouldn’t see. 

And then I cried myself to sleep.

⸻

Going back to school the next week made my tummy feel funny. I remember sitting in class the day after Christmas vacation ended. I was surrounded by kids wearing big new jackets, pretty furry boots, and holding onto each other as they argued over who got the best gift. 

Steven bragged about his new walkie talkies. Mary, a girl who always teased me for wearing the same clothes too many days in a row, got a Barbie Dream House with a pink car.  Rachel got a real life puppy. She said it looked like Snoopy.  She named him Santa.

I had my head laid flat down on the desk. Sissie wasn’t here with me and I was happy she was out sick. Because she would probably be crying again.

Someone poked me hard on my back. It kind of hurt. Then they asked me, “What did you get from Santa?” 

I felt like everyone in the room got all quiet. Like someone asked me a secret.

I kept my head down. Then I did something bad. Something really really bad. 

**I lied.**

“I got a Barbie Dream House, and I got **two whole Barbies** and a car, and clothes for them too.”

I thought my voice sounded funny. Someone said, “Wow you’re so lucky”. Another one said, “Score!”.  But then Mary opened her big mouth. 

“She’s lying. Santa wouldn’t have gotten her more stuff than me. Her mommy told my mommy she didn’t think Santa could even come to their place this year.”

And my face got hot again, and my throat hurt like I was sick, and I didn’t say a single thing. 

Because the truth was that I wasn’t good enough this year for Santa. He couldn’t find my house because it didn’t *glow enough.* 

My house that was too dark and too small and my tree that didn’t have lights because it was only made out of paper.

⸻

That was last year though. I’ve been extra good this year. I wrote a letter to Santa in class all by myself today too. 

**“Dear Santa,**

**I haf  been very gud this  yeer. I do nott effer fite with mi  sister. i all ways  help mama with cleeninng and i do alll off mi hoom werk. can Yu plez come to our apparments .? it will bee so brite in ther so yu can c itbetter. Sissie will b so sooo sad if yu get lost again.**

**Serrrsly**
**thank yu and i love yu soo much”**

Sissie wrote one too but hers just asked for chocolates and a puppy. 

When I gave mine to the teacher her face got all sad. She said that Santa would definitely find our house this year and she would talk to his little helpers for us. She told me all of our letters were going to be mailed right to the North Pole!

She gave mine a stamp  with a candle on it and mistletoe. I hope that doesn’t mean I have to kiss someone. But she said the candle would make my letter shine bright and she patted my hair.

⸻

The days after flew by so fast but I was excited. I had a plan for Santa this year. 

Now it’s the night before Christmas. Mama is home. We had yummy food tonight, she called it “meat loaf” and she got it from her work. It smelled like bacon and hamburgers and it tasted like “heaven”. That’s what Mama said anyways. 

Mama was smiling a lot and showing her teeth. That’s how I knew it was a real smile and not a lie one.

“Are you girls excited for Santa this year?” she asked all smily.

Me and Sissie looked up at her. I smiled back. 

“Yeah, because I know a way to make sure Santa finds us this time!” 

Mama smiled, she brushed my hair out of my eyes. “I don’t think you need to worry about that this time sweetheart, okay?”

I felt all warm inside. I already knew I didn’t have to worry about it! My plan was going to work.

When Mama went to bed early she said she had a “headache”. It meant her head was maybe going to explode I think. She always said it felt like that.

Sissie went up to bed right after. She said she wanted to sleep so Santa could come sooner. It was snowing outside and dark out. But the flakes looked pretty. 

I sat on our smelly couch and I waited.

I waited until the house was super duper quiet. I closed Mama and Sissie’s door and locked them real good. I hid the keys under the couch cushions. I didn’t want them
to wake up and ruin the surprise. 

Then I grabbed all the candles in the house.  I found newspapers and something called “bills” and some of my homework with bad grades that I was saving for Mama’s smily days. 

I put the Christmas music on from earlier, it was loud but not too loud. Just enough so Santa could hear. They were going to be so happy when they woke up. 

I looked into Mama’s purse. Bingo!  I pulled out her lighter with the smily face and hid her smokies too.

And I got to work.

⸻

After I finished the room was *so bright*. It looked like the lights were on! I was tired. I did a lot of work but it was worth it.

I don’t remember falling asleep on the floor, all I remember was the warm big fire in the fire place. The candles all around the room, making the house glow. 

And I knew that Santa wouldn’t get lost this time.

⸻

I woke up a little after. I don’t know how long I slept. But I woke up because I was too hot. The air felt funny, my throat was burning and the room was a little too bright. 

**Whoa.** The room was *way* too bright. I tried to cover my eyes. I couldn’t see for a second. 

There was the sound of a monster roaring, it almost covered the Christmas music. It felt windy but like windy in the summertime. Hot and dry and strong.

I opened my eyes  again, this time peaking through my fingers. 

**The room was on fire. It was big on fire.**

I felt scared. Really really scared. I was sweaty and my eyes were burning so bad.

My heart was thumping all funny, too fast and some of the beats started going missing like when Sissie would scare me. I started crying loud.

I wanted to run away, but I was still thinking of Sissie. And then I thought something sad, and bad, and all my fault. **Mama and Sissie were still sleeping.**

The doors were locked up. And it was all my fault. I needed to open Mama’s and Sissies rooms right now. 

I tried ripping the couch cushions off but they were so hot because they were on fire and my fingers were hurting.

Then I heard noises coming from the chimney. And I stopped. 

Because **something** was in there.

I heard screaming. Rustling, scraping of skin on brick. The yells were deep and angry sounding. The fire was shooting up and whoever it was couldn’t come down.

It smelled like meatloaf again. Like hamburgers and bacon. But this time it made me feel sick.

I could hear animals outside too. They must have been big and covered in bells because each time they neighed all loud like that I could hear chimes with the snorts and hooves.

And now I knew that something that was stuck in the chimney was *Santa* and he was on fire too.

I cried and yelled for help. The big fire moved down the hallway all by itself. I was so scared but I yelled until my voice went funny and my throat felt like it was on fire too.

Santa was screaming still. I was screaming too. I tried to open the front door but the doorknob burned my fingers. A black boot fell out of the chimney. There was meatloaf in it. 

It burned up real quick. 

⸻

A neighbor found me, the old lady across the street. She broke the door in and ran inside, her eyes were huge. She scooped me up from the floor and put me in the snow, she was screaming so much. 

It scared me. 

When the police and the firetrucks and the ambulances came I was still burnt and I smelled like meatloaf. I didn’t have any hair left, every time I moved pieces would fall down just like the snowflakes.

They put me in the big ambulance truck and the police asked me so many questions. They kept asking why I made the fire, why I locked Mama and Sissie up, how I could do that to them. 

I told them in my new *scratchy voice* that it was so Santa could find us. And I told them how he got stuck in the chimney and I think he got burned up. And I told them that he finally found us. And I asked if Mama and Sissie found him and left with him.

They looked at me not smily and some of them were crying.

They didn’t find Santa, they only found Mama and Sissie but they weren’t Mama and Sissie anymore. I heard one of the officers say that they looked like coal.

And then the ambulance truck left. I watched the glowing apartment get smaller and smaller from the weird bed I was in. I watched until it looked like a star. I saw Santa’s sleigh fly by over the star too. I tried to tell the ambulance people but they gave me a shot.

*And then I fell asleep.*

⸻

That was last Christmas. I live in a home now with lots of other sad kids. Some of them scream all day, some of them hurt each other, some of them hurt themselves. 

Now it’s Christmas today again.

That means it’s been a whole year without Mama and Sissie, without them in my new big house. I miss our stinky couch. I wish we still had our paper tree. All I want is to grow up so I can have a new family, a family that is just like Mama and Sissie. I’m always sad and I think I don’t like myself anymore but I don’t cry because Mama said to be good last time. 

But sometimes it’s hard to be good here. People are mean and it smells bad. And nighttime is scary. I have nightmares about a glowing house and smell that meat loaf stink. Sometimes I hear little bells tinkling when I’m trying to sleep in the crowded room. And sometimes I hear big animal hooves scratching at the window but I’m too nervous to look.

This morning I saw big boot prints around the outside of the house. It was all the same shoe. Then this afternoon I saw something moving in the fireplace for a second. It looked like an elf sort of but real ugly, its eyes were all red. It was making angry eyes, and snapped its teeth at me.

I ran and sat in the kitchen for the rest of the day.
 
Later, before sleep time one of the helper ladies in the house told me there was a big present for me upstairs on my bed. That it was sent from someone special. And it was just for me.

I didn’t care about presents anymore but I still opened it. I opened it because it had my name written all pretty. I opened it because it said it was from Santa.

Maybe it had a way to get Mama and Sissie back. Something that could make them not coal but real people again.

It was wrapped in golden paper. So bright it glowed against the dirty beige walls. I opened it slowly because my hands don’t work right anymore, the new skin is all tight and achey. I finally got it open and inside-

Inside were two pieces of coal.

**I was naughty last year.**
