I’m sorry for the lapse in updates; I hope that I didn’t worry anyone. I get that if my updates abruptly stop and you don’t hear from me regularly, you’ll probably assume the worse, so I’ll try to be better about that. Hopefully this update makes up for it, however: me and my selves have been busy, and we’ve learned a lot since I last posted.

My injuries from the house weren’t terrible by any means, but they were still enough to put me out for a day. This turned out to be fine since on our walk away from the rig, the tower light kicked on, and we had to book it back to safety for the time being.

Thankfully the angel’s needles were thin because it made cleaning and dressing the small punctures much easier, and it meant that they would probably heal faster. Other than the one on the top of my foot, the other wounds on my leg had mostly caught the muscley, fleshy part of my calf, and while too much pressure on it hurt, it didn’t seem like anything vital was damaged.

We sat in the tower in mostly silence over the next couple days while we waited for safety to return, each passing hour making my dread grow and grow. Every night that I lay down to sleep, I just kept fearing that I would be brought a dream of the beast lurking below. That it would finally see me and know where we are. I thought back to what the scientist had told me—about me being connected to the roots of this place—and can’t help but wonder why.

I know by this point that the shelf (and likely the abyss as a whole) is feeding on me, but I can’t seem to grasp how. Is my mere presence that strong? All I did was accidentally walk in through the back door of this place. I’d thought I would have had to interact with the rigs or tower or *something* that Kingfisher had set up in order to put this place into motion, but it seemed to have sprung to life all on its own.

Maybe those questions weren’t important right now. The ‘why’ might not necessarily matter if it doesn’t point me to a way out.

The monster that showed up to keep us in the tower overstayed its welcome by nearly 3 days until another creature came scuttling up the cliffs and tore that first one apart. It must have not been interested in sticking around after scoring what sounded to be a very large kill, and after a few more hours of it gorging on its prey, it left the shelf.

We returned to the body we’d been forced to wait to deposit to find it bloated and rotting, the stench even more unbearable than it was when we’d left it. Seeing the corpse in such a disheveled state made me worry that perhaps our time letting it sit may knock a few points off our score in this grizzly game we were playing, but it didn’t seem to affect anything. After feeding our newest corpse to the hungry maw of the chute, the gauge climbed another quarter of the way in satisfaction.

*I* didn’t feel satisfied. I felt sick as its whirring growl billowed up from deep in its guts, demanding that we bring it more. I felt dread tight in my chest knowing that it wanted us to dive deep into another rig to find more scraps to fill its insatiable belly. Most of all, I felt scared. Scared that I knew it was our only way out.

Then again, maybe it was fear that what we were doing *wasn’t.*

Either way, my sorrowful speculation was going to have to wait. Hope was already turned on her heels and heading onto our next clue.

“C’mon,” she beckoned eagerly, “I think this is major.”

“God, Hope, this better be worth our time,” Ann sighed, “We just lost a shit ton of time waiting for that stupid *thing* to die. We need to double time it before Hensley has another dream and brings that ‘ill-boogyman’ thing to us.”

I narrowed my eyes at her and spoke curtly, “It’s not like I can control it. And besides, the scientist said that we’re in its web. If it’s going to sense us, I think just *being* here is enough.”

“All the more reason we need to not waste time.”

“Well, the only other thing we could be doing right now is more body scraping, so this is sort of our best bet…” Hope told us softly, not wanting to stir the pot, “Until the next rig shows up, we’re dead in the water.”

“No, we aren’t,” Ann rolled her eyes, “We should be working on getting to the top of the cliff. By the time we get up there and grab the next body, I’m sure the last one will be here.”

Hope looked nervously over her shoulder at the cliff and frowned, “Ann, I know you think we could get up there with ladders and anchors, but I don’t know if it’ll hold. That catwalk is really high up, and once we got one bolted to the wall, how would we even get the next ladder up to keep it going?”

“We’d do it carefully and methodically. There’s four of us; two wait at the top, the other two pass the ladder from below. Lift it, bolt it, rinse and repeat.”

“Yeah, I’m sure four malnourished, cancer-ridden bodies have the strength required to do that for—what, five ladders up?” I couldn’t help but snicker, eyeing the space keeping us trapped.

Ann’s face bloomed frustration, and she huffed away from Hope and I, “Look, criticize all you want, but you two *know* we’re going to need that fourth body; you saw the gauge. Eventually, we’re going to need to get up there, and if we don’t do it now while we have time to kill, we might not have time when we need it most.”

“Well, let’s check this out first,” Hope pursed her lips, “I agree with you, but if there’s a way up there that can spare us the danger, I’m sure we’d all prefer that. Maybe there’s a clue here that can help us get the main door open so we can access the elevator.”

I could see that Ann wanted to argue, but she swallowed it down, knowing that it was pointless.

“How’d you find this place anyway?” I asked, trying to dispel some tension, “Weren’t you two going to the cliff door to try the code? How’d you end up at the motel?”

“Well, we were, but then something stood out to us. When we asked about the laptop, the scientist brought up ‘research A’, remember?”

“Yeah, and?” Ann urged.

“You found the laptop in the radio tower, remember? Research A isn’t the station.; It’s what the vending machines were marked as.”

“Do you think he misspoke?” I questioned.

“It wouldn't have been unlikely, but we decided to come over here ourselves and look,” Hope told us as we finally reached the motel courtyard. We breezed past the vending machines toward a pass through behind them and continued down the dark corridor to the back of the building. As we moved, I followed the wires on the wall that seemed to run from the vending machines.

“We never really looked back here, and even if we did, I don’t think we would have thought anything out of the ordinary, but look—”

Hope walked down the alley behind the structure, leading us by the light of her flashlight until coming to a stop before a door. She was right; even if we’d seen it before, we wouldn’t have thought much of it. It was just a plain, metal barrier; the kind you’d see of maintenance doors or back entrances into a place of business. The one thing that set it apart was the familiar keycard reader next to it, a small red light gleaming in the dark.

“Holy crap,” I muttered.

Hope smiled, “It makes sense now that I think about it. If this was a ‘research’ point, why would they not have a base of operation here too?”

“That was some good thinking,” I told her, slipping my hand into my coat and withdrawing the keycard.

“It wasn’t me who figured it out. June did.”

Me and Ann turned in surprise to our fourth shy companion who had been silently paddling along with us till this point. With new eyes on her, she darted her own away and shrugged, “It just seemed weird to me."

I smiled at her, “Well, good job. Hope was right; this could be major.”

“Do you think it’s another room like the rigs?” Ann chimed in.

“It could be. Although this door doesn’t seem as extravagant as those ones.”

“It could still be dangerous though,” Hope reminded us, “We should be careful.”

I nodded, then pressed the keycard up to the reader. With a small beep, the LED switched green, and we heard something in the door unlatch.

Ann grabbed the handle and tugged, swinging the slab open with a grunt. The outside appearance was definitely misleading—it was a lot denser and sturdier than the usual hollow service door. On the other side of the gate was a concrete staircase leading down into a basement—thankfully this one was not suspended above an abyss.

Ann and Hope led the way, leaving me to walk behind with June. I listened to her shallow breathing next to me as she stepped deeper, and could hear the fabric of her hoodie crumpling as she anxiously fidgeted with it. There was a slight rhythm to it.

*Scritch—scuff—scuff—scritch—scuff—scuff—*

The pattern rang familiar in my ears. When I was younger, it was something that I always did when I was anxious. A sort of nervous tick I’d developed. I used to do it so much that some of the edges of my clothes began to tatter on the sides by my hips. It was something I kicked after Mom died; my anxiety going into hibernation for those first few numb months before reemerging as apathy. After that, there was no need for any of that anymore. I didn’t really get anxious like I used to.

That’s why I found it interesting that June was still doing it. Neither Ann nor Hope exhibited any of those habits, but we were all certainly scared and anxious all the time. It brought me back to what I had been wondering about my fourth self before we dove back into the house.

I couldn’t quite place what part of me she was supposed to be. It was more than my fears, it was more than my insecurities; it was something deeper than that.

The contemplation would have to wait, though.

As we reached the bottom of the steps, Hope dowsed her light to ensure that nothing potentially down here might see it. As she did, we noticed a soft flickering glow from within the space ahead, accompanied by an undulating electric buzz. We all waited in absolute silence to see if anything else would make itself known, but when the coast seemed clear, Hope kicked the beam back on and stepped fully around the corner.

What was waiting was not another brutalist control room like at the rigs. This one was still mostly concrete, but it was much more homely. Where we stood was a bit of an entrance area with a few benches and an ‘L’ of dividers that drew its boundaries. Beyond were a little under a dozen desks, all cluttered with papers and adorned with little baubles and desk ornaments. There were pictures hung on the cubicle walls along framed degrees of status and education, and at each station, a computer sat dormant, their lifeless screens casting our flashlight glow back at us.

Beyond the office area, we could see what looked like a break nook complete with couches and a small kitchen. It, too, was gussied up with color and fake plants, giving much needed life to the decaying area, but with nobody around to give the abandoned memories context, it only left behind a chill in the air.

The buzzing that we’d heard was coming from something on the floor a few cubicles away. A light flickering up from the floor as it tussled with its own mortality. It was the only glow in the space other than our own beam, so we moved in toward it.

It was a desk lamp that had been turned on, then knocked to the floor. Based on the other things around the work area that had been knocked to the ground, it looked like whoever last visited here turned the place over in a hurry. There weren’t any other cubicles that we could see in such disarray, so clearly this one held importance, but it was pretty easy to solve for why. The computer here was missing, and there was a name tag laying by the leg of the roller chair nearby. Ann turned it over with her foot, then clicked her own flashlight on.

*S. Shae.*

“I can’t believe this has all been down here this whole time,” Hope said, pivoting in place to take in the massive room once more.

“I can’t believe you two never thought to check around the motel for anything,” Ann scoffed, “Those vending machines are one of the three points of interest on this whole plateau; how did you not poke around more?”

To my shock, Hope got a bit defensive, “Well, we were a lot more overwhelmed figuring this place out when we first arrived, Ann. Sorry that between the monsters and the fragments of the past appearing out of thin air that we didn’t think to comb every alley of the town.”

“I’m not saying you had to do that, I’m just saying that it seems like a pretty obvious place to dig deeper into.”

“You didn’t think to do it until now either.”

“Yeah, well, I haven’t had a lot of downtime to think since you puked me up, remember?”

“June was born later than you, and she still figured it out.”

“Guys, hey, chill—it’s fine,” I cut in, shutting both of them down.

Ann immediately shrugged off the spat and bent over to pick up the flickering lamp, but I caught Hope’s eyes. She looked a little embarrassed at the outburst even though she didn’t raise her volume in the slightest. Compared to how I can usually get, she handled that gracefully. Still, I noticed that since our last call with the angel, her patient demeanor hasn’t been as strong with Ann as it usually is.

My third clone set the lamp back on the table, then using her wadded sleeve for cover, grabbed the blub and give it a slight twist. The orb finally stopped its incessant buzzing and went steady, its light growing more confident.

“So this was Shae’s desk?” She noted before running her thumb over several stacks of papers, “It looks like somebody was already here looking for answers too.”

“It was probably that Juarez guy,” I said, pointing to the vacant spot where there once was a computer, “That must be why he had the laptop back at the radio station. Everyone we’ve talked to about him so far says that he screwed them over; maybe once he left them to die they thought they’d find answers here.”

“Well, judging from the fact that they didn’t seem to have the computer unlocked when you found it, I’m going to assume they didn’t find what they were looking for.”

“We should still check again,” Hope nodded, picking up a stack of books from a cubby on the cubical wall, “Maybe they missed something. The password to the computer, or a clue.”

“Oh, really? I thought we were just going to immediately leave after finding this place,” Ann jeered.

Hope gave her a disappointed glare.

Together, the four of us began shifting through the space, much more methodically than whoever did before us. I would have thought that a scientist would have done the same, but as I imagined Juarez rushing back here and creating the mess that we were currently cleaning up, I began to get the sense that maybe he didn’t have the luxury of time like we did.

Apparently, our method wasn’t helping because we weren’t having any more luck than it seemed he did. We opened any container we could find, we skimmed through every page of every notebook left behind, hell, we even checked for false bottoms to the desk drawers, all with no luck. Hope and June began to bleed out of the cubicle and look into other ones as a last resort, but I stayed put on the floor before Shae’s desk. If there was an answer, I knew it had to be here.

The sense I got from the man who had somehow deceived everyone he worked with was that he was meticulous, and he would keep his secrets close.

I had just finished fully ripping the last drawer of the desk loose and turning it upside-down when I was finally ready to give up. We’d picked the meat of the area clean, and all that remained was a skeleton. With aching bones from sitting so long, I began to stand. Ann had already gone full 180 on this idea and was back to bitching about us running low on time, and I was in no mood to hear it.

I grabbed the edge of the desk for support, gripping my thumb around into the empty socket where the top drawer once was, then froze. The wooden top of the desk felt very distinctly different from what my extra appendage was feeling. I traced my thumb over the surface and found that I was feeling paper. There was something stuck to the bottom of the inside of the desk.

I ran my fingertips to the edge of it, then gently tugged, peeling the sheet loose. It had been there for quite a long time if the crackly sound of the glue peeling was anything to go by, and once I held it in my hand, a big smile graced my lips.

“Quit your moaning,” I snapped smarmily toward Ann, cutting her off mid sentence, “I think I got it.”

The girls all rushed over and looked down at the worn sticky note.

*IamChosen83\**

“Yes! Good find, Hen!” Hope patted my back.

“Guy had a bit of an ego problem, huh?” Ann snickered to herself.

“Well, considering he left his friends to die, I’d say that he definitely had a sense of self importance.” I nodded.

Ann didn’t say anything in response, but I saw her eyes lock to me in my peripheral before quickly darting away. We still hadn’t directly talked about what happened back when we were leaving the house, and I could tell she was still feeling awkward about the whole thing. As soon as I noticed it, I tried to quickly look up and smile. To show her that I hadn’t meant it as a slight toward her—I was only agreeing. Still, I was too late, and rather than calling attention to it, I just let the unspoken words fade into the background drone of the compound.

Hope hopped up excitedly and clapped her hands together, “This is great! This could be so huge! Do you know what might be on that laptop!? It could be the actual code to the door!”

I nodded, “Yeah, we should head back and see if it works. It’s possible that this password is wrong too.”

“Don’t say that!” Hope scolded, lightly swatting my arm with a pout.

“Hey, um, guys?” June called out, grabbing our attention. We looked up to find her standing a few feet away in the aisle of a cubical. Weakly lifting a hand, she pointed to the end of the room, “What do you think is this way?”

We each moved to join her, then looked where she was pointing. Around a small turn in the room, there was a wide corridor that we couldn’t see from the entrance. Hope and Ann both cast their beams into its maw, but the darkness within quickly swallowed it up. It went deep.

Wordlessly, we all moved a little closer, but I could tell the atmosphere it was giving off was making us a little antsy. When we still couldn’t see the hall's end, Hope turned her light to something beside it. Near the doorway, there was something interesting parked; a four seated kart with its nose pointing toward the tunnel.

“What the…” Hope pondered, moving closer.

“Must go pretty far if they needed a kart to travel it,” Ann noted.

I looked up toward the ceiling and scrunched my brow in thought. Biting my cheek, I drew a mental map of the town in my head before my eyes went wide and I spoke, “I think… I think that might lead to the main compound.”

My clones faced me.

Gesturing with my arms, I explained, “Well, if we entered back there, and the vending machines were facing this way, then that would make the cliff in the direction of that hall, and the door wouldn’t be too far off from there.”

I could see eyes go wide as my guess sunk in. Hope spoke first, “Wait, I think you might be right.”

“Well come on, what are we waiting for then?” tittered Ann, hustling over toward the tunnel and moving for the kart, “We’re already down here, we may as well see. Getting into that compound tops the laptop priority, yeah?”

None of us could argue. We went to join her as she was already in the car’s front seat and cranking the key, but we didn’t bother sitting down when we heard no sound.

“Damn it, it’s out of juice,” Ann grunted, “We’ll have to walk it.”

“Shouldn’t be much farther than the surface,” Hope said, looking at the ceiling, “If anything, it should be faster. Just a straight shot; don’t need to weave between blocks and alleys.”

“Safer too, hopefully,” June muttered next to me.

Ann jumped out of the kart then clicked her light back on, starting off down the hall. All of us followed.

We walked in a nervous silence for serval minutes, our footsteps echoing out into the dark as our eyes stayed glued ahead. Eventually, there was a change in the tunnel ahead; an alcove off in the right wall. As we got closer, we noticed another kart parked in the space, a staircase leading up to a platform, then another door.

“You think this is it?” June murmured from the back.

Ann shook her head, “There’s no way. We haven’t been walking long enough. Plus the hall keeps going.”

Stepping forward, I furrowed my brow and cocked my head, “No way… I wonder if…”

“Hensley, what are you doing? Get back here, whatever this is, it can’t be the cliff door.”

“I know,” I called back over my shoulder, “But it still might be useful.”

Climbing the steps and reaching the door, I swung it open and faced the stairs on the other side. The girls had already caught up to me by then, so I began to ascend without a word. At the top, there was another door akin to the motel one, so I scanned the keycard once more and opened it.

The door swung open into a stuffy dark storage room, but based on the type of equipment being stored, my theory was confirmed. I walked out of the closet and into a familiar hallway; the main corridor of the radio tower.

“Oh snap,” Hope said, “We’ve got a whole network of tunnels down there! I wonder if there are ones leading to the rigs?”

I pursed my lips, “Maybe, but I think we would have passed another break in the tunnel farther back if there was.”

“Well, we’re not going to find out if we don’t keep going,” Ann sighed in annoyance, “It’s great that we know about the passage now, but can we get moving again?”

“S-Shouldn’t we check the laptop while we’re here?” June quietly offered.

Ann rolled her eyes, “Why, are you scared to keep going?”

“Well, n-no, but I just thought that it might be useful. What if there’s something down there that we need to know about and the answer is on the laptop?”

“Well, then you can stay here and go check. We’re going to keep going.”

“Ann,” Hope warned with a glare, “We’re not leaving her alone.”

“Oh my God, Hope, she’s not a baby. She’s a grown woman, screw off.”

“Yeah, well, Hensley’s a grown woman too, and she still almost died the other day. Maybe we stop assuming that everything is going to be fine when things can go wrong at any minute.” Hope sternly accused.

Immediately, I felt a weight set over the four of us, and Ann eased off. I hated that Hope was throwing me in as an example and using the situation at the house as ammo, but the last thing I wanted to do was draw more attention to it. Trying to diffuse, I stepped toward June.

“I’ll stay with her. Ann was right earlier, we’re losing a lot of time. You guys can go walk the rest of the tunnel, and June and I can stay here to crack into the laptop. We can meet up in a bit and swap notes.”

Hope looked back to me, her expression going soft again, but she looked unsure, “Hen, I don’t know… last time we split up—”

“It’ll be okay. We should both be safe where we’re at.”

“Look, all of you can stay for all I care. I’m going back down,” Ann tossed out with a wave over her shoulder.

Hope’s head pivoted fast between Ann then us before finally letting out a sigh, “Alright, fine. But don’t you two *dare* go anywhere outside this building, okay?”

“You got it, Mom,” I jabbed playfully with a smirk.

It got one back from her, and with a caring nod, we both went our separate ways.

Upstairs in the room, my heart thundered as I pulled out the sticky note again and punched in the password. June hovered curiously over my shoulder as we both sat cross-legged on the floor. I held my breath as my finger hovered over the enter key before I finally got the courage to press it.

The relief I felt as the screen switched to a loading symbol was indescribable.

June and I each let out a little laugh of cheer as the system booted, then shared a look of joy with one another before turning back to the screen. The operating system on the device was one that I’d never seen before; most likely custom made, but it looked easy enough to navigate around.

Interestingly, it didn’t look like I needed to though. The computer had been locked with a screen already pulled up. A file named *personal logs* was opened that contained a bunch of text documents, the last one on the list still highlighted as if it was the most recent thing clicked on.

I turned to June, “Well, that’s convenient.”

 She furrowed her brow, then pointed, “This last one is dated a year ago. Do you think that’s how long ago they were here?”

I joined her curious look. How was that possible? Had nobody really come back here in a year to try and clean up their mess? Was time not working the same here or something? If it had really been that long, wouldn’t the bodies in the rigs be long dead? Was the machine somehow keeping them alive?

The thought made a lump form in my throat. The poor people sitting in comatose agony for a year straight. No wonder they were all so mentally vacant when we found them.

I suddenly had so many questions about the date now on top of the ones that had been piling over my time here. I figured that if anyone could give answers, it’d be the one who seemed in charge of it all. There was most likely more information elsewhere on the laptop, but we were already here, so looking to June, I asked, “You ready?”

She nodded, not looking away from the screen.

I clicked it open.

*I need to gloat for a moment. How can I not?*

*The most important step forward in the history of humanity—bigger than Sputnik and Apollo, bigger than any disease cure we’ve ever come up with or any element ever discovered—and they put ME in charge. Me. If that isn’t my devotion paying off, than I don’t know what is.*

*There were doubts along the way, sure. How could there not be? I gave over half my life to this organization, and there were certainly days—no, entire YEARS—when I wondered if it was worth it. All those lapses of no progress, all the failures and wasted attempts trying to break through, all of it was agony in the moment, yes. But now, seeing it all come to fruition?*

*Well, I’m not an emotional man, but it certainly brings tears to my eyes.*

*Now is no time to get ahead of myself, however. There’s still much work to be done, and this, too, can become yet another wasted attempt if we do not tread with caution. This place is magnificent. You can almost feel the ancient secrets buzzing through the silent air if you focus hard enough.*

*The town we chose took nicely. It’s an exact echo, 1:1. We did our best to leave as much of it untouched as possible to preserve its roots, and now all of our equipment is set. We have the rigs functioning, the drill stabilized, and today, we finally opened the gates. All that’s left now is to wait for our first tribute to see if our math is correct.*

*I can barely sleep, I’m so elated. My mind is buzzing with possibilities and implications, but perhaps I should stow those until we see what truly happens.*

*As much as we’ve tamed of this place, there is still far more that is unknown, and all of our trials and training mean nothing in the face of the real thing.*

Not much there other than learning a bit more about Shae. Clearly these people were at this project for years, but that was already known. I patiently wait for June to finish reading, exchange a concerned look with her, then open the next log, dated several months later.

*It’s been a while since I last wrote for myself. I’ve been so busy with my work and test report logs that I haven’t had time to update my personal records. Our first trial alone created enough paperwork (and headaches) to last me a lifetime. It went poorly, if that wasn’t clear.*

*The rigs took to the tribute, but we underestimated just how much the basin had taken to THEM. In their panicked state, the roots around town began shifting fast, and before we could get a handle on it, over one night, the whole place was nearly twisted into a labyrinth of their memories. Though I wanted desperately to remain and study this phenomenon, it was proving too dangerous.*

*There was other things cropping up in the folds of the manifestations; creatures that we’d never seen before. Based on what we observed, I hypothesized that these were also some sort of powerful manifestation that the tribute was plucking up from the roots, perhaps from their insecurities or fears. They seemed related to the spaces that were being produced, but some of them were hostile, and we could not remain when they began finding entrances into the research zones.*

 *HQ told us to shut it down before we compromised the entire operation, so we took what we could from it, fired up the drill, then jumped to a different instance. The good news is that we got plenty of imprint from the surge that the tribute provided, so we’re not short on jumps for the time being.*

*This town isn’t as flawless a copy as our first, but it’ll make due. I’ve already begun drawing up new plans to prevent this ordeal from happening twice, and I write now out of excitement. I think I finally have it.*

*The energy that runs through the roots of the Basin is clearly too strong for the rigs to process on their own. We need a filter of some kind to help take a bit of that weight off the systems. Luckily, I don’t need to engineer one. From the information I gathered from our trials and the last subject, the human brain makes for a flawless one.*

*If we can find a way to emulate a human consciousness and hook it into the rigs, instead of a tribute’s imprints spilling out onto the streets, the system should be able to sustain some of it. The subject would effectively be sharing some of their mental load across four other minds, and if the roots take well to this, any memories that sprout up should confine to the rigs alone. This way, we still are able to harvest the same level of imprint without compromising the drill.*

*All of this is easier said than done, however. We already know how to connect the human mind to the Basin; it's what got us here. The issue now is being able to replicate consciousness. With so much energy pouring through them, we’d burn through cores at a rapid rate, and they’d need to be easily reproducible. We barely have AI that can reach the same level of complexity as the brain, and technology is often unreliable. It breaks, it malfunctions, it short circuits.*

*A real brain doesn’t, so long as its blood is still flowing.*

*Besides, the roots would never take to a hunk of metal like that.*

*I’ve been having the rigs refitted over the last few months to accommodate for these new ‘filter cores’, but I haven’t specified to the engineers yet what exactly their details are. The census right now is that they’ll be mechanical in nature, but that won’t stick.*

*The more I look into it, the more impossible it seems. I need to make a call to the higher-ups and ask permission for something, but I fear it’ll cost me my job.*

*Then again, perhaps it’s a risk worth taking. After all, my devotion is what got me here; surely it will keep me safe. And besides, my position means nothing in the face of progress. If this is what needs to be done for us to break through to what lies below, then I’d happily give it all to have my name as even a footnote in the book of history we’re bound to write.*

A shiver ran through me as I finished the log, and June began her cloth fidgeting next to me as she neared the end. Both of us were somewhat speechless as we stared at the screen, and I was hesitant to click to the next file. My stomach was sick at the implications, but it did a full churn as June spelled it out.

“The bodies we’ve been finding then… the ones in the rigs…”

“Yeah…” I nodded with a swallow, “All our memories—Zane’s and the house. They were there because they… they were our filter.”

“Those poor people…” June whimpered, hugging her knees. After a beat, she asked, “The Basin… he keeps saying that. Is that what this place is called?”

“That’s at least what they called it,” I tell her. Uncertain myself, I ask, “You ready for the next one?”

She nods, and I click the log.

*It worked. My idea worked. The organization barely batted an eye at my request, and once I sent my math over, they were scrambling to get the cores built. They told me that as soon as I needed more, let them know. I’m not to let anyone here know how they work, however, and I wouldn’t dream of it.*

*There are still some here who are weak. Those who don’t realize that to achieve what we’re working toward, sacrifices must be made. It’s frustrating to have to work alongside them—them and their incessant griping. Their nagging. Their judgmental glances and hushed whispers in the break rooms. That’s why I am in charge, though, and they are not.*

*I am the one who will see this through. I am the one who will bring us to salvation. I am chosen.*

*Our first harvest after the cores were put in was an instant success. We got enough imprint to make another jump in less than a few weeks. The town is growing farther from what it once was back in our plane, but it hardly matters now. It’s clear that the roots prevail no matter how deep we go.*

*I feel that we’ll be there soon. We’ll finally find that ocean, and hear that voice in person that has been calling us onward all these years.*

*The problem now is the locals. The deeper we go, the more we’re running into unsavory types. Discarded refuse that lives in the cracks of the Basin’s roots. They won’t stop us; we have the technology to repel them, but we need to take extra caution going forward. We’ve had tunnels built between our main areas of operation to avoid outside contact, but unfortunately, this isn’t possible for the rigs. We’ve lost a few good people during shift changes already, so I’ll be coming up with a new system soon to avoid anymore risk on the matter.*

*All of that comes second to the harvest, though. We just need to hit the bottom. Once we do, none of this will matter anymore. None of the pain and suffering. It will all be made right.*

I didn’t stop to think more on that log. There was only one left, so as soon as June was ready, I clicked it.

*We were so close. So unbearably close.*

*We had it. In the palm of our hands—it was right there. Only a few more leaps, and I know we would have hit that ocean.*

*Did we dig the wrong way? Were we too reckless in our operation? I cannot fathom how it is we went wrong.*

*I know it’s out there. The being we seek—I sense her sleeping deep below. We’ve come this far, and it’s all been true; our faith. Our visions. It was all confirmed once we reached this place. All we needed was to make it a little further. And yet, for all of our fervor, for all of our devotion and work, we’ve been punished. We’ve been halted in our crusade.*

*Something emerged from the darkness a few days ago. Something that my brain can hardly fathom. Whatever it is, its magnitude nearly reaches the heights of the one we seek, but it’s intent—its very being; it is the antithesis of her.*

*Our defenses were nothing. Our technologies were sticks and stones in its presence. We stood no chance. It ravaged everything. Our servers, our power lines, our imprint reserves. It’s all in shambles.*

*Most of the researchers here with me were swallowed up by it. It grabbed them while they screamed in terror and flailed about, but little did that do. Like blood filled grapes, it popped them between its mighty jaws, drinking their essence and consuming their being.*

*The worst part was in the aftermath. As I hid myself away and waited for it to pass from this place, I could still hear them. Their screams and their pleas. Not in my mind—no, that would be preferable. They were one with it now. People I knew, people I worked beside every day for the last decade, whispering words of madness from within that unknowable mass.*

*I don’t know how it didn’t find me. I don’t know what spared me from its all-seeing search. When I emerged, however, to take in the aftermath, I found that I wasn’t alone.*

*A few other researchers and a couple engineers are still alive here with me, but that hardly matters. We’re stranded now here upon this shelf. As I said, we have no imprint reserves to make the jump back to the surface, and no resources to gather more.*

*With our combined efforts, we were at least able to get the tower's defenses back up and running, alongside a bit of comms equipment—enough to get a signal topside. I sent a message out to HQ explaining the situation, but they had no response. I fear that with things so dire, they don’t want to risk recovery, lest they release whatever it is we found.*

*The fools.*

*Giving up so easily. Shying away in fear. They know as well as I do that we were sent to find results, and now that we’re so close, they shy away like a hurt dog seeing a raised hand? Once again it falls to me. Once again I am the only one with the strength to do what must be done. I see that now; that I always have been.*

*You see, the more I think about this creature that writhed up from below, the more I come to a conclusion. This was our final test. This was our final trial to see if we were truly worthy of what lies below. Well, I have never been one to shy away from a challenge.*

*I am going to get out of this place. I’m going to escape and return home to those pompous cowards back behind their cushy desks. I’ll take this all the way to the top, and once the ones in charge hear about what was done here, they’ll put ME in charge of ALL OF IT. They’ll see that I’m the only one able to overcome this miniscule obstacle in our way, and get us to the one we seek.*

*It’ll take some work, but I have a plan. All I need to do is get the drill running again. According to the terminals at the tower, the rigs are still active, which means imprint can still be harvested. Our cores will be long spent by now, but that’s no matter. I designed them, and I know exactly how to hook a new one up.*

*As for the replacement filters? Well, I did say that I wasn’t alone.*

*Anyone I don’t need can rot here after that. They were all ones that never had true faith anyway. Dead weight if you ask me.*

*Besides, I know there’ll be more like them on the other side, and if I make it home, I can’t have word of the deeds I commit here following me through. Even I’m aware enough to know that I’d be ostracized for such a heinous crime.*

*It’s as I said here long ago, however. Sacrifices must be made.*

I’m sorry, but I’m out of room; I know it’s bad timing. It might be good to let you all marinate on that information, though. Lord knows I needed a minute to process it. I’ll give you more of my thoughts next chance I get to update but for now…

Well, for now, there’s a lot that I need to look into.
