We descended into the bowels of the earth with nothing but our flashlights and our wits. The cave system we were exploring had never been touched by human hands before, and we were eager to be the first to uncover its secrets. As we ventured deeper into the cave, the air grew colder and the walls began to twist and turn in unnatural ways.It was as if the cave itself was alive and trying to swallow us whole.We trudged on, our hearts pounding with both fear and excitement. We were all experienced cave explorers, but this cave was unlike anything we had ever encountered before. The darkness seemed alive, and at times we could swear we heard whispers coming from the shadows. We turned a corner and our flashlights illuminated a crevice in the cave wall.

"Holy shit," I breathed.

We squeezed through it, and found ourselves in a large chamber. As we stepped into the room, a putrid smell filled our nostrils. It was the stench of death.A sense of dread washed over us as our eyes adjusted to the dim light. There were bones scattered on the ground, and strange symbols etched into the walls.They looked as if they had been made by something not quite human, something written in an ancient language I had never encountered in all my days. Suddenly, we heard a sound that made our blood run cold.

It was a low, guttural growl, coming from deep within the cave. We shone our flashlights toward the source of the noise, and our breath caught in our throats. In the corner of the chamber, we saw movement. At first, we thought it was a trick of the light, but as our eyes adjusted, we realized that it was something else entirely.

Something that no one could have ever imagined. A writhing colony of eldritch horrors began to emerge from the shadows, their grotesque forms twisting and writhing in the dim light. They were unlike anything we had ever seen before, they looked like overgrown centipedes, but with too many tendrils, legs, appendages, and masses of feelers sticking out of their faces, and their eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. 

They moved with a fluidity that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. We tried to back away, but it was too late.The creatures had us cornered, and we knew that we were in for the fight of our lives. Pain and fear gripped me as I watched my friends fall one by one, their screams became deafening, echoing off the walls of the cave. I was alone, with nothing but the sound of my own heart pounding in my ears.One of the eldritch horrors lunged at me, its jaws snapping inches from my face. I managed to dodge it, but not before a long gash appeared on my cheek.

Blood poured down my face as I stumbled backwards, trying to gain some distance from the monsters. I could feel my strength fading as the creatures closed in on me.I knew it was only a matter of time before they would rip me apart too. I closed my eyes, bracing for the end, as somebody lit a flare gun into a pool of gasoline, sending a burst of flames and heat everywhere.I can't say for sure, but as I left I swore I saw a creature's eye in a cave chamber the [size of a car.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)
