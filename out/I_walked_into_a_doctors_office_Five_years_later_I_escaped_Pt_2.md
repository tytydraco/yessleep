When I woke again, I was alone. My arms and legs were now strapped to the bed. I could lift my head and shoulders but only slightly. I stayed quiet, fearing another sedation. I tried to take in everything. Was this truly a hospital? I knew everything felt wrong. Where were the rhythmic beeps of medical machines? Where was the bustle of daily hospital activity? There was no television in the room, no bathroom, no chair for visitors – nothing but the bed, the I.V. stand, and a small wooden wardrobe on the wall beside the thick metal door. Hospital rooms don’t have metal doors. They don’t have locks. I didn’t see the door when I first woke up. It opened outward.

I could not move my hands to reach the I.V. They ached when I tried to use them. My legs wouldn’t move at all. One of the bags connected had the same yellow substance from the office. There was another hanging next to it with a purple liquid. It seemed too thick. My brain struggled to shake off the haze, as I thought I saw the second bag move like there was something squirming inside it. The unbearably bright florescent lights hurt my eyes and caused me to see everything with a blank, white vignette. I heard footsteps outside the door and squeezed my eyes shut, feigning sleep. The rough clank of a metal lock, the slight groan of a massive door opening sent my heartrate into a chaotic sprint.

An ominous, low growl of a chuckle sounded an inch from my face, “Another nice try, Ms. LaFleur. You never seem to learn.” The breath was sickly, smelling both sweet and foul like rotting meat. The burn blazed in my arm once more and I sank into nothingness.

The next few days (was it days?) were a blur. Fish-bowl memories float to the surface then drift away. I was in and out of consciousness, only taking in snippets at a time. I would wake and not be able to open my eyes or the bed was now on the other side of the room (or in a different room?). The doctor stood at the foot of my bed, watching me with a hungry smile, enormous black pupils, leaning toward me, as a chef would lean over a pot to take in the aroma; the nurse talking about me to no one I could see. But mostly just seeing the cold, empty room.

There were other nightmarish images that haunted my feverish, drug induced fugue state: the doctor’s face contorting, elongating, and snapping back into place. The nurse turning her head all the way around without moving her body, like an owl. Screams that seemed both far away and entirely too close. The feeling of someone hovering over me, breathing hard.

I had no way of tracking passing time. There were no clocks, no windows. I could only guess by the length of my hair how long I had truly been there. It was just above shoulder length that night I went to the Urgent Care. My hair doesn’t grow quickly, but now it was nearing the middle of my back. Someone would come in occasionally to sponge me down, brush out my hair, clip my nails, and brush my teeth. I was usually unconscious for this routine, but I was waking up more often and staying awake for longer stretches. My mind was clearing, but I made every effort to show no signs of change. I remember the day I could feel my feet again. My big toe wiggled, and I nearly wept with joy. Whatever they were using to keep me drugged and immobile wasn’t working anymore, but if I woke up and moved, even opened my eyes, someone would walk in seconds later. I spent an eternity awake, pretending to be comatose. I had become quite the actor. I had to camouflage my attempts to assess my strength, control of my limbs with shifts that could be considered normal sleep movement. I could fully feel not only my feet, but both of my legs. The muscles always felt tight, like compressed springs ready to jump into action. I hoped this was a positive sign that my body had not withered into atrophy. My hands and arms felt stronger than they ever were before this place.

I could peer through the tiniest gap in my eyelids, through the eyelashes. There was now a third bag hanging from the I.V. stand, containing a deep brownish red liquid. The door was open more frequently. The nurse and doctor were gone for longer and longer. Were they confident in my imprisonment? Was it a test or a trap? I didn’t know and I no longer cared. I had to find a way out. If I tried to sneak out, they would somehow see me, like every time I had been obviously awake. How long had it been since I had left this bed? Could I remove the restraints? Could I even stand? If I risked it without a plan, I would never make it out. I decided to test the reaction time to me waking. Would it be long enough to get up, see if I could even drive my body like I used to? The alternative – just staying in this bed, paralyzed to inaction from fear – was not an option.

I let my eyes flutter open. I moved my head groggily. Keeping up the act for what they could see. Under the sterile white sheet, I made quick attempts to remove the restraints. I pulled up my wrist in a sharp upward motion. It gave slightly and I heard the sound of Velcro pulling away from itself. Not handcuffs. Not locks. I sat up straight, leaving my hands bound by the restraints I knew would not hold when the time came. I kicked my legs as though in a panicked attempt to escape, concealing the newfound knowledge they would move as I needed them to do.
Footsteps. Not even a full minute. It was not going to be easy.

I let the nurse “sedate” me. The injection didn’t even burn this time, but there was a tinge of drowsiness. I let my whole body go limp, docile. The nurse gently stroked my face with a finger. I wanted to recoil, get away, eject myself from that touch – like ancient, cracked leather. It didn’t feel warm but hot, scorching on my bare skin. She spoke aloud, not to me but what I started picturing as her imaginary friend, “She is a fighter. She should be ready soon.” Her voice was wrong; it didn’t match her appearance. She was older, face wrinkled and creased, but the voice was light and youthful.

It took every ounce of willpower to not physically react to this. Did she know I was faking? Ready for what? As I laid there, forcing my body to be calm, she started crying – a deep, horrible sobbing for several minutes that trailed off into a wet choking cough. It went on for too long, but then it morphed into a guttural, gurgling chilling laughter. Nothing in this place had scared me more than this moment. And then… THUD. Despite my desperate self-control, my eyes popped open. The nurse was crumpled onto the floor. A thin river of blood flowing from her stomach and pooling around her. Looming over her was a woman, her back to me. I could see the dripping surgical knife in her right hand. She was trembling and her breaths were hard, ragged, and rasping. I was unable to speak. My mind could not decide in that split second whether this new person was friend or foe. The next moment, everything I had known until then was ripped away.

She turned toward the bed, slowly as if each movement had a terrible cost. Her shoulders hunched forward; her arms were unnaturally long. She had saved me. I should be nothing but thankful, but the fear I felt at her presence was overwhelming. I could not understand why until I saw her face. My face.

No. Almost my face. The eyes were a fraction too wide, the jaw was squarer, and the mouth stretched across as if being pulled from both sides.  

My heart stopped. I was so jarred by the impossibility of this sight that I felt blackness creep into mind, shutting down, fully rejecting what could not be real. The sharp sting of a hand across my face brought me back. That face. It was me. But it was wrong. There was something animalistic and primal about the woman before me. Her stance was akin to a gorilla, lumbering yet powerful. She stripped off the sheet covering me and ripped off the restraints. I crawled off the bed, wobbling on my unsteady legs.

“Who are you?!” Anger, confusion, violation. I bottled all of it up into those three words and flung them at her. She said nothing. There was something like sadness in her eyes. She pointed at me and then the door. I was still too stunned by her that I could not move. Her head tilted, her eyebrows furrowed, and she looked to be concentrating intently.

“Forgot…me…again?” It wasn’t a human voice. There was too much growl in it. It was too low, too hoarse, and the words seemed to cost her a great deal. What did she mean? Did we know each other? Had my memory been tampered with in this place? Heavy tears pooled in those eyes that were mine but not mine. Her lips parted, trying to speak again, but all she managed was mouthing the word “Go” over and over as tears streamed down her cheeks. I wanted answers, but this was it. I found my balance and went to the open door. The hallway was dark, a long empty corridor with four other doors identical to mine. 

There was one dim bulb nested into the ceiling at the end of the hall. Just below it, I saw the mangled, bloody body of the doctor. Bile erupted from my stomach, and I was halted, doubled over to let my body heave it out. Then I ran. I ran straight past the doctor, not sparing him a single glance. I wrenched open the door at the end of the hallway. It led to a small stairwell, so I climbed. If I stopped, this place would swallow me. My muscles screamed, my lungs burned as I ran up and up the countless stairs until I reached the final step in front of the only other door I had seen. I opened it to reveal the blinding sun and the world I had been taken from so long ago. I was terrified to take that first step into the cold, fresh air. Why? I shoved the doubt out of my mind. I could not afford to hesitate.
