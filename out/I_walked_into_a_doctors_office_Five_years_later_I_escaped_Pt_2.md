One day, about six months after my escape, the phone rang. “Ms. Lafleur?”

“This is she. Who is this?”

“This is Officer Keshner. Would you be able to come down to the station? We have a few follow up questions regarding your case.”

“Of course! Did something happen? Did you find something new?” I asked, intense excitement and dread rising like a tide inside me. 

“Yes. I can't discuss the details at the moment…but you said you were an only child, correct?” 

“Uh, yeah. And my parents passed away years ago. It's just me.” They have her, I thought. That had to be it. They think she's some bizarro twin. 

“Ok. Can you come today? Now?” He asked. 

“Yes. I will head there now.”

I had been living in an apartment on my own for almost a month. My cousin, Michelle, had insisted I stay with her after everything. I didn't object. She was always like the little sister I never had. Her parents, my mother's brother and his wife, had moved to Florida when she was heading to college. She has two older brothers, Ryan and Lee. The whole family came together when I popped back into the world. It was nice, but then they all had to return to their lives, drifting off back to familiar routines. Michelle had a small, one bedroom place, and after a few months on the couch (I refused to let her give up her bedroom for me), I knew I needed to get my own place. I settled for a unit in the same complex as Michelle and we still spent most every evening together, watching television or just talking. So, she was sitting on my couch when I got the call. 

“Who was that, Liz?” she asked, seeing the fear etched into my face. 

“The police. I have to go to the station. For questions” I told her in a robotic tone. I felt numb. 

“Let me get my shoes on. I'm coming with you.” I told her it wasn't necessary, but she wouldn't hear it. We climbed into her little blue Kia and zipped off down the road. We parked in the little lot in front of the police station. I took a moment to take deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth. It didn't calm my nerves. We met Officer Keshner at the front desk. He was an abnormally tall man, thick like a bodybuilder with a shaved head and a square jaw. He told Michelle to wait in the row of chairs near the door. She was about to protest, and I waved her off. “I'll be fine. I'll tell you everything when I get out,” I said as reassuringly as I could manage. 

The officer led me back into a small room, similar to the one I had given my initial statement. He gestured to a chair on the opposite side of the table that occupied most of the room’s space. Then he sat down in the other chair. He had a blue, official looking folder in his hand and sat it on the surface between us. 

“Ms. Lafleur… I'm going to show you some photographs. They are not going to be pleasant. If you need to take a break or…anything, let me know. You're not in trouble here. But we've never encountered a situation like this. The captain has been on the phone damn near all day trying to figure out if this needs to be handled by the FBI, military, or some other alphabet agency.” he told me, keeping his voice level. I felt sweat bead on my forehead and acid churned in my stomach. I had no clue what the pictures would show, but the foreboding in the officer’s voice already had me on edge. He opened the folder and removed a stack of pictures. He laid them in a row in front of me giving a gentle thwack of the print paper as each hit the tabletop. 

There were five pictures. I took them each in turn, trying to maintain some level of equanimity. The first was of a man, bloody, caked in dirt. The doctor. So, he truly was dead, I thought. I should have felt reassured – not only was this tangible proof that he existed, but he was no longer a looming threat in my life. Something in the back of my mind kept me from feeling anything at all. I was simply numb.  

The second… my eyes locked onto the horrible image and my heart sprinted away, urging the rest of my body to follow. It was me. Dead. This wasn't a strange, poor copy like the one that saved me. This was me. My ears were ringing, and I didn't realize I had jumped up from the chair and backed into the wall behind me. Keshner was sliding a small black trashcan next to me, and, upon seeing it, I retched. I threw up hard, as if my body was attempting to expel something lethal. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, my entire body trembling as I forced myself to look back at the photograph. I was spiraling. How many of me did they make? And HOW? How was any of this even possible?!

It wasn’t just that the dead woman looked like me—it was me. The same sharp angle of my jaw, the same faint scar on my eyebrow from a childhood fall, the same freckle just below my left eye. Her hair was a little shorter than mine, her skin pallid, but otherwise, she could have been my reflection frozen in time. A thick, jagged wound split across her throat, dried blood darkening the fabric of her hospital gown. My stomach lurched again, but there was nothing left to bring up. I pressed my back against the wall, desperate to put more space between myself and the impossible truth staring up at me from the table. Why was my savior doppelgänger so distorted if they could make a perfect copy? Unless… But I couldn’t entertain the thought. I am Elizabeth LaFleur. Me. Not them. Not any of them. Keshner was extremely patient and waited silently while I freaked out. He caught my eye, and I knew we needed to continue. 

“This was found three days ago,” Keshner said, his voice low but steady. “An anonymous tip led officers to an abandoned lot near the old shipping yards. She was already dead when they got there—her body wasn’t… fresh, but it hadn’t started decomposing the way it should have. Toxicology came back inconclusive. No prints in the area. No security cameras. And no ID except for this.” He reached into the folder and slid a plastic evidence bag across the table. Inside was a hospital bracelet, still smudged with dried blood. I didn’t need to read it—I already knew what it would say. Lafleur, Elizabeth. Admitted: February 6, 2019. My vision wavered, my pulse hammering in my ears. This was supposed to be my hospital band. The one I had woken up with. The one that should have still been on my wrist. But I was alive. Wasn’t I?

My mind erupted into a cacophony of unanswerable questions. What did those people do?! Are these clones really of me? How? Were they just made to look like me? And the one thought circling like a vulture above all the others: Am I really…me? I had pushed this question down only moments ago, but I could no longer suppress it. 

I remember my life. All the things you’re supposed to remember: my childhood, growing up in a nice little neighborhood, friends, relatives, birthdays, holidays, boyfriends. I remember my parents dying in a car wreck when I was 19. I still felt the heartache of that day, faded but still there. I listed these things, as if noting them methodically could make them more genuine, more mine. I had the hallmarks, milestones, but I wasn’t able to draw the details. There were gaps. The day-to-day life I had before was not clear, but that was normal. Right? I couldn’t remember the sound of my parents’ voices, the smell of my childhood home, the feel of my life long ago eluded me. Officer Keshner was still understanding, silent, while I continued to stare down at this gory image of myself, processing. I looked up at him again, his eyes meeting mine. There was a hard exterior to him, but I sensed a kindness, too. He wanted answers almost as much as I did. He held my gaze for another moment then dropped his eyes to the third picture. 

It was grotesque. The image was a shallow hole (grave?) filled with body parts. Some were deformed or mutated. There was a severed arm with two hands, a leg without a knee, and the heads… They were cruel imitations of me with varying degrees of imperfection. I grabbed the trashcan from the floor, feeling sick once more, but there was nothing left in my stomach. The deplorable carnage in that picture was too surreal for me to take in fully – like the absurdly over-the-top violence in a slasher movie. I registered that this image was objectively more horrific than the one of the dead me, but it wasn’t. Keshner gestured to the other large photograph to this one’s right. It was another angle of the body parts. I felt hollow and helpless. 

The fifth picture was different. It was smaller than the first four. It was in color (the others had been black and white) and looked as if it was taken with an old disposable camera except that it had a timestamp on the bottom right: JAN 9 2021 08:16 AM. I snatched it off the table and held it close to my eyes, taking in every detail. It was me again, whole, healthy, alive, and in the world. It was a candid shot of me, sitting on a bench somewhere, possibly a park. I was wearing the jacket I bought from that thrift store and the shoes I paid way too much for in this fancy shop downtown. I hated them because they pinched my toes and rubbed my heel, but I wore them because they were too expensive to leave in the closet. But this still wasn’t me – not the me currently sitting in the police station. I was trapped in an underground nightmare for the entirety of 2021. I sat holding this picture for what felt like days. Who was she? I couldn’t think of her as me – the true me. Was this alternate the same one they found dead? A deep sorrow consumed me. I ached for this woman – the life she had. Was it my life? I grieved the loss for both of us. 

My mouth hung open in shock. I flipped the image around to Keshner, finally demanding from him the same one-word question on a loop in my head, “How?”
“Suffice it to say, we don’t know. These four pictures – “he swept his hand over the other photographs, “were taken by our crime scene techs. This one,” he pointed at the image in my hand, “was sent to us.”

“Sent? By whom? When?” I demanded. 

“It was left in an envelope on the front desk. It had your name and case number written on it. There were no fingerprints on the exterior or interior of the envelope. None on the photo and none on the note that came with it.” Keshner explained. 

“There are cameras EVERYWHERE in here. You didn’t see who left it?” I was almost yelling at him, frustrated beyond belief. 

“No. We have combed through our security footage. We get a lot of foot traffic in and out of here. We have followed up with everyone that could be identified on the tapes going back a week before it was found. We’ve got nothing. No leads.” He admitted, sounding defeated. 

“Wait, you said there was a note? What note? What did it say?” I asked, unsure I wanted to know. 

“The note was typed. It had directions to that body,” he pointed to the second picture, “and to the…disposal site of the…body parts. That was it. We checked it out, and this is what we have. Someone wanted us to find all of this, but we can’t understand who or why at this point.” 

I had nothing to contribute aside from my horror and revulsion, so I was sent home. Michelle tried her best to calm me on the drive back home, but we were both filled with dread as we stood in front of my apartment door. A large envelope was taped to it and in thick black letters it said: OPEN NOW. Michelle reached her hand up to pull it off the door, but I smacked it away. 

“Liz… We have to see what’s in there,” she said, in her most reasonable tone. 
The words were caught in my throat. I wanted to open it. I wanted to throw it away. I wanted to burn down the door and run until I couldn’t run anymore. I stood, transfixed, at this innocent or deadly message. “Call the police. Ask for Officer Keshner. Tell him…” I trailed off, unsure.

“Ok.” Michelle didn’t need me to finish. She was pulling her phone from her pocket and dialing before I finished speaking. She got Keshner on the line, explained what we found. He arrived within minutes, along with two other cops. I had been rooted to the spot, as if standing on a landmine. When he carefully removed the envelope, I relaxed, but only slightly. He had latex gloves on his massive hands. He was careful not to rip the envelope as he opened it. It contained a single item: a DVD. It was just the disc, a rewritable one. One side had a sticker on it like a label that said: “Test #3. Conv. Attempt #7.” The handwriting was different from the envelope. This was slanted, cramped, and untidy. 
“Do you have a DVD player?” Keshner asked us. I shook my head no. Michelle said she had a PlayStation that would probably work. “Alright. We will have to take this in for evidence, but, Ms. Lafleur, do you want to see what’s on it before we go?”

No. I don’t. I want this to be over, I thought. But I found myself nodding my head yes and walking over to Michelle’s place to watch the damn thing anyway. Michelle and I sat on her couch. Officer Keshner stood near the TV, controller in hand, loading up the disc. 
The video started. You could see a bright, white room. In the center was a woman in a wheelchair. Her face was partially covered in thick bandages that obscured her forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. Her eyes looked glassy, groggy. She was wearing a white hospital gown, and her legs were covered by either a thin white blanket or sheet. There was a rhythmic chime sound every few seconds, it was low and unobtrusive. A voice began to speak, but the owner remained off screen. I knew that voice, the deep tone and strange cadence: the doctor. 

“What is your name?” he asked. The woman did not respond. He repeated the question, a little louder and more insistent. Still no reply. The was a sharp buzz and a yelp from the woman. The question again.

“B…Bi…” she tried, trying to shake her answer from her mouth. Another quick buzz and a yelp. “Bianca. S…S-Sinclair.” 

“Incorrect. Your name is Elizabeth LaFleur,” he stated. Ice slipped into my stomach and chilled my every nerve. “Another round of therapy for Test subject #3, nurse. Up the dose. Double. This one is stubborn.” And the video ended. I could not look away from the screen, but I felt everyone else’s eyes upon me. I felt like an imposter. Was I? Who sent this? Why? I am a nobody. There was simply nothing about me that would be interesting enough to make more of me. 

Or was that the point? 

I was holding Michelle’s hand when the video started. I kept squeezing harder as it played. When it ended, I felt guilty. She pulled her hand from mine and winced. Officer Keshner turned to me, mouth open in either surprise or disgust. 

“This was here when you got home?” he asked.

“Yeah. Just like you found it. We didn’t touch it.” I confirmed. 

“Ok. We will have to send everything out to try and verify this is real. It could be someone’s idea of a joke. Anyone who read about you a few months ago could have put this together. We’ll see if there are any fingerpr—” he was explaining when I cut him off.
“No. I think it’s real. That room… I’ve been there. It’s exactly the same. Even that weird hum, I think from the lights. It’s the same,” I said. I was beyond positive this wasn’t a hoax. Keshner examined my face. I’m not sure what he was searching for, but seemed to find it, then nodded. 

“Alright then. We still have to investigate it, but I will try to run down any leads on this. Don’t get your hopes up, though. This isn’t much to go on. We’ll start with this Bianca. See if there’s anything out there about her going missing or…” Dead. He didn’t say the word, but I knew. Which would be worse? Living, convinced you are someone else, or dying? 

A few officers went through both Michelle’s and my apartments, checking for any sign of intrusion. Keshner checked the windows and doors to make sure they were secure. He pulled a business card from his wallet, wrote something on the blank backside of it, and handed it to me. 

“This top number is my personal cell. The bottom number is my direct line at the station. If anything comes up or you need me, call. I don’t care what time,” he told me and then he left. It was such a kind gesture; I almost cried. He believes me. I had two people in the world that truly believed me: Michelle and now Keshner. I looked at the card, flipped it over and realized I had never even asked for his first name. It was Mark. 
That night Michelle insisted on staying over. She suggested we have a slumber party, like the good old days. I didn’t want to kill her mood and admit I don’t remember any of our sleepovers. We didn’t exactly live close to each other. I just took comfort in her being this relentlessly positive force in my life. I had escaped months ago, but that coldness had not fully left my bones. I was in my own place, but it took Michelle being here – fully accepting me, not doubting, not pressing for answers I didn’t have – to get it to finally sink in, warming me from the inside.

A nagging little voice in the back of my mind said: She’s never asked you any questions about that time. Does she really believe me? Is she just playing along? Am I that fragile? I dismissed the thought. I was lucky to have Michelle as family and friend. 
“I would be lost without you, Michelle,” I said as the credits rolled on our second John Hughes film of the night. “You’re my best friend. Thank you for…” There wasn’t a big enough word. “Everything.” She looked at me in mild surprise. Her mouth opened slightly as if to speak but thought better of it and gave me a big too-tight hug instead. She pulled back, looking at the ground, wiped away a tear and said, “No thanks necessary. We’re family. That’s what families do.” This was thoroughly not my experience from life, but I left it alone. I felt like I was finally coming home. 

I still had the nightmares. I still called Mark on a semi-daily basis for updates, but the next few weeks felt almost normal. I worked from home answering calls for an insurance company. I had groceries delivered. Michelle said the one (and only one) good thing is that I completely missed the whole Covid thing. 

“Everyone was in lockdown. So, it’s not like you were really missing out,” she added one day after telling me about the pandemic. She used to be such a quiet, mousy little thing, but she had developed a wonderfully dark sense of humor in my absence. She would joke, seemingly callously, about my missing time. Anyone outside might get offended, but I enjoyed it. It took the weight from it, lessened the sting. If I could laugh at it, then it couldn’t beat me.
