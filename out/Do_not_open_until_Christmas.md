“Sleigh is fucked.”  Walken held up the warped plastic runners with a look that was one part disingenuous disappointment and one part barely suppressed glee.  “Guess that means we’re done with this holiday display or whatever.”  He was just a December worker at the store, but it was still annoying.  I felt like I had to fight him on every little thing I asked him to do.

“Bells still work.”  I pointed to the pile of brass bells strung along twin strips of red and green leather.  “Set up the sleigh with the snow fluff around the base to hide the runners and then start attaching the bells up front like reins.  I’ll tie them into the deer harnesses.”

“Ring up needed on Lane Two.”  That was Gary, sounding like a sleepy dick per usual.  Walken rolled his eyes.  

“Are we getting that or…?”  He flapped the misshapen runners like wings.

“You are.”  I grabbed the sleigh pieces from him.  “I’ll keep working on this.  Come back if you get off the register though.”

“Listening to Freida talk about her grandchildren is so much more interesting, but I’ll do what I can.”  Smirking, he sauntered off toward the front.

In the next five minutes I got more done than I had in the thirty beforehand.  I hated these kids coming to work for a couple of months.  Most of them were spoiled little shits that acted put upon because Mommy and Daddy wanted them to work for a few weeks instead of sit at home annoying them, which meant *I* got to be babysitter instead and…what was that?

The last box had a large, red velvet bag tied with a gold cord.  I’d been doing this Christmas display for five years and had never seen it before.  It fit in with the sleigh and Santa doll theme-wise, but it looked much nicer and more expensive.  Pulling it out of the box, I was surprised how it felt full but still very light.  And when I went to untie the cord

“Lane Two is closed.  Sorry folks.”

Snow fibers fluttered around as I slammed the bag down.  Looking up, I saw Walken wandering back toward me grinning as he explained his register had “gone haywire” and had to be shut back down.

“Is there anything you need me to do or whatever?”  His tone said he hoped not, and I was close to just sending him away when movement caught my eye.  Something in the bag had shifted.  I reached for the gold cord, but hesitated, and beckoning him over, I told Walken to see what was inside.  Giving a long sigh, he pulled the bag closer and undid the top.

Glistening strands of green and red goo stretched and snapped as the bag yawned wide.  There was suddenly a smell surrounding us—a sharp, frosty scent that was so cold in my nose that it almost felt metallic.  My mind was filled with the image of a dark mine somewhere deep in the bowels of some ancient mountain rimed over with steel-grey ice.  In that dark, pinpricks of light sparked again and again, and I somehow knew it was the sparks of a thousand small picks digging at whatever lay nestled in that place.  

*A beautiful sight.*  The alien thought whispered across my brain even as I saw something dart out of the bag’s darkness in a swirl of real winter snow.  It was a pair of silver chains, lined with delicate bells and terminating in hooking claws something like a mantis or…a curled holly leaf.  Either way, they had dug into Walken’s shoulders and were yanking him in so fast that by the time he began to scream, it was a faint echo from somewhere far away.  A small herd of children being shepherded by an elderly woman looked my way and I forced a smile and awkward wave.

“We’re happy tonight, aren’t we kids?  It’s almost Christmas!”  A few of them nodded and laughed, but one little boy looked at me and then the open red bag dubiously before clutching his grandmother’s hip and turning away.  Smart kid.

Gingerly edging over to the bag, I grabbed the gold cord and tugged the opening shut.  Tensed and ready to run, I gently slid it over to the box and pushed it back in.  It wasn’t until I was closing the box back up that I noticed the ornate tag on the end of the cord.  Silver-etched lettering in a delicate font had been pressed into a piece of fine black leather.  Just one word, but enough for me to tape up the box and write “Do not open” on the outside, even if the warning worked only for me the following year.  Just one word, but it was enough.
