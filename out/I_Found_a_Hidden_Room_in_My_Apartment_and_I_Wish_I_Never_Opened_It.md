Hey, Reddit. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I never thought I’d have a story worth sharing, but here we are. Buckle up, because this is gonna be a long one.

A few months ago, I moved into a cheap one-bedroom in an old building downtown. The place had that “charming but slightly creepy” vibe—hardwood floors that creaked like they were haunted, weirdly narrow hallways, and a closet in the bedroom that was way deeper than it needed to be. But hey, rent was half what my friends were paying, so I wasn’t complaining.

At first, everything was fine—just the usual old-building quirks: pipes groaning at night, the occasional draft from nowhere. Then, about a month in, I started hearing… other things.

It started with scratching. I figured it was mice—an old building, right? I set traps, but they never caught anything. Then, one night, I heard something *knocking*. Not like a branch against a window, but a slow, deliberate *tap… tap… tap…* coming from inside the bedroom wall.

I told my landlord, who shrugged it off. “Probably just settling,” he said. But the knocking kept happening. Always at 3:17 AM. Exactly three knocks. Every. Damn. Night.

That’s when I noticed something weird about the bedroom closet. The back wall didn’t match the rest of the apartment. The other walls were plaster, but this one was cheap plywood, like it had been added later.

One sleepless night (after the usual 3:17 AM wake-up call), I grabbed a flashlight and started poking around. I pressed against the back panel, and it *moved*. Just slightly, but enough to make my stomach drop.

I pulled out a box cutter and sliced through the caulking around the edges. The panel came loose, revealing a dark space behind it.  
It wasn’t just a crawl space. It was a full room—about the size of a small office—hidden behind my closet. The air was thick with dust and something else… something sour, like old sweat.

My flashlight beam landed on a metal chair in the center of the room. It was bolted to the floor, with leather straps on the arms and legs. Next to it was a small table with rusted tools—pliers, a handsaw, things I didn’t want to think about.

But the worst part? The walls. They were covered in writing. Not graffiti, not random scribbles. Names. Dozens of them, scratched into the plaster like someone had used a knife or their fingernails. Some were so old they were barely visible. Others looked… fresh.

I recognized one immediately. Emily Carter. That was the name of the previous tenant. The landlord told me she’d “moved out suddenly.”

I ran out of there so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. Called the cops immediately. They searched the room, took photos, and asked me a million questions. But here’s the thing: when they checked the records, there was no mention of Emily Carter ever living here. No lease, no paperwork. Like she never existed.

The cops left, saying they’d “look into it.” That night, I stayed at a friend’s place. But the next morning, I had to go back for clothes.

I was packing a bag when I heard it. Not from the wall this time.

From the closet.

Three slow, deliberate knocks.

*Tap… tap… tap…*

I didn’t stick around to see what was making them.

**UPDATE:** I’m staying with a friend until I can break my lease. The landlord is refusing to let me out of it, saying I “damaged the property” by tearing open the wall. Cops still haven’t found anything useful.

Oh, and last night? My friend’s dog started growling at the front door at exactly 3:17 AM.

I don’t think whatever’s in that room is staying there anymore.

(*Would you guys want updates if anything else happens?)*

**UPDATE #2:-** Hey, Reddit. It’s been a few days since my last post, and… well, a lot has happened. I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did, and honestly, I wish I could say things have gotten better. They haven’t.

After my first post, I tried to break my lease. The landlord, Mr. Hargrove, was *pissed*. He accused me of "vandalism" and threatened to sue if I didn’t pay for the "damages." When I mentioned the hidden room, he went dead silent. Then he hung up.

I called the cops again, demanding they check the building’s blueprints. Turns out, the room *wasn’t* on any official records. The detective I spoke to—Detective Ruiz—started taking me seriously after that.

I did some digging of my own. The building’s been around since the 1920s, and according to old newspapers, it was once a boarding house. There were reports of disappearances in the '50s and '70s, but no arrests were ever made.

Then I found *her*.

A woman named Lillian Hargrove—the landlord’s *grandmother*—ran the place back then. There was a small article from 1973 about a tenant who vanished. The police questioned her, but nothing came of it.

I think the Hargroves have been using that room for a *long* time.

I haven’t slept well since I found the room. When I *do* sleep, I have the same nightmare: I’m in the chair, strapped down, and someone’s standing over me. I can’t see their face, but they whisper the same thing every time:

*"You shouldn’t have looked."*

Last night, I woke up screaming. My friend said I was scratching at my arms in my sleep. When I looked in the mirror, there were faint red marks—like fingers had been wrapped around my wrists.

This morning, I drove past my old apartment. There was a moving van outside. A young couple was carrying boxes inside, laughing.

I almost didn’t say anything. But then I saw *him*—Mr. Hargrove, smiling, shaking their hands.

I couldn’t just walk away.

I pulled over and told them everything. At first, they thought I was crazy. Then the guy—Jake—frowned and said, "Wait, our closet *does* feel weirdly deep."

They promised to check it out. I gave them Detective Ruiz’s number.

I thought leaving the apartment would stop the knocking.

I was wrong.

Last night, at *exactly* 3:17 AM, my friend’s cat suddenly arched its back and hissed at the bedroom door. Then—*tap… tap… tap*—three knocks, right on the wood.

Whatever’s in that room… it’s not staying there anymore.

**Question:** Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Should I get a priest? A lawyer? Both?

*(I’ll keep updating if anything else happens. Stay safe, Reddit.)*

**UPDATE #3: "I Went Back to the Apartment… And What I Found Changes Everything"**

Reddit, I don’t even know where to start. The past 48 hours have been a nightmare. I’m typing this from a motel room with the lights on and the door barricaded. I think I’m being followed.

Two days ago, Jake—the guy who moved into my old apartment—called me in a panic.

*"Dude, you weren’t kidding,"* he whispered. *"We found the room. And… there’s something else."*

He sent me a photo. Behind the chair, in the corner of the hidden room, was a small door. A *trapdoor*.

I told him to call the cops immediately. He said they would. Then… nothing.

His phone went straight to voicemail after that.

I know, I *know*—worst idea ever. But I couldn’t just leave them there. I drove to the apartment, my hands shaking the whole way.

The front door was unlocked.

Inside, the place was *silent*. No furniture, no boxes—like they’d never moved in. But their car was still outside.

Then I heard it.

A muffled *thumping* from the bedroom.

The hidden room looked the same—chair, tools, names on the walls. But now, the trapdoor in the corner was *wide open*. A set of narrow, crumbling stairs led down into pitch-black darkness.

The smell hit me first—damp earth, rust, and something *rotten*.

I almost turned back. Then I heard a *voice*.

*"Help…"*

It was Jake.

The stairs led to a tunnel. The walls were rough stone, like it had been dug out by hand. My phone flashlight barely cut through the darkness, but I could see more names carved into the rock. Some were so old they looked colonial.

The tunnel branched in three directions. Jake’s voice came from the left.

I followed it.

The tunnel opened into a larger chamber—and my blood went *cold*.

Bones. Dozens of them. Piled in corners, shoved into alcoves. Some were old, yellowed with age. Others… *weren’t*.

At the center of the room was another chair. Jake was in it, barely conscious, his wrists tied with rope. His girlfriend, Mia, was slumped against the wall, her mouth gagged.

I didn’t see Mr. Hargrove until it was too late.

# He Was Waiting

A hand clamped over my mouth from behind. *"You just couldn’t leave it alone,"* Hargrove hissed.

I fought like hell. Elbowed him in the gut, grabbed Jake, and dragged him toward the tunnel. Mia stumbled after us.

We didn’t stop running until we were out of the building.

This time, the cops *had* to act. They raided the apartment, found the room, the trapdoor, the tunnels.

But Hargrove was gone.

Worse? The tunnels *kept going*. They don’t just run under the apartment—they connect to the entire block. The cops think there could be *dozens* of hidden access points in other buildings.

I thought getting Jake and Mia out would make it stop.

It didn’t.

Last night, at *exactly* 3:17 AM, my motel room door rattled.

Three knocks.

*Tap… tap… tap…*

I didn’t open it. But this morning, there was a note slipped under the door.

Two words:

*"YOU’RE NEXT."*

**Question:** What the *hell* do I do now? The cops have a case open, but they haven’t caught Hargrove. Do I leave town? Change my name?

*(If I don’t update again… well, you’ll know why.)*
