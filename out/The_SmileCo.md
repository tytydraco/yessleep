I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to go with it. I’ve been sitting on this for days now, going back and forth between thinking I’m overreacting or going crazy and wanting to know more. 
I don’t really have anyone left to tell. Not in the way that matters. I keep thinking about calling someone from the old job, but what would I even say? “Hey, remember that quiet guy from soil sampling? I think I found a town that isn’t supposed to exist.”
No one would believe me. Heck, I’m not even sure I believe me.

So I’m putting it here. Not for karma. Not for fun. Just… to get it out. Somewhere. Anywhere. Maybe one of you has seen something like this. Maybe someone out there remembers Okshita, or SmileCo. Or maybe you know that weird feeling, like the world’s missing a page you were supposed to read.
If you do — let me know.

Allow me to provide some context: I used to work in environmental science.  
It wasn’t glamorous, but it paid decent — just soil and groundwater testing for industrial sites, mostly. I'd spend hours alone in lab rooms running the same instruments over and over again, but I liked it. There was something satisfying about gathering data, about understanding the story hidden in the dirt.
However, they let me go four years ago.
I’m not going to get into the details. Let’s just say I got a personal diagnosis that made management uncomfortable. Not contagious, not terminal. Just... something about being a liability… No matter, I was close to retiring from that company anyways.

I wasn’t quite sure how to fill my empty time, so I began hiking. On a few of my hikes I had come across some old abandoned houses/buildings. This began my fascination with urban exploration. Over these past few years I’ve explored dozens of different abandoned buildings, towns, mines, etc.

Earlier this year I found myself moving into a town not far from a small town in northeastern Oklahoma called Picher — yeah, that Picher. The ghost town that basically collapsed into itself after lead poisoning and sinkholes made it unlivable. It’s a decaying husk now, but for me it’s become a kind of base camp for deeper explorations. I’ve been mapping and recording the weird and quiet places left behind by history, and this was one of my most dangerous mappings as the air and grounds are still somewhat unsafe to traverse through.

But a few weeks ago, I stumbled on something that wasn’t supposed to be there.
I was camping on a logging road not far from the Kansas border, maybe ten miles northwest of Picher. My plan was to hit an old rail station I’d been tipped off about, but sometime around midnight I spotted a rusted metal sign poking out of the brush. No name, just a faded arrow and a number: 13.
Curious, I followed the trail. About an hour later, I found myself at the edge of a town swallowed by trees — buildings choked in vines, power lines dangling like nooses. Roofs partially caved in and a broken welcome sign on the edge of town with no name. 

The first thing I noticed was the silence. Not the kind of quiet you get in rural areas or empty fields, but the heavy, unnatural kind—like the town itself was holding its breath.
The buildings looked like they had been abandoned in a hurry. Doors hung open on rusted hinges, windows were either shattered or covered in layers of grime so thick they looked painted. I passed what had once been a diner—still had the cracked “OPEN” sign fallen in the doorway. Inside, I found plates of mold, a child's shoe was lying under a booth, and broken coffee cups sat on the floor beneath the counter. 

As I explored a couple other buildings I felt watched. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but the air changed the second I stepped past the townhouse. There was no sound, not even birds. Just that thick, pressing quiet that makes your ears ring. And then — that feeling. Like I wasn’t alone. Like something was standing just behind me, close enough to breathe but refusing to make a sound.
I turned around more times than I care to admit.
Nothing. Always nothing.
But it didn’t go away.
That kind of silence doesn’t feel empty. It feels like something’s holding its breath, just to see what you’ll do next.

Thats when I came across the most interesting part. Hidden in the deepest part of the town, behind what I assumed to be an old library, was an RV.
It was buried halfway in the dirt, like the woods had been trying to eat it for the past decade. Brown and white, late ’80s model. One of the windows was cracked. The door was ajar, hanging open like someone left in a hurry.
I thought maybe it belonged to a squatter or a hunter who never came back. I hesitated, then went to step inside.
Even though the door was ajar, I still had to pull pretty hard to open it fully, it seemed the hinges were stuck on some vines that had grown into the RV. 

Inside the air was stale, thick, like someone had tried to clean something chemical out of it years ago. The floor creaked under my boots. Most of the front had been gutted — cushions torn, wires dangling, a lantern rusted to one side. But in the back, where the bed would’ve been, someone had built a workspace.
A makeshift lab.
Glass jars lined the wall, most empty. A microscope sat crooked on a bolted-down desk. There were scribbled notes taped over the cabinets, diagrams I couldn’t make sense of. And in the corner — a cardboard box. Plain, water-damaged, taped shut. I whipped out my pocket knife and cut the box open, inside was a collection of 4 things. 

* Two hardbound notebooks, cracked and water-stained.
* Five cassette tapes, each labeled with dates and what looked like experiment numbers.
* A few strange rocks — one black and glossy like obsidian, another pale green and flaky, almost like it had veins. Some of the green had been broken up and placed in vials 
* And an old, but intact cassette recorder.

I was curious. I took one of the journals and something wrapped in cloth on the desk back with me to my campsite, and then a couple days later I brought it back home with me. I cracked open one of the notebooks. It was difficult to read at first, but it looked like an experiment log. The first journal was labeled:
"Dr.  — Log #001" (the name was smudged) 
Here’s a portion of what it said. I’m typing it exactly as written:

Journal EntryDate: March 18, 1997Location: Okshita, OK
I wasn’t planning on writing tonight, but something about the way the samples behaved in the dish has kept my hands restless. Might as well make a record of it while it's fresh.
Earlier this afternoon, one of the foremen — Raul — stopped by the trailer with a small padded case. Said the crew had pulled something new out of Shaft 3, about 200 feet down past the main iron seam. Not uncommon to find odd minerals here and there, but he said this batch "felt weird."
Not dangerous. Just... strange.

Inside the case were two specimens. One a deep black, almost blue under the right light. Smooth and heavy, like polished obsidian but somehow matte. The other, a pale green crystal that shimmered slightly along the edges, delicate like mica or glass slivers.
Both were cold.
Not cool — cold. Not in a dry ice, chemical reaction kind of way either. Just... unnaturally chilled. Even after sitting on my desk for hours, they haven't warmed up.

I ran basic tests — no radiation, no unusual off-gassing, no acid reactivity. They appear inert, at least chemically. The green one flakes easily and breaks down under semi-light pressure. The black one is much denser, heavier than its volume suggests. There’s something about it that reminds me of magnetic basalt — but my meters are only picking up a weak magnetic field.

Raul said the guys are calling them “Glassrock” and “Nightstone.” Not scientific names, obviously, but I won’t lie — they fit. I’ll log them as Type A (black) and Type B (green) until we know more.
No urgency yet. No hazards. If anything, they seem almost… clean. Unnaturally so.
I’ll prep a small test batch tonight, dissolve traces into distilled water and run conductivity and bio tests in the morning. 

Not expecting much — probably just another shiny distraction that’ll go nowhere.
But I’ll admit — I haven’t stopped touching the Type B sample. Just running it between my fingers absentmindedly while I write.
It’s strangely calming. Like holding a smooth river stone that’s never been in a river.
Might be nothing. Probably is.
Still — I want to see what it does when mixed.
— Dr. A. M.

I haven’t read any of the other entries yet. I will, I have to. I decided to unwrap the thing in cloth I had taken too. When I opened it up it was a soda bottle, like one of those old Coke ones you’d see the polar bears drinking in those commercials. It was untouched by dust and across the middle was a washed-out light blue label with a cartoonish bottle cap mascot smiling. The label read in yellow letters: SmileCo™ - Original Blend.

As I was turning the bottle in my hands, I swear — just for a second — I felt warmth.
It was subtle, but unmistakable. The glass had been cold as ice, but then… it wasn’t. It was body temperature. Almost like someone else had just been holding it.
I froze, then held it up to the light. No residue, no finger prints. But as I tilted it, something inside moved. I hadn’t noticed it earlier — it was thick, dark. Not syrupy like soda. More like ink.
I gave it a gentle shake, and the liquid barely sloshed, almost congealed. That’s when I saw it, bubbles.
Tiny ones, rising slowly to the top, where they popped inward. Not outward — like pressure escaping — but like the liquid was pulling in on itself.
I set it down.
And this part... maybe I was just jumpy. Maybe I imagined it. But the second I walked away, I swear I heard a faint hiss from the bottle — like carbonation escaping, or… something breathing.
When I turned around, it had stopped. But I swear, I swear that little cartoon bottle cap was smiling wider. 

Later that night I looked up the town mentioned in the journal — “Okshita, Oklahoma.” Nothing. Not a map pin. Not a population stat. Not even an old census record.
Then I searched the name on the bottle — SmileCo™. Still nothing. No trademark filings, no defunct business listings, no half-finished web pages archived from the early internet.
Just… blank space.
That’s what gets under my skin the most. These days, everything leaves a footprint — even ghost towns, even companies that went belly-up decades ago. But this?
It’s like someone scraped it clean. Like it was never meant to be remembered.

I thought I could walk away from this.
Weird minerals, an erased town, a bottle full of congealed soda. It was all strange, sure — unnerving — but I figured I’d catalog it, maybe dig a little deeper, and move on like I always do. Just another curiosity for the shelf.
But then last week, something changed.
I was driving through the outskirts of town — the newer part, where they’ve been trying to redevelop the old industrial lots — and I saw construction crews working late. No signs, no logo, just chain-link fencing and temporary floodlights.

The next morning, there was a sign.
Not big. Not flashy. Just a white board with black stenciled letters.
“SmileCo Processing Center.”
 Just the name was enough to send shivers down my spine.
It wasn’t the kind of name I could forget. And when I went back that night, the sign was gone.
I asked around my town — no one had heard of SmileCo. But the lot’s still fenced off. Still guarded. Still growing.
So I’m writing this now because I think something’s happening again. Not just in that dead town in the woods — but here In my town.
I’m starting to think SmileCo was ever really gone.I think it was waiting.

I’m packing my camping bag with essentials, (flashlight, batteries, food, water, etc.) I’m going back to that town tomorrow. I’ll keep you posted.
