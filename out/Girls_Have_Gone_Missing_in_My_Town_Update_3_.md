K'o uvnn cnkxg, Tgeekv.

So, yeah, a lot has happened recently. Marie and I hung out, I'm not convinced her dog is actually still a dog, and there are more dead people and girls.

The Dollengangers had two German Shepards, Beauty and Beast. According to Marie, Beauty's been missing for over a month, but she told me this while petting her. As for the dog, she looked more like a generated imagine of a dog.  You can recognize what it is, but it's wrong. Too shiny and uncanny. She had one too many teeth and claws, and her eyes were scarily intelligent. Not to mention, she smelled like pine sap, candle wax, and sunscreen.

After a while, I suggested we walk around town, so she gave me a soda and went on without waiting. She would balance on sidewalks, arms out and expression downcast. I know Calla would walk like that, but it still surprised me to see Marie imitating her. She's always been more serious and sarcastic, not one to act childishly. We talked about school and hobbies and music, and she thanked me for the dolls.

She looked older and more depressed. There were some gray streaks in her already-pale hair, and her eyes were reddened. I think she had been crying before I arrived, so we watched some of her favorite horror movies and stuff like that. Beauty was trying to comfort her, but Beast kept growling at his mate. The poor dog looked stressed.

During our walk, she brought something up: mimics. I know you guys have suggested that as well, and while I said I'd wait for my winter break, I broke and did even more research. Mimics, shapeshifters, even Doppelg√§ngers. That one caught my attention, and they seem to be the deadliest. They're these creatures that kill the person they look like, albeit unintentionally. I'm convinced these are what's terrorizing the town.

She also brought up the camping trip without prompting. This time, she said what made Calla take her place. "I hope you rot in a ditch, you whore." I don't even know what started their fight, but it was enough to piss them both off, I guess. According to Marie, Calla gathered her stuff up and went to go get Ben.

Even just telling me this made her start crying, and I took her back to her house and made some waffles. She led me up to her room and put on some dumb horror movies, then a show she really likes. As we watched one of the episodes, she told me something else. I'll don't think I'll ever forget the way the light left her eyes or how she lowered her head in defeat.

In a voice more broken than Humpty-Dumpty himself, she whispered that she tried to OD a month ago, but her parents managed to bring her to a hospital in time. However, she confessed that she wished they hadn't. There was a long silence, then she asked for me to stay with her. I remember putting my arm around her because I was terrified that she'd disappear that night, and I promised her I wouldn't leave her side. She just reminded me that was she moving away next week, right after Christmas.

This morning. she told me about Mr. Sweeney.

Apparently, he was found dead at his table, having died on Wednesday night. A shotgun blast to the head was the culprit, but the weird thing? The gun was found on the couch. The note the cops found said that he had accidentally strangled Piper because she had bitten him while he was doing indecent acts to her. I wish I could say everyone was shocked by that, but they weren't.

Piper wasn't buried where the note said she'd be.

As for the new girls (I don't mean to blow past that revelation, but that's all I know about the case), their names are Chastity, Valentina, and Mimzy. Guess who they look like.

Girls have stopped disappearing, but I'm not convinced this is over. I'm going to head into the forest this weekend with Marie, and before anyone gets worried, I'm taking a gun and pepper spray with me.

Nola, signing off.

  
Edit: slight update to the plans. I'm taking my pistol, revolver, bear spray, and a pocketknife with me. Marie's bringing her dad's hunting rifle, Desert Eagle, hunting knife, and pepper spray with her. Fingers crossed that's enough firepower for whatever the hell these things are. Wish us luck, Reddit, we'll probably need it.
