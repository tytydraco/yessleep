23 december,my birthday.
I was lying in my bed,no one said ,,happy birthday" to me until then(keep in mind it was 1 in the afternoon).I was watching TV,then,my mom came into my room and told me that this year I would not have a birthday party,wich made me sad because I made a lot of plans.
We ate,then my mom took me with her to meet with her friends.When we came home it was 8 pm,still,no one told me ,,happy birthday".At this point I started to question if today was 23 december or not.
We sat at the dinner table,and we ate,talking about everything else rather than my birthday.I felt like my family has forgotten about me,and I felt sad.





After I ate I went to my room,closed my door and start watching TV.
After around 2 hours I decide to go on tiktok,I scrolled,and scrolled,but then I found a video with netflix movie recommandations.I picked one and I put it on the TV.
After around 2 hours into the movie,someone barged into my room.Dressed all in black,and,with a low creepy voice said,,Happy birthday".
I immediatly got out of my bed and grabbed the scrissor on my night stand(I always kept a scrissor there in case a package came and I wanted to open it in my room).
I started attacking the black figure wkth my scrissor...I...I stabbed the black figure,but I dont know where,I couldn't see.





The figure starts screaming,its like a woman was screaming.
My dad came into the room,fast.He turned on the lights,and,only then I saw who the black figure was.It was my mom.I just stabbed my mom.
My dad called 911 and they got her to the hospital.It turns out that she was dressed in a black dress because she wanted to tell me to get ready because we are going to a party.A party that was thrown for my birthday to be more exact.And the low creepy voice?She was just being silly,trying to be funny,but I overreacted.I stabbed her.I stabbed my mom.
The medics told us that they couldn't do anything.She was stabbed in the belly and twice in the neck.Therefore she lost a lot of blood.
I killed my mom...
After a few years,I started to get better with the tought,and still,I missed her.
I got married to my beautiful wife,Sarah and we have a beautiful little girl,Malenya.
One night me and Sarah were in our bedroom,staying on our phones,when Malenya came into our room crying.
After what seemed to take forever,we calmed her down,and she told us that she heard a woman's voice that came from her closet,teling her ,,Come here at grandma".





Me and my wife were terrified,but of course we acted like grown-ups.I went into my daughter's room and checked the closet,but no one was there.That night,she slept with us.
Since then,everything was normal,until after a few months.
One night,my wife started acting realy wierd.She woke me up in the middle of the night twice,telling me,,U are gonna pay for this one way or another".
I was confused,pay for what?
But after she said that she layed back in the bed,and fell asleep.
The same thing happend for the following month,then it stopped for a week,almost two.
But then,the worst night of my life,came.I was sleeping,and some wierd sound woke me up,it was my wife.She was somehow almost in the air.I think she's getting possesed.Before I could do anything I see her getting out of the bed,more like crawling,and going into thr kitched,scared,I followed her.I saw her getting a knife,and going into the left,which was my daughters room,I started yelling at her,but she still kept going.Malenya was sleeping,but she woke up from the screams.




Sarah started attacking her with the knife and I got in trying to get my daughter,but she attacked me too,she cut my pointer finger off.I pulled back,I went to grab the gun from my room,but when I got back,it was too late,my wife was gone,and my baby girl was sitting there,on the floor,with blood all over her.
I went searching for Sarah all over the house.When I got to the bathroom,I turned on the lights,ready to shot anytime,and I gasped in schock and fear as I saw ,,I told you that you are gonna pay for it.You are gonna pay for the night you killed me" in blood on the mirror.




I went outside,still searching for my wife,only to see her on the roof of our house,with the knife in her hand.She got closer to the edge of the roof,stabbed herself with the knife in the chest,and she fell on the grass.I cryied,and blamed myself for all of it.
Until this day I live with the fear that she still want revenge,and that she's gonna kill me.I also never talked about this before
