I woke up with a jolt. I'm surrounded by darkness. 

I blink desperately trying to adjust to the dark, but in this moment It's no use. It's pitch black. *Where am I?* I try to move, but I can’t.  

*WTF* 

I try again, but nothing happens. I'm stuck. 

*No, not stuck...restrained.* 

I look down and squint attempting to make something, anything out. I continue to focus on my hand and slowly, my eyes begin to adjust. The picture clears and I can see that my hands have been taped down to an armrest.  

*Okaaay...?* 

Trying not to panic, I give my legs a try even though I’m pretty sure I’ll be running into the same dilemma. Ignoring that eerie feeling looming in the back of my mind, I slowly wiggled my right foot. Within seconds, my biggest fear was confirmed by that gummy adhesive wrapped around my legs. 

*Can you break it?* 

I’m going to have to try. I plead my brain to send all the right signals to my legs as I mustered up the strength to kick them up as hard as I can, but to no one’s surprise, the tape was won. 

*That’s 1 for the tape and 0 for us.* 

FUUUUCK! The alarm in my head begins to go off and I am instantly consumed by fear. My chest tightens, my breath becomes shallow until the panic sets in and starts to bubble over. Hyperventilating, I frantically pulled and kicked at the restraints trying to break free. 

*Shhh! Shhh! They’ll hear us! You need to calm down.* 

The thought had me still in seconds. I was aware of what this situation meant, but my brain had not processed the fact that the captors were still around. Perhaps, just waiting for me to wake up. Okay, I need to try and calm down to gather my thoughts.  

“Okay, okay... Let’s think, what happened? How did I get here?” I said breathlessly. 

I shut my eyes and begged my mind for a memory, anything that might help me figure out how the fuck I ended up here. To my disappointment, my mind was blank. Just a gaping hole of nothingness. I sat up straight and looked down at my wrists. I tugged a bit and tried to turn them slightly, quietly testing the grip on the tape. 

*Someone clearly doesn't want us to go anywhere.* 

I started to feel agitated again thanks to my vulnerability. My heartbeat blared in my ears, and in this darkness the sound was deafening.  

*Breathe...*   
*Breathe...*   
*Just breathe.*  

My head had this heaviness. A groggy feeling associated with taking Benadryl or Nyquil. Maybe someone put something in my drink? What other reason could there be? I don’t feel any pain; my head isn’t throbbing; no part of me feels bruised or broken. Just disoriented with a dry mouth. 

I sighed, no use in asking if someone could be that cruel. Women have been drugged, raped and killed for centuries. You'd think that things would be different living in modern times, but not much has changed. Suddenly, I thought of him and my heart was filled with a mournful yearning.  

*Mako...*  

Oh, I should have listened to you and just came home. God, please don’t let this morning be the last time I would ever see him. My eyes swelled with unshed tears. I was scared, and angry with myself for not staying aware. Frustrated and determined to figure this out, I continued interrogating myself.  

Only, I just couldn’t make any sense of how I came to be here. I have no memory of being taken, and to be completely honest, I’m surprised they were able to carry me. I say they because I am by no means your average, socially accepted, thin woman. No. I’m on the thicker side. A plus sized girlie which can only mean there was more than one man involved. 

"What is the last thing I remember?" I whispered to myself, and then chuckled. 

*I swear, just because you watch True Crime docs and listen to Podcasts doesn’t mean you’re Sherlock Holmes.* 

I roll my eyes. I remember the bar, my friends, getting a drink, then nothing. Complete darkness. 

*Typical. Isn't this how most True Crime stories begin? You'd think you'd be smarter Luna.*   

Oh yea, I’m Luna, by the way. Did I mention that? I know what you're thinking... this is not the time or place to be a smart ass but talking to myself (something I do way too often) is oddly comforting in this moment. It’s almost as if I am not entirely alone in this dark, dark room. 

I released the shaky breath I'd been holding and felt the pressure dissipating from my ears. As my body continued to release some built-up tension, the gears in my mind began to turn.  

It started slowly, and even though the current situation begged for urgency, I could not rush the process. Every detail was important, and hopefully, one of them would help me find a way out of here. 

Wherever here is. 

-----

(BEFORE)

I wake up to Incubus’ 11 AM playing in the background. I groan and reach for my phone to turn off the alarm. *Ugh, 3 am already? I should call in…* 

NOPE! I have this same thought every morning. Seriously! Maybe it's a 5 AM shift thing? I don't know. I get up, shower, get dressed, and prepare my coffee. I need to be in top shape for my presentation today. Good thing I packed my lunch bag last night. One less thing to do. 

I get all my things ready, then bend down to pet the little jerk I have for a dog. Now, before you say anything about my dog, Luke, let me just say, this dog is not your average dog. He and I have a love and annoy the living crap out of each other type of relationship. It's never a dull moment in this house. 

My man, Mako, was already up and making his coffee. He also works an early shift.  

Now, Mako is... well, he is the perfect example of the result from cross-cultural relationships. He is the sexiest man I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. He’s Tall, and not your slender tall – more, beefy. And I don’t mean that in a body builder type of way, he’s more like a tribal warrior. 

This man has Polynesian blood, as well as Japanese and Korean. *You remember Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones? Yea, that’s right… Mako’s my savage*. I bite my lip as my eyes take him in.  

By God he is FIIINE!  

I walk behind him and with my hands I trace the outline of his broad shoulders, down both of his fully tattooed arms, back up the center of his waist until I've fully wrapped my arms around him, then I plant the faintest kiss on the back of his neck. 

"Mmm, good morning baby" he says turning around to kiss me on the lips. 

"Morning, mi amor" I reply with a flirty smile. 

"Are you off to work already?" 

"Yes. I have my presentation today, so I wanted to get to work a little early to prepare. I already let Luke out and filled his bowls. Umm, remember that I am having a few drinks with everyone from work later on tonight, so I won't be home for dinner. There are leftovers in the fridge in case you don't feel like ordering out. " 

"Ah, forgot about that. Don't drink too much and call me if you do, so I can pick you up. I don't want you driving if you've been drinking." He says with a hint of concern. 

"Yes boss!" I reply mockingly. He is not amused, but his features soften after I give him a reassuring smile.  

I reach out for him and pull him close. "I'll be okay, promise. I don't plan on having more than two drinks anyway. I want to make sure we can have some adult time later.”  

A mischievous grin spreads across his face, and his eyes darken. Ugh, he Kills me. That look sends shivers down to the deepest, darkest parts of me. It gets me every time. 

"Adult time hu? I think that's a given. If you think you can wear something like that and go out for drinks without getting punished, you’re crazy." He smacks my ass and pulls me in tighter for a passionate kiss. “Why don’t you skip the bar and come straight home instead? We can have some dinner then move on to the more adult stuff.” His smile widened and I felt weak in the knees. 

“I want to, but Vanessa has been begging us to go out for weeks so we said we’d go for a bit. Don’t worry, I’ll be back before you know it baby,” I promised. 

"Okay. I'll be waiting for you," he says. "Good luck with your presentation. I love you babe." 

"And I love you mi amor." I quickly composed myself, grabbed my things and headed out the door. 

If only I'd known that that moment would be the last time I would see him. 

-----

I arrive to work 15 minutes before 5 am. *So much for getting here early.* 

The presentation doesn't begin until 8 am, so it’s not like I don't have plenty of time to prepare. I just don't like not being able to stick to my plans. *Damn Mako for making me late. I am going to make him pay for that tonight.* 

I can't help but smile at the thought. That man has a way of making me lose all of my senses, and today was no exception. I get to my office and settle in. My mornings usually consist of reading emails and making sure all the tasks I assigned were completed or were at the very least, being worked on.  

A few minutes after I arrived, I see Maya walk in. She and I start at the same time, so she probably woke up feeling the exact same way I did. Who am I kidding? I KNOW she did. 

"Good morning Luna" she waves as she walks to her desk. 

"Morning Maya," I reply. 

I know it doesn't seem like it based on our brief exchange, but Maya and I are friends outside of work. We tend to start our conversations a little later in the day. Especially, once our other friend, Vanessa, decides to grace us with her presence. 

Vanessa is the high-spirited one in our group, and I like to think it’s because she's way younger than us. See, my bar hopping, and clubbing days are way behind me, and Vanessa is always trying to get me out of my comfort zone. I find that both adventurous and exhausting. *That girl will be the death of me.* 

Maya and I are closer in age and have both left our 20's in the past. We refer to Maya as the mom of the group, and she has a drawer full of knick-knacks, to prove it. Both of them help hurry the day along when it's dragging on or when our boss, Mr. Roach, is in one of his moods. 

"Luna, are you coming out for drinks tonight?" Maya asks from across the room. 

"Yeah, just for a bit though. Mako and I have some things to take care of when I get home." 

"Ohhh, things hu?" She smirks, "Is that what we're calling it?" she teases. 

I laugh. "The best part of adulting," I say. "Not sure if I want to stay too long with Mr. Roach being there either. Hard to let loose when the boss is around, even if it is after work hours." 

"Girl, you just know there's something off about that man. There's been a lot of rumors about him and the females that conveniently, no longer work here, but it's hard to tell if they're true when most of the team tends to get trashed at these types of events. The downside of an open bar." She says shaking her head in disapproval. 

"That's true. You know it's going to be hard to convince Vanessa to leave later." 

"No one is going home early tonight! We are going to drink until the sun comes up!" Vanessa chimes in loudly from the back sashaying to her desk as if on a runway. 

This girl is all sass and energy of a typical 25-year-old. She starts her nights at the same time I am getting ready for bed. 

*Ay dios!* 

"No promises." I say, already feeling tired at the thought of pulling an all-nighter. 

"Yeah, Luna has things to take care of with Mako tonight," said Maya gesturing air quotes with her fingers. 

Vanessa Rolls her eyes. "Well, I am going to take advantage of that open bar and see if I spot any guys worthy of my attention." 

"Good luck trying to find one. Most of the guys that will be there already work here" Maya says with a laugh. 

Vanessa gives her an exasperated look. "Friend! Must you point out the obvious? Who knows, maybe a random stranger will come and whisk me away to his playroom," she replied wishfully. 

I laughed. "Vanessa, this is not the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. Although, I'm sure Mr. Roach wouldn't mind whisking you away" I teased. 

She frowned and became very serious. "Girl! Don't even joke about that. The rumors about him being a creeper are disturbing. He definitely gives ME the creeps." She said with a shiver. 

*She's not wrong.* 

Stewart Roach is definitely strange. He's the manager of our department and enjoys reminding everyone every chance he gets. At first glance you notice the formal attire, the formal tone and diction when he speaks or sends an email. He keeps to himself most of the time and is very conscientious about the way he interacts with the team. Almost too careful, which to me, seems calculated. Why would anyone take so much time to ensure that all their bases are covered unless they’re trying to hide something? Still, he’s never really said or done anything that proves this theory of mine. It’s just a feeling. 

Now, don't go thinking that Mr. Roach is our version of Mr. Grey either.  

*So gross.*  

No, physically he looks like an old man; balding, long scraggly beard, with glasses. All of that but on the body of an under-developed, and mal-nourished 13-year-old boy. 

"I get the same vibe when he's around. Let's just go for a bit and steer clear of him. I'd rather neither of us confirm if those rumors are true," I tell them.  

Before we could say anything else, we see Mr. Roach walk in and head into his office. His presence signifying the end of our gossip and the beginning of a long day. I should have called in.  

Too late now. 

----- 

The day rolled right on by, and by the time I looked at the clock again, it was time to leave.  

My presentation went as expected. Everyone seemed content with my findings and ideas on how we could manage our time better. Their favorite part being the amount of money we save. All in all, it was a productive day for a Friday. And now off to the bar. I should probably text Mako to let him know. 

Mako is a bit of a control freak. Ever since I met him, we do this thing where we text each other anytime we're heading out or arriving to our destination to let each other know that we made it there safely. There's been a few times when I've forgotten to text him or to hit send and ended up coming home to the scowl on his face. The thought made me laugh. Oh Mako, I'd rather be home with you right now. 

I send him a quick text, and also text Maya and Vanessa to let them know I’ll be leaving soon. They'd left before me since I had a few last-minute emails to send out. I don't like to leave things pending, especially on a Friday. The office is closed on the weekends, so anything pending would stay that way until Monday. 

I grabbed my things and made my way to the door. When I glanced back, I noticed that Mr. Roach was still in his office. Hmm, maybe he's not going. Would be a lot more fun if he didn’t show. Fingers crossed! 

It takes me about 25 minutes to reach the bar. We’re meeting at The Laundry Room, downtown on Freemont. You'd think they'd pick a closer bar. I mean, there's like one in every corner here in Las Vegas. 

The company rented out the place for Employee Appreciation Week, and the open bar was enough to convince Vanessa that we should all make an appearance. 

I texted Mako again to let him know I’d arrived and then made my way inside. I was surprised at how elegant it was. Like I said, I don't get out much and the bars I went to back in my 20's looked nothing like this one. Las Vegas is more for the young, the gamblers and tourists, honestly. Not much to do here as a local. The weather alone is reason enough to stay at home with the AC blaring. 

I squeezed through the crowd and spotted Maya and Vanessa getting drinks at the bar. Didn't need to be a mind reader or GPS software to know that’s where they'd be. 

"Luna!" They both called out when they saw me. 

"Hey ladies! What'd I miss? 

"Girl, nothing! There's no music or hot guys. Just shots, shots, and more shots” said Vanessa, hinting for me to take one. 

Maya shook her head. "We've already had 2 shots and a gummy. Maybe you should wait a bit Nessa?" 

"Come on friend don't be like that," she whined. "Luna, will you drink a shot with me?” 

“Ummm, I just got here.” I looked at Maya with a pleading look. She laughed and shrugged in response. “Ugh, okay, but I am counting that as one drink. I am not getting wasted with you tonight Ness.” 

Vanessa jumped up and down clapping her hands with excitement. “Let’s get this party started.” 

I rolled my eyes. *Ay dios mio*, please don’t let this be a long night. 

Vanessa leans over the bar and waves the bartender down. He walks to her and she says something that makes him laugh. From this angle it almost looks like they’re flirting. 

*Oh, this could be a good thing. He’s not too bad on the eyes either.* 

While Vanessa was getting the alcohol and hopefully something else, I started to tell Maya about how Mr. Roach was still in his office when I was leaving. “I’m thinking he might not show.” 

“Girl let’s hope so because I don’t want to stay too long either and Vanessa looks to be in it for the long run.” 

“We might not have to worry about her tonight. She seems to be hitting it off with the bartender.” I motion over at the bar with my head.  

“OMG! Get it friend!” She shouted. 

Vanessa was now fully leaning over the bar and making out with the bartender. I giggled too the second I saw her reach down with one hand to lower her dress. It must have ridden up during their heated exchange.  

*That girl is something else.*  

“I don’t think we’re getting drinks anytime soon,” I laughed. “I am going to look for the restroom. Keep an eye on our girl?” 

“Damn right! You’d think they’d come up for air at some point.” She laughed. 

I walked away chuckling. It took me a bit to find the ladies bathroom. This place was surprisingly big. Bars are typically small and a little gross. This place was not at all what I was expecting. I quickly use the restroom, wash my hands, and meet back up with Maya and Vanessa. 

*Wonder if Nessa is done playing tonsil hockey with that bartender?* 

And low and behold – she’s back at Maya’s side, drink in hand and shaking her hips back and forth. 

*Looks like someone found a jukebox.*  

“Lunaaaaa” she yells when I come into view.  

Yup, she’s hammered, and I've only had one shot. At least, she’s having fun. “Did you get me a drink, or do I need to make out with the bartender to get one?” I say mockingly. 

Maya almost spit her drink. “Ummm, I confirm that tongue was not needed to get my drink.” 

Vanessa rolls her eyes but couldn’t hide her smile. “Don’t hate cuz my drink came with a cherry on top.” 

“You mean *lengua* on top" I emphasized by licking the air and she blushed. "Did he tip you too?” I added.  

“Oh no girl, the tip comes later.” She replied in a suggestive tone. 

We burst out laughing. God, we laughed so hard that my cheeks began to hurt. I definitely needed that drink now, so I made my way to bar and asked for 3 of our favorites – a BabyMomma.  

We drank and talked about the usual; our day, our home lives and all the nonsense happening in today’s world. Vanessa went on about her BDSM fantasies, still hoping her Fifty Shades would ride in on his Audi, take her away to his playroom to punish her. 

*I love me some Mr. Grey, but I am not sure I like the idea of giving up full control.* 

Maya shared her adventures as a mom, and the struggle of dealing with the wedding industry now that she was comparing prices and venues. At some point, I had to break away and go to the restroom again. Alcohol always ran through me so quickly. 

I excused myself and speed walked to the bathroom, cursing my small bladder on the way. I swear I can’t even take a sip of water without having to pee every 15 minutes. In my haste, I bumped into someone. 

“OMG! I am so sorry" I said mortified. 

“It’s not a problem Luna.” I hear them say. “Are you okay?” 

Oh no! I froze. Of all the people here, I had to bump into the Boss, Mr. Roach. 

*Way to go dumbass!* 

I mentally kicked myself and looked up already dreading the fact that not only did I have to talk to him, but I also had to feign nicety. 

*Tragame Tierra* 

“I’m okay, thank you Mr. Roach.” I tried to move past him but he blocked my way. 

“Please Luna, call me Stewart. You aren’t on the clock anymore. There's no need to be so formal,” he said, a creepy smile playing on his lips. 

I shuddered internally. It wasn’t so much what he said or how he said it, he just gave off this icky vibe that I can’t quite put into words. A feeling of dread and uneasiness ensues when he’s around, and the urge to runaway becomes hard to ignore.  

“Is something wrong?” he adds, and I realize that I hadn’t said a thing this whole time.  

*Say something, Estupida!* 

“No, sorry. Alcohol you know, just runs right through me.” I said making a swooping motion with my hands for emphasis. “I need to use the restroom, excuse me sir.” I ducked out of his way and quickly scurried on to the restroom praying he didn't follow. 

"See you later" He shouted behind me. I looked back and gave him a dismissive wave and kept going. 

*See me later? Nel, not if I can help it.* 

Fuck that was awkward! I shook the creepy stalker vibes off and walked faster. I was so excited when I saw the restroom door that I almost went inside with my drink. Great! 

I looked around and spotted a little shelf on the wall, on the opposite side of the bathroom door. A dangerous idea popped in my mind then. Mom would kill me if I left my drink somewhere I couldn’t keep an eye on it. 

Oh, but the urge to pee was insane! I’d held it for too long at this point that I couldn’t wait any longer. I looked around and didn’t see anyone remotely close by, so I set my drink on the shelf and convinced myself I’d be quick. Sorry *mom, n*ature calls. 

I know what you're thinking...what a dumbass, right? Yeah, I’m right there with you. 

I ran in, peed as quickly as I could, washed my hands and I was right back out in a flash. Couldn’t have been more than 2 minutes and I was out the door. I grabbed my drink and looked around again for reassurance. There was still no one in sight, so I made my way back with a smile thinking I was so slick. 

What I didn’t know was that he had been watching me the whole time. Just waiting for the opportunity to strike.   
 

And I had just given it to him.   
 

-----

(NOW)

Glasses clinking. Laughter. I'm in a bathroom stall. Christian Grey. 

*Christian Grey?*  

Wait. No, that can't be right. Am I dreaming? 

*You are if Mr. Grey is there.* 

A memory? I must have dozed off at some point. I sat up feeling like I'd overslept. My eyes felt heavy, my mouth was dry and there was a fuzzy feeling in the back of my throat. I guess this wasn't a bad dream. God! Please tell me someone's looking for me. If no one's figured out that I am missing, I am the only help I am going to get right now. 

*Goodluck to us then.* 

I looked around trying to make out the size of this place. It feels big, but it's really hard to tell without more light. There are darker shaded areas around me that could be furniture or maybe shelving. The one thing I know for sure is that it is ridiculously very cold in here. 

*Maybe a garage or basement?* 

If only there was a window or light. 

*Yea, cuz that's kidnappers are known for, their hospitality.* 

I lean my head back in frustration. I can't believe this is happening to me. I scoffed at the thought. 

*Pretty sure everyone in this situation said the same thing.* 

Shut up! Only I could be so sarcastic at this moment. That, or I've officially lost my mind. Maybe I did? Maybe I am dreaming. Yes! maybe I slipped and hit my head. I could be sleeping in a hospital bed right now with Mako, and my family at my side. 

*Oooor you've literally gone batshit crazy because you were FUCKING TAKEN BY SOME PSYCHOPATH MURDERER!* 

STOP IT! Just stop! This is by far the worst possible time to lose my shit. Get it together Luna. Focus! What happened at the bar? I know I never made it home. I mean, I'm strapped to a fucking chair in some dark room. This shit feels pretty real to me.  

Mako has to be trying to reach me, if not looking for me already. I gave him all the details of the bar and someone there has to have seen something. All I have to do now is remain calm, stay alive and try to get out of here. 

*But mostly, stay alive. I mean, can't do anything else if you're dead.*  

You just can't help yourself, can you? Okay, let's start with the basics; I arrived at the bar, Maya and Ness were already there. There was something about shots? Oh, and that bartender.  

*I remember him, he had his tongue so far down Nessa's throat he probably gave her a tonsillectomy.* 

That's funny, but were getting off topic here! Let's see; There was Nessa and the bartender,  I got us some BabyMommas, went to pee, bumped into Mr. Roach...  

 *Oh...* *BUMPED  INTO   MR.  ROACH*  

That has to be it! That is by far the most out of place thing that occurred at the bar. 

*Well, besides getting kidnapped.* 

I rolled my eyes. Actually, It's abducted.  

Now, if you didn't find that encounter the least bit suspicious there is definitely something seriously wrong with you. In fact, someone should probably go and check YOUR basement right now to see if I'm down there.  

*…Ooor your garage.* 

ANYWAY, Mr. Roach was there. I had seen him in his office and thought he'd be too busy to show, but he was there. And he said he'd "see me later", almost as if he knew he would. That whole encounter was just beyond weird and now I'm here, taped to a goddam chair in *Jeffrey* fucking *Dahmer's* basement. 

…Ooor his garage.   
  
For the love of Christ! 

*I'm just saying, I definitely don't remember reading this scene in Fifty Shades. Pretty sure I would have remembered this one.* 

Is this what Vanessa had in mind? How the hell am I the one tied up when this is her fantasy? Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. After all, Mr. Roach is a tiny man. There's no way he could carry me. Besides, we were at a bar full of people we work with. Yes, he is a creep who may or may not have crossed a line with some girls from work, but to be fair, he's never actually done or said anything to make me think he was capable of hurting me. 

*Plus, with a bar full of employees he had to have been busy making rounds.*  

That's true! Look at you being helpful for once. Would he have had the time though? and then there's motive. 

*You say that as if all psycho, pervert, murderers have a reason for murdering someone. They're fucking insane Luna!* 

In any case, none of this makes much sense. Someone was definitely watching me. They were close enough to wait until I was alone, watch me until I screwed up and put something in my drink. Then stalk me the way a lion stalks its prey right before it pounces. 

*Which begs the question; what would they have done if I hadn't left my drink unattended?* 

I don't think I want to know the answer to that. The sound of a door unlocking pulled me away from myself. I was frozen, immediately unable to move. My heart started racing and the sound of blood rushing filled my ears. I heard footsteps and the sound snapped me to attention. If I wasn't still before, I was now. I moved just enough to angle my ear towards the sound. From what I could tell, the sound was coming from somewhere above me.   

*Guess the jury's still out on the whole basement VS garage dilemma.*  

You know, It’s astounding to me how my brain is capable of continuously fucking with me right now. You'd think it'd be all '*Oh, woe is me'* but no. Its non-stop sarcasm and disturbingly dark humor from me. 

Before I could continue talking shit to myself the sound of more footsteps and thuds continued to grab my attention. It almost sounded like someone was pacing up there. The not knowing was gnawing at me, but at the same time it was comforting to know that they were up there and not down here with me. 

I need more time to figure out how to get out of here or at the very least, out of this tape. I willed my body to move, but I was still frozen in place. All that shuffling above me had me motionless, so I decided to wait and listen. After some time, the movements became less frequent, and then came to a complete stop. I can't tell if I'm relieved or more concerned than when they first started. 

I held my breath afraid that they might hear me, and yes, I know that doesn't sound rational, but haven't you been paying attention? My sanity was left at the bar when Dennis fucking Rader decided to take me hostage. 

I continue to wait and attempt to control my breathing to listen more clearly. Just then I heard something different... it's faint through the walls. It sounds like a person or maybe some jingle? I lean in closer trying to make out the sound. It's the TV! I think they turned on the TV. Please let it be that they're going to sleep and plan to deal with me later. 

*Much, much later.* 

I wait for what I can only assume has been a few minutes before I start tugging at the tape again. The residue on the tape pulls at my skin and it burns, but that is nothing compared to the horrific outcome in these types of situations. 

I wiggle, I pull, and try to twist my wrists as much as I can in hopes of loosening the tape. Every tug takes so much out of me and in the dark it’s hard to tell if I'm making any progress. If I’m going off of feeling, which I am, it doesn't feel like I've made a difference. 

*How long has it been?* 

If I could just free my hands then maybe, I'd have a better chance of escaping. I slump down for a moment and close my eyes. I am just so exhausted. Each moment is a fight against time and its becoming a struggle to stay awake. 

*Open your eyes Luna. This may be our only chance.* 

That's right! I sit up and try again. I begin to pull my wrists in a circular motion. I continue moving my hands in the same direction until my wrists feel raw from the friction. I ignore the sting and rotate them over and over and over again. When I felt one side give a little it sparked just enough hope to keep going. Then I twisted my wrist up and down, as far as they could push and pull against the tape until I felt my hand break free. 

*It's out!* 

The feeling of relief was so surreal that I just sat there and stared at my hand in disbelief. 

*Yes, yes. It worked; can you try the next one now?* 

I shook off the disbelief and moved on to the other side. I felt around with my free hand trying to find the lining. My heart was roaring in my ears and the adrenaline was making my hands shake. All the shaking was only making it more difficult to try to remove the tape. Dammit! I was freaking out. Sweat dripped from my eyebrows and I could feel the warning signs of a panic attack. 

*Stop it Luna. Just breathe!*  

I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Okay, pulling off the tape will only create noise, and I don't know how much space is between them, and me. For all I know they can hear my breathing.  

As if on cue, a squeak penetrates the silence and I immediately look up. My ears are on full alert... waiting. A few seconds trickled by without another sound, but I stayed frozen in place. 

*Come on. Try again.* 

I start the gut-wrenching process again; pull and twist; pull and twist. When my arm began to get tired, I stopped and used my right hand to pull on the edges.  

When that didn’t work, I went back to twisting until finally, I feel the tape begin to loosen a bit. I continued the same motion and pace until I felt it give a little more. I rolled my wrist one last time and yanked my arm up in one swift move. 

SNAP! 

I froze. Holy shit, I did it. I left no room for emotion this time and switched to survival mode. I gave my wrists a quick rub and quickly bent over to remove the tape from my legs. Removing it wasn't as hard as my hands, but it still took me a minute or so. 

When I took the last bit of tape off of my jeans, I began to cry. I was suddenly overwhelmed by emotions. I covered my mouth and cried into my hands. My free hands. 

*I know. I know, but we're not out of the woods yet. I mean, we could literally be in the woods somewhere.* 

I shook my head, "There are no woods in Vegas."

*We could be anywhere Luna! Come on! Don't let this be for nothing.* 

And so I wiped the tears away and nodded with determination. I looked around and blindly walked forward until I came to a wall. I used the wall to feel my way around until I came to the door. I carefully ran my hands down the grimy door, but there was no doorknob. It must be some type of automatic door, which means the access pad had to me somewhere on the wall.  

I moved my hands some more to the side of the doors until they come across a small box. I feel around it, but there's not much to it. No number pad, or key ring, so that can only mean that it required a badge and that the door was locked. 

*No surprise there.* 

I sighed, nope. I had freed myself from those restraints, but the hardest part was yet to come. I know now that there is at least one locked door, and that whoever was on the other side was going to come in at some point to finish what they started.  

It became imperative that I look around for something to use as a weapon. I had to be ready for when that time came. My only chance was to hide and strike them from the back. Hit 'em hard enough to either have them blackout or die. 

I never thought I could be capable of killing someone, but this bastard made it so that I didn't have a choice. If this *Ted Bundy* wannabe thinks that abducting and keeping me bound deprives me of my right to choose, then he's about to be in for a rude awakening.  

In the game of life or death, I choose life. And if I have to die in order to live, well then...   
  
I'm going to take this motherfucker with me.
