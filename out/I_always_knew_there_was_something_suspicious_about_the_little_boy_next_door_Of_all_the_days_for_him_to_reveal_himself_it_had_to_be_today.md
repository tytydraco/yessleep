I live next to a house that is locally infamous for several missing cases involving teenage girls. It doesn't help that I'm a teenager myself, and that even though I'm nonbinary, I get mistaken for a girl due to how femme I dress and look.

(And yes, my pronouns are they/them!)

For much of my life, unlike normal children who get their joy from playing with kids that live next door, I was specifically told to avoid the house where the little boy, who goes by Lyle, lives. Can you blame my parents for this? I learned about the missing cases and figured they were trying to protect me.

But I could not hold back my curiosity about this place. In fact, I wondered about what was really going on in there.

It was a few years ago that I went over to the house to ask about playing with Lyle. When Lyle came up, he asked me if I'd like to come inside and play.

I didn't even make it through the door when my parents noticed and screamed the shit out of their lungs. They dragged me back to the house and scolded me for going there.

"Sage! You could have died in there!"

"Are you okay? He didn't get to you, did he?"

"Mom, you don't have to worry! I'm not a girl, so..."

"You might just end up like the others if you go in there!"

"Yeah! You may call yourself an enby, but that could have ended badly!"

&#x200B;

After I finished my homework this morning (my school is off this Friday because some of the staff got sick), I decided that I needed to find out what was happening in the house next door.

My suspicion about Lyle, who is now 10 by this point, had finally reached a breaking point such that I could no longer hold myself back.

I should have noticed the signs. Today's date was the first red flag that I should have noticed.

I decided not to take a direct approach. Seeing as my parents were out for the day, I figured I wouldn't have to hear such a high-pitched scream ringing out from my house even as I was going to be a Peeping Tom.

Another sign I shouldn't have ignored was that the windows had an incredible amount of tint. The drapes were pretty dark-colored.

But I could see through the window just fine, despite my nearsightedness and my not wearing my cheaters. I would have put on my glasses at this point, but what astounded me was the d√©cor of the interior.

It had no traditional aspect to it. Crosses were everywhere for some reason. The furniture was neither bright-colored nor dark-colored. It had a neutral, grey-area aspect.

Inside, I could see Lyle smiling in joy, laughing and playing like a small child.

He appeared to have a toy plane that looked like that of the Red Baron from World War I.

I was a little joyed to seem him playing, even as his own parents were out. But something felt creepy about the way he was playing... and the toy he had in his hand.

I finally gave in to the unnatural desire to knock on the door. My heart pounding, I wanted to know more, and yet I still felt afraid of what I would say or do.

"Hello? It's Sage, your neighbor."

I heard hasty footsteps. Lyle must have been coming to answer the door. But the footsteps echoed, getting louder with each tap, and I was sweating with fear.

I know the missing cases involved teenage women. Remember that I look femme enough that I get mistaken for a girl.

I put on my glasses just in time for Lyle to open the door to me.

"Hello, Sage. It's been a while. Would you like to play with me?"

"Sure. I haven't had the joy of playing with a neighbor's kid, so..."

And I went inside. Boy, was I wrong to do so.

"Yo, Sage! Ever hear that no one wants to play with me and my family? Like, what happened?"

"No idea, Lyle. Last time, my parents were sure I--"

"Could have died? Yeah, that's what they're saying about me."

He seemed so much like an innocent little boy that it appeared impossible for teenage women to have disappeared in this seemingly normal house. Boy, was I wrong about that.

As soon as I went up to his room with him, an unsettling feeling came over me. The air felt heavier and heavier.

I was willing to leave when Lyle looked at me and gave me a patient smile.

"Sage, come in."

And when I did, you, too, would have been astonished at his room's interior.

Unlike the traditional little boy's room, it was filled with seemingly religious items and what appeared to be religious books.

Another sign I shouldn't have ignored.

In the room appeared to also be a kind of table, but for what?

"Now, Sage... would you lie down there for a bit?"

Lyle pointed to the table. I cleaned my glasses, and with a better look, it was a torture table thing like in those medieval movies!

I should have fled then. But I was not willing to let a child cry. Even as my sweat began to get profuse, and my heart pounding so fast I thought my ribcage was going to shatter, I felt like it would be necessary to lie on it for the child to be happy.

"I need to play in this way with teenage girls to be happy." Lyle spoke in a voice that sounded terrifying. I should have gotten off the table and fled. But even as I felt scared shitless, I felt something weighing heavily on me.

I couldn't lift myself off. Then, Lyle fastened the straps that were on the table.

"Now, what shall we play, Sage? Operation? Aggravation?"

He'd said the names of two old board games like they were games he'd play on a girl, or an enby like me, on this table.

"Ooh, I know! Operation! You be the one I operate on, okay?"

I couldn't move. This was getting tense.

My parents were right. I could die in here.

He appeared to get pairs of tweezers. And some scalpels.

How could Lyle's parents let him play with sharp stuff like that?! Then again, Lyle's parents are pretty creepy themselves.

Then Lyle went to the closet, or what I assumed to be his closet, and said,

"Wait here. I'm going to prepare you for the game."

I should have been able to get up. This gave me a small regret about taking Estradiol; I was somewhat weak.

Then he came back with what appeared to be two pieces of cloth.

"Screams will only draw others to stop the playtime, Sage. And you needn't feel afraid; you won't have to see what I will do."

Taking off my glasses would be enough to make me blind to what he'd do, but *blindfolding* me?

"Okay, I'll prepare you now..."

Adrenaline finally got to my brain and I got up from the table. I think the adrenaline made me stronger by a bit, because I broke the straps off. He'd blindfolded me right before I did it, but I took it off, found my glasses, and I was about to break out when I realized the room had no windows.

I bolted for the door, but it had been blocked off by his room's furniture.

I had hoped Lyle's parents wouldn't mind a broken wall, so I just punched the wall next to the door until I had a hole. Looks and stuff didn't matter to me anymore--I was running for my life. I went through the hole in the wall, a piece of my yellow skirt tearing off in the process.

I was incredibly shocked when Lyle also went through the hole in the wall. The door then swung open, revealing his room again, but the furniture didn't block the door this time.

I bolted for the front door, but then it closed by itself.

"Won't you stay with me, Sage? I haven't had a playmate in so long..."

And Lyle had said it while *floating* in the air! He had a frickin' crimson aura around him!

"You're the first person I have ever wanted to play with who wasn't a girl. Who are you, really?"

He knew I was an enby?!

"My parents would only bring me teen girls. They believed that guys would only kill me. But you... I'd like to know how you are neither and parentally approved."

Big words for a 10-year-old boy. But he's not a normal human!

"All my playmates are somehow destined to die... but you? You're capable of living even as I try to play with you."

The front door had locked by itself. I decided that rules of keeping a neighbor's house the way you found it no longer mattered because I was in a desperate need for survival.

"Come back and play with me, Sage!"

I broke a window and was about to exit when Lyle grabbed my leg.

"Please? I have to be happy!"

I kicked him with my Mary Jane shoe and made a successful escape. Drenched in sweat and panting from all the exercise and fear, I felt happy to have survived the weird, scary kid.

Of course my parents would be surprised to see me break out of that house like that. They appeared to be staring at me in utter horror.

"Sage! Sage! Are you okay?!"

I was feeling around for my glasses and then I put them back on.

"Sage, how did you--?"

"I'm sorry, Mom! I didn't know what came over me, I--"

"You've just become the first person to survive the demon Lyle!"

"I was the first non-female person Lyle ever wanted to play with..."

&#x200B;

If I had died from the wounds or not survived my trip to the hospital, I wouldn't be posting this. I'm still taking Estradiol and my wounds are still being treated. I have no regrets about transitioning now--being an enby was helpful in my encounter with Lyle. It'll take a while for me to recover, but I am no longer afraid of anything in life.
