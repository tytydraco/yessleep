The house I live in isn’t really mine. It’s a place that’s been handed down from generation to generation, the way a track runner passes off a baton - hurriedly, yet with a kind of practiced grace. Over the years it descended through the branches of my wife’s family tree until it finally settled in her hands. She hadn’t lived here in more than a decade, but according to her, nothing about it had changed except the slow, inevitable aging of the bones that hold it up.

It was a quaint little home, out of the city but not quite in the middle of nowhere. Settling in was surprisingly smooth, and we even made friends with a few of the neighbors. Most of the other homes around us were occupied by families who’d lived in the same walls for generations, so when they started warning us about the need for security in the area, it didn’t feel like idle small talk. It felt like something we were meant to take seriously.

“The world is really going to hell,” one man muttered to nobody in particular as we happened to be checking our mail at the same time. It caught me off guard; I try to keep neighborly conversation to a bare minimum. On its own, it was a throwaway remark.

“Break-ins are on the rise around here. Mary-Jane down the road had her generator and all the batteries in the house stolen. Batteries! Out of the clocks and remotes even!” another concerned local told my wife while delivering yet another round of housewarming stew. My wife, far more sociable than I’ll ever be, actually asked for more details.

“Break-ins? Were there any arrests made?” she asked, with genuine concern.

“Oh, of course! Good ol’ MJ had AllEyesOn installed. It informed the police at the slightest hint of trouble. Those two kids were arrested before they even made it out of the driveway!”

By then, my ears had heard enough about “good ol’ MJ” that my eyes began their familiar climb toward the back of my skull. While I love my wife dearly, I have strict limits when it comes to enduring what feels like a sales pitch.

“How the hell is that even possible? The drive from just about anywhere is longer than a jog down a driveway,” I muttered.

The very next morning, there I was leaving the department store, arms loaded with all the wires, cameras, and motion lights a single app could possibly want from a man. There are a lot of assumptions one could make about me on sight, and most of them would be correct. I like video games. I like anime. I spend way too much time online. All of that just to say: I would rather cut my leg off than have to do IT work.

The endless wires coiling in and out of one another in their boxes looked like a snake pit. The firewalls singed whatever was left of my sanity. All of this for an app that worked about as well as just calling 911.

Once the bulk of the setup was complete, I fell into an exhausted lump on the couch. The last step was here, and without hesitation I slid the toggle in the app from deactivated to activated.

“All eyes are on you now,” my phone chimed.

I furled my brow as the message sank in. The security app sounded vaguely threatening, but I pushed the thought aside and switched apps to start what I hoped would be some well‑earned relaxation which, of course, would turn into doomscrolling.

My wife came into the room looking as concerned as ever.

“Did you hear the news?” she asked directly.

“I’m almost certain I didn’t, but I know you did.”

“Two other neighbors have been getting robbed. Not just once, but three nights in a row things have gone missing.”

“Well, I have some news you haven’t heard.” I held up my phone. “We have AllEyesOn… well, on. Hopefully it’ll do the job.” I genuinely wanted her to feel safer in her own home. Inside, though, I was still skeptical the app could do more than a phone call. 

The next few weeks went as monotonously as one could hope. Mowing the yard, painting the fence, and a charcuterie board of other chores. Gossip is the blood that flows through the veins of the suburban ecosystem. Mary-Jane had discovered one remote that did not have its batteries stolen, Rodney lost farm equipment out of barn over the course of four days, and Ellie had two of her cats disappear. All was at it had always been. At least until, at 1:13am, my phone chimed.
