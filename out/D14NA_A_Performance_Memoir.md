They called it Friendly Competition Week.

It started with confetti emojis in an HR email and ended with Craig eating his own name tag.

I work on the 18th floor at Meriton Solutions, Department of Strategic Compliance. That’s code for: “Make things disappear and meet your numbers doing it.” I used to think I was lucky—quiet desk, solid performance reviews, nobody breathing down my neck.

Then came the memo:

“Let’s Outperform—Together! Join us in celebrating Friendly Competition Week! Boost morale, chase excellence, and climb toward advancement!”

Your Potential. Our Culture.

There were prizes. Recognition. A free lunch with upper management.
Craig and Dana, two top performers in my row, went all in. I watched it begin. First, Craig unplugged Dana’s mouse before a presentation. Dana responded by installing a keystroke tracker on Craig’s desktop. It escalated fast.

By Day Three, Dana brought in cupcakes.

By Day Four, Cynthia was dead.

HR sent out another email the next morning:

“We LOVE the 18th floor’s energy! Let’s keep it up—Competition Week has been extended indefinitely!”

Smiley face. Red font. One heart. One skull.

I should’ve left then. But I didn’t. I was doing well. My metrics were up. I had a shot. And anyway, I told myself, I wasn’t like them.

But then Bobby vanished.

His shoes were under the Xerox.
The copier still runs like it’s digesting him, printing sheets of static with the faint shape of a human hand embedded in the ink.

Then the ladder appeared.

Dead center of the office.

No one saw it arrive.

It’s made of bone-white rungs, rusted metal, and tangled badge lanyards soaked in old blood. It twitches when no one’s looking. It hums when someone’s “let go.” It connects the office to… somewhere else. Somewhere above, or below. Maybe both.

Dana climbed it halfway last week.
She hasn’t come back down.
But her desk is still typing.

Craig whispers now. He doesn’t breathe. He just optimizes.

⸻

I tried to quit.

Typed up my resignation. Walked toward HR. But the hallway had warped. All the doors curved back to the breakroom. Every exit was just another entrance.

I looked in the mirror above the sink and saw Dana staring back.
She smiled.
Her tag said D-14-NA.

Then it said MARA.

Then nothing.

I think that’s when I broke.

Not in one crack—but a slow bend. Like a performance review over time. Like a neck.

⸻

My desk had a gift waiting for me this morning.

A black envelope. A red badge. No name.

Just:
D-14-NA
Alignment Tier: FULL

I didn’t cry.

I sat down.

The chair wrapped around me like a handshake.

My fingers started typing before I told them to. My mouth whispered onboarding procedures in my sleep. I haven’t blinked since Tuesday.

Every morning, my reflection gets further away.

Every afternoon, the ladder pulses louder.

Craig smiles when he sees me now. Not because I’m his coworker.

Because I’m his replacement.

⸻

There’s a new hire across the floor. Bright. Polite. Still blinks. Still breathes. She asked if I was feeling okay.

I smiled and said,
“Just aligned. Aren’t you?”

She looked at me like I was already dead.

She’s not wrong.

She’s just early.

Final Memo From D-14-NA
We’re all climbing something.
Here at Meriton, we make sure the ladder leads somewhere.
Don’t worry if you don’t remember who you used to be.
We’ll remember for you.

You’re doing great.
Better than everyone else
