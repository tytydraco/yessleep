I was opening the shift that day. I walked past the golf cart with its flat tire. It was coming up on its 2-year anniversary of being broken. I scanned my pass and opened the door to the kitchen. I walked in, past the storage closets, prep stations, and freezers, to finally meet the sink. While I was walking, I was thinking about what the twist was going to be for the final of a show I was watching, or about maybe going back to school after I saved some money up.

I thought about how nice it would be to leave at the end of the day. To feel the setting sun on my skin and a cool breeze of wind hit my face after being next to steam all day was a feeling of unmatched relief. I also couldn’t wait to blast some heavy metal in the blown-out stereo; it helped to drown out the stressful day I knew was ahead. It didn’t matter. None of my thoughts mattered in that moment. As I rounded the corner of a cooler to get a view of the sink, I only remember seeing the bloody, lifeless bodies of my coworkers on the floor. I don’t even remember picking up a notebook covered in blood.

I was the first to find it that morning. I immediately called my supervisor, security, 911, and anyone else I could get hold of. Security got here first, a big man named Reggie, who gagged at the first sight of the two bodies. I don’t blame him: one was missing half the flesh on his arm, leaving only the ulna and radius sticking through, and the other was purple, with hundreds of small needle-like holes in his face and neck. I tried not to register them as the people who trained me and talked to me every day, but it was too hard. I was in tears with Reggie consoling me when the police came. They closed off the dish pit, covered the bodies, and got our stories. I didn’t even know I had blood on me. I guess I tried to resituate them, even if it was a vain effort. I was cleared, and the restaurants, kitchen, and everything else at Riverside Memories Retirement Community were closed for the day.

Days passed, and no new information came to light. The police said the deaths were murders, but no suspects have been identified yet. The police were still investigating, but the residents had to eat, so the kitchen opened a week later. There went all the evidence to solve this case. But truly, there was no evidence. None of it made any sense. The bar gate out front was open because no one was scheduled for security that day, so no one would have seen someone suspicious come and go. No weapons were found in the investigation, so how could one of their arms be shredded like that? What about the hundreds of small holes in the other's face and neck? Could Raymond and Grant have killed each other? I knew these people; they didn’t hate each other. There were only four of us in the dish pit. Sure, some people came and went, but we grew to be a small family. Grant hadn’t even clocked in yesterday. And there was the blood-covered notebook, which had ended up in my backpack, staining my clothes. I only now just realized it, as Maxwell had woken me up from my intense daydream about evidence while I was washing dishes to see if I was hurt.

It was my first shift back, and the idea of having to stand where the two bodies were to wash dishes upset me. There was an extra weight in front of the sink like three hands had grabbed my legs and forced me to stand there. Usually, the kitchen was a bustling place. Servers would run by for extra silverware, cranky chefs would scream at you for entering within a certain distance of their invisible bubble, and overall, it was a loud, yet productive place. 

Now it was like a ghost town. Only a skeleton crew was in place. Two chefs who would normally be barking orders had gone silent, the dozens of footsteps and cartwheels rumbling the ground were absent, and even the heat vents above the grills, which normally had a constant hum, had fallen ever so silent.

The only thing worse than being stuck with your thoughts in silence was that whoever was in charge of cleaning the blood didn’t do a good job at all. There were still blotches on the ceiling and high up on the walls. I was holding back the floodgate of tears all morning. In the past week, I couldn’t get the image of their bodies out of my mind. Trying to solve their murders was the only escape I had. 

 "Jaclyn? Jaclyn?" His deep voice always made me jump. 

"Yes, sorry. Hey, what’s up?" I stammered out in an overly friendly customer service voice.

 "Your jacket, it's bloody. Did you hurt yourself?" My supervisor noted. I looked down and sure enough, blood had stained a large portion of my blue kitten hoodie. I had no idea what caused it. The blood wasn’t fresh; it looked like it had been there for a while.

"Oh my God, you're right. But I didn’t feel anything. Do you think I could have grabbed a knife by the blade? Or or maybe…" 

"Hey, hey, it's okay, go wash up and I can finish this set. If you did hurt yourself, go home for the day, okay? Actually, I think it's best if you just head home. I’ll hold down the fort. Besides, we have a new hire coming in. I want to show him the ropes and try to get another set of hands in here as soon as possible." I was so glad to hear those words. 

"I will, thanks, Max," I say as I untie my work apron and throw it on a drying rack.

Maxwell had been able to feel my hesitation about coming back. I guess it was pretty easy because I had been silent all shift, staring up at the blood. After the brief interaction, all my thoughts were on the bodies again. Some of my uneasiness was relieved by Maxwell. He cared for us like family. When he came into work the day I found the bodies, he didn’t stop crying. Eventually, he ran out of tears, but his dry sobbing didn’t stop. I didn’t ask about his personal life, but I guess his work family was closer to him than his real one. On my way to the break room, I passed by the obituaries of the residents who passed on the announcement board. As usual, there were about 5-7 names up on the board. Grant and Raymond's photos were up there next to a few of the residents. Residents’ deaths just seemed to be happening more often, I guess it bleeds over to the workers now. Raymond’s face was a smooth paper brown bag, but what I saw didn’t reflect that. It was white as snow when I saw the body like someone sucked the blood and flesh right off his bones. I started to run to the break room.

I needed to focus on something else instead of the bodies. Calling my friends “bodies” was the best way to remove their no-longer-existent personalities from them. I burst into the break room to get fresh clothes from my backpack and check up on myself. No cuts to be found. I only found the culprit of my stained hoodie when I went to get a replacement. The shirt I chose from my bag was stained, too. The last time I used this bag was when I found the bodies.  I flipped my backpack upside down and spilled everything else onto the floor. My glasses case, phone charger, and spare clothes all came out as expected, but a small brown and red notebook fell to the ground with a thwack.

I don’t ever remember seeing it before. It was a high-quality, leather-bound journal with a strap to keep the covers closed. The leather had dark crimson on it. The first few pages looked like an idea dump. There was a list of songs under the heading "soundtracks for a movie," with one of the songs being "Tangerine" by Led Zeppelin. The next page was covered in blood; the only things I could make out were the words "Game ideas." There were a few pages with the heading "accomplishments"; most of these pages were empty, one of the few entries being, "Got a job."

Similarly, there were pages with the heading "to work on." It was hard to decipher what some of the text said through the curtain of hemoglobin, but most of the pages were filled. One bullet point was circled and highlighted; all it simply said was "zoning out." After that, there were more pages covered in blood, and then a journal started. Every few days, there was an update about how the writer was doing, their thoughts, and feelings. One of the entries was about the dish pit. It was highlighted in bright neon yellow. Most of the entry was covered in more sanguine, but I could make out what follows:

2/12/25 – “Management Sucks”: 

"-Notable thing that happened was the garbage disposal breaking down. We had a few plumbing issues before, which management didn’t deem as a top-priority fix, so I knew this wasn’t going to be fixed anytime soon. I wished they gave a shit about us."

My immediate thought was that I shouldn’t have this. This was crime scene evidence, and I was ruining it with all my fingerprints. This was Grant's notebook. The only reason I could tell was because of the fluid English, yet the countless spelling mistakes. I should have taken it to the police. But maybe, I thought, there was something in here that could answer what happened, and the cops wouldn’t show me because of confidentiality and whatnot. I let my nosiness take hold. I kept reading. I’ll try my best to transcribe what it says through the gore:

"These thoughts grew ever more common over the past weeks, and so would the daydreaming. I kept asking Maxwell, but he just said the same thing as before. I always had a fear of not being in control of my body or mind. Probably why I talk to Maxwell so much about my insecurities-"

Insecurities were spelled wrong in the book. A lot of words were.

The blood was too thick to read what was next. I tried to recall any time I saw Maxwell and Grant talking together, but only his lifeless body popped up in my mind. I didn’t want to show Maxwell the journal; he would have probably broken down even worse than before. So I followed his suggestion, and I left for the day. I was going to read through as much of the journal as I could.

Hours have passed, and I keep asking myself why I have this. I feel like I opened Pandora's box. Most of the entries I can read make me feel like I should have been there for Grant more. He seemed so fine on the outside, but it's clear he had some issues going on. This journal entry was dated two months before his death.

2/17/25 – “Bad Thoughts”:

 “Some shifts while I was cleaning dishes, I would think of songs that would go perfectly in a movie that I had been creating in my mind for the last 10 months while daydreaming. I also thought about what I was going to get from the vending machine on lunch break every shift. Rarely would I think of darker thoughts. Last shift, a thought that entered my mind was how shitty this job is. Sure, it paid well, and it provided just enough to get by, but it was a dead end. There’s nowhere to learn or grow, definitely no place to get a promotion. I never went to college and had to get my GED because I messed up so badly in high school. Was I trapped here? Was this a trap of my own making? That was enough, my mind deemed. I came back to reality to see that the sink was overflowing.”

Grant was older than me, by how much I don’t know. I never bothered to ask. I regret it now; maybe he could have gotten his thoughts out to another person, even if it was something small. Grant was full-time in this place, five days a week, eight-hour shifts each of those days. Before his death, he worked six days a week, 10-hour shifts. The job paid surprisingly well, so there was no reason for him to work so much. Maxwell fought to increase our pay. And so much paid vacation time, you’d think he’d never want us around to work.

Every few days, Grant would update his journal with more stories about, as he puts it, “daydreaming.” They were depressive death spirals of thoughts he had while working. Some were shorter, only describing his thoughts in a few sentences, while others were longer with whole paragraphs. He described it here in this entry:

“Usually, I would put in some earbuds and listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks. After a while of working, you usually get into a groove, where my body takes over the mundane task of cleaning plates so that my mind is free to wander.”

I hate it when I read that. It was just a sign of more awful things to come. All of these journal entries were highlighted. Here are as many as I could get down that were clear enough to read.

2/24/25 – “Squishy Waterballons”:

 “-bodies and minds were one of the few things we had control over in our lives. Well, not really. My mind wasn’t entirely my own; at any time, some disease like schizophrenia or dementia could come and ravage it as it pleased. My body could give me cancer one day if it makes a mistake. My hair was going to fall out one day, and my body would decay, just like the residents here. I hated that. I don’t want to know I’m rotting, maybe at the ripe age of 50, I would-”

It feels wrong to type this last part now that he's gone. Would he even want his deepest thoughts out in the world to see? Why else would he highlight them? I am choosing to skip to the end of the entry.

“My train of thought was interrupted by two things. My earbud bud running out of battery with a loud, doo doo doop, and a sharp pain in my palm. Damnit. I was letting my mind wander again. The pain was from a knife cut; I must have grabbed it by the blade. Blood was dripping out from underneath and from the hole of the cut on my latex glove into the sink. Maybe my mind was already betraying me.”

I was there that shift, God, and to think I didn’t do anything? I thought it was an accident, not self-harm. Maybe if I had reached out to him, he would still be here.

 3/3/25 – “Leftovers idea?”:

 “Why do the residents waste so much food? Tonight, almost every plate still had three-fourths of the food on it. I had to scrape it all into the trash can. I could have taken it downtown to the homeless shelter and given it away. I mean, the chefs just toss out all of the bread every night; it's such a waste. Maybe I can talk with Maxwell or the floor manager, maybe we could start a program to feed people.”

Grant did talk with Maxwell about it, and I overheard. 

“No, we can’t do it. Think of the logistics, all the holes we have to jump through, paperwork… just everything,” was what I first heard.

“Okay, I understand, but I can take my car. We don’t have to tell anyone about it. I can take it in some of my containers to the homeless shelter.” This conversation must have been going on for a while.

“No. We can’t let anything in here leave. What if a resident is sick? We don’t want germs spreading to another facility.”

“What about the food we don’t use? The leftovers we toss?” Grant was pleading.

It was silent for a long time.

“Fine. I can help out. We can sneak out some leftover bread every night. Don’t tell anyone.”

“Thank you, Max.”

Grant started walking away, and I had to act like I was doing something else.

3/16/25 – “Kitty poster”:

 “Jaclyn put up a hand-drawn Hang in their poster above the sink. She really is an artist. Maybe we can get her to do a bigger one for the place. It warms this cold, desolate room. It’s been keeping me focused. Thanks, Jaclyn.”

I put it up because it was so barren inside the dish pit. Sand-colored popcorn windowless walls surrounded whoever was stuck at the sink. You could forget how colorless and claustrophobic it was if you had earbuds in, but I think the poster brought a little life to the place. I’m glad I made it a little better for you, Grant, even if it was for a few weeks.

3/22/25 – “Meditation”:

“I sometimes put my hand under the sink to let the water run over. I try to focus on just the water running, nothing else. It's the closest thing I’ve tried to meditation. The warm water slowly loses its feeling after a while and becomes temperature-less. It brings me a nice comfort.”

4/1/25 – “Matthew”:

 “The rest of this shift was miserable. All I was thinking about was d-. I didn’t want to zone out and drift away, so I tried to focus on rinsing plates. Grab plate one, rinse, and grab the next one. I guess in reality, these thoughts brought me back to my brother. Grab plate two, rinse, and grab the next one. We both had a bad childhood, but he took care of me through most of it, which he never had to do. Grab plate three, rinse, and grab the next one. I mean, if he didn’t, not much of value would be lost. When he drank himself to death, much more was lost than what remains. Grab plate five, rinse, and grab the next one. The only reason I’m still living my life is because of him. After losing him so long ago, maybe it was time to join him. But I’m scared of what’s on the other side, even if I missed him that bad I couldn’t join him because I’m a pussy. Grab plate nine, rinse, and grab the next one. I would do anything to hide this pain, to focus on anything else instead of being alone, trapped in my mind. Grab plate 18, rinse, and grab the next one. That’s right. I was still in my mind. My attempts to stay focused failed miserably, very in character.”

I want to keep apologizing, but I don’t even know what it will do. I didn’t do anything is what I keep telling myself, but that's the problem, I could have done… something. 

As bad as it sounds, the reason why there were two deaths became clear to me. Grant was severely unwell and was just getting worse. Maybe he did something irrational. I hated myself for even thinking that. Sure, there were a lot of unexplained elements in my head, but at least if I took it to the police, I knew what had happened now. It made sense to me until I realized that the last entry was the last normal one.

There had been a rip in a few pages following it. I was expecting to find more of the same moving forward, but I started to accept that this might have been a murder until I read this.

5/7/25 – “Can’t sleep”:

 “I couldn’t stop thinking about it. It felt like it had made a nest in my mind and was resting there, waiting for me to give it more thought. I thought maybe writing about it would get it out of my head. Maybe it only made it worse. I haven’t gone back to work for a while, but it didn’t matter. The thing in the sink followed me ev-.”

What? The train of thought I had was just derailed completely.  What on earth could Grant have been writing about? I wanted to read more, but the paper was torn. I checked my bag and found two paper scraps, but they didn’t fit there. The first one read, “If You’re re-,” scribbled down fast and hard on top of a drawing. It wasn’t in pen or pencil or Sharpie like the rest of the book, it was in blood. The drawing underneath had to be somewhere else in the book. 

The other scrap wasn’t paper, but an old crumpled-up Polaroid. The photo was of a person, seemingly chugging a can of something in an old carless garage. The light in the photo was a blinding white, a combination of the camera flash and the fluorescent bulbs. It made it so that detecting features of the face was impossible; you couldn’t tell hair color, facial features, anything. The only defining feature was the Grateful Dead shirt at the bottom of the frame. I didn’t pay much attention to the photo and attempted to search my bag again for more paper, but there was nothing. 

So I attempted to find the page with the missing scribble. I flipped back to see if the piece of paper matched with any previous page, but found one I had previously overlooked. It was another entry. It was related to an injury Grant had on his last shift. I saw him alive.

4/19/25 – “What I Saw”:

 “As I am flung back into reality, the smell of something meaty hits my nose. I looked down at my hand to see an amalgam of flesh and latex rubber. My right hand had been under the steaming water the entire time. I was washing the plates with only my left hand. The latex of the glove melted off, letting the water onto my bare skin. I don’t remember feeling anything at any point, certainly not now. My hand had third-degree burns, and whatever latex that remained had fused with the skin. Blood was leaking out where the skin had taken the most damage. I must have been in shock because all my attention was focused on watching the flesh peel off and fall into the sink. As flesh fell away, that… thing… came into view. I don’t know if I saw the paw or the tentacle first. They were so small I couldn’t even tell what they were at first. All I know is that there was something in the sink. It was black, the same black that Mothman is depicted in. If I had felt the pain, the noise of the scream I would have let out if I was in pain wouldn’t compare to the sound that I made when I saw that thing. The thing in the sink must have known I saw it; the tentacle and paw quickly receded down the drain hole. I staggered back and just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. What the fuck did I just see? Was I going insane? No. It had to be real. My scream got the attention of Jaclyn and Raymond, who came running immediately.”

The only reason I forgot that sight was because of the more mangled one that was a week later. But I didn’t forget the smell. The water vapor carried it throughout the kitchen. Grant was speechless; we thought he was in shock and rightfully so, half of his arm was drooping and melting off, hitting the sink like a bowl of thick soup. Raymond called an ambulance, and I rushed over to the medical cabinet to grab anything I thought would help. Maxwell came running in after us, but he didn’t do anything to help. Instead, he just started crying, sobbing uncontrollably. I didn’t understand at the moment, and I was mad. I yelled at Maxwell to get it together. I should apologize to him for that.

Grant didn’t come back to work again after that. Until I found him in front of the sink, missing more flesh off the same arm. My mind so badly wanted answers my body began to shake. Did his mind make something up to try to hide the mental image of his own arm melting? Was he insane?  I wanted that to be true; I didn’t want to see the thing he saw. But there was nothing to see. Tentacles couldn’t fit in the sink, or a paw, or any sort of animal for that matter. Otherwise, the thing would have to be a shape-shifter to fit in. I had to think rationally. One nagging thought remained as I tried to explain everything away: Why would he write the rest of what I am about to read? He had to have seen something if he had written about it this much. I shook away the dangling thought. I started flipping back towards where I was previously to get a better picture of Grant’s psychosis.

More journal entries popped up, just adding more questions to the pile. More missing papers and more clots of ruby censoring of critical information didn’t help. It was all right in front of me, and yet I couldn’t see it. Something discernible did come through every now and again, like, “What if daydreaming were never something the human mind could do?” or “It fucking showed me itself, like an angler fish.” I didn’t know what to make of it. Of course, I told myself the obvious answer that he was unwell. My fib to myself just made me more curious to understand what he was talking about. 

The closer to the end of the journal, the more soaked in liquid lineage the pages became, and the crazier the handwriting. Letters no longer were confined to the lines; each one was contorted into different shapes and sizes. Words were either too small to read by the naked eye or too big to fit on the page. One page was blank, except for one line, which had hundreds of different sentences written on the same line over and over again. 

One page wasn’t written in any language I could detect, but it seemed to me Grant had followed the grammar rules of wherever it came from. Every letter in this language seemed to be written with painstaking care and effort. Not even the slightest deviation in shape for some of the reappearing characters. A new feature for the journal. The whole page started to resemble meaningless schizophrenia rambling, yet it oozed confidence about it. It meant nothing to me and my quest for explanation, but it still impressed me.

One page had the word “plan” written down over and over again, with what seemed to be bullet points underneath. The first one read out, “Bad thoughts.” One bullet point read out, “Try smoking,” another, “Try drinking.” The blood was too thick to read what was in the middle. The last bullet points read, “Listen to sad music,” and “burn Matthew.”

Besides Plan, another word was written over and over again; it was simply, “Cut.”

The next pages were titled, “Wake up?” In big, bold letters. More bullet points, one said “noise,” another said “touch.” One line was half haphazardly scribbled out, and it said, “When it’s full.”

My brain couldn’t make sense of it. Every theory I had crafted seemed to be true and false all at once. Everything supports that he was insane, but my gut feeling couldn’t shake that something was there in the sink, tormenting Grant.

I made a violent page turn, and a waterfall of colorful paper and tape fell out into my lap. Sticky notes and lined paper were stuck together with tape and glue. It was a diagram of what Grant had seen in the sink. 

The tentacle was crudely drawn in with a black Sharpie. The tentacle wasn’t exactly like an octopus; it looked malnourished, about the size of an index and middle finger held together. The tentacle didn’t have any deviation in size or shape until the end, where it had become a stub. It didn’t have the suckers on it; instead, it was countless proboscis where each of the little suction cups should be. Grant estimated that maybe 100–200 small needles were in each group.

He must have gotten a worse look at the paw he described. It was scribbled down with no size estimates. I would guess it couldn’t be bigger than a cat's paw; otherwise, there was no way the whole animal could fit into the garbage disposal. Grant drew what looked like talons and webbed toes. For once, I entertained the idea that it was real. The thought of whatever this animal was living right in front of me forced me to dry heave.

I slid the journal away from me and ran to the bathroom, with the journal falling onto the floor. I fell to the ground in front of the toilet and tried to vomit to distract myself for hours. It was all too much to handle.

When I finally got back up and walked back to the book, it was open to a page that was written in the dark, foul-smelling ink that covered the rest of the book. It stated,

 “—ading this, the sink isn’t safe to use.”
