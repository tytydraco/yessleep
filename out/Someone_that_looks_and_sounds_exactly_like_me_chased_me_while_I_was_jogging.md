I don't even know how to describe what happened but I'll do my best.

I don't have much free time in my life. I work late in security for a local mall. And when I come home I'm usually too tired to do anything else besides watch TV before bed.

As the years have gone by I've noticed my wife Alice become more and more unhappy with the lack of time we spend with each other. As well as my increasingly worsening physical appearance.

I felt bad about this. Since I met her she's always stayed in great shape by going to the gym in her free time and all I did was sit in a control room eating chips and watching the security cameras.

So I decided I should put in an effort to make her happy.

So I put an end to my usual five after work beer ritual and set my alarm clock for 5am. This is where the story starts.

&#x200B;

I was awoken by my alarm clock at 5:10am on account of the fact I hit snooze. This earned me a shove from my wife sleeping next to me who was no doubt annoyed by the alarm going off repeatedly.

After kissing her on the cheek I got out of bed and got dressed into some sweatpants and a hoodie. Then I had a bowl of cereal before finally embracing the inevitable and heading outside.

The sun wasn't up yet and there air was crisp.

I made my way down to the local park where I usually see joggers during my drive to work. Though at this hour its all but abandoned. This was fine by me because I didnt want to make myself look like a pathetic fatty in front of these more experienced joggers.

So I stood at the beginning of the jogging trail, tied my sneakers as tight as I could, and set off running.

The jog was enjoyable for roughly 20 seconds before the inevitable abdominal pain and sore throat I'm used to set in and I was left panting like a dog as I continued on at a pace barely faster than a brisk walk.

*I really let myself go,* I thought to myself as I leaned against one of the lampposts that illuminate the trail as it goes. As I did this I heard something behind me. The sound of shoes hitting asphalt. And fast too.

Before I could turn around another jogger ran past me and continued on. I felt embarrassed that someone saw my laughable attempt at fitness and I envied this persons ability.

Then I noticed something strange. As my vision of this person got smaller and smaller as they jogged away from me I saw that they were wearing pretty much the exact same type of clothing as me. A blue hoodie, gray sweatpants, and white sneakers.

*At least I didnt dress like an idiot,* I thought to myself before pushing away from the post and continuing to jog.

I jogged for another few minutes until the pain in my abdomen got too bad and I stopped to catch my breath. I felt ashamed in myself and thought back to my Highschool days when this wouldn't be a challenge for me. I pulled out my phone to check the time and saw that it was 5:47am. Deciding to cut my losses and try and do better tomorrow I turned around and started jogging back to where I started. As I still needed to shower and be dressed for work in 3 hours.

As I jogged along I saw a figure in the distance. And quickly realised it was the person who passed me before. They must have run all around the trail and was coming back for another lap.

But as we jogged closer and closer to each other I noticed something strange. His hoodie had the exact same brand logo as mine. Not only that but he looked a lot like me. Same facial hair, same hair color. He looked like a thinner version of me. I was getting a bit creeped out at this point.

&#x200B;

When he was about 25 feet away from me he stopped dead in his tracks and stared at me. Causing me to slow down and stop as well.

"Good time for a run huh?" I called out to him nervously.

&#x200B;

"Good time for a run huh?" He responded in the exact same tone and voice.

A shiver ran down my spine when he said this. I know I'm gonna sound nuts when I tell you this but this man looked like a carbon copy of me. There was no doubt in my mind at this point that something wasn't seriously wrong.

I didnt have time to think of what to do before he started sprinting towards me. I cursed under my breath and turned around and started running as fast as I could. But I could hear his sneakers slamming against the asphalt as he was quickly gaining on me.

When I heard him right behind me some long forgotten training from my high school football days kicked in and I quickly darted to the side and onto the grass that was next to the road. When I did this I saw as he landed on the ground and rolled a few times from his momentum. He tried to tackle me.

As fast as he fell he got back to his feet and ran at me again. At this point I ran out into the road and started screaming for help. I saw a cars headlights and foolishly I ran right towards the front of the car while waving my hands in the air shouting. I heard the tires screech but the car still hit me with some force which caused me to slump forward onto the hood.

The woman inside the car gave me a freaked out look before reversing her car. She probably thought I was some crackhead trying to rob her, or worse. I don't blame her for what she did.

I ran across the street to the sidewalk and didnt stop running until I made it home.

I slammed the door behind me and locked it while hyperventilating. This noise must have woken my wife up because she came downstairs looking drowsy and annoyed.

&#x200B;

"Josh what's with the damn racket!?" She said annoyed but her expression turned to one of concern when she saw how scared I looked.

"Josh what's wrong?" She asked while walking towards me. I stood there with my back pressed against the door. Still too shaken up and out of breath to fully get my words out. I said something along the lines of "Man... fucking man came after me"

I left out the details of how he looked exactly like me. Knowing how crazy I would sound to her.

Alice reached out to me and I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tightly. All while she tried to calm me down.

I ended up calling into work sick this morning. Now I'm typing this out. I have no idea what that thing was. If anyone has any ideas or advice on what went down or how to handle it please don't hesitate to let me know.

Edit: I forgot to mention that while I was running away I lost my phone. It must have slipped out of my pocket and I never noticed. My wife came to me a few minutes ago and showed me that she's gotten over 50 messages from my number even though we both know I lost it. My phone is password protected. The messages go as follows:

"Where are you?"

"Hey where are you?"

"I love you"

"We should go somewhere"

"Please call"

"Where's the house?"

"Address?"

"Home address?"

&#x200B;

And a bunch of other messages that are all just like that. I had her block my number and I plan on getting a new phone.
