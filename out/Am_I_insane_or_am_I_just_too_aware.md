Does this also happen to y’all daily?

Ever since I was a kid, I feel like someone is calling me even when they are not. it goes like “(my name).” then i ask “why mom, why brother?” or “what?” and they say “what do you mean?” and i just let it pass by saying “nothing, i must have misheard.” like that.

Until, it happens daily. And I spoke up, “you definitely called me, don’t play around.” and then they will act like I am not the normal one.

But then, it also happens when I am home alone. I am watching anime and random youtube videos at a certainly high volume or so. And then I will hear uncanning sounds and will pause the video to hear it more clearly, but everytime I do, it is very silent and the sound has disappeared.

I figured I am the one so jumpy and paranoid. But until now that I grew old, it still happens. I, who now live with my aunt, who works at day and comes home at night. We live in an apartment and of course, I ensure the doors are always locked when I am home alone. I always get home first because my school ends at 3-4 pm and her works ends at 6-7 pm. So, she has the need to knock before I open it.

At least thrice a week, I hear knocking at the door and I open it, only to find no one there.

Another thing is this, it doesn’t happen daily as the noise thing one.

Randomly, I get this feeling of being scared to open anything. As I mentioned before, I need to open the door for my aunt but I’m scared that one day I am to see something different than “no one” and my aunt.

Sometimes, even when I am about to sleep and I turned off the lights and close my eyes. I am scared to open them again because I might see something none of us wants to.

Even when I am washing my face with soap, I am scared to open my eyes again. Sometimes, I get so paranoid and my heart beat races up just imagining what I could see the next moment, I force my eyes open. It stings with soap sometimes but worse could’ve happened if I didn’t.

Bonus thing, is that I also see shits from my peripheral visions (not as daily as the other two things) that makes me jump and terrified as hell. It is always someone peeking at me, I don’t know but as I write this, I got an idea it might also be the one calling me. What if the few times I saw it is the times it failed to hide ever since I was a kid? But that is just another supernatural unbelievable shit. 

I have never opened this up to anyone because they might say I am overthinking it. So I am asking y’all.

I can say that my biggest fear is to see a person grinning eye to eye that looks uncanny with a weird smile like in those fictional horror movies I see. But what if? Please no for God’s sake, I am scaring the hell out of me. 

Please help me avoid this feeling and give me a head-ups if you all are experiencing the same bullshit.
