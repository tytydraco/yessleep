Priyam had long justified her actions. Prior to being married, she had to stand out and be the most youthful, most beautiful in her friend group. She has famously told every single one of her friends and haters that she will remain youthful even in her old age because it's simply genetics and because she's always beloved. It is not delusion, in fact, she has proven it by stealing every single one of her friend's boyfriends. Their loyalty means nothing to Priyam because her beauty, huge brown eyes, youthful chiseled face, pouty pink lips, gorgeous black hair and her charming and young personality always wins them over. She understands how to be a pick-me girl that the men will surely adore. In fact, that's how she met her husband. He was another lady's fiance but Priyam is more fun, more lovable, and thus, her husband left the sad old lady to pursue her.

Now, while she enjoys her life, she was bored. She has turned 30 and was married, yes, but to a man who was now, distant, preoccupied with his own ambitions, and rarely home. When Roger visited India for business, something changed. He was her manager, but his attention had felt different. Unlike anyone else, he truly saw her for who she is, or so she convinced herself. Priyam believed the universe was finally evening things out.

Over the next few months, Priyam seduced Roger with careful skill - inflecting her voice with such playful innocence, talking about her love for the simple things that he also loves, like music and guitars, and about how she missed affection and wanting a family with him. She let her long hair frame her face just so, and each time he left, she added a playful text or sent a racy picture, keeping him tethered to her. Roger didn’t and couldn't resist. Instead, he showered her with special projects, late-night calls, and messages of admiration. With time, his obsession grew, overshadowing even his family life. He has come to believe that his life is meant to be with Priyam. Priyam is now Roger's number one priority.

One night, after a particularly intense call, Roger’s wife—suspicious of his late-night office “meetings”—walked in on him. When she entered his study, she saw him transfixed, with Priyam’s half-dressed body filling the screen. Priyam clutched her pink sweater to her naked full breasts. Roger turned to see and realized his wife, the woman he can not wait to leave for Priyam, was standing right behind him.

Furious, Roger's wife slapped the keyboard in an attempt to throw it down but failed. What neither of them realized was that her outburst had hit the broadcast key, sending the entire video call to their office network. Names popped up as coworkers, and even some senior management who were still online as late as Roger and Priyam was on their "special late night project", joined the accidental group chat. Roger’s wife screamed, calling him a narcissist, a cheater, and railing about Priyam—“of all people, that scheming brown hussy!”

When Priyam returned to the office the next day, everyone knew. Roger was offline and no one was there to defend her, unlike what he's done in so many situations before when she was late or made a mistake with a client. Priyam was miserable, Roger was not anywhere today, not even on social media.

As the gossip spread, Priyam found herself isolated, the center of a scandal that seemed to follow her every step. She shrugged it off. The beauty of not having friends is that she never had to carry this home and her husband will be none the wiser, just that she's wanting a new job. This did take a toll though, because Roger didn't console her after. He should have. Could he have gone back to his wife? His wife looked so tired and ugly and old! Definitely needed to be younger for Roger to enjoy. She mentally compared herself to the woman she saw. She was a racist old hag and her boobs needed work. Priyam still felt bad, and tried to hold on to her confidence, her sense of allure. She reminded herself that beauty and youth had always been her weapons, her shield against the judgment of others.

That night, after her long bath, she stared into her mirror naked, admiring her youth and beauty. But she suddenly couldn’t ignore the crawling sensation beneath her skin. When she looked closer, she saw faint, ghostly handprints covering her arms, her neck, her face. They were familiar, like echoes of past lovers, clinging to her skin as if refusing to let go. She scrubbed at them furiously, but they only grew darker, spreading like shadows across her body.

In the silence of her room, faint whispers filled the air—Roger's voice, her husband's voice, every single boyfriend she stole, every man she's seduced, each one asking why she discarded them, their bitterness sharp and cold. She closed her eyes, but the voices grew louder, the handprints pressed harder, like invisible hands tightening their grip.

She screamed and smashed her fists at the mirror. Her beauty, her youth, everything she’d used to her advantage, now marked her as a prisoner of her vanity, a reflection she could never escape. She grabbed a piece of the glass and cut the handprint that seems to belong to Roger, she felt a sense of relief as a portion of her breast dripped with blood. The handprint seems to be gone now... perhaps she can do the same to the others all over her body.
