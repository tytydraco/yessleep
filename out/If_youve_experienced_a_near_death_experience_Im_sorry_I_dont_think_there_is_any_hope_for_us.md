The first time I was made aware of my predicament was after finishing my exams. It was a late, cold December night and I was desperate to just get home as quickly as possible. Beyond the blistering cold, I was exhausted from the days of cramming I did in order to prepare for the final. Not that it did much good; I was fairly certain that I’d absolutely bombed the fluid mechanics portion. What little brain power I had left was wasted on calculating how big of a curve I would need in order pass the class, so I was mainly traversing back on autopilot. At one point, my subconscious mind became aware of a faint neon orange hand and I made a stop at the crosswalk. I convinced myself it was pointless to think about the exam any longer and let out a shallow sigh as my mind then wondered how my schedule would look like if I had to retake the course. The crosswalk signal changed to usher me forward. I had only taken a few steps when something broke me out of my trance. All I could feel was a rapidly rising sense of unease and I turned my head in search of the source. My eyes were met with a blindingly bright light and for just a few moments, it seemed like everything was frozen in place. I had a brief thought about how odd it was the humans have a shared experience of time slowing down when they’re near death. I then wondered how I knew that I was about to die. After all, my sleep addled brain still couldn’t make out what exactly I was looking at.  Maybe this was the light at the end of the tunnel everyone spoke of, I thought. As the light inched closer, my final thought was accepting that this was going to be my fate.

And yet, at the last possible moment, the car managed the veer to the left. The sound of screeching tires fading away was what finally made me aware that I was still alive. My heart was beating at a rapid pace and I could feel my blood loudly thrashing in my ears. My mind was racing but I couldn’t seem to be thinking of anything as I made it back to my house. I made it to my room before I realized that I was still shaking. The adrenaline was fading and I had barely managed to collapse onto my bed before the thoughts came flooding through. I was nearly killed. It was maybe a foot or two that separated me and certain death. Would I really have been okay had I died today? Would I be able to say that I had no regrets? I quickly came up with a resounding no. There was so much that I wanted to do; so many things to try and experience. I got up to my desk and booted up my computer. I couldn't go to sleep after nearly just dying anyway. There, I planned out what I wanted to do. What I *needed* to do. No longer would I be content with my milquetoast lifestyle. I swore upon myself that from that day forth, Memento Mori would be engraved upon my very being. If any day could very well be my last, I was sure as hell going to live more like it. How ironic would things turn out knowing what I do now. How tragic. If there is any respite to be had, it would be that those few months of blissful ignorance were probably the most that I’d ever lived in my entire life. Perhaps if I wasn’t so curious, or maybe if things had just been a little different, I could have been able to enjoy it for just a tiny bit more. I wish from the bottom of my heart that it could’ve lasted just a bit longer.

Those few months went just about how you would expect it to. I was reinvigorated. I was filled to the brim with the kind of energy that only those who have been confronted with their mortality have tasted. No longer was failure a fear that shackled my decisions. I would embark on novel experiences and projects. Successes and failures both followed, but I only felt jubilation. Failures only served to spur me forward, while successes pushed me towards different ventures. I was riding the high of my mania. As Camus put it, one should “live to the point of tears,” and I made sure to do so. I was much more outgoing than I had been in the past. New connections formed and I found myself a part of different groups, each with their own way of seeking to get the most out of life. Two of these groups would send me down the path I find myself ensnared in now.

The first group was your typical thrill-seeking type of people. I really enjoyed my time with them. They lived life on the edge and they slowly turned me into an adrenaline junkie like them. They eased me into it starting with roller coasters. That soon evolved into downhill skiing, which migrated to cliff jumping, and finally sky diving. I can remember going into the airplane without a shred of anxiety. If anything, I was restless with anticipation. I couldn’t wait to take the leap and add another experience under my belt.

Eventually, the plane made it to altitude over the jump sight and one by one, my friends made their way out of the airplane. I was 4th in line and was jumping tandem with an instructor. We made it out just fine and began our rapid descent towards the ground. It was exhilarating feeling the wind billow around me from every direction once we were in the air. It felt like I was flying. I was still taking in everything when I noticed that the jumpers that were in front of me had already deployed their parachutes and were now at a higher altitude than us. I tried to turn my head towards the instructor but wasn’t able to see him completely. Regardless, I knew something was wrong. We were getting uncomfortably close to the ground with no signs of slowing down. Finally, I felt something come loose and looked up to see the parachute deploy…with my hopes dashed immediately as the entire parachute had been cut away from backpack. I reckoned we couldn’t be more than 1000 feet away from the ground and still we were falling fast. Seconds went by and again I had the thought of acceptance of my fate. I closed my eyes and braced myself the best I could when I felt a yank in my shoulders. The instructor managed to get the reserve parachute open. We managed to survive despite the rough landing, but it was cutting it extremely close. I thought I'd simply gotten lucky again. I didn’t learn my lesson that day.

The second group were psychonauts. They experimented with psychedelics and soon, I dabbled with them. By this point, there was no need for them to ease me in. I was ready to dive in the deep end with them without hesitation. Foolish words I know, but at the time, I was brimming over with confidence and thought I could handle anything. Acid was a mainstay, as were magic mushrooms. Sometimes we would branch out, but we were loath to do any reagent testing, so we stuck with the ole reliables. One day, one of us received a batch of MDMA for cheap and the entire group was eager to try it out. She had always come through with great quality stuff. We all took what should’ve been a normal dose and had a little kick back. How tragically stupid we were not the test it to make sure that it was pure. The batch was tainted with fentanyl and most of us overdosed. Four people died that day. I managed to get the only dud.

Once was luck, twice was a coincidence, but three times? Three brushes with death and surviving each time miraculously was something that I couldn’t believe was just happenstance. Perhaps it was my curiosity, or maybe it was my survivor’s guilt, but I was determined to get to the bottom of this. I had some trepidation, but I knew there was no other option but to test it. Once again, I would dive into the deep end, spurred on by some feeling of invincibility. The revolver sat in my hand. I diligently loaded one bullet into the chamber and spun the barrel. I gently placed the barrel to the roof of my mouth and… CLICK. I placed the gun back down and for a second wondered if I’ve truly lost it.

I repeated that every day for a week. At the end of the week, I tested the bullet and sure enough, it fired into the dirt without a hitch. I kept up this routine for the entire month and made it through unscathed. I didn’t want to face the forlorn conclusion that had sprouted from the back of my mind. I decided to go all in and play Russian roulette with a Glock. Again, no dice. If a bullet won’t fire, then a rope would do the job just as well right…? Of course not. It proved just as futile as the guns did. Three separate times I would try to hang myself and three separate ropes would snap or rip conveniently. At my wits end, I climbed to the tallest skyscraper in my city and prepared to jump. I glanced down, certain that there would be no possible way of surviving this fall. I steeled myself and jumped. Wouldn’t you know it, a gust of wind blew me back through a window one floor down. I couldn’t believe what had just happened. Lying there on the floor, all I could do was let out a pained chuckle. I was now faced with the reality that I *couldn’t* die. See I told you it was ironic. From having your entire identity being based upon a saying meaning “remember you have to die” to realizing you might be immortal. Isn’t that hilarious?

From then I tried to understand why I couldn’t die. I spent a few years chasing possible leads. I tried any and all possibilities, ranging from spirituality to scientific. All that led me to my running hypothesis; I am quantumly immortal. It’s a bit of a complicated topic, but in a gist, every single instance where there is a possibility that I die, the universe splits into two versions. There is one version where I die and my consciousness ceases to exist, and there is the other, where I continue to be the conscious observer. It’s a coin flip every time to decide which one I am. Somehow, I am always sent into the universe where I am alive and still observing. If this hypothesis ends up being true however, then it isn’t only constrained to me. Every person out there is a possible observer. It could be you and you’d have no way of knowing unless, like me, you’ve had some brushes with death. The only other alternative I could come up with is that there is a cruel, cruel God and they enjoy my suffering. For my sake I hope it is merely a cruel God because that means one day, he might get bored and end this hellish torment. For your sake, I too hope this cruel God only has his sights set on me.

To date, I’ve tried to kill myself 255 times. 255 times have I flipped the coin, and 255 times has it landed on heads. I want you to understand the sheer improbability of such a thing happening. It’s about one in 5.39 ⋅ 10\^67. It really is a mind-boggling number. I take mental damage just trying to perceive it.  A guy called Scott Czepiel ran some similar numbers and he put it into perspective. Deal yourself five cards once every billion years, and then buy yourself a lottery ticket every time you get a royal flush. If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand Canyon. Now start over until you fill up the Grand Canyon. Once you’ve done that a million times, the amount of time that has passed hasn’t even reached 0.0001% of 5.39 ⋅ 10\^67 seconds. And this was just the times that I purposefully sought out death. There would be countless times that I was near death and yet still avoided it. Thus, I’m entirely certain I’m immortal.

You might be wondering what’s so dreadful about my predicament at this point. Perhaps this is more of a blessing than a curse but unfortunately, I cannot see it that way. Ever since I had an inkling of my predicament, I've tried to ignore the nightmarish crux of my predicament. What kind of fate must I endure if I am to live forever? Already I’ve had people that I cared about die. That is simply the fate of all that live. And yet I am now removed from that cycle. Will I be forced to see all that I care about die, leaving me behind? What of my own body? My consciousness will survive, but what use will it be if it is trapped within an immobile prison? I’m certain that I will bear witness to many atrocities and tragedies in this near infinite future of mine. It is the primordial fear of the unknown that strikes me most to my core. All that I know is that I will undoubtedly suffer, because I know that there is no end. However, what is worse is not knowing what fates await me in this eternity. Currently I am barely afloat in an ocean. I can feel myself sinking and I know that it won't be long before I succumb. I look around and know that there is nowhere to save me, nowhere I can swim to. I can only go down. Whenever I fall beneath the surface, I can only see the depths of the abyss. It seems impossible to even imagine there being a bottom to it, let alone what might be waiting for me there.

My only solace and the only reason I still continue with these attempts is that I’m giving another version of me the escape that he so desperately desires. For the versions of me that are lucky enough to have the coin land on tails, I envy you. There is no hope for me. I am to be the consciousness that is forever denied the embrace of death. Even still, I continue. Perhaps a small part of me still believes that there’s a chance that I will succeed, or it is simply to spite the absurd fate that I find myself in.

Attempt number 256; I inject the potassium chloride into my vein. In my head, I envision myself rolling a boulder to the top of a hill. I pass out and awaken hours later. I close my eyes and see the boulder come crashing down the other side. But I will continue trying. For as long as I'm able. One must imagine Sisyphus is happy.
