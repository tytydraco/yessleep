Fumbling through the keys on my lanyard I stood outside my door trying to find the right one to fit the slot. Unlocking the door I made my way up the two flights of stairs to yet another door which I had to perform the same ritual of finding the right key that fits the lock. Unlocking the second door I entered the kitchen and immediately went for a beer from the fridge; dragging my tired body through the house, I pushed the door open to my room to retrieve my towel and a fresh set of clothes.



The house had been silent since I got home, my roommates still out at work or somewhere else enjoying their lives. A deep sigh found its way out of my body. Popping my beer I grabbed my towel and made my way to the bathroom. The door creaked open as I pushed against it, stepping in I swung the door shut and set the latch. Pulling my phone out of my pocket I opened it, hit play on the spotify app and set it on the sink. “Run” by the Foo Fighters started blaring from the speakers I stood there contemplating what had gone so wrong today. Pushing these thoughts from my mind I cranked the faucet on the tub and stripped down. 



Stepping into the shower I let the hot water rush over as I tried to let my inhibitions melt away. I did the old scrub down routine occasionally taking sips from my beer as I enjoyed the hot shower. It was almost soothing to me in a way, having that shower beer after a long day at work, it was a nice pat on the back saying that the day is over, to go and relax. Time was of no essence to me, I could stand there forever just letting that hot water rush over every fibre of my being. My water heater however had other plans slowly the water went from hot to warm then dropped right down to cold. An audible “fuck!” found it way out of my mouth as I shut the water off.



A little annoyed I grabbed my towel wiping myself down then dressing myself. I removed my phone from its previous place and hit pause right in the middle of “Erase Me” by kid cuddi



Setting my phone on my desk, I set my head down on my pillow relaxing every muscle in my body. This was my favorite part of the day, being able to completely relax and put the days events behind me.



As my eyelids grew heavier I could see the events that had weighed on me, almost slipping out of my consciousness releasing the stressful day that weighed so much on me. Feeling the guilt of waking up late for work drifting away, my eyelids grew heavier. Putting it behind me I fell further into my sleep, regretting my choice to drink a bit too much the night before flew away with my ability to give a fuck. 



The day was over all I had to worry about was the day to come. Falling further into sleep the days events flashed through my mind, Being late, damaging the part at work, being stuck on the old sandblaster trying to cut the grime and paint of the set of rims, sweating my ass off for multiple hours while my boss questioned why I worked there, my car shitting the bed on my way home. All of it behind me, problems I could deal with tomorrow, for now all I cared about was getting sleep to deal with tomorrow's problems. The lull of my deep sleep was about to overtake me, everything I had dealt with was about to be behind me, but then I saw IT. That slight flicker of movement from the corner of my eye, A shadow cast on my ceiling seemed to shudder ever so slightly. 



My eyes flew open alert to this anomaly staring daggers at what appeared to be a man with an arm unnaturally long on one side and a strange squared off nub on the other. Quizzically I stared almost too long at this figure that took up a portion of my ceiling. It must’ve been a figment of my dreary mind, my eyes were playing tricks on me that's all it was. I scoffed letting my eyes fall back into their natural position at the wall across from my bed, but my curiosity got the better of me. What exactly had cast that shadow? I scanned my room seeing what could possibly make that shape. My eyes fell on my fan, an old relic of my past life, hardly holding itself together with duct tape and a zip tie for the cover that hung below the open blades. A surge protector with an LED power button illuminated the fan above it with a deep green hue showing it was on.



I laughed at myself feeling childish that something so simple had frightened me. Putting my nerves behind me I let my eyes rest back into position ready to be consumed by the much needed sleep I was so ready for. As the kids of my eyes closed, I swear, just for a split second, I saw it again. The shudder. 



The movement that had driven the deep animalistic feelings of danger that drilled itself into my very being. Again my eyes flew wide open staring at this figure cast upon my wall, I couldn’t look away, Something in my very being said if I looked away it would take me. Consume me. Everything in my being said to get the fuck out of that room, my body said run, but my mind still searched for a reasonable explanation. 



It must've been the exhaustion of my day taking a toll on me, that's the only reasonable explanation I could come up with. I forced my eyes closed, trying to put these feelings of uneasiness behind me. It was just a trick of the mind, I told myself, the exhaustion was taking a toll on my mental health. Thats all it was, My mental health fleeting, I clearly pushed myself too hard and now I was paying for it. And yet, that creeping dread stuck in the back of my mind, what if I was wrong? What if I wasn’t over analyzing this, What if it was real! 



My eyes shot open right to where the shadow was. It was still there! as still as ever, I let out a light chuckle, of course it didn’t move it was clearly just a shadow. My eyes fell back to the wall, nothing to worry about. 



I should've never taken my eyes off of it, I should’ve turned my lights on, I should’ve done something about it! And yet I foolishly let my sleep deprived body take control of me. 



As my eyes fell back to the wall the shadow darted out of sight, gone from the illumination of the fan. It was then that I felt a cold almost slimy tentacle slither across my back and into my ear, too fast for me to react, it had entered through my ear canal, into my brain. I thought I was safe, I was in MY house, MY room, MY sanctuary, and yet I was helpless against this ethereal being.



Then I heard it, inside my head,”Your body is Mine now.” I shot out of bed, rushing for the light switch not 3 feet away from me. But something wouldn’t allow me to reach it, my body wouldn’t respond, I stood there in the center of my room petrified. The light from the power surge illuminated my face, one which had taken on the form of true terror. I tried to push myself ahead toward the light switch but it just WOULDN’T reach it. 



I whimpered, ”what the fuck” as I struggled to reach my arm out to the light switch.



 A deep guttural cackle rung from within my head, “ Like I said, your body is mine now.” 



I tried to scream, I tried to move, I tried to do anything to make my body respond but it wouldn’t. I stood there frozen in the center of my room not even a mere 3 feet from my light switch. So close, and yet it felt like lightyears away, I managed to stammer out a, “Wha… what do you want.” through my shaking voice.



The voice rung deep again,”Are you FUCKING stupid, I told you already twice, once more and you’ll regret it.”



“I’m sorry.” I pleaded with the voice, I broke down in a contorted crying fit. My face twisting in pain and sorrow. 



Through the tears I managed a simple word I’d used many times before but never in this context, ”why.”



The voice laughed again almost out of enjoyment of my predicament. It rung again through my head again,”To be honest, I simply needed a vessel.”



I broke down harder, tears streaming from my face. Begging with the being inside me I said," I'll do whatever you want, please just give me back control of my body."



It laughed as if it was finding amusement out of my suffering. “You see boy I needed a vessel and you just so happened to fall in line with what I needed, together we will wreak havoc on the world and cause pain and suffering to all who fall in front of us.”



I broke down further, struggling to flick the light on, but to no avail. Again the cackle rang out throughout my head. “You think a measly lightbulb is going to do anything to me? Here let me show you.”



My body almost felt like the control over it was released and in a slow mechanical movement my legs started moving forward in a poor display of what one would call walking. My hand now trembling hovered over the light switch and in a brisk movement it flipped it to its on position. The light sprawled across the room banishing the darkness around me and illuminated my surroundings.



The cackle came once again from within my head. “ I told you, you're mine! And once I’ve gotten hold i’ll never let go, don’t worry though once you fully comply you’ll get a semblance of control again. It’s just a matter of trust between us that I am looking for.”



Tears streaming down my face I was able to mutter, ”What are you planning to do with me?”



A massive roar let out from within and my body shot forward towards the wall, my head started beating itself into the nearest surface until all I could see were stars. The much needed sleep came for me once I had bloodied my head to the point I knew there would be irreparable damage. Everything went black.



I woke up in the hospital, trying to move, only to be stopped by the restraints someone had placed on my body, if I could even call it that anymore. I struggled trying to get loose but it was no use, I was secured to the bed with no hope of escape. The only thing I could do was scream, which I did, and naturally it attracted the attention of a nurse who came rushing in to my side, who promptly injected some drug into a tube leading to my arm.



From what I could tell it was a sedative because as soon as the fluid shot through the tube my nerves were dulled and I once again became complacent to a different kind of demon.



She explained to me that I had a nervous breakdown and bashed my head against the wall, screaming to the point I had knocked myself unconscious. At that point my roommates had called an ambulance for me and they ushered me to a psych ward after getting treatment for the damage done to my forehead. She explained how the restraints were there to help me and how if I had been alone I would have most likely died from the blood loss.



I tried explaining to her what had happened before my “break” The shadow demon, my inability to move, the shuddering of the shadow. Which understandably led to a psych evaluation with a professional.



This doctor explained to me that I had a severe case of schizophrenia and it was usual for men my age to develop it around this time. He had said it had driven me to do everything that I had done to myself and that's why I was restrained. 



Despite what I had tried to convey to these “professionals” They looked at me as if I was a lost puppy, I could see the sympathy in their eyes as they shoveled medication into my mouth and forced me to swallow. Another demon had taken my body, something that would make me more complacent, something that would make me more malleable, and yet, through the daze from the drugs I could hear it, that deep low cackle ringing throughout my head and with it one last phrase from the monster within me.



“I told you, you’d regret it.”
