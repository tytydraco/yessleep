Pop’s Grocery was the kind of place that sold bait in the morning and beer in the evening, a little bit of everything but a lot of nothing, all at a higher price than what the big supermarket chains could afford. The dusty two-lane road in front of Pop’s hadn’t seen much traffic since the highway was built; weeds grew in the cracks of its asphalt parking lot. The white-painted brick was peeling; the lights were dim; the shelves, half empty.

The place hurt to look at, especially since I could remember what it used to be like. I’d grown up shopping there with my grandfather, and back then, Pop’s grocery was the heart of the community.  
When I moved back to my hometown, I wanted to save it–

And I had a feeling that the data was on my side. 

Upscale suburbs and shipping warehouses were sprouting like mushrooms all around Pop’s; the county’s tax base and population were growing for a change. People were passing be the old store again, people with empty refrigerators and growling stomachs, who might be willing to pay a little more to shop locally–

Or so I hoped. 

The plan had looked fine on paper, when the impossibly-large quantities of money involved were all just imaginary; real life, however, was a different story. My heart was in my throat as I walked into the Manager’s Office to begin the negotiations; I could feel the employees watching me, knowing that everything was about to be in my hands.If I screwed this up, I wouldn’t be the only one going bankrupt. 

The Manager’s Office itself didn’t exactly give the impression of modernity and success: soggy greenish-gray carpet, mismatched furniture, stained ceiling tiles and ugly yellow walls. I moved to close the door, but Steve Kelch, the fourth-generation owner of the place, shook his head:

“Leave it open.”

He reached into his desk and offered me an ancient cigar. I realized that as far as Steve was concerned, the negotiations were already over: Pop’s Grocery was mine, and he was glad to see it go. I was honestly surprised: the numbers he’d shown me about the store’s profits were bad, but they weren’t that bad. Pop’s had been in the Kelch family for over seventy years, and I’d expected Steve to put up more of a fight. Instead, he’d told me about his plans to retire to Florida and said that his lawyer would be in touch. 

The amount of information I had to take in during those first days was overwhelming. I misplaced documents, mixed up the names and faces of my new employees, and felt a deepening sense of dread as Steve Kelch walked me through the store, cheerfully explaining all the work that needed to be done.

I stayed late that first Friday night, wandering through Pop’s Grocery after closing time at 8:30.   
I needed to clear my head, to remind myself why I was doing all this in the first place. I ran my fingers along the polished chrome of the dairy section, admired the neon signs and checkered tiles. Alone in the old store after hours, I had the uncanny feeling that I was back in the past–like no time had passed at all. 

A loud crash jolted me out of my reminiscing. I felt the blood rush from my face: I had locked the doors. Nobody else should have been in the store! 

Was someone taking advantage of the chaotic transition, using it as an opportunity to steal from Pop’s? They would have to be desperate or insane to rob a failing grocery store. Desperate, insane…maybe violent. 

Just a few days ago, I had read an article about a meth addict who had crushed a man’s skull during a mugging gone wrong. I didn’t think that my little hometown had a major drug problem…but then again, I had been away for a long time.

“Hello?” I called out. My voice echoed strangely  in the empty space. Without the beeping checkout lanes and background conversations, the silence in Pop’s felt ominous, even menacing. I found myself looking nervously over my shoulder as I jogged toward the source of the noise, somewhere in the back of the cereal section. 

Two minutes later I paused, panting.The end of the aisle wasn’t any closer. In fact, it was like I hadn’t moved at all. I took a deep breath, trying to get myself under control. It wasn’t possible. Physics didn’t work like that–

Yet when I ran all-out toward the glowing neon sign above the “DELI” section, it actually seemed to get further away. The lights flickered suddenly; it felt like a warning.  Hadn’t Steve Kelch said that the wiring in Pop’s needed to be updated? That the power sometimes just…went out?   
Panicking, I turned backward in the direction I’d come from–

But I could no longer see the front of the store. It was lost in hazy darkness. 

I could feel myself beginning to hyperventilate. To get my breathing under control, I tried to center my attention on the products around me. At first, they looked just like the standard bakery items available in any supermarket…but only at first.

“BRED.” Read the plastic-wrap loaf in front of me. I almost laughed. It was a misprint, it had to be–  
The stuff inside was greenish-black and lumpy. I was reaching out for it when it flopped off of the shelf and landed on the beige tile floor in front of me. It flailed wildly, like the contents were trying to gnaw their way out. 

I backed away with a shudder. The products looked almost exactly like ones I knew, but there was something wrong with all of them, I could feel it–and that wasn’t all. Was it just me, or was something moving in the next aisle? I didn't call out any greeting this time. I didn't know what was going on, but I was certain of one thing: someone, or *something* in Pop's grocery wished me harm. 

CREAK. A hideous metallic groan boomed through the store, so loud it felt like the walls themselves were being rearranged. I glanced up at the neon “DELI” sign; it looked as far away as a distant star, but at least it gave me something to move toward…as quickly and quietly as I could. Ten minutes passed, then twenty. All I could do was keep walking. 

CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAKKKK!

That metallic groan was closer now, and louder, too. I sprinted, careless of the dizzying way the aisle stretched out beneath my feet. Just when I thought I couldn’t run any further, the fluorescent lights overhead began to flicker out one by one. Darkness closed in on me like a wave. Instinct had taken over, the animal part of my brain pushing my aching legs beyond what they would ordinarily have been capable of–

I nearly slipped on the oversized cereal box on the floor in front of me.   
I stared at it stupidly, suddenly remembering why I’d gone down the aisle in the first place. Looking back over my shoulder, the lights were back on…and I could hear footsteps. 

“Can I get that for you, honey?” 

A scream rose in my throat when I heard the woman’s husky voice, but it was just Irene: the longest-serving employee of Pop’s Grocery. The original “Pop” had hired her when she was a teenager, and (according to local gossip) she’d also raised three of his illegitimate children. Their names (Debbie, Snyder, and Oscar) were allegedly based on the product boxes atop which they’d been conceived. I supposed the kids were lucky that none of them had ended up with Kit-Kat or Ho-Ho. 

“What are you doing here?” I demanded, with all the authority of a limp noodle. 

“Well, somebody locked the front door while I was having a smoke…” Irene grinned “...so I had to come around back.” I checked my watch. I’d been running down that horrible aisle for what felt like hours; how could it be that just five minutes had passed?! Irene’s watchful green eyes took in the sweat on my forehead and my pale, frightened face. She chose her next words carefully:

“It’s not a good idea to be all alone in a big store like this. You never know what might happen. You okay?” 

I nodded…but I practically clung to Irene’s apron strings as she finished locking up and headed into the foggy parking lot for one last cigarette. 

“I remember you, you know,” she said suddenly when we reached our cars. “You used to come in here with your grandpa. He’d buy fish bait, diet soda, and a cheese’n’egg sandwich–every Saturday morning, like clockwork. He used to push you around in his shopping cart…” she exhaled a cloud of smoke and looked back at the dark hulk of Pop’s Grocery. “You really think you can turn this place around?”

“I hope so,” I answered honestly. 

“Me too. I got grandkids to feed, and God knows my deadbeat daughters aren’t gonna get jobs themselves.” Irene hopped into her driver’s seat with the agility of someone half her age. I swallowed nervously and bent down beside her driver’s-side window. 	

“Look, uh…” I began. None of the books I’d read on management had a chapter on how to thank an employee who’d just saved your life.

“It probably isn’t a good idea to hang around the parking lot for too long, either…” Irene said pointedly–then revved her engine and winked. With a smile, I slid behind the wheel of my own car and followed her tail lights into the [darkness](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify).
