I shouldn’t have been here.

I climbed the fence, scraped my palms, and felt the dirt steady beneath my shoes. I’d run until my lungs burned—and somehow, I was standing in the hotel’s front yard again, staring at its lobby doors like I had never left.

The lamps glowed too warm. The place didn’t resist me. It welcomed me back.

My chest tightened. No footsteps. No alarm. Just silence heavy enough to crush breath.

I pushed the wide doors open. The lobby was thinner now. Fewer staff, each movement too quiet, too exact. Their eyes didn’t follow me, but I felt them brush past me—cold fingers when I wasn’t looking.

I walked. One step, two—then without passing an elevator, without turning a corridor, I was already at my room door. My hand was on the knob.

Someone was inside.

I eased it open. Luna and Solis sat waiting. Both lifted their heads at the same time, eyes fastening on me. They gestured me in.

The window drew me first. It wasn’t night anymore. Pale morning light seeped through, not gold, not warm—just flat gray, heavy as clouded glass.

*“Are you okay?”* Luna asked, gentle, careful.  

“You should be enjoying the party, not sneaking away,” Solis added, swaying slightly, as if the music was playing in his head.

I didn’t answer. Not sure what to answer. Because… I wasn’t sure if I could actually trust them.

*“You can trust us,”* they said in unison.

Every hair on my body stood on end.

My skin prickled, but I forced myself to stay still. I couldn’t let them see how much that rattled me.

Yet beneath their voices, beneath the hush of the room, I felt it: a presence on the other side of the door. Not sound. Not movement. Just pressure, quiet and patient, like a weight leaning against the wall. Waiting for me to notice.

And worse—I felt I knew it. Familiar in a way that clawed at the edges of memory.

A hand closed on my arm, snapping me back.

Solis. His grin didn’t ease me—it split wider, stretched too long, like he’d been wearing it for hours.

“Shall we go back to the party? See you later,” he said.

His voice was light—and heavy at the same time.

Luna rose without a word, following him to the door.

As it swung open, I couldn’t resist. I leaned, eyes pulling toward the corridor.

The hallway stretched out, dim in the gray light. Empty… almost. At the far end, the shadows seemed to breathe—thickening, pooling together into something that wasn’t quite a figure, but wasn’t nothing either.

My chest clenched. It was still there.

I drifted back toward the bed, as if retreating might make the room smaller, safer.

My shoulder brushed the window.

Below, the party still churned. I looked down to check the partygoers.

Without warning, it froze.

Like a cord pulled taut, everything stopped.

Dozens of heads tilted upward.

Every eye locked on me.

And they *smiled*.

In perfect unison.

\---

I stumbled backward, chest hammering so hard it shook in my ears. My mind screamed one thing—I need to get out. I have to.

I lurched toward the door, but froze. Escape wasn’t that simple. If I ran blind, the shifting halls would eat me alive.

*A map. I needed a map.*

The thought pressed into me—not mine, not fully.

Like someone had whispered it just before I could think it myself. I didn’t want to obey. But I did.

My hand snapped to the floor plan pinned to the wall. I ripped it down, paper crumpling in my fist, and yanked the door open.

The corridor stretched ahead. Wrong.

Half-light, half-dark. The bulbs on the ceiling glowed, but the floor was drowned in black, as if the ground itself didn’t want to exist. No rooms. No signs. Just mine behind me, and the corner ahead.

I stepped out, nerves screaming.

Then I ran.

No hands grabbed me. No shadows lunged. But the feeling clung anyway, crawling under my skin. The walls, the ceiling, even the floor seemed alive. Watching. Waiting. The hallway didn’t move, yet every step made it feel tighter, like it was folding shut around me. Like it wanted me inside.

And still—I kept running.

Until I reached the corner, breath ragged, adrenaline burning, where the dim light pooled like the last spark of a dying star.

I sank down at the corner, the dim light above like a spotlight pinning me in place. Everything beyond its reach was swallowed in black, thick and endless. I had no idea where the exits were—not at this rate, not in this maze.

Good thing I had grabbed the map. My hands shook as I unfolded it, paper crumpling in my grip. I searched for escape routes… but every path, every arrow, every line led to one place.

The manager’s office.

\---

I have no choice but to follow the path. The hall shifted, but I didn’t stop. Until—dead end. The map demanded forward.

I hesitated. My eyes darted around, searching for another way. Could there be a hidden door? A passage I hadn’t seen? I rapped on the walls, listened for hollow echoes. Nothing. I peered over my shoulder—maybe the space behind me had opened? Nope. Just an empty corridor where I came from.

And then… it felt different. A darkness behind me slowly crept approaching me, *pressing*, *bulging*, as if ***chasing me***. Panic clawed at me. I spun, checked the sides, tried the ceiling, kicked at the floor. ***Nothing budged.***

Then — a low, grinding pressure crept downward from above. Slowly. Unforgiving. I dropped to my knees, but the ceiling kept coming, inching closer, forcing me lower, pressing until I was flat on the ground.

I tried to roll, and crawl in desperation for escape, but the floor…

The tiles against my back were not solid anymore. They pulsed, soft, as if breathing with me. I felt myself dip, my body sinking, swallowed inch by inch into the floor. I clawed at the air, heart hammering, but the ground kept taking me—up to my shoulders, my throat—like the hotel itself was pulling me under.

I blinked.

And everything reset.

The dead end was gone. The hallway stretched forward.

And I was no longer on the floor.

I was standing.

I hadn’t moved.

At the far end, a sign glowed faintly:

Manager’s Office.

\---

I approached, every step dragging, my knees trembling. The map still pointed here. But could I even trust it? This thing had led me through shifting walls and lies—what if it was just bait? Each step forward felt like handing myself over, like saying, Fine, do whatever you want with me.

The door creaked when I pushed it open. I peeked inside to see.

The room was empty. Old. Dust choked the air, coating the cracked walls. The paint had melted into pale streaks. Cabinets slumped to one side, half-open like they’d given up. But the desk and chair—untouched, still standing proud in the center, though blanketed with decades of dust.

I slid inside, slow, wary. My eyes roamed the room. On the walls and scattered across the desks were faded awards and certificates—tokens of the hotel’s golden days. Best in hospitality, five-star accolades, a pride that once filled these halls. 

I couldn’t stop. My hand found a drawer and tugged. It resisted, then gave with a rasping groan.

Inside—papers, brittle and yellow, curled at the edges. I sifted through them, careful, though they crumbled at my touch.

Photographs.

Black-and-white faces frozen in cheer, guests in gowns and tuxedos, champagne flutes raised under chandeliers that glittered brighter than stars. A lobby grander than anything I had stepped through. Staff in crisp uniforms, smiles sharp with pride. The hotel in its prime.

The air grew heavy as I dug deeper. Beneath the photos, time turned cruel.

A headline, ink faded but words still screaming:

**GRAND HOTEL ENGULFED IN INFERNO – 1956**

*“Luxury reduced to ash. Guests trapped in their rooms. Partygoers caught mid-celebration. Staff—and the manager—lost in the flames. What once was grandeur now lies in despair and ruin.”*

I flipped to the next page, the paper stiff, almost clinging to my fingers. Another photo slid loose, curling at the edges as if it didn’t want to be seen.

The staff again—this time a formal portrait. Executives arranged in a neat row behind a polished desk, their expressions proud, confident, the kind of faces that believed the hotel would last forever.

And there—front and center.

Solis. Luna.

Their eyes caught mine through the grainy photograph, steady, commanding. They weren’t guests. Not passing shadows. They belonged here.

Like they owned the room.

A weight pressed on me. My chest tightened. I stepped back toward the desk, palms damp, throat dry.

My eyes dragged to the corner of the desk—an old nameplate buried in dust. I wiped it clean.

And froze.

The letters carved themselves out of the grime.

**My name.**

The sight hollowed me out. My chest tightened, stomach turned. Every instinct screamed no. I staggered back, but the name stayed etched there.

It wasn’t just a plate. It felt like a claim, like the room itself was whispering that it belonged to me.

The air seemed to thicken. I whispered, *“This isn’t real…”*

Silence.

The door creaked open behind me, inch by inch.

Then — a familiar voice spoke:

“Welcome back, sir.”
