Okay, so I'm stuck, like, right now, and I need to type this out fast. Everything I'm saying is totally legit.

My girlfriend moved out about three weeks ago, and honestly, it wrecked me. But it really wrecked my cat, Bandit. He was obsessed with her. Since she left, he's just been moping around. I felt so guilty going to work because I knew he was totally lonely. I’d get home and find his little acts of revenge, you know? My curtians were ripped, and he’d unroll all the toilet paper across the bathroom floor. I was like, "Dude, come on."

But the real crisis was last week. I got home super late, exhausted, and saw Bandit hiding next to the sofa. He had somehow clawed a hole the size of a dinner plate—literally pulled the stuffing out—right in the side. I didn't get mad. I just felt like I was failing him. I had to figure out how to be there for him.

So, I bought this cheap pet camera on Amazon. It had a live feed and a speaker so I could talk to him during the day. Sounded cheesy, but I just wanted my fuzzy buddy to know I was still around.

I set the thing up next to my bed that's Bandit's favorite spot and for a few days, it was awesome. I checked it a bunch, told him he was handsome, and all the destruction stopped. I thought, Okay, problem solved.

This is where it gets crazy. About an hour ago, I was finally relaxing, half-asleep, with Bandit purring on my chest. My phone buzzed, it was the camera app. Motion sensor. I almost ignored it, figured it was just Bandit shifting or sumthin.

But I clicked it.

It wasn't a live feed.

Instead of my bedroom, the video showed this dude. He was tall, way too skinny, and pale. Like, sickly pale, with these huge, staring eyes. He was creeping into my room, but like, super slowly and weirdly, like he was trying to mime sneaking. He got right up to the lens, and he smiled at it. A terrible, wide, gross smile.

I froze the video and looked around the room. Empty. Just us. I was shaking. A glitch, a bad feed, a hoax.

I immediately grabbed my laptop and pulled up the Amazon reviews for the camera. I scrolled past the five-stars, looking for the weird stuff. And I found it. The last review, one star, caps: “DANGER. THE TIME DELAY IS LIKE 10 TO 15 MINUTES. DO NOT BUY.” My heart totally stopped.

I went back to the video and hit play. I watched in absolute horror as the pale dude finished his silent walk, gave the camera a little chilling wink, and then slowly, horrifyingly, slid underneath my bed. Then, I watched myself walk into the room, climb into bed, and get comfortable with Bandit. The video ended right when the purring started.

I’m laying in bed right now, totally still. Bandit is asleep, warm and heavy on my ribs, but I know, I know, that the person I just watched on that delayed feed is directly underneath my mattress. He's been there for at least 15 minutes.

I can't move to call 911. If I make any noise, any sound at all, he’ll hear it. I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

Seriously, people, read the reviews. Bandit knew. He was trying to tear the house apart because he knew someone was here.

What do I even do? I can't move.
