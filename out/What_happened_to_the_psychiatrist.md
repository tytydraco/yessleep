It was my first therapy session. Can you believe that on the first day of work, a police officer has to face a school shooting? Or that on the first day of work, a firefighter has to put out a massive fire? Yeah! In my first therapy session and a patient committed suicide. As soon as we finished, I left the room and was heading toward the hallway to the children's area when I heard screams coming from the room I was in less than a minute earlier. The patient, a chronically depressed person with paranoia, had gone to the bathroom a few minutes before we ended therapy. I stayed in the chair, took some notes, and then left. He hanged himself in the bathroom with his shoelace. I swear I didn't hear anything. I couldn't just go to see him; there was no reason.

This was the fifth time this week I've told that story, and they keep calling me crazy. They say I'm not even a psychologist. Can you believe it? I have a badge, I've worked in a psychiatric clinic for almost 10 years, my social circle revolves around patients, psychologists, and psychiatrists. In fact, most of my friends are psychologists, psychiatrists, and patients as well. I think they say I'm crazy for staying here in this clinic, but I want to breathe new air. After all, I never recovered from my first patient's suicide. It's as if a part of me died with him. I dream about him, I feel responsible. Every relationship I've tried has failed precisely because I freak out about that scene in the bathroom; I scare guys with my exaggerated nightmares.

It's as if everything happened yesterday, sometimes I feel like time stopped the very minute I entered that bathroom after hearing a nurse's cries for help, I even hear the cry yet when there's much silence.

However, there's one thing I still can't explain: I feel everyone around me aging, and I look the same as I did that fateful day, the same one who glanced at the dead body in the bathroom mirror and glimpsed myself. I mean, even the same clothes! I've insisted to the clinic director that a modernization wouldn't hurt anyone, but he ignores me; in fact, he barely even looks at me. An unbearable old man!

Yesterday, I finally got a break. It's perfect for giving me all the time in the world to get out of that rotten dungeon. Honestly, there's one thing that always bothered me: when I get a break, I feel empty being away from the clinic, but on the other hand, I feel suffocated inside it. Once, I had a panic attack just stepping on the sidewalk. I could have sworn that night there was a huge face under a tree in front of the clinic's driveway, waiting for me to walk down the street, alone. I couldn't see him well, but he terrified me with just one look, and I went back inside and decided to sleep there. It wasn't the first time, nor would it be the last.

Everything went wrong when I had an opportunity to leave the clinic. There was always a job, there was always a patient in crisis, there was always a friend asking for help covering her/his shift, and I was the best candidate to do these favors, considering I was the only one who didn't have a life outside of there.

Initially, I hated spending the night among a bunch of lunatics who, for the most part, were free to go anywhere, and I knew there were some who were dangerous, both, to themselves and to others. They always justified it by saying that locking them up would be inhumane and against the clinic's rules. "That's not a prison!". Occasionally, I could hear screams, moans, and truly frightening whispers from my room, which I was careful to lock up tightly. Generally, in these situations, we weren't called; the guards and nurses on duty were responsible for controlling any potential outbreaks.

On tuesday, with a sweet voice, one of my best friends brought me a little card from a clinic I really wanted to work at, she said "I'm going to pray for you to be able to be at peace." She was very religious and always said things like that, but I was already used to it and, to be honest, I really wasn't at peace there.

Now I'm here outside waiting for someone to pick me up, I hope they come before nightfall, this street is very dangerous, but they will not hold me back again, otherwise I will get legitimately crazy.
