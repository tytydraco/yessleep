Part 1: [they took my friend in the haunted forest](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/3vtA3yhqt4)

I am at the police station right now, we drove here in a missing persons SUV. I am reporting four new missing persons, and one missing person being spotted in the haunted forest. So how did it get to this?

Five people I met online recently decided to help me investigate the haunted forest, as my friend Claudia had been abducted by mysterious cloaked figures there only two years prior.

After agreeing on a time, Josh picked us all up in his SUV. He picked up Liam, Andy, the couple Jack and Katie, and myself this morning. We drove to Cannock Chase and got there by 7 p.m. They had brought equipment I didn’t even think of.

We got to the car park and began to head up to the bridge, following the path. I made sure everyone had their phones on them, as well as other supplies.

As we crossed the bridge, the same one that had filled my head with dark intrusive thoughts two years prior, I had a gut feeling to go back and to go forward, like my body and mind were at war, dragging me in every direction.

Our group and search party was made up of off-the-grid, inside-a-lot types. Josh and Liam believed the cloaked people I encountered were a satanic cult.

Andy and Jack believed they were ghosts or undead entities. Katie thought they were alien vampires.

As soon as we crossed the bridge, we quickly marched deep into the forest. But I retraced my steps, in search of the same clearing where all this began in…

I was walking further ahead of the others; they were frantically looking around like they’d just come to Earth for the first time.

Then I saw her…

I saw Claudia…

She was fully naked. Her hair was all gone, including her eyebrows. Her body looked totally different; she looked half the size she used to be, more like a skeleton. She was even an inch or so shorter.

She was wearing a thick metallic collar around her neck. She was so pale. The skin on her face, I can only describe it as…it didn’t look like it belonged there…

That wasn’t the worst of it; I also couldn’t see her eyes…they were just black orbs.

She was peeking at me, slightly hidden from behind a tree, just like the others…no, not others…she can’t be one of those things.

She looked at me for a few moments, both of us frozen.

Then she began screaming and running away…the scream sounded nothing like her; she sounded like a dying deer.

I didn’t know what to do, so I ran after her. I wasn’t going to leave her here. My group panicked and asked where I was going; all I said was,

“It’s Claudia!”

“Your missing friend is alive? I don’t believe this. How can this be real?” Liam gasped.

“When we see her we need to take a photo” Andy exclaimed.

“We have to help her” Katie cried to her boyfriend Jack.

“Stay behind me. She could be dangerous” Jack whispered back to Katie.

They followed me. As we ran, the sun began to set quickly, and the night’s darkness consumed the forest. I ordered them to turn on their torches fast.

We followed the path Claudia had taken; it led to a trail crossing. Left or right. She could have gone left or right.

The group looked at me. In that moment, I realized I was the leader. I wanted to cry and curl up in a ball. But I couldn’t; Claudia was alive and needed me.

“Jack, take Katie back to the car and call the police. You can get a signal there,” I said sharply, but my voice was shaking. They nodded and ran back.

“Liam and Andy, go follow the right. Josh and I will take the left. If you find anything, shine the torch in the air and flick it, or make a sound to get our attention,” I ordered. They agreed, and we split ways, running off in different directions.

We ran for what felt like miles. We could hear the faint screams. Considering how skeptical and superstitious Josh was, he was sure they were just deer noises.

Then, in the beam of our flashlights, we saw the bridge. The exact same one.

“H…how did we get all the w…way back to the bridge?” Josh whimpered.

Somehow, we had run a full circle and landed right back at the beginning of the path. That was impossible; we hadn’t even seen the clearing yet.

“Jack and Katie,” I said to Josh. He instantly knew what I meant.

We charged back to the car, and it was…empty. Jack and Katie were nowhere in sight. At this moment, I realized…I had urinated in my underwear.

Without saying a word to Josh, I began to run back to the bridge. I didn’t see if he was with me. Where the heck were they?

I was running as fast as I could, just like all those years ago. This time back into the forest.

The moonlight shone over the bridge like a corrupted, twisted sun. I didn’t need the flashlight to see them. They had returned for me.

On the bridge stood eighteen cloaked figures. I counted them all this time, wearing their disgusting red- and brown-stained robes. Hoods up, of course; a few wearing masks, a few with long white unwashed beards, most with clean pale faces. They were organized — nine of them on the right and nine on the left — leaving a clear pathway across the bridge in the middle of them.

My heart sank. My chest and stomach tightened so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack right there and then. They just stood there, watching me.

I ran back to the car where Josh was. I was so glad to see him there; part of me thought he would be gone too. He was trying to get a signal on his phone.

I screamed at him to open the car. Josh barely started the car, the ignition kept turning over. 

As the headlight beamed into the trees ahead, a single cloaked figure peeked at us from behind a tree. As horrified as we were, we just wanted to get out the forest. 

He urgently yet carefully drove us away from the forest. I was in no state to drive. I should have tried ringing the other four’s numbers, but I called the police right away.

They came to a lay-by not too far from the forest to meet us and get details.

Now I’m waiting at the police station to talk with someone again. I just gave my statement over an hour ago.

I also discovered something that is making me want to go back to my room and never come out again.

When we met with police officers at the lay-by we were parked at. We stood outside Jack’s car, talking to police who arrived near the scene. When I asked police officers to track the GPS of their phones, the police officers asked me to try to call them first.

When I did, we could hear faint ringing from the car. The police officers checked all over the car and found four phones in the back of the car. The phones belonged to Liam, Andy, Jack, and Katie.
