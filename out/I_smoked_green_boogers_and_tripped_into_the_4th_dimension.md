She did a quick ‘running man’ dance, the smile on her face was broad enough to show the gap in the center of her upper line of teeth; one of her shoes was untied and she tripped over the strings and stopped to kick her left leg out so that the strings would unwrap from where they’d tangled. In her hand she carried a bottle of half-drank Listerine and when she saw me there on the intersection of the sidewalk, she stopped and shouted a hello. Her coat, which reached down to her knees, was stained and as she stepped closer the stench was that of raw garbage; Henrietta had been in the dumpsters.  
“Want some?” she offered the bottle of Listerine over to me.  
I took it, took a massive gulp—the mint covered all else.  
Henrietta ripped the bottle from me, “Don’t take it all!” she protested before taking another swig of her own. Upon returning the black cap to the Listerine bottle, she bobbed her head like she was listening to music only she was listening to. “Hey!” A red Kia stopped in the street at the redlight of the intersection; it was the middle of the day though the thick clouds overhead signaled a bad time. The driver, a young man, looked on from where he sat in bewilderment at Henrietta. He rolled the passenger side window down and she pushed half her body into the vehicle to speak.  
The conversation the two of them had was totally muffled by the engine, but upon Henrietta violently thrusting herself from the window, I saw that she’d been splashed; the curly brown hair on her head clung to her skull and she kicked out her legs in the direction of the driver in fury. “Little dick!” she squalled. The driver slammed on the gas and the Kia pushed through the intersection, totally ignoring the red light.  
Henrietta clumsily sloughed the shoe from her foot, the untied one, and threw it like a pro pitcher in the direction of the car speeding off. The shoe rocketed through the air, the shoestrings trailing after like streamers, and ineffectively plopped in the center of the street.  
The woman turned on me then, a scowl over her face. She took another drink of Listerine and slammed the bottle into my chest—I grabbed it, sipped it—while she plodded into the road to retrieve the shoe there.  
“Tossed his soda cup right in my face,” She indexed her face with her finger. While sliding back into the shoe, an old Reebok, she cussed under her breath, “How’s I’m supposed to make any money?”  
“Get a job?” I asked, smiling.  
“Yeah?” she fell onto me, wrapping an arm around my neck, “You look worse than I do!” She sprung forth her neck and clamped onto my earlobe with her mouth; her teeth audibly clicked as I pulled away. “What kind of job, anyway? Sanitation foreman? What kind of jobs do they have these days anyway? Should I go on down to the job store and get a job from a job tree? What a job that would be.”  
Listening to her rant mostly absently, I rifled through my own jacket pockets while pulling my tuque down over my ears; upon finding the aluminum pipe, Henrietta froze in speaking, eyed the pipe?  
“What is it?” she asked.  
“Not much.” I took a drink of the Listerine; it was nearly gone, and I returned it to her. “Let’s go around back.”  
Hiding by trashcans in the alley, we took turns on the pipe till it was spent and I pushed myself into a corner to urinate.  
Unzipping my pants, I stared at the sky; a cold hand latched onto my member, and I went stiff. Henrietta whispered into my ear, “Let me aim it.”  
“I can’t with an audience.”  
“I won’t look at it. Just let me aim it.”  
Closing my eyes, I let the world fall away. Hot urine rained on my face. In a panic, I saw she’d directed it straight into the air. I shoved her away; she was laughing and pointing at me.  
“Fucker,” I said.  
She nodded at my exposed legs; my pants had slipped down to my ankles during her surprise maneuver. I hoisted my britches up and turned back to my corner to finish my business, with my head twisted so I could keep her in my peripheral.   
“Hurry up,” she said, “I’m hungry.”  
Upon returning to her, we left the alley together. It began to mist very cold as we moved down the sidewalk together; the streets were empty probably due to the brewing storm. She pulled me into a strange walk where she hung off my arm and rested her head on my shoulder. “You smell like piss,” she whispered.  
“I’ll get you back,” I said.  
“If you can.” We began to pass a small convenient store and she froze in her walking, therefore freezing me there too. She looked in. “Here?” she asked.  
“As good as any other,” I shrugged.  
“Don’t forget I like those hot sausages.” She let go of me and rushed into the store—I followed.  
She struck up a conversation with the only clerk at the front desk and as I pushed further into the small store, I heard less of what they said.  
Seeing they provided small shopping baskets, I lifted one from a stack and began perusing the snacks along the aisles. The refrigerated section had precut sandwiches. I lifted a few into the baskets and then snagged four one-liter sodas. I tossed a few bags of chips into the basket too then began looking where they kept the jerky to find the spicy sausages Henrietta liked. I took a whole display box of them and dumped it into the basket. Once the basket was full, I angled myself near the door and kept an eye on the front.   
The expression of the clerk, a balding man perhaps in his forties, was one of abject boredom. Henrietta shouted something and the older gentleman merely raised his eyebrows. I pushed nearer them, keeping a row of shelves between us.  
“I have this magic trick!” proclaimed Henrietta; she looked around the store, quickly lifted a party-size bag of Lay’s potato chips from a nearby display and motioned for the older man to look closely at the bag. “Have you ever seen this? It’s pretty weird that they’d put this on the packaging, but you’ve got to keep your eyes peeled.” The older man craned over the front counter to examine what Henrietta was pointing at. “Now look, if I hold the bag like this,” she held the bag between her flat palms, “Look at that end closely. I can’t believe they’d print that on the packaging! Can you?” The older gentleman, obviously confused and agitated, lifted the glasses which hung around his throat from a chain and placed them on his nose and squinted at the end of the potato chip bag. He began to open his mouth to say something.  
Henrietta slammed the bag with her hands and the bag exploded open on the end nearest the man and potato chips erupted in confetti all over him; the man fell into the wall of cigarettes behind him and stumbled to gather his footing.  
We ran like mad of the door and down the street.  
We slowed to a walk and began to snack as we went, divvying the booty.  
That night, we slept by the pier, keeping warm in the walls of a dilapidated shack.   
The pier was surreal in the morning; it was an abandoned place. Seeing the colorful paintings of faded hotdogs or sundaes plastered across withered plyboard in the dawn glow felt like a total dream—for a moment before Henrietta awoke, the pier felt like a destined stop on the way to purgatory and I got the sick feeling that something wasn’t right.  
That all changed upon seeing her stumble from the innards of the clapboard shack. We both looked out on the pier, and she unwrapped one of the spicy sausages I’d lifted from the convenience store and nibbled on the end of it; she caught me watching her eat and exaggerated herself orally pleasuring the object. She laughed and took another bite.  
We made grunting hobo love under the pier—pressed against the stilts we wildly grabbed at one another with claws and squeezes and bites.  
My vision blacked for a millisecond and then we were holding each other, supported poorly on quivering legs while gasping into one another’s shoulders. We zipped ourselves clothed and pressed into town for the morning.  
Across town there was an abandoned factory. We stood in the gravel lot there, picking rocks and chucking them at the windows and sometimes they clanged off the wall and sometimes our aim was true, and we were rewarded with the shattered glass which rained down the side of the structure. Mostly, we were bored.  
“Ever heard of jenkem?”  
“No,” Henrietta focused on her aim while closing an eye.  
“It’s fermented human waste. You keep the fumes trapped and inhale it. Supposed to get you so high.”  
“Nasty,” she threw her rock and it clanged against the wall and her shoulders slumped while she scanned the lot for another.  
Even when the sun rose to its zenith, the fall air was cool, and the clouds passed before the sun in such a way that its rays seldom warmed me. The factory’s innards were colder still, and dark and wet from the prior day’s rain. It was an old cannery—rusted tins were strewn in places across the floor. We kicked them as we explored the factory and only so often, we roused the inhabitants—smallish rats which ran from our stomping feet before disappearing into unseen cracks.  
We drank from our liter bottles, screamed into the dark high ceilings, and supposed things about life.  
Conveyer lines sectioned off floors of the building and we angled over them, pushed towards the other end of the structure and broke our way through the other side by smashing a window and once there, we met the day again and a rusted chain link fence; Henrietta moved to a place it was worn by a post and lifted it and I crawled out of the property and held the fence open for her.  
Evening came and we crept into town again. Old shops were boarded over, and the few people left in town on the cusp of sundown were the worst sort; we fit in.   
Henrietta scored and I didn’t ask how, and we huddled in the alleyway among the garbage, and she opened the bag and we looked at its contents and I withdrew the aluminum pipe.   
The stuff in the cellophane bag—it couldn’t be called anything besides stuff due to its viscosity. It clumped in places and was green like boogers are green but looked crystalline enough.  
We smoked it and waited in the alley and the shadows grew long while we watched the sky twist into night—there wasn’t an impulsive switch or overwhelming surge of energy. It cradled me there and it took a moment till I realized I was completely high and sitting on the ground with my back to a trashcan. Scanning for Henrietta, I saw her sitting directly beside me. She had her hand on my lap, and I was mildly startled at not having noticed her presence so close. The world was far away and so I stood, and she protested, but I stood anyway and shook my head to gather my bearings.  
It was nighttime and against the cool breeze which crept down the black alley, I wished I had a cigarette—I didn’t smoke cigarettes, but I wished I had one then.  
“Sit down. Lay with me,” said Henrietta. I pivoted to see she’d laid sidelong against the trashcans while her eyes fluttered in protest at her own sleep.  
I marched out of the alley and onto the sidewalk and looked either way, up each end of the street and it was deserted then the sky exploded with the light, and I froze there, reaching out to support myself on the exterior wall of a brick building. I stumbled and lost my hand there. The building wasn’t there—not entirely. The place where my hand was become totally transparent, as well as the wall itself. In fact, I could see entirely through the wall. It was an abandoned shop. I reached out to touch the place where the wall should have been and was surprised that there was something partially solid there; I jerked my hand from the place and visually saw a reverberation. The wall was like gelatinous glass, disturbed by my touch.  
For a moment and no longer than that, I had a moment of seeing my own body from an overhead perspective and I could see that I too was totally transparent, my brain, my veins, my bones wriggled like jelly—hairs of light danced off my skin. I shook my head and came back to myself.  
Then the street wasn’t empty. It was full of life, vegetables—round and obtuse—like those of a faraway planet. They sprouted from places in the road, levitated atop their vines and listed in the breeze. I stepped into the open street and placed a flat hand across my brow to stare into the sky. The light which shone there was not the sun or stars or moon, for the rays came from all directions. Pivoting, I looked down the street then back to the alleyway then back down the street; everything seemed one great living organism—the warm blood-pulse of the world was all around me.  
Squinting through the bright lights in the sky, I spied a form yards out and approaching. It started out as merely a dot and closed in quickly.  
“Hey,” it called out in the voice of a child.   
Planted to the spot, I couldn’t move and looked on in sickness while the form approached; it became clear. The thing was a twisted naked man with skin as white as snow. The thing held its eyes shut and though it moved quickly, it did not possess the movements of a normal man—it merely glided across the ground. The man—if that’s what it was—came to a halt maybe ten feet from where I stood and I chanced a glance towards the alley. “Hey,” it called my attention from there and upon my attention snapping to it, I noticed it did not move its mouth to speak.   
“Trade,” it said.   
“Huh?” I asked, startled.  
“Trade?” There was a hitch in its voice like a small girl’s.  
I swallowed dry, placed my palms flat against my pockets. “I don’t have anything to trade,” and then I quickly added, “Sorry.”  
It came closer to me and that was when I felt its intimidating presence most of all, the man lumbered of me by several feet; his eyes remained closed and for a moment it seemed the long lashes of the man’s eyes were knitted together. The man opened his eyes to expose that there was nothing there but two open black sockets. My mouth was locked shut and I could not even scream.  
“Trade,” said the thing.  
A stark white finger with a yellow nail crept from the black recesses of the man’s left eye socket and the eye closed upon it so that the thing fell free as though it had been sliced. He caught the finger which he’d produced from his eye and held it out to me. He nodded at me as though he expected me to take the severed finger. I took it; it was mushy to the touch and already cold. “Trade,” nodded the man.  
I shook my head.  
“You’ve got one there,” he pointed to my crotch, then held out his hand expectantly, “So trade it.”  
I shook my head again and turned to run. Upon feeling the man’s cool touch on my shoulder, I ripped from it and took off, tripping over the strewn vines of those strange plants—daring a glance, I witnessed an arm leap from the open eye socket of the man’s right eye, and he moved after me in that strange, gliding way. The arm which hung from his face twitched out in front of him and clasped wildly in the open air.  
In a total craze, I pushed down the road, pumping my arms and legs as hard as they would allow. My lungs burned.  
It was total black, and I tripped over something, and I almost let go of my bladder as I skidded across the ground. Looking around madly, I saw the moon hung in the starry sky and the street was dark and there were no levitating plants—no man was after me. Sweat coated me and my breath came in wheezes as I stood. I shook my head and slapped my cheeks as if to awaken myself.  
My stride was tentative as I expected the man to come from around any corner, any tree, any hedge, perhaps from the sky itself—there was nothing but the moon and stars there. I nodded to myself in a constant rhythm if only to chill my anxiety. I moved to the sidewalk, touching the walls of the deserted shops there and feeling them solid.  
Upon reaching the alley, I staggered in protest at my earlier fall—at lifting my pant leg, I saw my right knee was skinned.  
Henrietta laid where I’d left her, and she stirred and sat awake. “You mentioned something about huffing shit?” she laughed the words out.  
I grimaced and sat beside her on the ground, lifting my injured knee to examine it better.   
“Hurt yourself?” she asked, reaching out a finger to prod the place.  
I nodded and then straightened my leg out and unfurled the thing I’d kept in my squeezed fist—I dropped the object on my lap. It was a snow-white finger which twitched like a worm dying in the sun. It went limp and I examined the thing.  
In a moment of panic, I stuffed my hand beneath my boxers and sighed relief. I’d gotten away without a trade.
