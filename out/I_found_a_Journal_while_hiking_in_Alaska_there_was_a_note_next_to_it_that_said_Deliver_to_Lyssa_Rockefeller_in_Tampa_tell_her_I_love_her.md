# Day 1

Hey Lyssa. I know I haven't been able to send you any of my journals recently but trust me, this is a big one. It'll definitely be sufficient for the past month of journals I've missed sending you. But how's life going on in Germany? I hear you and Maddie went to Berlin like 2 weeks ago was it? I appreciate you sending me journals though even though I haven't, like truly it helps a lot since Wyoming is rough. These journals help me get through isolation and it really helps.

But this journal will mostly be about that hiking trip that I told you about last time I sent you? Yea, this place is beautiful and there's a load of these pine trees everywhere, its nothing like Florida or Georgia. It's all mountainous up here and the game is different to, way more elk, some moose even but I really haven't seen moose. Only on the drive up. Oh, one that I did see was this huge moose with like massive antlers, it must have been the size of like a car. The nice part too is that there's no one else here. Its just me, the birds and the elk I was talking about. And holy shit there's a lot of elk. I actually shot one with that rifle you gave me for my birthday. I know you don't know much about guns but thank you so much for it.

When I got here I literally sat there for like maybe a couple of minutes drinking beer and sitting in my trunk with the door open just staring at the mountains and breathing in the air. Thank the gods I came here during summer because it was still chilly up there. The drive from Casper to here was maybe 2-3 hours? I don't know there was probably 2 cars I spotted the entire way here and that moose I was talking about.

After I was done taking in the view I started to walk through the trails and just... wow. They were beautiful! Especially at mid day you can see for probably 20 miles! The photos I took of the views should come with the journal. One thing I will say is the nats up here are horrible. Every time I swat one like 30 more start swarming me.

Well after staring at the views for a little bit, or more like a long time I finally found a clearing to set up my tent and my firepit. Luckily I had brought my own pit with me this time and actually managed to set it up properly without instructions. I already had firewood in my truck bed when I came here so I have probably 3 to 4 days worth of firewood with me, and there plenty of trees I can use incase I would stay for more then a week. But the isolation sometimes Is good for you, truly. Getting away from Tampa is so relieving especially after sometimes not being able to sleep due to the noises. Here? Nah, just birds chirping, owls, and crickets.

I set up my tent quickly since it was getting dark and I made sure to cut markings into the trees on my way here to remember my path to get here. I wish Raymond came with me honestly because then I would have someone to share my beers and tent with and have a good chat. But I hunt alone, sleep alone, and chug beers alone. The chugging beers part is the only part I don't mind doing alone.

I walked about 4 miles into the forest to find a good place to sleep, cool part is that it overlooks a massive cliff since I'm up on a mountain. It awesome to see probably 2000 feet below me up on this cliff. I set up my fire and my chair to be next to it so I could overlook it while the sun was setting. The sunset today was gorgeous. After I went out and shot that elk I told you about previously and ate some of it. And man was it good with the bread I had packed for myself, elk sandwich with lettuce tomato and some hot sauce. Its great with some beers. Writing this I'm a little loopy, but I'm not completely drunk, I think a photo of the sunset should be with this journal, but sometimes the photos fall out and it doesn't come with the journal, sometimes they fall out in the mailing sometimes. That's all I'm gonna wright for today I'm tried, I'll write more tomorrow.

# Day 2

As soon as I woke up I knew something was wrong. The sounds around me were different, much more windy, more animals then my last spot. Something was wrong. My heart dropped when I opened the tent flap. I was on the top of the mountain where I saw everything, but this mountain was in a different range. I could tell because of the fact that there was way more mountains surrounding me, when I came to the spot it was a singular mountain surrounded by forests.

I was in a panic today trying to figuring out where I was, my GPS I kept in my backpack said It didn't even know where I was, It just said "Invalid Coordinates." I almost shit myself when I read that I kid you not. I almost smashed the GPS on a rock in anger when I realized maybe it was because I was to high up, but that didn't make sense it used satellites. So I just angrily jammed it back in my bag when I realized that my fire pit and chair were still there, mind you the sun was just coming up so the horizon was a faint yellow, I was facing the eastern horizon where the sun was rising where I shit you not there a deer near the fireplace. Looked like a deer, I started to reach for my gun when the creature turned its head towards me, It was a deer, but It was not of a species I knew of, plus I didn't even know deer came up that high. I grabbed my gun as slowly as possible and aimed it at the deer, when I pulled the trigger the gun fucking jammed and the sound of the click from the jam made the deer run off. I was beyond pissed.

I packed up my gear and started to walk down the mountain, it was extremely hot today, surprisingly data worked on my phone so I got a text from my mom asking how's the trip been. Strangely, I couldn't text back or call her so I thought maybe it was how high up I was. I didn't know If I already needed a search and rescue team already but I didn't know if it was needed, I could see everything from up here, but Wyoming is very rural so I didn't see anything.

As I was starting to finally make it to some plateaus on the mountain side where I could set back up my camp I realized the trees are a species I'd never seen before In Wyoming. Lyssa, these were huge pines that almost reminded me of those redwoods in Cali, more or so like Sequoias. But even bigger. They were probably 200 feet high, each of them, and the mountain I was on seemed larger than I had anticipated. But my air flow was fine, almost like somehow the atmosphere here was denser with oxygen,

When I finally made it to the plateaus I noticed that there was foot tracks next to a tree with a trail marker on it. This mountain was extremely tall, I could tell because of the fact that when I looked down over an overhang the ground was a blotch of green and brown from the recent rain. It was extremely cloudy but if this mountain was so tall then why was I not above the clouds? Maybe I was but I just didn't realize it? I don't know.

After setting up my tent and starting up a fire I decided to check the trail to make sure it didn't lead back to my original campsite. As I followed the trail with the rifle you gave me I swear I heard some sort of ethereal tone. I don't know how to put it but it was extremely peaceful and the sun was just peaking behind a wall cloud that had been blocking the view of the sun for the past couple of hours, I could see for miles. And I swear the trees ahead of me were huge. Next to the mountain was a valley hidden behind some mountains I couldn't see due to the clouds from early this morning. In this valley Lyssa where these huge trees, bigger than the ones I saw today. Possibly 500 feet tall? Dunno, looked skyscraper sized from my point of view. But it was all the way down in the valley and the trunks width looked huge as well, maybe 30 to 40 feet in width? I would have expected this to be some sort of tourist spot due to the huge trees and maybe I could find some one to help me, but nope, silence.

I eventually made my way upon a cave where the tracks ended, I raised my gun up and shown a flashlight into the small cave where I saw that same deer from earlier today. It was the biggest damn deer I've ever seen, maybe 5 feet tall and almost 5 feet in length to. It was crouching down inside of the cave eating some sort of red root protruding from the cave walls. I raised my gun and made sure that it wasn't jammed this time, carefully cocking back the bolt to peer into the chamber to make sure no bullets were caught in the magazine before slowly cocking it forward, I shot it right in the stomach and it died instantly. As I walked into the cave and was starting to carry the deer, which was extremely hard as the deer was probably 500 pounds. I heard that same ethereal tone I had heard from following the trail from the deer walking to the cave. But this time it was extremely loud and I had to cover my ears because of how loud the cave was making the noise. What did it come from? Wind blowing through rocks maybe? Possibly, I still don't know how that sound was made or how it was so loud, but the day wasn't breezy at all, besides from waking up. Most of the trees stood still.

Well, after coming back and skinning the deer before gutting it and cooking the non fat parts, which was very hard as I had never seen a deer like this in my entire life and couldn't tell which parts were protein packed or pure fat, It tasted really good, but it wasn't filling. I had to have at least four pounds of this massive deer before I felt like crap. That root that it was eating, maybe that might be edible too, I'll go looking for it tomorrow but right now I feel a sack of potatoes. Unfortunately from all of the time using my phone today trying to call or text my mom and dad, my phone died. I'll charge it when I get back home. I'll wright more tomorrow.

# Day 3

I moved again, I know for a fact something is wrong in this forest. I woke up to the sound of something moving outside my tent and grabbed my gun. It sounded feral, like a wild dog but mixed with the sounds of a human. I was scared shitless but when I heard it starting to open my tent I fired my gun at the tent door too afraid to even realize it could have been someone's dog or someone in general. But it howled in agony as it ran off. Getting a surge hope, I rushed out of my tent to realize I had moved places again, but I didn't care, I was in a clearing, surrounded by those huge trees I told you about yesterday. But this time I was in a clearing next to a mountain that was smaller than the one yesterday, but I was next to a lake and there was a chair that I had never bought before sitting next to the lake with a rusty old can of beer in it.

I sprinted after the trail of blood I had noticed on the ground, hearing something in the distance screaming in pain as it scurried along the thick bush and low hanging limbs of the trees, it was 9 AM I think, I went to bed last night at probably 12 so it was a good sleep. I was 100% not dreaming.

After losing the trail for a little I heard a scream to my left, it sounded more human than the last ones but still had a ping of savageness to it. I chased the way the sound came from before spotting it. A severed leg in the underbrush of a canopy, I inspected it for a second fearing the worst, had I just shot someone trying to find help just like me? However the leg was too long and bony to be human, but in all honesty is was to human to not be human. So I started to scream for the person I shot to come back and I had medical, however the noises had stopped, so I retraced my steps and saw the blood trail once again, following it.

After what seemed like hours of trying to trace the trail with my rifle and all of my ammo in hand. I made my way to a cliff that seemed to drop down for 1000's of feet. I thought I was in a valley, how is there a cliff right next to the valley? The blood trail was now straight up a drag trail on the sand of the cliff, and it appeared like whatever I shot killed it self. I grabbed my binoculars and tried to peer down into the trees below, before I realized something. I looked up and saw a ginormous expanse of mountains and waterfalls ahead of me, this isn't anywhere I knew of. Maybe Wyoming but they don't have the insane water falls I was seeing. The falls stretched for what seemed like miles along the mountains sides and fell into a massive river cutting the expanse in two. I call it an expanse because it was probably 50 miles across, I could see it all.

I took my eyes off the beauty of the expanse and looked down into the canopy of trees and found a small opening among the sea of trees. I could see something down there, however my binoculars were at max zoom and I couldn't peer any farther down unless I wanted to join that thing in the after life.

I was getting hungry, and I hadn't seen anything besides small birds for the entire day. So I decided to search for the red root I had seen that deer eating the day before. I managed to stumble upon an exposed root next to one of the massive trees that surrounded me. However the chunk was to big for me to just yank off so I decided to cut off a big chunk and cut it up into pieces to snack on. However when I cut open the root a semi clear liquid started to gush from the root. I have never seen this tree before, so I had no Idea if the "water" I was about to drink was dangerous, however I used my filter first to see what was in it. And in the excess tube, there appeared to be just tiny pieces of wood floating around and nothing else, no bugs, nothing. So I got my jug and put it next to the exposed root and took a swig of the liquid. It tasted extremely refreshing and had almost a fruity taste to it, with a hint of bitterness. It immediately made me full of energy and almost strength from what It had felt like. Did this root water have unique properties? What about those massive trees I saw down in the Valley from yesterday? Did they have water that had even better properties? I don't know yet, but tomorrow I'll try to find a tree like that and drink its water.

After cutting the root in multiple, smaller, edible pieces I noticed the root it self was extremely light for its size. I was praying I didn't need to eat a lot of these because most of the roots I have had before hand had tasted awfully bitter and woody. But when I bit into this root, the root tasted of lettuce, and was extremely crunchy but edible and tasted delectable. After consuming the root my stomach felt full, but I was full of energy from it, even more so then the root water I had just drank from.

After filling up my jug with the root water, and bag with the root itself, I realized I was lost, I was to distracted by the root to even remember the blood trail that led back to my camp with all of my supplies. However me and you both know that I have had experience with no equipment camping. It was difficult but with the vast amount of resources around me there was no fear.

I realized that the cliff I was on had a long winding path down to the floor of the expanse where I could see what that thing was. After making my way half way down I realized the sun was setting, so If I wanted to see what that thing was I needed to haul ass down to the floor. But I needed sleep, and I didn't know if I would move exactly at 12 AM or sometime in the dead of night. However I wasn't chancing it. I glanced back up at the sun and checked my GPS which had a clock in it. Its clock wasn't working to, so I deduced from the light of the sun and the length of the shadows it was around 4 PM.

I realized on my way down the mountain I was on was humungous. After walking down the path for what seemed like hours I had finally made my way down to the floor of the expanse, The sun was just barely peaking over a mountain surrounding the expanse to my northwest. So I had to move south to find the body of the thing I had shot since the path down had curved along the edge. Before moving south I turned back to face the mountain I was on. The small mountain I had thought I was next to in a valley was actually just a peak to a huge mountain that closed off the southern exit to the expanse from the floor. It looked almost as big as Denali but maybe a little smaller, It had an insanely flat way to get up to it.

After hiking for around 30 minutes up ahead I saw a break in the canopy of the trees where it looked like something had fell through, I looked ahead and saw it. It was short, around 3 feet in height and had a long bony tail that wrapped around its leg, I presumed that this was some kind of rodent from far away, but when I got closed I realized it had a human face, It had my face. I'm not joking it had my face. except it was dark blue and looking right at me. When I found it that damn thing was still alive, the sight of it made me gag, a tree branch had pierced through its stomach and it looked helpless. I had to kill it, but with my face on It, It took me a long time to shoot, I had to look away when I pulled the trigger, and I looked back when I had shot it, It was obviously intelligent, however whatever it is shouldn't be on earth. I had heard of skinwalkers but this thing wasn't malicious, it was almost scared of me, like deer are.

I set up camp under a branch I had cut using my axe I always have on me, you know this best. Remember that one time we went up to the White Mountains and we got caught in that ugly storm and I built us a shelter that almost collapsed on us? Good times. After drinking the root water I'm gonna go to bed. I'll try and figure out what's going on.

# Day 4

I woke up in the middle of the night, I felt the ground shifting. Not like an earthquake, but more or so like something organic was shifting the ground smoothly. I tried to look outside of my small shelter however I couldn't see shit. Wondering, I pressed my ear up to the ground out of curiosity. And there that ethereal sound was again. This time it felt like it was shaking the ground. I looked for my flashlight but realized I left it at my camp. I slept until morning.

I woke up under my shelter still. But my surrounding had changed. I was next to a lake, more or so a large river. This time, there were small 10 feet pines next to me that looked to be extremely young, almost like recently planted. I am so confused. I don't believe in the paranormal or in anything really. But this time I have to admit something deeply wrong is happening to me. That chair I saw next to that lake yesterday, has someone else been here to? I truly hope so because I need to find someone else. I'm in some strange area where no one else is in and that there are undiscovered species of deer and trees and a new type of animal. I'm scared. I already shot my flare this morning but I saw nothing for the next 5 hours. I just sat by the river watching the river flow by me into a big lake with large pines around it. Not the 500 foot tall ones I saw in the expanse. Just regular pines. My GPS still won't fucking work.

After waiting for something, anything to appear, nothing did. So I packed up my bags and left my camp here knowing the ground would move again. So does this mean that every day the terrain around me shifts? Every day I trek through a new wilderness while everything else here has seemed to accept that as fact? It still doesn't make sense why there's new trees, new deer, new life forms. I thought about this a lot. Lyssa I don't know if this will ever get back to you honestly. I'm just writing to write because otherwise I'd shit myself not being able to vent my feelings. On the walk, which I didn't know where I was going I just wanted to leave this forest, I saw a bear. But this one was huge, around 8 feet tall, on all 4 legs, and was lanky as I'd ever seen. But this beast was incredibly slow, and appeared to be eating leaves on its hind legs, which it stood about 14 feet on its hind legs and could easily reach the small 10 feet tall trees that surrounded it. It had to hunch down and appeared to be licking sap off of the trunk. It looked at me but didn't seem like it was going to attack at all. Either way I had my gun ready incase it would pounce.

I slowly walked past the bear, and after I couldn't see it anymore I turned back around and continued my walk. From the river side base I had, This terrain seemed extremely flat, and there was only one hill in the distance that I could see that appeared to be 1000 feet tall. I decided to go there in order to overlook the terrain and see if I could see a way out of this maze of trees.

I sat down for around an hour at the base of the hill, eating roots and drinking the water, which kept it self cool surprisingly. And was extremely refreshing, and kept me refreshed for what seemed like hours, and the red root also kept me full and energetic for what seemed like an entire day. It must have had an insane amount of calories.

As I made my way up the hill I spotted a deer, a regular deer, leaning down munching on the root, I raised my gun as fast as possible and shot it without thinking, after it fell down and started to roll down the hill towards me, I managed to catch it, this 400 pound, basically elk. I was shocked, and It didn't hurt at all. Did the root give me some kind of strength? When I first caught the elk I actually laughed, the first time I had laughed since my second day after realizing how fucked I was. But this was out of pure joy. I actually was so happy it took me 30 minutes to carry the deer up the hill over my shoulder. It didn't fell heavy at all actually. As I made my way to the top of the hill it was semi flat, so I decided base would be here for tonight. After cutting down one of the small pines and cutting up the fire wood. Before making sure the wood was dry and finding a rock. After sparking the wood for sometime it finally caught on some leaves and it finally started to make a fire. After crowding around It I realized how much the temperature had changed over the first days, 1st day it was cool, 2nd day it was extremely hot but damp. 3rd day was mostly the same but more drier. And today it was actually sort of cold. My breath wasn't visible but it was on the cusp of being visible.

I started to look around my surroundings from atop the hill, the visibility was breathtaking. I could see for what seemed like hundreds of miles, and there was barely any haze. I could see the mountains off in the distance. These mountains were unlike anything I had ever seen. Trust me when I say this Lyssa, they had to be 50000 feet tall that's how large they looked. They breached the horizon and l swear to you till the day I die these things were bigger than Everest. All of them were. Let me tell you that, when I see you again. I have hope that I will see you again Lyssa. I'm starting to forget your face, I'm a fool for not bringing a photo of you with me.

After admiring for the mountains I realized I heard running water not even 50 feet away from me. I turned around and saw a hot spring. A damn hot spring. Just my luck. I took my clothes off and washed them off before leaving them on a branch to dry. I'm not joking when I tell you this. The water felt great on my skin. It felt tingly, almost like the feeling of an arm that was asleep waking up, but in a good way.

After putting back on my clothes the sun was already setting. I did wake up fairly late in the day. These roots make you have sounder sleep I guess. But I love you Lyssa. You might not get much more from me, my ink for my pen is running dry. Sorry, only thought I'd be here for 3 days but that time is extended. I don't know for how long. But If I don't get back to you, trust me, this will. I will do everything in my power to make sure this journal gets back to you. I took additional photos, of the creature, the bear, the deer that I've killed. The terrain. These photos either you and me, or just you will hang on our wall. I'm going to go to bed, I think I only have enough ink for tomorrow but It will be enough. Goodnight.

# Day 5

I'm so sorry Lyssa. I should've stayed on the base of the hill. I'm such an idiot for not staying up there. I only have around a paragraph left of ink left in order for me to tell you this.

I awoke to me falling, the hill literally sunk from underneath me in the middle of the night. And I fell, for what felt like 1000's of feet, I tried to curl up into a ball but I broke my ankle bone, tail bone, and probably every bone in my lower body. I don't know If I'll survive, but I can see dark spots on my stomach so I'll probably die of internal bleeding shortly. Thank the gods, I had my gun at my side the entire night because I heard those damn dog noises I heard on day 3. I can't die, I will try my hardest to live through this. But I can hear those damn things getting closer. Its just day time and I can see there shadows through the trees, surrounding me. Thank the gods they are waiting for me to die. And I'm lucky that deer carcass didn't fall on me or I'd die instantly from that thing, It landed 20 feet away from me, but I can see those trees from the valley today. They are surronding me. They're gorgeous Lyssa, My camera died after I took a photo of these trees, please don't mind the dirt on the lens, I couldn't wipe it off, my hands are all bloody. But these trees were possibly 1000's of feet tall. Just my luck I didn't land on the soft canopy and I landed straight through the spot where none of the canopies over lap. I have a gun, but trust me, I won't go out that way. The sunrise right now is beautiful, In all honesty those creatures are looking at it to, they're admiring it. The sunrise. These things are intelligent just like ourselves. 

I can't believe I'm going to die. It doesn't hurt due to me chugging the root water since it seems to dull my senses. Fucking thank the gods, I was screaming from how badly it hurt when I fell. I love you Lyssa, god damnit, I love you. So much. I hope you know that. Incase this diary goes anywhere besides being next to my dead body. I'm going to wright a note next to it to deliver it to you. I pray the note stays with it. But in all honesty this has been an odyssey, I don't know where I am. Or what death Is like. But my life is fulfilled knowing I got to spend a lot of it with you. Dying at 33, hah, never expected that. I guess this is a good bye then? I can't believe it. Met you in highschool, married in highschool. And never looked back. I thank you for those times where me and you took each other on adventures, All my money goes to you, cause I never wrote where my money would go If I died. Goodbye Lyssa. I will always remember you.

-Brian Walker, goodbye love.
