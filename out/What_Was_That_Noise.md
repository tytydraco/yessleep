I can't stop thinking of something I heard earlier. I like to think I have pretty thick skin I don’t really get upset or offended by anything but sometimes there can be something that genuinely will creep me out. 

In recent years I have gotten a newfound love for creepy pastas and internet horror stories. Ill often times listen to youtube videos of people narrating stories from reddit or other blog sites just because I like the suspense of it all. I find it oddly relaxing. One of the things about creepy pastas that attracts me to them so much is that in all of my favorite ones (like the backrooms or sirenheads or ben drowned) there is always some layer of realism to them. They are fictional made up stories but still allow for some level of believability. The thought of ‘what if this was real’. I like the uncertainty and mystery of not knowing. 

I’ve also delved a little bit into true crime and nsfl content. Stuff that no normal person should have to see. But im not normal. So. Things like this include videos like ISIS executions, cartel executions, live suicides, etc. I have seen the infamous 3 guys one hammer video which was a murder that took place in Ukraine where 2 teenage boys beat to death an old man with a hammer and recorded it on a cell phone and it is extremely graphic. 

I say all this because it leads into what happened this morning. It somewhat involves my job. I currently work in the pickup department at my local grocery store. We just had our space moved from the front to the back corner of our building. We have a bit of a light forest area behind our store. There’s a short cement/brick wall and up that hill behind the wall is where the woods start. Woods and forest areas are no stranger to horror stories so you can probably tell where this is going.

It’s a pretty normal day. Colder than usual it’s cloudy and rainy but nothing im not used to. Im just outside dealing with a customer loading her car like normal and then it happens. Something that hours later I can’t stop thinking about because it genuinely made me uncomfortable enough to remember it.

Im just loading this ladys car and out of nowhere I hear the sound of a woman screaming at the top of her lungs. I stop and look up and am able to deduce that the direction of the screaming is coming from the forest area beyond our little wall. I don’t say anything or acknowledge it because I didn’t wanna start anything but as I continued to load her car I kept my ears focused on what I thought was desperate screaming. In my own imagination it sounded like someone yelling for help as they were being attacked or assaulted. I couldn’t make out any words though because there was also the sound of trucks and machinery going on so the voice was a bit muffled. 

This goes on for what feels like a good 2 minutes. The gasp for air between each wail getting more frequent until she eventually slows down and comes to a stop. It was a gradual decline into silence. I cant say Ive heard anything like this ever before. Not in real life. That was the most messed up thing about this. It actually felt real. The screaming felt like it was coming from a place of real fear and desparation. It felt so real that even now hours past I still cant stop thinking about it.

I don’t know what happened. Part of me wants to believe my mind was just playing tricks on me. But what if it wasn’t. What if what I imagined wasn’t imaginary at all. What if I really just witnessed a sexual assault occur within earshot. And I just stood by in confusion and uncertainty. I don’t know what I would have done if I knew for sure what was going on if anything at all. That’s really why I didn’t wanna talk about it. I didn’t wanna start any kind of incident without knowing exactly what had happened. 

Still a mystery to me. Im not sure if what I heard was real or not. But it definitely was unlike anything Ive experienced before. Hopefully this will just go away and I can stop thinking about it. And that it really was my imagination and me being overly paranoid and cynical.
