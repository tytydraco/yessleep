Living in a small town feels like reading a book that’s been read a thousand times, yet still holds sentences that surprise you when the time is right. My town, Dusty Hollows feels just like that; the stars seem to hang a little closer, and every sunset lingers. The town was founded by 5 families back in 1875 just a tid bit after the civil war ended. One of the few (and only) things “The hollows” as my group of friends call it is known for is the sheer amount of serial killers that have passed through the town. 



All the way back in 1886 The Servant Girl Annihilator, one of the first serial killers of America stayed in the city hotel. The owner still has the fake check that was left by the killer. He killed 8 servant girls, most of them with his bare hands, he came from Austin and during his stay at the Inn local legend says he was calm and met with a person wearing a black wooden mask. He stayed for 6 nights and left on the 7th day. 



Clementine Barnabet the author of the Louisiana Axe Murders also passed through the town they say she was walking around drenched with blood, the sheriff arrested her. While she was in the city jail she was visited by a person with a black wooden mask. Clementine disappeared from her cell on the 7th day. 



Ted Bundy was seen in the city, he was staying at his cousin’s house Mr. Cowell (The photo of him in the town’s welcome sign is still sold on shirts). Some people even claim Dean Corll “the candy man” was seen fishing on the river. I could go on and on about the different stories but they all share the same elements: a brutal killer arriving in town, meeting with a masked man and leaving by the 7th day. And most importantly there never was violence not a single dead body or murder just graciously visiting “The Hollows”... until yesterday. 



Whispering Pines Inn stands proudly as a charming relic of the past at the end of the main street. Its original wooden structure was lovingly restored and its front garden and fence are open for weary travelers. The garden has a big beautiful oak tree, it was planted whe the town was founded over 100 years ago. The lobby has a vintage look and hosts local artworks mainly made by Clarisse Eckhorst, the town’s artist; she paints insanely detailed watercolor plants and animals. The rooms are all the same having an outdated tv set, original wooden bed frames, exposed brick walls and semi clean carpets with 70s geometric patterns resembling the shining if you ask me. There is a small living room where they serve complimentary breakfast (hostess cakes and toast) from 6-10am and a basement that is locked for customers.



Ever since I was a kid I have worked at the Inn, well actually my family owns the place so I grew into it. Usually they tell kids not to talk to strangers, in my case it was the opposite. I was delivering towels, playing with the kid’s guests and even receiving new guests. Summer is our busiest season so my vacations were always at the Inn. I don’t think I have ever left the town for more than 2-3 days even when my mom got sick my dad did not take a single day off.  



Yesterday we were arguing about it. I wanted to take a day off so mom could rest, she hasn’t stopped working ever since she was diagnosed. Even when there are no visitors my mom cleans all the rooms and prepares breakfast.



“Eli… This town is special, the wind doesn't blow past the town, it lingers. We are the first interaction outsiders get with Dusty Hollows. We embrace ‘em, we treat ‘em like family, we worry about ‘em and we make their stay special. If we close even for one day it would be like the wind stopping. The wind never stops, son, you need to understand that. We have a family tradition here that has been going on for centuries and I - ” he explained with his crackling deep voice.



“No! You understand, this shitty town, “the hollows”, we are just a random city in the middle of nowhere. There's weeks without visitors dad. This is not Austin, it's not Houston, the family that left today will probably never come back. Lets just give mom a couple of nights, she can’t be working like this there’s no need” I say agitated, I'm really angry at this point. 



We went at it for a long time but I finally convinced my dad to close for a couple of days. I agreed to clean the rooms instead of my mom and I would take care of anything that came up. Our rooms are on the first floor, it's more convenient that way, my room is closer to the main entrance. 



Yesterday was the first night in years that the Inn was closed. My mom was finally able to rest, she stayed in her room since 6pm. Dad and I went to sleep at around 10, my room is closest to the main entrance, and normally I am on call waiting for any late guests that want to check in. But not yesterday, I slept like a baby most of the night. 



The house slept for the first time in years, you could hear the water running through its old pipes, the wind crashing on the wooden walls, and the old bed springs singing an inharmonious melody through its creaking noises. The crackling of the old wood felt almost as if the house was breathing, settling into its position. Something woke me up at 2 am, there was a metal screeching sound coming from outside my room. I was too tired to even stand up so I just waited for it to stop and went back to sleep, it lasted for about 5 minutes.



The calm didn’t last long, this morning just like violin strings breaking, a harrowing noise woke me up. As I was standing up I started to clearly identify my mom’s voice. She was screaming, I had never listened to something like it. I instantly opened the door, I saw the entrance hall wide open and a glimpse of my mom’s back.  She was on her knees. I ran outside as fast as I could.



“NO NO NO NO NO NO NO” she cried out, breaking her voice. She gasped for breath.

I couldn’t feel the wind, it seemed as if it just stopped. The scene was horrific,the family oak tree my father was hanging from it. The rope was tied to his legs and he was hanged upside down, he was wearing his pajamas. His face was sliced completely off, my stomach churned as I saw the blood dripping from his face to the floor making a pool of blood on the grass. I went straight for my mom, I hugged her and I broke into tears. “Don’t leave me alone… not like this…. don’t let them get me… James!! Aaa!!” she cried out.



My eyes couldn’t believe what they just saw. I couldn't stop staring at the scene trying to find something just anything that might make me say it was all a hoax. This couldn’t be real, not like this what did my dad ever do? Near the base of the oak tree I could see some pieces of wood, not just any wood but black wood. I kept hugging my mom, we both cried for what felt like hours. The sheriff came he is still talking with my mom inside. I am sitting in the garden watching as the coroners move my dad, they gave me a blanket and checked my vitals.   


What did she mean by “don’t let them get me”, why is there balck wood near the tree. Who could have done this and why? This will not stay like this. I need answers. I will keep you posted but for now the Hayes “Whispering Pines Inn” is closed until further notice.
