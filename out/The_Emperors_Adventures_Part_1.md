Preface:
 “...There is no clear and understandable preface here, so you, my dear readers, will have to think a little about the essence of what is happening. You shouldn’t expect any kind of sound and intelligible logic from my story, because everything I’ll tell you happened at a time when it would have been better not to talk about it... Soon you will find out everything for yourself...” 

 
Before I start telling my long and complicated story, I would like to tell readers about our amazing world: how it works, what is its climate, who inhabits it, and the like.
 
 Speaking in general, in simple words, our World is a ball filled with countless Systems, each of which has the same unimaginable multitude of planets and bright luminaries illuminating the cosmic surface… But most of all, it strikes the mind and makes you think that in the "planets" located in the Systems, there is an even smaller part of existence marked by "Kingdoms". In these Realms there is a certain law that says about the "innumerable and manifold of everything" Also, this law has spread not only to cosmic structures, but also to everything else, including dimensions, the number of beings and the boundlessness of power, as proof of God. Take for example the inhabitants of the Kingdoms, and try to count them. At first, it will seem to us that it is a very easy-looking task that can be solved in a short period of time. But not everything is as simple as it seems…
 
 If you and I, dear readers, already know the "law of Kingdoms", then will we try to count the inhabitants with a serious look? The answer is obvious. I also wanted to convey to you an important wisdom: the main thing here is that if we clearly understand the laws of a particular form of existence, we will not ask stupid and empty questions, but by applying these laws, we try to put clear understandings of being in our head… That's how, my listeners, I explained to you the basic principle of our immense infinity. Remember: "This principle applies to all subsequent forms of existence," and explaining to you in the middle of my story that "everything is innumerable" would be a stupid and meaningless decision on my part.  Also, it is worth noting that these same Kingdoms are as small as we, the inhabitants of the planets, they are almost like atoms. That's how it works. Throughout my story, I will try to explain these or other forms of existence as briefly as possible. And if you think that countless Systems are the limit, then I hasten to disappoint you... This is such a low type of existence that if you try to compare it at least with the following type of structures, then for them Systems are nothing but absolutely nothing. The further we plunge into this cycle of infinite infinities, the scarier and more all the following and subsequent types of structures will seem to us. Yes... I realized all this after countless amounts of time and not only time. You will learn about this much later. 
 
 And now, read me, I will try to explain to you briefly and in an accessible way the whole "Our World", namely: who are its inhabitants, what planets and systems are in it (although above I have already told you quite briefly what Our World consists of"), but most importantly - who am I and I will tell you my formation...
