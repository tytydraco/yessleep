It may sound strange, but I have been delivering this pizza for three hours now.

 

 

I think I am going crazy, It started as normal as it can get: a ticket coming from one of the regular food delivery apps, requesting two large pizzas to a street no more than six minutes from our business. Having our shop on the far outer suburbs meant we weren't strangers to deliveries that would dip into the country, far from it. I could regale you with a million times I had delivered to a massive property where I got to pet a horse, or a cow, or an alpaca, it was how ordinary this order was that initially shielded me from my concern.

 

Three doors down from one of our regulars, an easy delivery, I thought to myself as my car rolled itself out of the driveway next to our shop, I didn’t think for a second that the house was more than a regular order, maybe some stoned teenagers left alone at their rich family's mansion over the weekend, but nothing I hadn't seen a million times. Even turning on the street, I was met with the same thing I had been met with a million times; Trees, the calls of magpies and kookaburras, and the cacophony of a million crickets chirruping en masse as if to entirely overwhelm my sense of hearing. It took little more than five minutes of driving, with me thinking that if I could take it slow, I might be able to sneak a cigarette on the way back. Before I knew it though, I was faced with the driveway; A narrow path of dirt and gravel that slowly inched its way into the dense bush and trees Infront of me. As I lowered my music, to focus on my driving, I turned into the driveway; It dipped into a valley and I could see the worn tracks of tires run down and then up into a large group of trees, with nothing but the idea of a tip, or maybe a cute farmer on my mind I thought only of moving forward and shifted my Ute into a lower gear to tackle the muddy and dirty track.

 

As my car pulled into the valley at the bottom I watched the track fade into the cluster of trees, I thought nothing of it as I recalled my Hilux burning through mud paths far more treacherous than this and that one time a few friends and I drove far into the Styx up in the mountain ranges, I pulled into second gear to climb the hill and I felt my car shudder. Had anyone else been driving it may have seemed like a quirk of my cars clutch, but I felt something else; It was as if my car was shivering, feeling something that I couldn’t feel yet, and as I corrected the gearstick the shadows of the trees on the other side of the valley drowned out the light, forcing me to turn on my headlights.

 

It seemed as if the track was far too long and that I should have reconnected to the nearest road; one that I was familiar with, due to a regular with an adorable pug that would chase me down to get to the pizza before their owner. But as I trekked on, still not totally disconcerted by the ever-encompassing dark, I began to look for the break in the trees that would usually allow for the emergence of the house.

 

The trees loomed too high, the track too straight. Had this have been logical I would have been by the house by now, or at least an intersection to soothe my beating heart, to let me know the road is ending. Still the driveway seemed to take me between trees for longer than I could imagine. It had been almost ten minutes until the radio played the stupid joke song I had set as my ringtone, it was my boss. I immediately answered and spoke, hoping to get help from someone who was my superior.

 

"Keep going Carl, these people need their food," I heard, before I could even open my mouth to complain about this awful road that I had been on. I still had the sense within me to roll my eyes at the nickname my boss had given me. Something so close to my name, but something wrong that my boss could pronounce with his deep accent.

"Their driveway is awful if I find a spot I am going to turn around and come home, it's not possible," I said, hoping my boss would do as he usually does and take my side with matters regarding customers. I heard a pause far too long over the line and was met with a phrase that almost froze my blood;

"They were promised a meal," The sound of a dead phone line met me after that and shocked me, my boss was never one to hang up on me and was someone who would usually take my side. I could not understand why he was so determined to have me deliver these pizzas. The phone line faded my phones music kicked back in, some terrible song from the 90's.

 

I shrugged and moved on, my car roaring loud as I over revved the clutch to climb the small hill in front of me, the trees seeming to swallow all of the dimming sunlight the late December sun could throw on my evening delivery.

It seemed so normal, that it was only when I snubbed out a cigarette into the old coffee jar in my console that I realised that I had been on this path for almost 10 minutes, taking me far into where the nearest town should be, and when looking at my GPS, said I was only 100 meters from the road I turned off of.

  
I'm sitting on a road that every map says is twenty meters above a river half a suburb away, typing this all out. I don’t know if it's all a glitch of my phone and Navman's GPS but I feel as if somethings wrong. Why can't I see the sun? It was supposed to be bright for another two hours but all I can see is the darkness of the moonlight sky in the very small gaps in the trees, and all I can hear is crickets. I will take off in a moment, a delivery is a delivery, but if you have any ideas, please let me know.

 

Thanks,

The Pizza Boy
