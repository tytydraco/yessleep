“Well I highly doubt - Woah.” Vanessa started to say, as we approached the gas station.

It was a small, rusty, dingy, sun baked off white color building. Piles of garbage bags and tire rims were littered around the edges of it and a handful of sorry looking cars with weeds billowing out from under clogged up the side parking lot. I couldn't make out anything inside, the windows were cloudy with brown tinge, presumably owned by a smoker.

“Is this place open?” Mike asked skeptically.

“Okay what in the Texas Chainsaw hell is this?” I laughed a little nervously. The place felt forgotten and out of place. If not for the bright “Open” sign trying to radiate through the grime on the windows I would have assumed Google misled us here. We didn't have the luxury of being picky either, this next leg of the trip was one of the hardest. Our last major town was a few days ago, and this was our last chance to resupply before another 8 or so days deep in the forest.  

We all laughed and went inside. The place had decent selection. Mike had been struggling with heartburn the past few nights and I wasn’t going to turn down a chance for a snack that wasn’t trail mix.

“They got Tum’s!” I yelled over to Mike who was chatting with the shopkeeper.

“Grab me two bottles!” He yelled over his shoulder. I obliged and picked up a few things for myself. When I got to the counter Mike already had the packages we had mailed here for ourselves. Mostly dry food, new socks, a few luxuries.

“-good so far. The weather has been great for us. Anywhere in our direction we NEED to stop and see?”

“Of course! The old quarry back in town is great! Cliff jumping if you're into that sort of thing. You're still a ways out but Wiarton is a nice town, the last “big one” until you finish the hike so stock up while you’re there.” The shopkeeper was friendly, maybe in his mid 40’s and well kept. He looked out of place in this old shitty gas station. Vanessa brought this up before I could.

“Do you own this place? We almost thought it was abandoned.”

“Ah soon to be. Was my fathers. He’s in pretty bad shape these days so I’ve been trying to help out. Hopefully get some of these cars scrapped. New windows …” He trailed off clearly very stressed.

“That's good of you man. To help him out. I’m sure you'll get the place looking great in no time.” I said as reassuringly as I could.

He must have noticed the energy of the conversation shifting after the bad news because the next thing he said,

“Well I won't keep you all, something something lots of miles before you rest am I right? Oh one last thing. There's a few weird folks here in town. Do weird shit out in the woods, dancing, singing, twirling around with candles. They are harmless but I wouldn't be doing you any favors to let you spook yourself running into them. They ask “The Mud-Man” to bring them rain! Eccentric bunch.” He rolled his eyes at the end, clearly amused by the strange behavior.

I however, was not amused.

We walked along the road for a while after the gas station, Mike and Vanessa chatting away while I listened.

“It will be getting dark soon, how much further to the trailhead?” Mike asked, swinging his head back around towards me.

I hadn’t been leading us to the trailhead.

“The trail? Did you not hear the guy at the gas station?” I asked with a chuckle.

“You haven't been leading us to the trail?” Vanessa was in disbelief.

“Abso-fucking-lutely not, are you out of your mind? I wouldn't go into those woods to save my own Mother. We take the long way.” I said exasperated.

“Woah dude what's the big deal?” Vanessa seemed shocked at the response, which irritated me.

“Seriously? There's a cult in the woods. I'm not too big on cults myself, how about you guys?”

Mike started next.

“We don’t have a better choice. You want to camp right here on the road? You were the one who wanted to “get lost in nature” remember? We didn't route a backup option for this leg of the trip. Even if we don’t camp there tonight, we have to walk the trail eventually. I'm not walking the road all the way to Wiarton, and I'm not walking 3 hours back to the gas station.” Mikes words left a pit in my stomach.

I knew he was right. And I had been very insistent on keeping to nature while we were planning, but not in the face of some 90's slasher film bullshit.

“Lets camp on the edge of the tree line tonight, not IN the woods but close by, then tomorrow we will hike as far as we can to be away from “The Cult”. Okay?” Vanessa's “Compromise” didn’t thrill me but I was clearly beaten. With no better suggestion I sighed and handed the map to Mike.

“Here we are. You cool with this spot Xander?” Mike asked, having already unclipped his bag.

“Guess so.” I pointed at each of them, “If we hear one fucking chant, see one goddamn candle…”

“We won’t Xander, shut up! I thought you liked a campfire story!” Vanessa teased.

“Ya I prefer to tell them, not be in them.” We all laughed and my anxiety eased slightly. Mike got a fire going and we settled around it while the sun’s light and security sank behind the forest.

Just outside the tree line, which stretched to the left and right of us to the horizon, the view of the stars was unmatched. No light pollution of any kind tainted the sky, and the stars counted in the thousands. The sky was bright, the moonlight so strong it seemed wrong that any shadows were left at all. This light however was swallowed hungrily by the forest, which was illuminated in no way at all. It felt to me like a wall. Pitch black and uninviting. Cut from the same cloth as a dark closet with the door ajar in a child's bedroom. I knew there was probably nothing to fear, but I stared into it anyway, looking for movement. For monsters.

After dinner Mike and Vanessa were pretty quick to head to bed and I followed suit. The prospect of sitting out alone, with the full weight of the forest’ stare seemed … unattractive. I had never been afraid of the woods, or the dark, I guess the story from the gas station really had gotten under my skin.

Good to their promise, Mike and Vanessa were up first, just after the crack of dawn with packed bags and rested expressions.

“You look like shit Xander.” Mike stated flatly. I felt like shit. Small fragments of terrible dreams swirled around my brain, just out of sight of my minds eye, but gnawing at me with anxiety.

“Thanks.” I packed up quickly. The woods had no sinister look to them. They looked like the kind of woods I loved getting lost in all my life. I felt the anxiety and dread lift slightly. Still, I was eager to be a few hours away from here so I could put any doubts behind me.

The first hour of the trail was beautiful, the sunlight off of the moss and leaves bathed the forest in an iridescent green glow. Something out of a fairy tale. Any worries I had been having were long behind me. I had forgotten entirely about “the cult” when we came to the crest of a ridge with a sharp 20 foot drop, giving an amazing view of the forest below.

I was appreciating this view when Vanessa's voice took me out of my trance.

“Ho. Lee. Shit.” She said slowly.

“Beautiful isn't it?” I said warmly.

“No, LOOK.” Mike whispered pointing off to the right. In a small clearing was a group of 10-12 men and women engaged in some bizarre dance. They looked to be dressed in nothing, covered in dark black mud, with patches of leaves stuck all over.

“Nope. Uh-Uh. Fuck that shit. What the hell are they doing?” I asked, trying to keep my voice down. Mike and Vanessa laughed. It was less scary to see in broad daylight like this but I was still uncomfortable with the number of them versus us.

“A rain dance I guess,” Vanessa chuckled. “Come on, they aren't hurting anyone, let's just go around them.”

And we did, without incident. Another few hours on the trail passed and I was almost happy we had seen them. The imagination is often more powerful than reality, at least when it comes to fear. They were just some hippies. Some naked hippies, asking for some rain. And by god did they get it.





We had heard the stories from other hikers. From the Pacific Crest Trail, or the Appalachian. So we knew the weather could be punishing, especially for first timers but nothing outside of experience prepares you for the emotional and psychological toll that days of unending discomfort can wreak on someone.

The rain was unending ... I'm not even sure how long we were in it anymore. We were beginning to feel like nothing would ever be completely dry again. If it didn't let up soon we would have to leave the trail, break from our journey and find a hotel to dry off at… and more importantly someone crazy enough to pick up 3 hitchhikers this far from town.

The rain and fog, when it began, were welcomed. I always loved the atmosphere a light rain and thick fog brought to an early morning, or beginning of dusk. One morning however, everything felt wrong. The rain brought misery instead of reprieve, and the fog brought gloom and distrust rather than intrigue and atmosphere.

Mike showed the first sign of change in this invisibly but undeniably different environment. It was as If the storm itself had changed, and began to change us with it. I first noticed a look in his eye, a change in his mood. I caught him glaring at the back of Vanessa's head, with an anger that I had never known him to possess. I assumed they'd had a pretty rough argument the night before after I'd gone to bed. I know better now.

“Guys,” I finally broke the several hour long silence, “does this all feel wrong to you?” Both of them offered no reply, not even slowing down to acknowledge me.

“Like the birds not chirping? Not seeing as much as a squirrel in 3 ho-” Mike cut my sentence violently short.

“JUST SHUT THE HELL UP VANESSA!” He spat, seemingly out of nowhere. This time Vanessa stopped and so did I, and Mike a few meters ahead spun around to face us. Vanessa and I shared a look of disbelief.

“I … don't think she said anything man…?” Mike certainly hadn't confused my voice for the shrill one of his girlfriend.

“And you stay the FUCK out of it or I'll leave you both behind.” And just like that he spun back around and pressed on leaving Vanessa and I shocked and confused.

“I've never heard him speak like that…” I whispered, mostly to myself.

“Did you hear his voice? It wasn't even his voice!” Vanessa was close to tears, and this statement was as strange to me as Mike's outburst. Mike wasn't acting like himself but his voice was unmistakably his own. Now I was questioning if Vanessa was hearing things too. I opened my mouth to question what she meant but she had already started off behind Mike.

That was alarming, and certainly reason enough for our next stop to be our last but things steadily got worse before that could happen. Mike has been snapping and shouting at something Vanessa and I can't or haven't seen. Things like “Stop fucking looking at us!” , “I see you!” , “Where are you hiding?”. 

Yesterday he apologized to Vanessa in a conversation that might win the award for “Most Bone-Chilling exchange of words between A couple” if that was a contest worth participating in.

“Vanessa I'm sorry for snapping at you. I thought you were the one whispering. Putting those things in my head… But I caught Him. I saw him this morning!”

Vanessa was staring right into Mike's eyes, with a concerning look of condescension and madness. Mike seemed aware of this and looked at me when he spoke next.

“He's watching us, poking his face out of the puddles, and hiding behind trees. Just like the man at the gas station said, it's the Mud Man.” Mike was tearing up now, the fear in him was certainly real if nothing else.

“Xander, he's saying awful things to me… He needs to be fed. He wants me to feed him … both of you … or he won't let us leave the forest…” Mike paused to sob but just as I went to reply-

“I believe him Xander. I've been leading us off the path for DAYS. We should be in a town or have found a road by now or someth …”

Panic completely overtook me, and the rushing blood in my ears drowned out the rest of Mike's raving. The world was silent while I furiously ripped around my pack for a compass. When I found it I questioned my own sanity too. It spun, and spun, and spun. My head followed suit and I toppled over, dizzy and nauseous.

As I lied in the dirt the full meaning of Mike's words burrowed into my skull like some sort of parasite. We've been off path for days. Days. How could he fucking do this to us? Where is everything, why haven't we seen anyone or anything? This section of the trail should have ended, we should have seen Wiarton or another town, hell I don't even remember seeing a trail head! Where are the animals? Why can't I hear them? Why is it STILL raining? The fucking cult?

My thoughts swirled as the panic attack chewed its way through me. It must have spat me out at some point, because I woke up on the wet forest floor with a pile of vomit in front of me, slowly washing away in the unyielding rain. Mike and Vanessa still stood a few feet from me, continuing the discussion I had bowed out from.

“Oh honey,” Vanessa cooed, not unlike a Mother would to an irrational child. “There's demons in your head, and I will get them out. Don't you worry. We will get those demons out no matter what. And that's how we will escape. You're very sick but I know just how to fix you sweetheart.”

From my spot on the ground I had a view of Vanessa's face while she spoke. Her eyes were glossy and cloudy, almost as If she had cataracts. Any doubts I had about my friend's sanity were settled then and there.

Mike kept Obsessing over the “Mud Man”, and Vanessa regarded him like a religious Mother who was convinced their son was possessed. There was a subtle but sinister implication to the “help” she kept promising him.

As terrifying as their condition had become, the woods were scarier. The world lacked geographical sense as Mike had suggested. The Sun, hard as it was to see, rose and set in a new direction everyday. Walking two hours in a straight line was as likely to wind us up somewhere new as it was to bring us to our camp from the night before.

Over the next few days since Mike's confession or revelation, I tried futilely to snap my friends out of their delusions, to help them see how warped the situation was.

“No Mike, shut up. Hell the goddamn Mud-Man, look around! I don't think we're even In Canada anymore!” I snapped, cutting off another one of his insane ramblings. Mike's eyes went wide with fear, he rushed up to me and shoved his Hand over my mouth.

“Dude,” Mike glanced around with paranoia. “Don't fucking talk like that! He is listening. He's always listening, don't you get that by now?” Mike stared deep into my eyes. His were filled with a horrible fear, like a cornered animal. He took his hand off my mouth cautiously, clearly concerned I would hurl another blasphemous comment.

“He won't let us leave until he gets two of us. He wants the last one to suffer, to know of him … I'm trying to make him change his mind.” Mike backed away after giving this… alarming warning, and walked off muttering some gibberish resembling a prayer or apology.

The forest turned on us in every way it could after that. The next morning, the trees had changed. Now looking ugly and diseased, their trunks and branches curled and twisted in odd ways, as if to leer at us. Their roots seemed to trip us no matter how hard we minded our footing, the air had a musky, sweet, putrid odor to it, like the earth was rotting beneath our feet. And the grass, the grass was sharp. It sliced at the flesh of our ankles if we got too far off the center of the path, corralling us towards god only knows what. 

Things came to a head when I found a slightly less threatening tree that had fallen to sit and rest on. I pulled out my trail mix, naively believing there was still some comfort to be had in these woods. Granola, peanut, almond, hazelnut and tiny little caramel squares sealed in a plastic see through bag. The mix looked incredible, standing out in stark contrast to the twisted environment surrounding me. Like a snowbank in the center of hell.

My mouth was pooling with saliva as I opened the bag, but as soon as the air reached my slice of peace and paradise, the mix rapidly decomposed. The caramel boiled and went black, the nuts withered and crumpled up into purple green and black little raisins and the smell coming from the bag rivalled that of the forest around us.

I glanced up to Mike who was sitting in front of me on his own log. He nodded slowly in defeat with me, a welcomed look of lucidity in his eyes. The thought running across both our minds was clear. What the fuck do we do now?

The rest of the day was spent walking aimlessly through the woods. It was clear at this point we would not likely find our way out naturally but the lying down to die option felt less attractive than lying to ourselves.

We stopped to camp in a small clearing we found just as the faint light that made it through the ever-grey sky began to fade. I would have kept walking all night I think, if not for the state of my ankles.

Deep lashes oozed blood all over my socks and shoes and the air itself felt like lemon juice washing over my wounds. The skin around it was awful shades of purple orange and green, infection setting in viciously quickly.

We all set up our folding chairs after carefully removing as much of the razor grass as we could safely manage.

“Still no reception?” I asked weakly to them both, knowing the answer. Vanessa was whispering to herself staring up toward the sky.

Mike ignored the question as well, but he was staring into his water bottle perplexed, his nose slowly curling in disgust. He looked at me and turned the bottle upside down. Even in the dim light, I saw a thick black slime pour out of the bottle. Vanessa’s head snapped to the scene quickly, and then she stood up, gagged and walked towards the tree line to be sick.

“We have to do something Xander,” Mike whispered with his head over his shoulder, making sure Vanessa was out of ear shot.

“I think she's going to kill me. I think that's her plan. Listen to me I love her but she’s fucking gone okay? She's going to kill me to ‘get rid of the demons.’ She's fucking nuts! I think…” He trailed off.

“What, you think what Mike? You’ve not been completely fucking coherent yourself!” I tried to whisper but desperation and fear crept into my voice.

“Shut up. Maybe I can convince the Mud-Man to let us go … for her.” He choked on tears saying this, his eyes looked clear, which gave me a small hope that he was still in there.

“Mike, that's the mother of your children… We aren't fucking killing Vanessa. Start thinking of a new plan.” I said this as calm but firmly as I could manage given the situation. Mike stood up and started pacing, cursing as the grass tore his legs up. He stepped into a large grassless puddle and stared down into it.

”Just fucking let us go! LET US GO!” Take me you fuck, and let them go!” He was screaming at the top of his lungs now.

He stood in front of me, sobbing into the puddle when suddenly I heard a loud crack. Mike looked at me confused, then grabbed his head and collapsed towards me.

There Vanessa stood behind him, with a large rock in her hand. Her face had twisted, warts and acne marked and seeped over her face giving her the look of a witch.

“IT’S THE FUCKING DEMONS IN YOUR HEAD! They won't let us leave. We’re going to get those demons out dear! NO MATTER WHAT!”

She was cackling while she spoke. Mike, on the ground before her, lifted his arm to shield himself as Vanessa lifted the rock to empty demons, brains, or anything else from Mike’s head.

I sat in my chair in a stupor, jaw slack. Not because of Vanessa, but from what I saw behind her.

The puddle.

The one mike had been pleading into, that Vanessa now stood on the front edge of, began to rise. The mud rose and formed an enormous humanoid shape, It towered over Vanessa by at least 4 feet. It was featureless, silent, but it shadowed Vanessa’s movements perfectly, just a foot behind her.

As she lunged forward with the rock, the mud copied and lunged toward her. It covered and enveloped her entirely, then quickly collapsed back into the puddle making a violent suction sound and a small splash as the puddle returned to normal. And just like that, Vanessa was gone. The puddle, the mud, had swallowed her.

I had seen enough. I finally left my seat and grabbed ahold of Mike, he was dazed and bleeding from his head still quite shell shocked from the surprise attack.

“C'mon, get on your feet we need to get the fuck out of here man.” I was yanking on his arm, barely managing to help him to his feet in my sorry state.

“Come on buddy, we aren't staying here, the ground just-” I was dragging Mike off towards the edge of the clearing when he started tugging away.

“Xan … “

“Nah man not right now come on-”

“Xander turn the fuck around man…” Mike said weakly pointing off behind us.

What I saw nearly brought me to my knees. In awe, in fear, in relief. The trees, the bush, were separating to create a path. It happened slowly, invitingly as if to show us a safe route out. The end of that path I could just barely make out movement, passing cars! Some sort of busy highway.

“GO!” And we ran.

“He listened! He listened! We're getting out, we're gonna make it!” Mike was rambling, giving thanks to the Mud-Man for saving us. We made it nearly halfway down the path before it was clear that the Mud-Man was only toying with us instead. The path, maybe 10 feet wide, was now slowly starting to close. The roots of the trees unfurled and reached out into the path trying to snare our feet. I made extra care to dodge puddles, Vanessa's fate still crisp in my mind.

Three quarters of the way, maybe 50 feet left. That's when Mike fucked up. He was only a few feet behind when I heard his boot slop into a muddy puddle.

“AHH Fuck fuck fuck fuck, HELP!” His scream was shrill like a child.

I turned around and saw Mike being pulled into the puddle, on his stomach he clawed to drag himself back out.

“Please! FUCKING HELP ME!” I was frozen again, because his foot hadn’t disappeared into the puddle, not yet. Out of the puddle reached a hand, thin, slender and … feminine? It was all I could do not to puke at the sight. I glanced back down the path. The road was getting shrouded by trees, maybe only 5 feet wide now and still closing.

I must not have hid my indecision well.

“Please don’t fucking leave me! I don’t wanna go under.” He sobbed.

I looked back and forth from Mike to the road. I wanted to be a coward, I wanted to fucking live.

“Please Xander, I’m not crazy! Please d-” Mike's pleas were cut off by the awful sound of water and mud cutting off his airways.

My brain was overridden by my body and I felt shocked to see my hand reaching out to Mike’s. I grabbed tight and began to pull. Slowly his head emerged from the muck. When his face came free he started choking and spitting out chunks of mud.

“Thank you! Fuck oh my god thank you! Get me out, get me out!”

I pulled as hard as I could but he did not budge. The Mud-Man, or rather Vanessa's grip was too strong. Mike sobbed in defeat, still choking up mud.

“Come on Mike, KICK fucking KICK!” I urged.

He gave one last desperate burst of struggle before shrieking in pain. I looked back at his grasped ankle and the hand plunged its fingers deep into the flesh of his calf.

“Oh my god it fucking hurts …” Mike sobbed, gurgling before vomiting a disgusting mud and blood mixture.

Mud began to flow out of his ears, nose, and even seeped from around his eyes. His grip tightened on my hand and I pulled back in resistance. His whole arm from the elbow down ripped off of his body and instead of blood or bones his skin was filled only with mud.

The hand I now held was the same, and promptly melted through my fingers like a wet goo. I threw up violently, body racking with sobs.

“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry …” But my words fell on deaf ears as the rest of Mike’s body deflated, oozing mud until his loose skin lay flat with nothing to hold it rigid anymore. I was still puking and crying as I turned to run.

3 feet of width left. The branches, all covered in thorns tore at my flesh as I ran and the path closed towards me mercilessly. 15 feet to the road, I could hear the cars now. It was sunny on the other side of the trees, a golden light shining into this muddy rainy hell.

10 feet now …squelch …

My feet hit and slipped through a massive black puddle. I fell down hard, knocking the wind out of myself. I scrambled back to my feet as fast as I could, fearing Mike or Vanessa's hands would be quick to seize me. A disgusting squelch and moan sounded from behind me, and stupidly I turned to look.

The mud rose, just as it did when it swallowed Vanessa. Only much much larger. The path had to stop closing to accommodate its massive size.

The mud, or rather the Mud-Man rippled and pulsated as if things were moving inside of it. Where its left and right shoulder would be, 2 faces emerged from the mass. The faces of my friends. They cried, gagged and wretched foul black ooze from their mouths, before pleading for relief.

“Kill us! Please Xander please make it stop …” Both of their mouths spoke in unison, the suffering in their voice was so genuine and haunting. They were still alive, or at least conscious. Prisoners of the disgusting thing in front of me.

From either side of the thing’s body rose 2 arms, one from each of my friends, and they stretched out in an awful 4 armed yawn well beyond normal range of motion. The arms shook and twitched, bones cracking loudly as if the Mud-Man was working out how to properly use an arm.

In between both of my friends faces, where its head ought to be, a shape of a mouth formed, really just a hole in the mud.

It moved as if to roar, but the scream came from Mike and Vanessa's mouths.

The sound was deafening and I screamed back, in pain, in fear, but mostly in grief for the fate of my friends. I was instinctively backpedaling away from the amalgamation, when I turned my head over my shoulder I was shocked, I was hardly 6 feet from the road! From sunshine, it may as well have been the gates of heaven.

The Mud-Man winded up the 2 arms on its right side and made a violent grab for me,

“Go.” Mike and Vanessa said together, followed by an unearthly roar. I turned and lunged for the edge of the tree line, vines, branches and roots tried desperately to seize me before my escape. The roar of the Mud-Man, through my friends mouths, rang my ears like a concussion.

The temperature difference shocked me before I had even hit the ground. I landed hard on the pavement. The sound of the Mud-Man’s scream was drowned out by car motors and chirping birds. Sounds of life. I looked back toward the path, and witnessed the Mud-Man finish its roar. The path was shutting again and it stood in the small hole watching me, its shoulders heaving up and down. The sound was muted, dampened by whatever separated that world and this one, but I could hear enough to know.

They, or it, was laughing at me.
