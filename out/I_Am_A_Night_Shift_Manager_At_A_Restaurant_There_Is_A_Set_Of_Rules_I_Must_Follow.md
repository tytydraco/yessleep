I been with this restaurant chain now for the better half of 8 years, last week i transferred into one of our smaller locations, this would turn out to be a big mistake. 

This location in particular had nothing special about it, other than the fact that it came with something that the other locations did not. 

Sitting in a poorly lit lobby in the middle of know where i found myself interacting with some of the night crew. It was simple small talk and honestly i was beginning to like it here. That was of course until Jake one of the team leaders gave me a sheet of paper and told me to read it. 

I smiled warmly at him before grabbing the paper and setting it down in front of me beginning to read it to myself. 

"RULES OF THE NIGHT SHIFT" were the words spread out in big bulk lettering across the top of the paper. Rules i thought to myself what rules I'm the manager there is no rules that i do not already know about silly paper i thought to myself. 

I started to crumple up the paper and toss it in to the garbage next to me when i heard a stern but calm voice come from behind me. "I wouldn't do that if i were you" I spun around to see jake standing just a few feet away with his hands on his hips looking me up and down. 

"I gave you that list for a reason, i recommend you read and follow it to the letter" he said as he walked backward into the kitchen of the restaurant. I un crumpled the paper and took another look.

Rule 1. The lobby closes at 11pm, if you should see someone in the lobby past 11pm you are to not say a word to the thing just walk to the kitchen grab a burger and hand it to the thing and walk away. it will not hurt you and will eventually disappear. If you so happen to break this rule simply walk away to the office and stay there until the clock hits 12am.

Rule 2. Between 8pm and 9pm there will be a man who appears at the drive thru window but you will never here the beep in your headset go off. Just go to page 2 on your register and tell him he is all set and move him along to the next window, do not make eye contact. If you should make eye contact you are to close the window wait in the office for 1 minute and return to work the thing will be gone. 

Rule 3. If you send an employee to take out the trash and he or she comes back through a different door than what he or she exited from, pick up one of the knives in the kitchen and stab them its not them. If you happen to break this rule well we here at Redacted Restaurant Group will no longer be responsible for your safety. 

Rule 4.  If you get a call between 1am and 1:30am answer it and ask who it is, if they reply with Alex than you are safe and may feel free to answer any of there questions they may have. If it is not then you must hang up the phone and hide under your desk for 30 seconds and then continue your night. 

Rule 5. At any point during your shift if you enter the office and come back out to see the restaurant to not be the same as it was when you entered, return to the office wait 30 seconds and walk back out. If you break this rule well you may never be seen again.

I read over the rules a few more times laughing it off to be some kind of joke on the new guy. "good one guys i know nobody likes the manager but really? you couldn't come up with something different" I said with a chuckle.

However, my laughing was quickly interrupted by a deep raspy voice coming from the other side of the counter. "What's so funny" I went to reply when i stopped myself. Something was off, now I'm not a judgmental person but this man was covered in scars and looked like he been through something so bad it could not be repeated. 

I looked down at my watch 11:10pm, thinking to myself and remembering rule 1 this must have been a test. A test to see whether or not I could follow simple instructions. I walked away and grabbed a hot burger that was sitting on the heat shoot in the kitchen. I turned back and handed it to the man who simply nodded his head and walked away. 

The rest of the night was pretty normal and I honestly thought that there would be know more surprises, now that upper management knew I could follow simple instructions right? 

12:55am came around and the trash had yet to be taken out, I looked toward the drive thru area where the night person Julia was standing. "Hey Julia take out the trash for me would you?" I said shouting from my office.  

She took a few bins out and i saw her come in and out for the next few minutes hauling more and more garbage out. I got lost with doing work on my store computer and jumped clearly startled at the sound of the store phone ringing.

I picked it up and went to begin saying the thank you for calling message when i stopped and remembered rule 4, i glanced at the time 1:05am. But before i could ask who was calling i noticed that Julia had returned, except she came from the opposite side of the restaurant from where she left to tell me she had finished with the trash. 

Remembering rule 3 i sprung out of my chair for the knife in the kitchen but panic washed over me as i did so stopping me dead in my tracks. There was nothing in the rules about what i should do if two rules happened at once. 

I grabbed the knife and plunged it into Julia's chest over and over again before watching her lifeless body fall to the floor. I soon realized my mistake, I never completed rule 4. I ran back to the phone which was now hanging off the hook in the office and proceeded to say who is this.

Nothing but static filled my ears, it got louder and louder and blood was now seeping from my ears and nose. I turned to hide under the desk but it was already to late. Loud stomps could be heard through the restaurant and they were getting closer, the door to the office swung open and what met my gaze was a 11ft monster staring down at my fear driven body laying hunched helplessly under the office desk. 

The monster let out a ear piercing scream as its eyes met mine, the monster bringing its fist down on the desk sending it collapsing onto my already paralyzed body. And just like that it was over, i blacked out.

I eventually came to and when i did i was met with a bald man staring back at me, "Ah I see you met are nice monster who lives in the woods" he said looking down at me holding his hand out as if to lend me a hand back to my feet. 

"NICE?" I yelled in return "That thing tried to kill me" the man glanced over at me for a second before sticking his hand out and handing me an envelop. I opened the envelop and looked inside, it was filled with all crisp new 100 dollar bills. 

"That is for you as a little bonus for doing such a good job on your first night here" I looked up at him and began to speak when he waved his finger in my face in a dismissive manner. "No need for a response there is plenty more where that came from if you wish to continue your journey with the Redacted Restaurant Group good day" he said turning away and walking out the office as if nothing had even happened. 

I decided to return to that location and been here for a year now the rules are still the same but it seems to be getting worse each night i stay. I think i even discovered a knew rule with the meat freezer lord help me.
