   I hadn't been in business long, nor did I ever think that I would start an entrepreneurship in the first place, but such is life on the road I guess. I started out merely a girl on her own, then a wife, then a mother, then a widow, and ended up alone again. When I lost David I diverted all of my motivation towards our daughter Sarah, trying to find the best future of comfort and satisfaction as far as what one could achieve in this existence. I realized she would never find any of these things on the road. The DJ was not happy with that.

   I know now that is the reason he took Davy away. I remember catching glimpses of him watching me cradle our little bundle. His gaze would always break away when I'd try to look into his sad eyes. His expression was always one of optimism so even in the most miniscule of instants the difference would have been clear. He wanted to turn back. No matter what the DJ said, no matter how excitedly it expressed that we had "So much more to see! So many more historical landmarks, gift shops, restaurants, live shows, scenic views, colorful personalities, temporary job opportunities, fun and safety for the whole family!"

   We didn't make it three miles down the opposite direction and my husband was dead. Sarah slept through the whole thing,  so I was able to lay her down in the passenger seat so that I could pull the remnants of him out and get behind the wheel. I obeyed the voice, though I honestly wanted to keep on going the same direction that Davy was going. He talked about his home in Ellisboro, how quiet and boring it was and how it was the perfect place for us now that our wild years were behind us. 

   We were so much alike. He was my best friend. He was my everything. He was me. Feeling the warmth of him soaking through my clothes I wanted to be him, mingle and let our remains melt together in the hot sun. The stink of us fumigate the vehicle, untouched for years and years. Perhaps our mold would darken the glass and everyone would see our love as a defiance towards the DJ. 

   But, our baby was sleeping next to me. So peaceful. In a world where stupid choices met with no tangible consequences. If I left her there she would suffer so much. Eventually the smell would wake her up. She'd cry. Nobody would turn around to check on us and discover her. She'd die alone. I couldn't have that. I guess that's why we are allowed to have children. It's one thing to experience the Road by yourself or with another who has cursed-free will, but to have a voiceless soul tied to your choices? That makes things a little harder. 

   I went on with Sarah for a while. Eventually we were able to make a temporary home in the town of Cole. I got a job as a dancer in one of many shows, looking out over a crowd of distant, empty faces. Eventually, we got a letter from the Being itself that it was time to hit the road again. "So much more to see and experience! So much for your child to learn!"

   Sarah was 5 years old. I bought her a bike and taught her how to ride. One day, as she was learning how to peddle on her own, I was able to let her go. "Mommy! I'm doing it! I can do it all by myself..." I turned away before it happened but I still heard it. I had to let her go on her own. It had to be her decision to keep going the wrong way down the road.

   I was alone. My husband and child were gone. I was just a wretched woman who murdered her own child. I don't want your sympathy nor your judgment. You are not in my shoes and yes I did turn to follow in the same direction as my baby did! Nothing happened. I walked for miles and miles, till my feet bled and my legs began to hurt so bad I thought they would just shatter from the pressure of my ceaseless stride.

   I finally fell down and sobbed into the pavement, a slow death was what I deserved. It's what I honestly wanted. But I didn't get even that. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and I looked up to see a young boy with a large smile on his face. He was dressed in clothes that seemed from the early 20th century and he had a satchel of letters hanging from his shoulder. "Message for you Ma'am." He said politely, yet dropping the letter beside my face then took off on an old timey bike up the road.

   So now I'm here. I got my orders. I don't have to travel any more, which is good, but I can finally see what is ahead for travelers. I run a gift shop on the outskirts of Ellisboro, Davy's town, handing out free coupons for sites on up a ways. The shop is endless with its shelves of brochures, tickets, trinkets, and such. I'll never not have enough work to keep me going, to keep folks interested! I tell the customers as they leave, especially those that have traveled for a long time or have...families, the same thing that they hear over the radio.

   "So much to see! So many places to go! Fun and safety for your whole family!"
