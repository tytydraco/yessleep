The sounds of chittering teeth overlayed the solemn service.  My cousin, Aidan, sat in the front row, one ahead and two seats down from me.  Rigid and tense, his eyes were fixed on the lower steps before the coffin.  By all accounts it would seem he was frozen in place, except for whatever chill sent his jaw into a shiver.

The loss was hard on all of us.  My brother, Gabe, sat beside me with his hands folded in his lap and barely held back tears.  Despite the gravitas of the ceremony, it amazed me the contradictions between these two.  My brother, barely holding it together.  My cousin, stoically enduring the funeral seemingly unfazed save for his clacking teeth.  The death hurt me as well, we were close ever since we were children, but with my brother falling apart beside me, I felt I had to be the strong one.  I rested my head on his shoulder, and grabbed one of his hands, hoping the physical touch would ease his mind.  His grip tightened, and remained so for the duration of the service.

“Are you okay?”  I asked once the funeral came to a close, and we were free to stand.

Gabe shook as if he felt the same cold as our cousin.  He sniffled, and I saw the path along his cheeks traced from two leaking damns.  “Yes, I think so, or I will be” he breathed in deep and hard.

“I didn’t think you would be affected this much” I commented, slightly surprised by his sensitivity.

He shook, rubbing his palms against his eyes, “Well, I just... You two were so much alike and, the whole service, I just kept imagining you.  You know, what if that was *you*.”  The last word cracked in his throat.

I didn’t know he cared about me so much.  I felt touched, my emotions had been simmering beneath the surface, but this pushed them out.  Tears welled in my eyes and all I could manage was “Oh,”.

My brother sniffled again, seemingly unfazed by my lack of shared expression.  “I don’t know how *he’s* doing it,” he said, nodding toward our cousin.

Aidan stood near the coffin with his parents and girlfriend, accepting condolences.  Or, in his case, deferring to his family.  He stood so still, an unnatural freeze frame in a video, seemingly stuck in place as the movie goes on around him.  Except for his trembling jaw.

“I’ll talk to him,” I said quietly, feeling the need to continue the role of a rock in the whirlpool of emotions around me.

Gabe nodded, “I’ll meet you at home,” he replied, and left for the parking lot.  The service was over, but the ground was frozen so the burial would take place another day.  Our parents and my aunt and uncle, planned to handle some legal details after the ceremony, but we were free to leave whenever we wished.  I watched my aunt and uncle move to a small table with my parents.  They left a small space open in their circle around the table as if expecting one more.  They always did this, an observation I made as a kid watching them have serious conversations.  The space was left open for an Uncle I never met, who they lost in their childhood.  The details of his passing were muddled at best, but the parallels to the present weighed eerily on my mind.

Before I left, I wanted to check on Aidan.  Approaching the front, the remains, I felt unnerved.  Shaky.  She was so young, and the circumstances so bizarre.  My focus settled for too long on the casket, and I felt the chill my cousin must be feeling.  Uncomfortable, I adverted my eyes and turned my attention to Aiden.  He had a thousand-mile stare, his blue green eyes gazed at memories only he could see.

“H-hey, how are you doing?” I asked awkwardly.  Liza, his girlfriend and my best friend, with her arms around his shoulder trying to offer comfort, shot me a look.   It was quite clear how he was doing, obviously this was the worst day of his life.  In spite of my poorly worded question, he seemed to understand.

“I hate this.”  He muttered, still afflicted by winter’s grip. “I hate this so much.  I hate to it my bones.”  His voice was flat, monotone, matter of fact.

Empathy swelled within me.  Between my own grief and suppressed emotion, seeing him in so much pain was like tossing a stone in a bucket full of water.  I threw my arms around my cousin in an awkward three-way hug between him, Liza, and me.  Although he didn’t return the gesture, I felt him trembling beneath against me.

After separating, I muttered a hushed goodbye and told Liza I would call her soon.  Her focus now, understandably, was singularly for my cousin, but I craved an opportunity to unload on my her.  She nodded her assent, and I left the funeral home.

As I made it outside, a solid grip grabbed my arm and spun me around.  I was pulled into a deep, meaty hug that took the wind from me and smothered me quiet, muffling any attempt at disapproval.

“Ohh, honey! Lord, I am so sorry for your loss. I know you too must have been close, gawd, I was tearing up just at the thought of how you and your brother must’ve been feeling!”

*‘Let me go,’* I wanted to shout but her grip only tightened, and I only whimpered.

“Lord, to think how she got herself into that mess.  I mean, did ya have any idea the sins she was playing with? So sad, just like your uncle.  That boy going off into them woods with that other boy.  Doing Lord knows what, and findin’ lords punishment for their sinning.  How a child could be so far gone, I never know.  I mean, if she were mine, I woulda beaten out those awful thoughts from her before the truck did. Mmm, mmm.  If she were mine, she never woulda been in that position.  Naked and her brain in the clouds.  Mmm, mmm. No, child of mine woulda behaved that way, but now she’s flyin with the angels.  She wanted to be in the clouds so bad, smokin for it here on earth, but she got her wish I suppose. Don’t let nothing ever tempt you here like that, honey.”

I began to tremble again.  I thought it must have been the cold, but I was also angry.  This lady, this woman I couldn’t even identify, shaming my cousin at her own funeral.  I felt sick, disgusted, mad.

I managed to wriggle my arms in between me and her and shoved her back.  Angry tears welled, but I didn’t want to show her.  “Good talking to you,” I muttered, “Hope to see you at the next funeral” I said more loudly.

The drive home I fought back tears.  Angry tears.  Sad Tears.  Confused tears.  How my cousin ended up in her predicament was still a mystery to all of us.  I turned into our neighborhood, and the drove the same road the truck drove.  I passed the spot where they found her, down the street from my house, and I felt myself began to tremble.  My teeth clicked together, and I cursed the winter weather.  I needed to distract myself.  I turned on the radio but what played I don’t remember.  I thought back to what that woman, I think my great aunt, said about my uncle.  His death was strange too.

Supposedly, he went out into the woods, shaking with anger.   A boy, that was known to bully him at school, followed, presumably to harass him more.  That was the last anyone saw them.  Three days later, the police found their remains, with their bones scattered all over the place.

No one could make heads or tails of what happened.  Some said it was cultist, some said animals.  Then the reason the boys were together became garbled.  Some said they were enemies, then some began to say they were friends or even more.  They went into the woods to do something bad, criminal or worse.  I asked my grandmother once about the story, and the different versions I heard at family gatherings over time.  She said that people often try to find things they don’t like about ones they lost to make their passing more bearable, even if they have to make it up.  I then asked her what she thought happened, and Grandma said, “That boy was a terror on my son and, in our family, anger is dangerous and hate runs deep.”

It had begun to snow when I pulled into the driveway and parked next to my brother’s car.  I walked through the front door and dropped my keys in their place, a little bowl on small table near the door.  Straight ahead was a sliding glass door that leads to the backyard, the perimeter of which is made of a wooden fence with a gate.  Beyond the fence is the woods I played in with my brother and cousins, and beyond the woods is my cousins’ home.  Cousin’s.  Singular now.  The thought of us all playing together tightened the knot in my chest a little more.

I walked down the hall towards the sliding doors only to stop halfway, turn, and go up the stairs.  A single flight of thirteen steps led to a landing above the garage and the kitchen.  On the right, a bathroom, my parents’ bedroom, and a slatted closet door.  On the left, my room and my brother’s room.  His door was half closed, meaning come or go.  The thought of retreating to my own bedroom to mourn alone appealed to me, but I still felt shaky from my interaction with the distant aunt.  Wanting to vent, I opened my brother’s door.

He sat at his computer chair pushed towards the window.  He watched the snow fall in the backyard, his eyes distant, lost in thought.   Perhaps the same thoughts I had earlier.  I sat in a bean bag chair at his feet.  In his hands he held a joint.  A second one with a blue tip sat on the windowsill.  I thought the color was odd, but it really only stands out now because he offered it to me.  I still feel a dash of fear when I imagine what would have happened if I had said yes.  Instead, I declined, and we sat in a silence for a moment as I tried to work through my frustration.  My teeth were grinding too hard to open my mouth to start.  Instead, my brother spoke.

“What’s the point of funerals?”  He asked, his voice tired with a little tremble in it.

The question redirected my thoughts from the obnoxious aunt.  Distracted enough to speak, I replied, “I guess, to give us a role in the loss,”

“What roles?”

“You know, there’s those who were closest to our-” I caught myself, extrapolation was fine at a distance, but I couldn’t bring myself to make it personal, “the deceased.  They need their role the most, because they can’t move forward without some motions to act out.  Everyone else plays a part, provides their condolences, gives the ones grieving a chance to respond, to begin moving on.”

“So, there is the grieving, the condolensers, what about you? And me?”

I paused and thought, “We’re caught in between, I guess.  No one’s trying hard to comfort us, but we still try to fulfill the role of helping Aidan.” I was rambling now, not thinking much of my words.

“And the murderer?”

My eyes shot to my brother, his eyes still looking outside.  He sat stoically; his question was serious.  “The truck driver wasn’t there.  Even if he were, he wouldn’t have a role, his presence would make everyone uncomfortable.”

“No, not him,” My brothers voice became, deep, shaky.  He seemed to struggle to get the one syllable out. “Me.”

The next ten minutes I don’t really recall.  The only memory I have of that conversation, that confession, is what I’ve told others.  He picked up the blue tipped bud and told me everything.  I remember tensing, my mind disassociating, and yet feeling the stab to my heart.  Once he was done, he lit the laced blunt, and began to smoke.  “She reminded me so much of you…”  He breathed, his tear-stained face turning to me, hoping to see… what? I don’t know.  Acceptance, forgiveness?  Disgust.  That is how I felt, and fear.  I had to get out, I had to leave.  He laid back on his bed, and I took that moment to run.

I ran out of the room, slamming his door behind me.  Down the stairs, into the living room, I jumped on the couch.  I cried, I felt sick.  I breathe in and out hard, panicking.  Then the house creaked.

I flipped around and looked at the stairs.  From my spot on the couch, I could see the top landing, but nobody was there.  Paranoid, my body ached.  I stared at the stairs, wondering what to do.  I wanted to run, to drive away, but I couldn’t pull myself from the couch, that spot.  I remembered what he said about the joint, what it was mixed with.  I remembered he started smoking it.  I knew he wouldn’t be moving for a while.

Liza.  I had to tell someone, and she was my best friend.  I needed to vent, cry, advice on what to do next.  I was shaking, trembling.  My phone was in my pocket.  I pulled it out and typed in her name, pressed call, it rang, she answered.

“Hey! How are you?  I have you on spea-“

“Listen Liza!  I need to tell you this, please listen!”  She could hear the panic, the cry in my voice.

“Okay, slow down take a deep breath and tell me what’s wrong…”

And I told her.  I recanted word for word what my brother told me.  How he loved our cousin, more than just familial bonds or the familiarity of a friend.  He thought she was beautiful, sweet.  They were so close, he thought she felt the same.  How the night she died, he had invited her over, to talk, for a little smoke, and for a deep heart to heart.  How he felt nervous about what he was going to confess, how he hoped she felt the same, but he couldn’t know for sure.  How he came to the conclusion that, if he added a little something more to hers, she might be more willing to listen, to agree with an open heart.  He tipped the ones that would be hers with a blue sharpie.  She came over, they talked, they smoked.  She didn’t understand what he was saying but he felt he needed to show her, that he could convince her through action.

I nearly puked again at this point.  I hated this, hated it down to my core.  I began to shake more intensely.  A stutter appeared in my voice between clacking teeth.

He took off her clothes.  Her mind was muddled, in a haze.  Yet, she felt something was not right, through the cloud she was fighting it.  At some point, he realized what he was doing and hesitated.  She pushed him off and ran.  She wanted to leave, to go home.  Confused, still in a daze, she ran out the wrong door.  She ran into the street.  It was dark, and cars are fast.  Trucks are heavy.

Snot ran down my mouth, I was swallowing and spitting it, but I never stopped.  I spoke until there was nothing more to say.  Then there was silence. 

Then a scream.

“Aidan!  Are you okay?!?” Liza shouted from her end.

The scream came from the phone but sounded distant.  I looked at it in confusion.  Liza came back.

“I’m sorry, he’s shaking so bad.  Hold on.  Aidan? Aidan?!”  Another scream.  Continuous screaming.  Loud, voice cracking, chord tearing shrieks.  The kind of scream reserved for death or the discovery of.  My phones speakers ripped themselves apart to provide the sound. I never heard Aidan scream, but I was sure that it could not be him.  I heard a notable bang, bang.  Liza dropped the phone.  She was screaming now.  The screaming continued, but began to grow distant.  She was running away.

The next thing I heard still haunts my dreams.  Popping.  Popping, ripping, tearing.  A squelch, the squeezing of ground meat.  Then chittering.  Bone against bone.  Nothing but clicking and clacking like teeth.

Soon that noise grew distant and vanished too.  I was scared, confused.  I stared at my phone for a long while. My mind wandered to the glass door, and I got up to stare outside.  My eyes following the path to where my cousin’s house would be.  I don’t how long I stood there, part of me must have known what I was waiting for, but eventually *it* came.

Through the trees, up to the gate.  The wooden entrance bowed, splintered, cracked, and broke.  Through the yard it came, slowly, shambling.  My breath caught in my throat.  My heart raced, and my face strained from terror.  My mind emptied all fear into my throat, and I screamed.

I would only connect the dots later.  What that thing was that crept through my yard.  After the police questioning, after the trauma center, and after the CBT appointments.  Some shared with Liza, many more on my own.  Only after years had passed did I learn about my cousin’s house.  How they found the bloody scene, like an explosion from the inside out, a fleshy mess of gore, muscle, organs, and clothes spread out down the hall.  Out the back door, through the woods.  Dropping off pieces of remaining flesh, one by one, piece by piece, as it walked.  Up the back porch, in full view.

Aidan’s voice echoed in my memory, ‘*I hate it to my bones.’*

I stumbled backwards, nearly falling as it approached the glass door.  It pressed a hand, colored in white, red, pink and wrapped in vasculature, against the door. It pushed.  The door began to groan.  I shouted my brother’s name as the glass broke.

Flight kicked in and I ran up the stairs.  My anger and disgust were now replaced with the need for survival.  I didn’t know why, but I thought if I could just get to my brother, he would know what to do.  He could handle anything.  But when I reached his door, I found it locked.  I pounded on it, begging him to open it, but he didn’t answer.  Then I heard it.  Crushing glass with sickening squish of what muscle remained attached to the feet.  The groans as bone rubbed bone, the pops of air as the knees bent to climb the stairs.

I panicked, and looked to my room, but it was too close to the top of the stairs.  Right then, I could see the crest of its skull, a white cap rising into view.  I turned and saw the closet door.  It had to work, I had to hide.  There was nothing else I could do.  I ripped the door open, and slammed it shut just as fast, with me on the inside.  I shrunk down to floor, my body shaking with a might I have not felt since.  I knew for sure it would find me.  That it would simply press that skeletal hand to the door.  The door would creak, crack, and break.  Wood would splinter around me, and then…

The sounds of chittering teeth overlayed the hall.  It grew louder, the clacking grew faster, excited.  Through the slits of the closet door, I could see it standing there.  Just in front of me.  My heart nearly burst from my chest.  It stepped into view.  I stuffed my fist into my mouth to prevent a scream.  I still have scars on my thumb from the bite.  It stood before the closet door and stopped.  It seemed to sway, left to right, as if considering.  My breathing grew rapid.  Draped in nerves attached to the spine, the lungs had not quite dropped from its chest, and its eyes.  It turned toward the closet and I could see its eyes.  Round, white orbits, all the larger due to the lack of surrounding tissue.  Yet, the iris, the unique hue blue green. 

It was my cousin.

Aidan.

It considered me.

It turned around and went to my brother’s bedroom door.  It placed a hand against the door.

The events that happened next are burned into my mind as auditory nightmares.  There’s the door giving way.  My brother’s confused and addled questioning.  The dawning scream of terror.  The scream that continued just above the sounds of peeling, ripping, tearing, and chittering.  The screams eventually fading, but the organic noises continued amongst the clacking and clicking of bones at work. 

Eventually, the noises stopped.

I expected Aidan or Gabe to come out, but they never did.  I remained perched in that spot against the closet wall for hours just waiting.  Waiting for something or someone to emerge. 

But nothing, nobody ever did. 

Eventually, my parents came home, but those memories of the discovery have vanished.  My next memory is of a police officer finding me crouched in the same position as before, curled behind the closet door.

I was eventually questioned, but I could not give answers.  I barely trusted my own memory, and knew they would question it to.  It was so unbelievable, for everyone involved.  The discovery of my cousin’s body at his home, a horrible mush.  The discovery of Aidan’s bones in my brother’s room, Gabe’s skin equivalently softened and peeled.  My brother’s bone, every single one accounted for, tossed into his closet.  And me. Alive. In the closet across the hall.

I would like to say I have recovered now, but recovery is always a work in progress.  Nightmares wake me.  Stray wandering thoughts intrude throughout the day.  But, worst of all, is the anger.  The anger I still hold against my brother.  It so readily appears now.  Whenever I have a bad day at work, or someone cuts me off in traffic.  Whenever I’m in an argument, or if I see a picture of my family.  Whenever I recall events of that day. I feel my body begin to tighten.  My arms, hands, legs, begin to shake.  Then I hear the sounds of my chittering teeth.
