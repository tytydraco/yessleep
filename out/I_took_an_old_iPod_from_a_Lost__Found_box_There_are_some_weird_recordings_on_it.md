Hello everyone. I f34 am currently experiencing some real weird shit. I'm sorry if my grammar is bad, English is not my first language.  

I won't say where I am exactly, but I'm in Europe and this gym I'm frequenting is a local owned business,  in case that's relevant. Also I'm on mobile, this is a throwaway, yadda yadda. I really need to hear your thoughts on this matter, because right now I feel like I'm losing it. Right. Onto the story, I guess?

&#x200B;

The first time the ancient thing caught my attention must've been 3 or 4 years ago, not too long after I started going to this particular gym. I had left my nice, brand-new Nalgene water bottle next to the threadmill (not for the last time I have to admit) and the receptionist pointed me towards their Lost & Found box. 

Luckily, my water bottle was right there, still half full, mixed in with some single gloves, a rather worn-looking green-ish men's T-shirt, a couple random odd objects like a souvenir keyring pendant and - an old iPod. 

I immediately recognized it as a 3rd generation classic iPod, not because I'm tech-savvy or anything, but simply because I had one just like that. It had been a Christmas present from my dad, right after it came out. When was that, 2003? Probably. I smiled when I took it in my hand, fond memories emerging with the familiar feel of holding it. I turned it around. Yep, totally the same model as mine. 15 gigabytes, copyrighted 2003. In fact - even the long, deep scratch on the back looked kinda familiar. But it couldn't actually BE my iPod, now could it? What even happened to it? I remember losing one of my music players at a fair back in '05 or '06 (I'm prone to losing things, and that night was also one of the first times I ever ended up black-out drunk), but whether that was the 3rd gen iPod or any other player I've ever owned, there's no saying. 

Eventually I put the old thing back into the box. I probably would've forgotten about it, but as I said: I'm very good at losing things. So ever since that day, I've regularly checked back in with the Lost & Found, retrieving forgotten sports bras (yeah I know, not embarrassing at all lol), my water bottle, the next water bottle after I left the original one at the bus station, and then the next when that one vanished for good. Every time I saw the old iPod, I made a mental note to maybe check the drawer I keep all my old electronics, chargers and cords in, only to forget about it the second I left the gym.

&#x200B;

In fact, it was only yesterday, when I went through said drawer looking for something completely unrelated, that I remembered. I did find the charger, but no iPod.  

Sunday is my gym day, so today at the gym I deliberately went to the L&F to take another look at the iPod. The same familiar feeling greeted me, the scratched and battered metal back cool against my palm. I thought about my dad, about that particular Christmas Eve when he gifted me my first digital music player. That was before everything in my family went to shit, of course.  

Looking at the receptionist and deciding on a whim, I said, 'Hey, can I ask you a question?'  

&#x200B;

Receptionist guy was a full-time employee, bald but with a neatly trimmed stubble, and tattooed from head to toe. He was looking exactly like you'd expect a gym guy to look like. I didn't know his name, but I knew he had been working there long before I joined. Come to think about it, it was totally possible that he owned the place.  

He gave me a small nod, inviting me to continue.  

'This iPod,' I held it up so he could see it from behind the counter, 'How long has it been here?"

Receptionist-or-maybe-owner-guy let out a small chuckle. 'Forever,' he said. 'I think it came with the box.' It was a lame joke, but I gave a small giggle as an act of courtesy. He was rather hot after all.

'Why, you wanna have it?' he continued.

I blinked. Did I? 'You sure?'

'No one ever came for it.' He shrugged. 'But it's probably dead anyway.'

I pressed the power button for a few seconds and the display and buttons lit up. I caught a quick look at the main menu before it went dark again. 'Very much alive,' I muttered to myself. Remarkable. And I even had a charger back home. A bit louder I said, 'Imma take it, if that's ok.'

Receptionist guy shrugged again. 'Knock yourself out.'

I don't know why I took that stupid thing with me, I really don't. I kind of wish I didn't. Maybe it was nostalgia about my own teenage years. Maybe it was curiosity, you know, that weird urge to snoop through some stranger's music library for no good reason at all. It does feel kind of personal.

&#x200B;

When I came home, I put the charger in, waited a couple minutes, then pressed the power button again. Again, the iPod came to life. Red buttons, blue screen.

Do you know that strange tugging feeling you get in your stomach whenever you do something you're not supposed to do? A little bit like nausea but not quite? The moment it hit me, I realized I hadn't experienced this feeling in almost two decades. It was awesome.  

I went straight to Playlists, expecting to see music sorted by artist or maybe some personal collections like 'driving', 'workout', or 'spring break 2007' or whatever. Instead, there were about a dozen different playlists labeled by date. I opened the first one, '3 march 2005'. It contained a bunch of files with random-looking numbers as titles, you know, the kind of titles that are automatically generated when you record something on your device.  

&#x200B;

A kind of dread suddenly emerged in my gut, mixing up with the former anticipation, but I can't explain why. It didn't even make sense. Whatever was on this player was probably pirated music or something, and that's why the titles looked odd. I went back to my electronics drawer, fished out a knotty pair of in-ears and plugged them into the connector, then I opened the first audio file.  

First, I only heard static. Then, faintly, something rhythmic. I turned the volume up to max and realized that it wasn't music or even some kind of beat, it was the sound of someone breathing. Quick, labored breathing. Woah, okay. So the former owner had recorded sex noises on their iPod. Yes, cool, whatever. But I wasn't gonna listen to this. Yuck.

&#x200B;

The recording was only about 20 seconds long, and before I could nope out of it, the next one started. More breathing, this time more ragged sounding, but also louder. I turned the volume down and was about to take the headphones out of my ears when the third recording came on and the breathing turned into something else. A whimper? Nah, that wasn't sex sounds. This sounded... scared. I skipped to the next track and heard soft sobbing. Jeesh. The feeling of dread in my stomach intensified. What the hell was this shit?  

I went back to Playlists and skipped through more dates, more recordings. Sometimes it was nothing but static, then again I could make out muffled crying. 

&#x200B;

On the fourth date, 29 march 2003, the whispering started. I couldn't for the live of me figure out what was being said, even though I turned the volume up to max again. It was most definitely my native language, because every so often I would catch a familiar word or two, sometimes as much as half a sentence. But I couldn't grasp what the voice was talking about. It was always the same voice.

I scrolled down to the end, to the last playlist that was called '13 april 2003'. But when I clicked on it, instead of more recordings, a little lock icon appeared. Locked. I don't even remember that you can lock folders on an old iPod?? I mean, it's not like there's a keyboard or any possibility to enter a password or code. If the folder is password protected, I guess I'll have to plug it into my computer to access it.  

&#x200B;

I haven't yet done that though. It's been a couple of hours since I listened to the first track. Now it's after midnight, I know I should totally go to bed, but I'm still sitting here on the floor and don't know what to do.  

I've listened to every single recording on the iPod that was accessible. I listened to the whispering, trying to make sense of it. You know, because here it's where it gets weird. Like, really really weird.  

It's not the whispering or the breathing or even the sobbing. It's that voice, always the same voice. I know that voice. And I'm sure you'll think I'm crazy, lord, I HOPE you guys are going to tell me I'm crazy, because I think I recognize that voice. I think... I think that's my voice.

Now what. What do I do?
