I’ve always loved Scotland—the history, the myths, the sheer, unrelenting beauty of the land. The idea of walking the same hills as the ancient Picts, the warrior people who once resisted Rome itself, fascinated me. So, when I finally got the chance to visit the Highlands, I didn’t hesitate. I rented a car, loaded up on supplies, and set out alone to find the most remote, untouched parts of the countryside.

Somewhere near Sutherland, I found a valley that my mind told me I should explore, it was deep, shadowed, and unsettlingly quiet. I should have turned back right then.

As I walked deeper into the valley, I started to see them. At first, I thought they were carvings—strange, spiraling symbols etched into the trees, the rocks. But then I noticed something worse: bones. Old, brittle bones tied together in intricate designs, hanging from branches like forgotten wind chimes.

I turned to leave. That’s when I saw the first one.

He was standing at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by the mist, completely bare except for the swirling, ink-black tattoos covering his skin. They weren’t just symbols—they *moved*, shifting and writhing like they were alive. His eyes were white, expressionless, and when he opened his mouth, I saw that his teeth had been sharpened into jagged points.

Then more of them emerged from the trees.

I ran. I don’t remember how long, only that I could hear them behind me—soft footfalls, whispering voices in a language I didn’t recognize. I tripped, slamming into the earth. That’s when they caught me.

They didn’t speak. They only *watched*. I was surrounded, paralyzed with fear as one of them stepped forward. His tattoos were the most intricate of all, spiraling across his chest like a living labyrinth. He knelt beside me and reached out, dragging a filthy finger across my forehead.

Then he smiled.

Pain exploded through me as I felt something burn into my skin. I screamed. The last thing I saw before I blacked out was his face, inches from mine, his white eyes staring into my soul.

I woke up alone, my head pounding, my body aching. Somehow, I was back near my car. My clothes were torn, and my forehead felt raw.

I checked my reflection in the window.

There, etched into my skin, was one of their symbols.

I don’t know what it means. But at night, when I close my eyes, I see them. Waiting. Watching. And I know, deep down, that they let me go for a reason.

Because they *marked* me.

And one day, they’re coming back.

I drove straight to my hotel, hands trembling on the wheel. My forehead throbbed, the symbol feeling as if it were still burning into my skin. By the time I reached the small inn I was staying at, my legs nearly gave out as I stumbled inside.

The receptionist, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes, gave me a worried look. “You alright, love? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I didn’t even hesitate. “I— I was in the hills. Near Sutherland. There was… something out there. People. They weren’t normal. They—” I stopped, realizing how insane I sounded.

Her expression shifted, the warmth in her eyes flickering into something else. Pity. “Aye, the Highlands can do that to some. The isolation, the legends. Makes the mind play tricks.”

“No,” I insisted. “They were real. They *marked* me.” I yanked up my sleeve, revealing the strange burned-in tattoo on my forehead through the reflection behind the counter.

She barely glanced at it before sighing. “You tourists and your ghost stories.”

I gritted my teeth. “It’s *not* a story. They spoke in some old language, their eyes were white, their teeth were—”

“Listen,” she interrupted gently, “get some rest, yeah? Have a drink. Whatever you saw, it’s just the hills playing tricks.”

I wanted to scream. Instead, I nodded numbly and turned away, heading to my room. As I locked the door behind me, I knew one thing for certain.

No one would believe me.

And that was the worst part.

Because when I shut off the lights, I swore I heard whispering just outside my window.

Soft, ancient words in a language I didn’t understand.

And I'd never see Scotland the same way again
