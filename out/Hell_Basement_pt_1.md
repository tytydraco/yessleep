Its a long standing theory, assuming you are a believer, that Hell is deep deep down below us and Heaven is above. Now imagine if you were 'born' or created if you will, in Hell. It would be fair to assume that you would class the world of the living above as a sort of paradise above for you and the other residents of Hell, their own little Heaven on Earth. On this logic it would also be fair to assume that some choose to believe there is a greater Evil that strikes fear into even the most despicable abominations in Hell and that place resides below Hell itself.


When i died, briefly, during my commute to work, the last thing i ever considered was pre-judgement for my sins throughout my time on this Earth and what was in store for me after i shuffle from this mortal coil.


The crash itself was a blur, i found out later someone didn't check both ways before they left their junction and completely side swiped me causing me to hit the centre division of the highway flipping my car multiple times thus rendering my body a broken, bloody mess later described by my ever helpful brother as roadkill in a suit.


The first thing i remember, before i even had chance to take in the sights and the sounds or make sense of anything logically, was the smell. It was so invasive it almost felt like i was being attacked by it, a burning putrid smell that only subsided to be replaced by a humid fleshy smell i will remember long after i'm dead....completely.


I found myself sat in a bare room, bare except for me and the cold concrete slab i was sat upon. The walls were barely covered in a decaying wallpaper i assume at one time in its life was white, what was left of it had the colouration closer to a yellowish swampy green and from the looks of it would also be sticky to the touch. Directly in front of me was a door frame with no door that led to a dimly lit corridor i had no intention of exploring, with another door frame at the other end shrouded in shadow. Down both sides of the corridor were closed doors each with a circular hole head height, just about big enough to fit a hand into.


As i looked around the room a figure appeared in the door way, at least 7 feet tall, shoulders touching each side of the door frame as he entered. Looking the stranger up and down trying to take in the sheer proportions before me, it was like looking at The Mountain from Game of Thrones if he took steroids, dressed like the cast of Mad Max and took body modification tips from Pinhead. Down each bicep were lacerations deep enough to see his muscles working, both wrists were cut down to the tendons and at least 80% of his body was scorched.


"Follow me" The only words to leave the strangers mouth as he turned around to lead me down the corridor, revealing the exit wound of what must of been a double barrel shotgun where the crown of his head used of be.


By now i was certain i was dreaming, or hallucinating or at worst this was the last torrid thought's my brain wanted to torture me with before i passed on, if only this was the extent of the torture i was about to be acquainted with.


As i followed the man down the corridor, each door passed greeted me with fresh unadulterated screams from the occupants within, i dare not peer through the crude holes in these doors as i pass to see what was causing all this Hellish noise... i just knew whatever was behind these closed doors would haunt the rest of my days.


As we passed through the next door we were greeted by a middle aged man in a black suit, his features were average for someone you'd expect to work in a bank, or a high rise office with his meticulous hair cut and purposley shaved 5 O'clock shadow. The fact he did'nt look like anyone else around here, or seem phased by any of it made me more nervous than the silent behemoth beside me.


"Mr Hackett, i assume you have alot of questions for me, due to time constraints i request you ask as we walk, we have lots to see and only a few infinite lifetimes to see it in." And with that the man turned around and walked off down the spiral staircase situated in the room behind him gesturing for me to follow.


"Where are we, and who are?" was the first words i managed to stammer as we began our descent down the spiral staircase.


"Im...sort of like a middle man, a messenger so to speak" The man replied, grabbing a torch from the stairwell, i hadn't noticed until he grabbed it that it was getting darker the further we spiralled.


"A middle man?  A middle man for who, and where are we?" looking behind me we were being closely followed by the behemoth blocking any thought of retreating back up the stairs.


"When you had your collision Mr Hackett, at 08:36am the morning of Monday the 6th of August 2018 that gave all who are interested right to claim what is now rightfully theirs, in this instance, your soul." The man reeled off the information lile a court summons.


"My soul?" i exclaimed, bracing myself on the walls of the stairwell to keep myself steady, the unrelenting spiralling motion of the stairs was becoming increasingly harder to navigate.


"For now, yes, Your soul." The mans shadow began to grow on the stairwell wall as the light from our destination began to creep up the dark stairs, flickering, almost making his shadow dance along side us.


As we reached the ground floor every animal instinct a human posesses clawed its way to the surface, fight or flight and i so desperately wanted to fly from this pit. I stood in the doorway trying to take in the sight before me.


Large stone pillars held up the cave ceiling, rows upon rows of these pillars stretched as far as the eye could see. The pillars were all covered in what at first looked like mesh, but as i got closer to the first pillar i could see it was made of barbed wire. Wrapped around each pillar from top to bottom with very little space inbetween were mutalated people tangled amongst the barbed wire, with chunks of flesh missing, eyes hanging out, vomiting on the ones below, all crying out...still alive begging for forgiveness and help. At the base of each pillar were ravenous dogs clawing and biting at anyone in reach taking their pound of flesh snarling at one another while keeping an eye on me as i walked by. I looked up to see a circle of birds around most pillars, occasionally one of the huge black birds broke from the circle to dive at one of the helpless souls, biting at lips, ears and nostrils.


The room was a chorus of screams from the damned.


"Is this....is this hell?" i asked the man, still power walking amongst the dogs without even giving them a second glance, i on the other hand had to avoid snaps from their incredibly strong jaws and nipping at my ankles as i followed.


"Oh no no Mr Hackett, we've looked into your past and found you do not fit the criteria of Hell" The man replied over his shoulder


"Im confused then" i continued "then where am i?"


"For the crimes you've commited, and the acts you befell upon your fellow man even the residents of Hell didn't want you. So i was elected to take you under my management, welcome to Hell's Basement, where the unwanted and down right worst of the worst are sent for penance. This is your preview into what you have instore because we believe people like you should know whats coming."


As if like a macabre movie reel my mind played out all the things i had done with my time on Earth, i stood as they played out in order not holding back any detail. Physically flinching away with every memory of me striking my family pet, killing the local wildlife with my bare hands, striking my first girlfriend...


I knew what was coming, it had just got past when i was a teen, i knew what was coming


Manipulating the friend of my partner to sleep with me, then convincing her to kill herself when she became unstable after the guilt had eaten her from the inside.


I knew what was coming, it had to be next, i knew it was coming


My partner's little sister came into view, i show up behind her in the doorway, we talk for a little bit then i sit on the edge of her bed. I'm all too familiar with what happened next, the manipulation, the abuse. I never intended to do anything but the black thoughts in my head craved being satisfied and she seemed so pure, so innocent it felt like the only way i could be satiated. But i was wrong. This just awoke a need within me, and she wasnt enough.


Over that summer i abducted, abused and killed several children all in the same way all without it being traced back to me, it went down as one of the most horrifying serial killers still to be caught due to the extent the abuse i put them through and the manner i killed them, all with my bare hands and all in drawn out unnecessary ways. I do feel remorse and i do want to be a better person but i fear and now i know, i've strayed too far and my judgement is soon upon me.
