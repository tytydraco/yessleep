The day I bought the DreamSync was the first time Val so much as touched me in weeks; throwing her arms around my neck when she saw the sleek packing. “I can’t believe you got it!” 

There wasn’t much choice. Tale as old as time; great relationship, ruined when our new jobs put us on opposite shifts. 

“We only really spend time together when we’re sleeping,” she’d quipped one night, staring at the ceiling in the dark. Of course, her phone was on the nightstand at the time. You know what that means: a torrent of ads for a company I’d never heard of.

DreamSync offered a simple premise: you put on one of the sleek, matching collars. You fall asleep. You share a dream where you can interact and spend time together.

I was skeptical, not just that it would work, but that it wouldn’t backfire. I’m not an unfaithful guy, or anything. But everyone has thoughts they’d rather keep private.

Now, those thoughts are the least of my concerns.

We poured over the instructions in our pajamas, put the collars on, and went to bed. To my shock, it worked almost perfectly. 

I opened my eyes on an endless pink beach, hot sand between my toes, crystal blue water crashing on the shore. 

Val was beside me, holding my hand as we walked through the waves. But the closer I looked, the more I realized it wasn’t HER; at least not exactly. She looked closer to the woman she was five years ago when I first saw her, back when she still painted her nails and spent hours getting ready for our dates. 

Back when we both made the effort.

I was different too, toned, like I was during my college athlete days. And was I taller?

“Maybe the dream gives us our ideal selves,” Val theorized when I brought this up. “Polishing the edges.”

But the changes weren’t all cosmetic. 

In another dream, I whisked her off to a Thai place she’s been wanting to try. I’d always hated the stuff.

That’s probably why she was so surprised when I brought home takeout from the same real world restaurant. A few days later.  “I’ve just been craving it,” I told her. I wasn’t lying either. Other foods I previously enjoyed started to feel bland.

A few nights later, we stayed up late watching a movie, and she curled up beside me on the sofa. The apartment felt eerie quiet; Val always talked through movies, shows, whatever. 

Or, at least she had, until our dream about a going to see a Broadway show. She sat through the whole thing, focused on the performance.

Odd.

When I started to lose interest in a hobby she always told me was a waste of time, I panicked.

DreamSync didn’t polish the edges, it let us reimagine one another, one dream at a time. I tried to track down the company, thinking there may be some kind of factory reset to make me who I was. But my search came up dry. No phone number, website, or physical address. Nothing.

I insisted we stop using the collars, afraid I’d lose what was left of my personality.

Val doesn’t want to, though. Apparently, she caught on quicker than I did. “You’re just a few nights away from being [the man I’ve always dreamed of.”](https://www.coleschapters.com)
