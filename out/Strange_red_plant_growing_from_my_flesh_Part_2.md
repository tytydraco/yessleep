My mother died last night. I should've called, I should've visited her more often, made sure she was okay. She's had early onset dementia for a while and spent the last few years of her life just fading away in that nursing home.

The gut wrenching grief that struck me overcame the stinging pain of the plant in my arm. I preferred it when it was just physical pain. The lifetime of memories she had made, all just slowly faded away. 

It was stupid of me to think she would remember how to remove this plant, towards the end of her life she couldn't even remember my name. I already possessed most of her belongings, though I couldn't stand to look through all of them.

I wish I had sooner. My brother was born much later than I, and didn't know mom as much. I was gonna leave it up to him to look through Mom's stuff since he offered, but with her passing it felt wrong not to at least look.

I found the boxes stashed in my basement, gritting my teeth when the plant scraped the wall as I carried the box upstairs. Among the belongings, photographs and pictures, memorabilia and mementos, was a singular notebook.

It was a rather small notebook, I took it for a random sketchbook or journal that my mom had stashed away. Until I opened it up. Scores of inky black streaks tore across each page, incoherent scribbles and scratches filled the notebook.

Some pages formed words, none of them sensical or comforting. “ITCHING! PAIN! HURTS! TENDRILS! THE ROOTS! THERE IS NO GOD!” My face contorted in concern as I flipped through, it looked like the inscriptions of a madwoman. 

“NO ESCAPE! DEEP IN YOUR SKIN! ONE WITH YOUR FLESH!” The notebook went on and on and on like this. Until one of the last pages, where a word I didn't recognize was written.

“FLORATURGY”. It was written across both pages, bolded and circled. “Floraturgy…?” I said out loud. The instant the word left my mouth, I felt an ache in my arm.

The red plant began twitching and vibrating, and I winced in pain. It writhed and danced like a tree in the wind, pulling and dragging my arm around uncontrollably. From the ends of its dozens of branches, it split open, blossoming like a bouquet of grotesque flowers.

Then, it shrieked. My face contorted in shock as the blooming flora emitted a high pitched wail. It went on for minutes, I panicked and tried suffocating the plant under a pillow just to shut it up.

The twisted burning pain of the red vestiges pulling on my muscles and tendons made me grind my teeth. Finally, it stopped shrieking. I removed the pillow gently to discover that the plant had closed back up.

Had it been a coincidence that it began fussing as soon as I uttered that word? ‘Floraturgy’? I wouldn't take that risk. I returned to the notebook, deciding I wouldn't say whatever strange words were written out loud.

There wasn't much of use in the remaining pages, only more incoherent and indecipherable ramblings like “IT HEARS”, “RUN AWAY”, “ITCHING BURNING”, “ALL WHO ARE CONNECTED HEAR”, “IT HEARS”.

The last few pages had odd and frightening drawings, my heart twitched when I saw them. The drawings were diagrams of people, with branches sprouting out from all over their body, engulfing them completely.

Was it really my mother writing all of this? In any case, my mother's notebook was a dead end. It confirmed that my mother at least knew about the red plants, but I was no closer to removing it than I was before.

My Doctor's appointment is tomorrow, hopefully they have a solution for this. Until then I hope that the plant doesn't start making noises again.
