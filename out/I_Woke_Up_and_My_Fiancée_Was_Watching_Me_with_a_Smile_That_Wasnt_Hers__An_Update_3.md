My wedding is in two days.  
And the symptoms *he* causes in me are becoming more and more present.

Arthur called me today.  
He wanted to know how I was doing. But there was something strange in his voice — a restrained tension, like he was trying not to let the fear escape through his throat.  
“Hey, David… how are you? Have you been going to college?”  
I tried to sound natural.  
“Considering everything, I’m doing okay. But no, I haven’t been going.”  
To be honest, maybe I shouldn’t even be a psychologist.  
Dianna is different… do you remember how we used to be in high school?

Arthur hesitated. Took a deep breath.  
“David… I found out what that symbol means.”  
I already suspected.  
But the fear in his voice… brought me a strange calm. Almost comforting.  
“It symbolizes Hades,” he said. “You agreed to be the sacrifice of the god Hades.”  
The god of the underworld… death itself.

He was terrified.  
But for some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to care.  
“I understand…” I said, with a naturalness that didn’t even feel like mine.  
“But I don’t think there’s anything left to do. The wedding is in two days.”  
“It’d be nice if you came. To see a familiar face.”  
“Anyway… I need to take care of some things. We’ll talk later, okay?”  
“David…? What did you do with David?!”  
“You don’t talk like that!”

I hung up.  
Stood there for a while, staring into nothing.  
The phone still in my hand, the call ended.

The truth is… his voice didn’t even sound real anymore.  
It sounded like an old recording, with static that separated me from the present.  
It sounded distant, like an echo coming from a place I no longer belonged to.

I got up without thinking.  
Threw on any random coat and left.  
I didn’t know where I was going — I just wanted to get away from the house. The bed. The mirror.  
From myself.

I walked through the city streets as if I was being pulled by something.  
The wet sidewalks, the cold wind, the muffled sounds… everything felt distant.  
That’s when I saw the first one.

A man standing in front of the municipal hospital.  
Thin, hunched over, covered by a dark, long cloak that swayed in the wind.  
Beside him, an old man in a wheelchair — breathing with difficulty, eyes closed.  
The man in black didn’t speak.  
Didn’t move.  
He just… stood there.

But then he turned.  
Saw me.  
And did something I’ll never forget:  
He bowed his head.  
Slowly.  
As if paying me respect.

And in that moment...  
something responded inside me.

It wasn’t me.  
It came from deeper than any thought, any impulse.  
It was like my flesh itself recognized it.  
As if my body knew that gesture was meant for him — for what’s inside me.

My head tilted slightly.  
My hands clasped together on their own.  
And an ancient warmth, almost ritualistic, filled my chest.  
Dense. Dark. Suffocating.  
Like the smoke of incense burning for centuries in a forgotten temple.

But I… I didn’t want that.  
That wasn’t me.

I tried to gasp for air.  
Tried to move. Undo that gesture, that moment.  
But for a few seconds — far too long — my body didn’t respond.  
It was like I had become a shadow inside myself.

And when I finally managed to pull away, the panic hit me like an avalanche.

I ran back home.  
Shut the door. Locked it.  
Pressed my forehead to the cold wood, trying to convince myself I was still real.  
Still… me.

I picked up my phone with trembling hands and opened the chat with Arthur.

 

**Arthur, please answer me.**  
**I saw something today.**  
**They saw me. They bowed.**  
**But the worst part was…**  
**I bowed back. Without meaning to.**  
**I bowed back and it felt like I disappeared inside.**  
**Dude, I’m losing control.**  
**I don’t remember hanging up that call.**  
**I don’t even remember saying all that to you.**

Silence.  
My fingers trembled above the keyboard. I typed again.

 

**Arthur…**  
**What do you remember from our conversation?**  
**Was that really me?**

 

The screen stayed blank.  
No typing icon. No sign of life.

That’s when it came back.  
The voice.  
From within.  
Just like the first time… only stronger now.  
Clearer.  
Closer to my skin than any thought.

*“Give up, boy.”*  
*“Arthur won’t answer you now.”*  
*“If you want, I can pay him a visit.”*  
*“See with my own eyes if he’s still... whole.”*

It wasn’t a whisper, nor a scream.  
It was a *presence*.  
Something that imposed itself — like a truth that won’t be denied.  
The voice seemed to echo from somewhere where time doesn’t pass.  
Too ancient to fit in the world around me.  
And cold… so cold it made my spine shrink, as if my body already knew there was no choice.

That feeling of isolation came back — like a frozen hand on the back of my neck.  
Stronger than before.  
As if the world was slowly pushing me out of it.

And I began, finally, to understand what it means to be a sacrifice.
