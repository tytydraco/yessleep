Long forgotten memories often resurface violently when you least expect it. Years of therapy had suppressed even the memory of having suppressed it. All it took for it punch through my subconscious was the simple act of turning the light off in my daughters' shared bedroom. In the sudden darkness everything came flooding back and I was a child again, no older than my oldest, back in the bedroom I shared with my younger brother. 

I saw it standing over my little brother's bed. Joe was asleep. The only light in the room was the red flame from the candle in its hand. It was tall, lanky, and stood bent over my brother. Long moon-silver hair lit by reddish candle light flowed from its head and draped over its crooked shoulders. 

It carried a sack. 

Something stirred inside it and I gasped. I'm sure I did, because just then it turned around. Sometimes I remember the — the — thing turning to me, like it knew I was awake. I quickly shut my eyes. I was going to die. It was going to throw me in its sack and take me away. I'd never see my parents or Joe ever again. I was sure of it. It would take me and do every horrible thing I could think of. 

Small comfort that I couldn't think of much at five.

I kept my eyes closed. I felt it loom over me, felt its breath on me. It stood by my bed waiting for me to open my eyes — to take a peek. I held my breath. I held my scream. I prayed for mom or dad to open the door. 

Just throw open the door, let the light in, and this thing would disappear. I was sure of it. 

All I had to do was turn the light on. The switch was right next to my bed. I just had to do reach out and hit the switch...

Why did I hesitate? Why was I so slow?

I heard Joe stir just as I felt the air relax around me. I dared to sneak a peak. My brother was sitting on his bed, rubbing his eyes. The tall evil thing dragged its feet towards his bed. It moved slowly like a thing from a dream.

Now! Do it now! 

When I revisit this scene in my nightmares, that's the command that rings in my head as I wake up, sweating.

I hesitated. 

Joe opened his eyes. Just a crack. That shouldn't count. It's not fair. I don't think he even knew what he saw. 

As I saw the thing bring the candle closer to its mouth, every fiber in my being told me to do it — reach for the switch. But the switch was in the darkness, outside the safe zone of my bed and protective blanket. 

Its gnarly, wrinkled lips went round, and its leathery cheeks puffed up. Whatever — whoever — was inside the sack stirred again. 

I plunged my hands into the darkness, putting my whole body into the thrust. I threw myself off the  bed. 

The switch clicked a moment after I heard the candle go out. Bright fluorescent light flooded the room, stinging my eyes. 

When they adjusted to the light, I was alone in our room.

Nowadays I have cameras in my daughters' room. I get my sleep when I can but never at night. I wait with the lights on.
