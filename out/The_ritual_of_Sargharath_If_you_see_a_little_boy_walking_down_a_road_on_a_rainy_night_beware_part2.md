What kind of a ritual? i asked. The boy stared out of the window for a while before he began to speak, "You and i need to break the barrier between your world and my world, so i can cross it and enter my own world". 


Barrier? what kind of a barrier? and what world do you belong to? i asked. 


" The world of zagamarth, it's looks almost similar to your world, that we are in currently, but simultaneously it's exactly the opposite. The residents look like humans, unless you look closely, pay alot more attention. We seek exactly the opposite of what you people seek. We thrive in sadness and despair. For us darkness and death is what's light and life for you people".


i looked at him confused, i couldnt wrap my head around a single thing he said. "what do we need to do? what's the ritual like?", i asked. "i dont know what you are saying, i just wanted to help a little kid on the side of a secluded road away from civilisation, i didnt sign up for all this shit!!! i need to go back home, i cant do any of this!", i blurted out loud, frustrated.


" You can scream, cry ,do whatever you want to but nothing can help you except doing what i'm telling you to. You sealed your fate the moment you stopped for me and started talking to me, the moment i looked directly at you", he said in an impossibly calm tone.


i dont knowww! i-ii dont know, why? why just me? you said you have been walking for 5 or so years whatever! so why now? why me? 


"You have been chosen, when we accidently cross the barrier and enter your world, we become invisible, you people cannot see us. There are and have been thousands of us walking among you trying to cross the barrier. It takes years if not decades. While we are invisible to you people, there are still some people out there like you, who can see us, who can hear us and feel us. You are one of them, and you are now going to be my saviour", he said looking directly into my eyes.



Your saviour?? i cannot even save my ownself , how would i save you? something out of this world?? i said annoyed at my own self now.


" You'll see, makeup your mind first. Would you like to drive nonstop for 2 years? or perform the ritual and end it right now?" , he asked.


i started thinking about it, going to drive for 2 years and then getting back to my life? what life? nothing would be same till then. My appartment won't be mine anymore, my job gone, my bf will move on and my friends and family will assume me dead!! There will be nothing left to go back to! 


i looked at the boy and said, "i will go for the ritual. i'll do it. Let's just get it over with and let me just go back home".


He nodded looking satisfied. "Thankyou, it'll save me sometime. i have been waiting for you since years now, to be able to perform the ritual and get back to my realm", he sighed.


"We need to stop the car now and get out to perform the ritual before sunrise", he said in an excited tone, his eyes shining. 


i parked along the side of the road and stopped the car. The boy got out in a heartbeat ,without even waiting for me. I got out and followed him, the rain pouring down on us. " Where are we going?", i asked.


"Keep walking, until we reach somewhere far away from the road deep into the woods, and keep in mind to not look back or around much while we are walking, there might be someone else present from my world stuck here as well, and now that we both know you can see us, if you happen to look at him, you'll be responsible for getting him out of here as well".




Oh my god! what in the fucking hell is this situation right now?? another one of you people? i just cantttt!! . I kept following him looking down while doing so in order to make sure that i dont look at anyone else from his world.


Within minutes we were deep into the woods, far away from the roads. Everything looked and felt so eerie, i couldnt hear anything apart from the rain pouring down, there was no other soul in sight. After walking for a while, the boy stopped and turned around to face me. "You need to be brave in order to do this, you need to trust me and not question me. It won't take long. But in case we fail to complete the ritual before sunrise, we'll have no other choice but to drive for 2 more years , atleast. The ritual only works if performed on the same night of the meeting, the same night we meet our saviours", he added.


Taking a deep breathe, he asked, "Are you ready to perform the ritual of Sargharath?". i had no other choice but to go along with it and perform this damn ritual of Sargha-th rathh, whatever!. 


i looked at him, taking a deep breathe, " i'm ready, let's do it!".

"We have got 4 hours till sunrise, We need to keep that in mind. The very first thing we need to make the ritual succesfull is blood, it can be any blood, any animal's blood, human blood, whatever", he said looking around. 


" How are we going to get blood now? i dont see a single animal here, not that i'm going to kill a poor animal for a ritual, we have no choice but to offer my own blood", i said.


The boy looked at me and rolled his eyes, "Its not a drop of blood that we need, but alot of it. You cant offer that much blood alone. So, WE are going to offer our blood, you and me together", he said.


It felt weird to let a kid do all that, i mean he wasnt a kid, he wasnt even human but he was in a child's body looking almost human, it felt strange. " Okay so do you have something to take our blood out or cut ourselves or something like that?", i asked.


The boy reached into his pocket and took out the same sac that he used before to take those chocolate chunk like things out of. He reached into it and pulled out a blade like thing but it was weird, it was too thick to look like a blade. He made me sit down on the ground and reached into sac, pulling out a little box, he opened the box and started making a small triangle around us with something powdery present in the box.


"No matter what happens dont look around much, dont go out of this triangle until sunrise, i repeat no matter what! you have to stay in this triangle until sunrise", he said. After making the triangle he sat in front of me, crossed his legs and spoke, " if you leave the ritual in between, without completing it properly, you'll be stuck in between the two realms and you'll lose your mind and eventually either kill yourself or die, nobody will be able to save you", he added looking into my eyes.


I dont know how but i felt brave enough to do it, it felt like i could do it and get over with all this, go back home and fall into a deep slumber with my boyfriend cuddling me. i wanted to end it as soon as possible. "Alright, i wont leave the triangle or end the ritual before completing it", i said.


The boy picked the blade like thing and ran it across his abnormally small palm, black viscous liquid pouring out of his palm. He let his blood drip down on the ground between the two of us. After the wound stopped bleeding, he made another deep cut, this time on his arm, more blood pouring out now. It felt like forever, watching a kid bleeding like that in front of you, felt horrible, but he wasnt a kid, i told myself.


After the ground was completely soaked by his blood, he lifted his gaze and looked at me, "Ready?" 


I hesitated for a moment but then quickly stretched my hand out, "Do it".


He made a deep cut on my palm, for a moment i didnt feel any pain but then the pain hit me like a truck! it felt like too much, i wanted to take my hand back , scream and run out of there but i couldnt do that, i had to be brave. 


Blood pouring down on the same spot soaked by his blood, we both sat in silence watching it. After what felt like forever, he looked at me and went for my arm, cutting it even deeper, More deep red blood coming out of my arm, falling on the ground.


i felt lightheaded, the dizziness was too much to bear, i wanted to sleep, close my eyes and not think about anything, but the boy spoke, "Dont close your eyes, keep looking on the ground". 


After we were done with the blood offering part, the boy took some jelly like thing out of his old reliable sac, wrapped in some sort of wrapper. He used it on his wounds and then asked for my hand, rubbing it on my throbbing and aching wounds. As soon as the substance hit my wounds, it felt much better, the burning wounds felt way too cool now, the pain almost gone, i looked at him and he smiled.


 "Now that the basic preparation for the ritual is done, we shall go ahead", the boy said in a suprisingly serious tone.
