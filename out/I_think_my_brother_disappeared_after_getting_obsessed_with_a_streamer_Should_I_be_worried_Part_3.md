Hey guys, finally got the laptop to work. You can see part 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/FH275tzb6p)

It took hours for the ancient laptop to charge, and even longer for it to finally boot up. I couldn’t help but curse my brother under my breath. Is he really so strapped for cash that he couldn’t get a newer one? The machine wheezed and groaned with every task, as if I’d interrupted its retirement.

Eventually, I managed to connect to Wi-Fi and access his social media. Scanning through his messages broke my heart. At most, he had three on any given platform—from me, Mom, and a few scattered exchanges from before Dad passed. My chest tightened as the realization hit: Are we all he has?

The thought crushed me. I leaned back, burying my face in my hands, as tears welled in my eyes. He’d always had my back when I needed him, but now I questioned if I’d ever truly been there for him. If I’d known how lonely he was, I would have done more. I wouldn’t have let it get this far.

The laptop whirred again, dragging me back to the present. I wiped my face and focused. Is this why he was so drawn to Caitlin? Was she filling some void for him? If I could find her stream, maybe I’d understand him better. Maybe I could help him when he comes back.

I checked his bookmarks first, but there was nothing. Of course, he already knew where to find her. Thankfully, he’d forgotten to clear his history. A single link caught my eye, and my heart quickened—a pastel-colored page buzzing with animated GIFs and an active chat window. At its center, a timer counted down to her next stream.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the screen. What am I even hoping to find? I told myself she was probably just a normal streamer, maybe someone who could help me understand my brother. Normal is good. Normal is safe. But a nagging voice in the back of my mind wasn’t so sure.

The timer hit zero.

She appeared, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe.

Caitlin spoke, but I didn’t hear a word. Her amber-green eyes flitted between the chat and the camera, narrowing slightly when she smiled. Her fair skin seemed to glow under the studio lights, and every movement felt deliberate, like a dance. The way her hands moved as she spoke made me want to reach out and hold them. She was stunning, and I hated myself for noticing.

She started playing an obscure vampire game, keeping herself in view at all times. I finally snapped out of the trance and tried to focus. Hours slipped by as I watched, my thoughts racing. Caitlin’s words pulled me down rabbit holes, reshaping old ideas and planting new ones. It felt like she knew exactly what would keep me engaged, and I hated how easily she managed it.

When the stream began to wind down, I felt an unexpected wave of relief. Watching her wasn’t hard, but it was exhausting in a way I couldn’t explain. My body felt heavy, my mind foggy. Still, I understood my brother better. He hadn’t sought her out in desperation—she was captivating. She was worth watching.

Then she posed a riddle.

Her voice softened, her cadence melodic, and I swear I felt it wrap around me like a warm blanket. 

>“I am the echo of what once was seen,
>A reflection that hides where I’ve been.
>I touch your mind, yet leave no trace,
>I am the answer you seek, but not the face.
>What am I?”

For the first time since her stream began, my mind went quiet. A single voice whispered from within, soft and insistent, like a memory I couldn’t quite place.

I knew the answer.

I leaned forward, fingers hovering over the keyboard. My heart raced as I typed, but I hesitated. What was I doing? Why did I feel this overwhelming urge to respond? I pulled back, shaking my head. This isn’t me. I don’t indulge in riddles. I’m here to help my brother, not get sucked into this.

Caitlin scanned the chat, her eyes narrowing in a way that felt almost... predatory. Her smile widened, and for a moment, she looked feline, like she was playing with her food. Her gaze flickered to the camera, and I froze. I knew she couldn’t see me, but it felt like she could.

The answer burned in my mind. My fingers moved on their own, typing it out and pressing enter before I could stop myself.

Caitlin’s eyes darted back to the chat. Her face lit up with joy as she read the answer aloud. Her excitement felt genuine, but there was something about it that made my stomach churn. Then, she asked for my real name.

I hesitated. She was enchanting, sure, but giving my real name to a stranger online? Absolutely not. I typed back, insisting my username would suffice. She laughed, her eyes flickering back to the camera. For a moment, I swore she was staring straight at me.

“Well, aren’t you a clever one?” she said. Her voice lingered in the air like smoke, cloying and impossible to ignore.

I shut the laptop and sat back, staring at the wall. The hum of the machine faded, leaving me alone with my thoughts. For hours, I’d forgotten why I was even watching. I hadn’t thought of my brother once.

Her final words echoed in my mind, sinking deep and twisting like a blade. “Well, aren’t you a clever one?”

I hated how it made me feel.
