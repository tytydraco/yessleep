It’s massive, enough to cover the entire sky, its sclera a deep grey, the thick veins at the edges a stark crimson against the background. The pupil is a thin line, a pure black, and it sits still most of the time.



Except when I move.



It stares at me, follows my every movement, but nothing happens. You might ask, how has the world reacted to this? When did it appear? How am I sure it’s following me?



Well, I don’t really know how to answer those questions, because when I walk the streets of what should be my home, there is nothing but ruin. The person that should be my wife, the figures that should be my children, are all pale, sickly things. Their limbs are long, unwieldy, their legs slender and white, but lacking toes. Feet are just lumps of flat flesh attached at the end of legs. It’s nearly impossible to tell one of these things from another. 



But the worst part about them are the faces. Or, really, the lack of them.



I’m not just saying they have something like smooth, featureless faces. I’m saying they, quite literally, lack faces, a dark hole in place of them. 



But I’m getting ahead of myself.



It started a long time ago, enough that I don’t really remember when. I was walking to my office building, I think, and caught a glimpse of the sky. It was the typical blue, nothing really out of the ordinary. But I had this strange sense of being watched. And something felt *off* about the sky. Nothing I could see, but this strange disorienting sense of its size, of how large it is. I remember being taught how our planet is circulating the sun, our entire solar system just hurtling through space. Forever. I remember suddenly feeling small. 



What a nightmare, I thought to myself. I brushed it off, and hurried away, already late to the day. When I got to the office, aside from a scowl from the boss, everything was as it should be.



I sat in my chair, logging away accounts or something, I don’t really remember. It was at our break time when it first started. 



Somebody knocked on the side of my cubicle.



“Hard at work, I see,” Samuel (maybe Sebastian?) said. It was my boss.



“Yes sir,” I said, turning in my chair. “Just trying to make up for–”



I froze. One of his eyes was slightly larger than the other, enough to be pretty noticeable. It’d looked just fine on Friday. Had something happened across the weekend maybe? 



He cocked a brow. I pushed the thoughts out, realizing I was staring.



“Just trying to make up for lost time,” I said.



“Alright, well, I was just checkin’ in. Keep at it.”



When he’d walked a good distance away, I turned and leaned into a coworker’s cubicle.



“Hey, is it me, or do Samuel’s eyes look kinda weird?”



“Dude, I gotta get through so much shit, we can talk about this later.”



“Sure, but–”



He turned in his chair and faced me. “What?”



I shut up pretty quickly. One of his eyes was larger too, but noticeably larger than the boss’s. I felt queasy, muttered an apology and turned back to my work, thinking I was hallucinating. I doubt knowing even back then would have changed anything.



The rest of the day, I kept working but that strange sensation of being watched kept popping up, stronger and stronger, eventually, like a nail being driven through the back of my skull. The noise around me faded, until I was left in an unsettling quiet. Everytime I turned around, I heard the screech of chairs, and the click-clack of typing would pick up again, like everyone had always been working.



But I could almost swear, in those moments of silence, they weren’t.



I left the office building as quickly as I was allowed to. The crowds weren’t any better– I had to constantly keep glancing around to make sure I wasn’t being followed or something. The crowds would grow silent in the same way as my office until I would check to make sure they were still there. 



Stepping into home, I breathed a sigh of relief, glad to be away from the strangeness of the outside. Natalia, my wife, wouldn’t be home for another couple of hours. So, I went in to check on the kids, kid(?), not quite sure. Sarah might have been her name. Or Angela. Maybe Susan. Maybe I had three kids and that’s why those are the only three names I can scrounge up when I think of them. 



I remember walking into her, or their, room and finding their faces even more distorted, their eyes far too wide for their (or her) little head(s), the smile(s) stretching from ear to ear, like god forgot how to draw people.



I only remember locking the door and hearing their cries sound from inside. Their distorted, disgusting noises, from high pitched screaming to deep laughter, and I sat in the living room, away from them, clutching my head, begging for it all to stop.



When my wife, Marissa, came back home, I ran to the door with tears in my eyes. 



“Selina, something’s wrong with the kids, I’ve been waiting for you the whole day, I…”



I stopped. Her arms were so long, like someone had tied her between two cars and drove in opposite directions. They dragged on the floor, and her head was patches of hair. She had thirteen eyes, maybe twenty four, all over her face.



I ran out of the house screaming. 



The thought did occur to me once or twice that I might be the insane one. But it didn’t linger. Everything was too real. Once, I approached a person, with probably fifty eyes all over his body, and I tried to talk to him. It seemed to go well, though I couldn’t decipher his words. He held out a hand to me, but when I shook it, I *felt* the eyes all over his skin, his body. I knew then this wasn’t just insanity.



Slowly, across days, weeks and months, the world seemed to unravel before my eyes. Buildings leaned, grunted and groaned, people became malformed things, and soon clouds gathered in the sky. They grew so thick, it was almost as if night had fallen.



I kept some money on me, and my bank account still worked, so I was able to feed myself for a long while. But even the food started to stink and mutate. I ate it anyway. What choice did I have?



It was like that for a while. This eternal night over the city, under the clouds, forcing down rotten food to keep myself alive.



One day, though, the world stopped changing and settled. People no longer mutated, but every single one became those white, pale creatures with long limbs and holes for faces. 



I see them walking around, going about everything like the world isn’t– *isn’t* gone. I see them standing before streets, waiting in crowds like they’re waiting for a car to pass by, but nothing ever does, and eventually, they just cross the roads. 



I see people sitting in cafes, typing on laptops that do not work. I see people in bars gathered in groups, leaning back as if laughing, but none of them ever make a sound. 



I wonder if it was all fake. If it had always been fake. But no, the ruins of buildings, homes and the skeletal remains of infrastructure do exist. That means humanity did exist at some point, right?



Oh, and the silence. That might be the most maddening part of it all. Because nothing makes a sound anymore. I can’t even hear my voice anymore, and I wonder if I am just like the rest of these creatures and yet I still have five fingers. When I catch my reflection, I might be frail, with a dirty beard, and unkempt hair, but I am *human.*



The sky also cleared that day. And behind it was the eye.



I don’t know what it belongs to, and I’m not sure I want to find out. It stares at me endlessly, as if waiting. My memory warps, and I forget things, and misremember most, but I still remember the name of my wife. Mariah. Yes, how could I ever forget a name as beautiful as that?



I walked. Walked until hours bled into days, and those turned into weeks, months and maybe even years.



But that was when I came across what I can only describe as God. 



I can’t tell you what he looks like because I don’t know what he looks like. The corpse is enormous, so huge, I’d mistaken it for mountain ranges at first. The longer I look at it, the more details are revealed, but if I look too long, my nose bleeds and my vision reddens. I remember eyes, mouths, limbs, tendrils, feathers, but also that he was not made of flesh. I remember beauty, pain, awe and horror, and I remember my heart pounding, and my laughter, but when I look away I forget. I forget everything, but details.



The only thing I do remember is the equally enormous rod of some material skewering Him to the ground. 



Was this thing our God? Had our God been dethroned, murdered and flung from the heavens down to our mortal plane? Was the eye behind it? 



I don’t know.



When the hunger became too much, and nothing else would keep down, in blasphemous desperation, I reached for God’s flesh, and gorged on it, and his blood, his perfect blood, golden like the sun, black like the night, violet like the twilight of a day ending, and quenched my thirst.



I don’t know how long it has been. At some point, the pale figures started ignoring me like I don’t exist. I don’t know why this is happening to me, but I’ve wept and had more than enough mental break downs for it. Hunger and thirst have both left and all I am now is a wandering husk. 



At some point, I realized electricity still worked. A thought occurred to me. I walked all the way back home, found my phone and checked the internet.



People were still online. Talking. Life was still going on. New shows were in development, a country had high tensions with another and sent an ambassador, and… it was all so normal.



So, this is my final attempt to talk to somebody. Anybody. Just get in touch with people. 



Please don’t ignore this.
