I’ve always avoided buying video games. I don’t really know why, but last week, out of boredom, I downloaded one from an obscure corner of the internet. It was a simple shooter. One map only. A mountainous, snow-covered area with tunnels carved through the rock and narrow roads between the peaks. There was just one playable mode. My team consisted of nine friendly bots. The enemy team always had five. What stood out immediately was that the enemy bots were better. They aimed better, set ambushes more efficiently, and reacted faster than the bots on my side. I didn’t question it. It felt intentional.

The first round went normally. We moved through the tunnels, spreading out, checking corners. At one point, I heard footsteps ahead of me. The radar showed no friendly bots nearby. I pressed Shift and slowed my movement, creeping toward a doorway at the end of the tunnel. The footsteps stopped. I assumed the bot had crouched and was waiting, so I fired through the doorway. I was right. The bot died instantly. The rest of my team won their skirmishes soon after, and the round ended.

In the second round, I returned to the same area. I heard the same footsteps again. This time, just as I raised my weapon, shots came from behind the doorway. My character died immediately. That didn’t make sense. I had been moving slowly. I hadn’t made noise. Still, I brushed it off as a bug. In the third round, I followed the bot that had killed me. Its name was Bill. At first, Bill behaved like any other FPS bot. He moved with his team, checked corners, and searched areas I hadn’t even visited yet. But he was different in one small way. He always stayed slightly behind the others, frequently stopping to look back, as if making sure no one was following.

A firefight broke out in the tunnels. While the other bots rushed forward, Bill retreated. There was no objective in this mode. No bomb, no hostages, no capture point. Just two teams trying to eliminate each other. Still, Bill fell back toward his spawn area. By the time my team realized what was happening, most of them were dead. Only Bill and two of my teammates remained. Bill threw a flash grenade and disappeared down a side path. When I found him again, he was crouched behind a box in the far corner of his spawn point.

He didn’t move.

There was no round timer. I tried to speed things up, even typed a command out of habit, but nothing worked. Bill stayed crouched, staring at the edge of the box. His crosshair didn’t move at all. Eventually, my remaining teammates reached the enemy spawn. That’s when Bill’s crosshair trembled slightly. It wasn’t recoil or idle animation. It looked deliberate. Slowly, he stepped out from behind the box and shot one of my teammates instantly. Before the second bot could react, Bill turned and eliminated him too.

The next round began like nothing had happened. This time, I tried something different. I went to my own team’s spawn area. It was identical to the enemy’s. I crouched behind the same kind of box and waited. I didn’t move. Minutes passed. Gunfire echoed faintly through the tunnels. Eventually, only one bot on my team and two on the enemy team remained. I leaned forward slightly and peeked around the box.

 There was a bot there.

It was looking directly at the spot where I was crouched. I fired first. It died instantly. It's name appeared on the screen. Bill. The last enemy bot was eliminated shortly after. Without any transition or scoreboard, the game simply displayed "YOU WON" and closed itself. I turned off my computer. I haven’t tried opening the game again. Something about the way Bill waited felt wrong. Like he wasn’t playing to win. Like he was waiting for me to move.
