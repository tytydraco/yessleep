This happened earlier in 2024, around January, so for some background information I had been struggling with my mental health for awhile, and I got sent to a inpatient unit, commonly known as a psych ward. 

This was nearly a year ago so the dates may be off a bit. So on the night of January 4 I attempted su*c*de. And I got sent to an Impatient facility in early morning of January 5, I got set in the adolescent unit along with others, I am in my late teens. The rooms they had in my unit where all double bedded, so you would have a roommate u less your doctor requested otherwise.

Now into the story, 

My discharge date was coming up in a few days, it was a normal day, I’m not sure what week day it was but now it was around early January teens like the 11 or 12, It was a chill day, the unit I was in went down to the gym, most of the other kids where in the corner, talking about whatever they do, girls talk about whatever shit. 

Me and my friend where just near the door, sitting next to one of the teks, teks are like the staff, we where like experimenting with music, and the speaker, with staff supervision of course. Keep in mind that I am religious, I won’t specify for reason, but yeah. 

We were just sitting in the corner of the gym, with the speaker, chatting when another kid that was another friend of mine walked over to us,

“Hey guys, did you guys see a tall black woman in that corner.” The friend that came over and walked over to us, and pointed to the corner on the opposite corner of the gym.

“I’m sorry what?” I said

“You haven’t seen her- or it?” The friend I was sitting with said

“N-no!? What? There are spirits in here!?” I was freaking out at this point, my friend then walked away

And I tried to forget about it, the topic really didn’t come up for the rest of the day.

Until the end of the day.

It was around 8 pm, rooms where open and everyone was in and out of their rooms, my friend came out of their room to me and my friend 

“Guys.. I saw her.”

I looked her, startled

Everyone started to talk and whisper about it, and I really don’t remember anything after that.

Fast foward to the morning,

I went out to the day room when I was done getting ready for the day, some people where out in the day room. And they were talking, about- it.

“Whats going on guys?” I asked them

“Oh we we just saw her.”

Everyone said different things like:

“She was laying on the ground, and then she got up, and went into the bathroom, and shut the curtian. She also turned off my light in the bathroom.

“She was standing in the corner next to the closet book case thing, then she walked into the bathroom and shut the curtian.”

Keep in mind that we didn’t have doors to the bathroom, just shower curtains, as a precaution that you can’t hurt yourself. It was wierd because many people saw her, people with roommate and people without roommates. And yes people saw her, many people. 

Someone that came to that unit a year ago, was admitted and they confess that they saw her when they were there a year ago. This freak the fuck out of me. This continued to different people, she would be standing or doing something, sometimes just staring not moving. Sometimes people would even report seeing her leaning over the bed, looking at the patient. 

I didn’t see anything, It was wierd because people that where religious didn’t see anything. That included my roommate, that got moved to another room. Somewhere between all this, it got brought up to the attention of staff. 

She was about 8 feet talll, also keep in mind there was night and day staff, each having 8 hour shifts, changing at 6 am and 6 pm. The nurse when it was brought up to her attention kept saying like,

“It was just staff, they go into the bathroom, and shut the curtains, and then off the lights.”

“The staff shine the light, and can look over you.”

We knew well enough that it wasn’t staff, the tallest staff was male, and was nearly only 6’5,

When we got a new admit, and they could see her, sense the energy. Someone’s room that they had there only room for specific reasons. They saw her.

The person that had that room freaked the fuck out. 

The shadow woman would be in some rooms, and she would be anywhere, then she would go into the bathroom, and wether the shower curtain was open or not, she would go into the bathroom, and just disappear. 

I was freak the fuck out, I slept with all lights on, barely sleeping. 

That was it, people kept seeing her. I left a few days after. I don’t want to know what that thing was.
