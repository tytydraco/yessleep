I enlisted into the marines a few years ago, I undertook basic training and received my first order of deployment outside the country. I was deployed to South East Asia, I can't specify where due to confidentiality.

 We were stationed in a jungle, and laid there to rest for the night. We had a platoon-size worth of men with us, then we settled there and set up our tents. We took turns for sentry duty, 1:30 AM, it was my turn.

 I picked up my rifle and stood around the area strolling, I could first remark of the endless buzzing of the crickets emitting from the myriad of trees. Until then, I never had a paranormal experience. 

I suddenly had the urge to pee, so I decided to go in one corner of a tree and do my business. After that, I went to patrol the area we were staying at much further, and then I heard something crunching behind the trees, I easily dismissed it as it could be a dog or a wild animal.

 But there was something unusual about it, it sounded different. The crunching noise went on for 6 minutes, and I decided to take a peek, and I remember having a weak gut before checking it, a premonition.

 I looked through the trees with my flashlight and my face suddenly froze, my stomach dropped, my knees felt weak, and the grip on my rifle grew weak. I saw what I could describe as a 6'1 tall, bald, naked humanoid with the reddest eyes I have ever seen, with long fingernails eating the insides of a dead stray dog. 

I remember I couldn't make any sound, and the both of us were frozen. That thing's teeth smeared with the blood of the dead dog. It then took the cadaver of the dog and ran away into the deep jungle never to be seen again. I proceeded to stand there, frozen for 10 minutes, until a fellow soldier told me that my duty was up, it was 3:00 am.

 I headed back to my tent, laid down my rifle close to me and tried to get sleep but I couldnt. That things eyes, it was permanently etched into me. Even until now, in my bedroom thousands of kilometers away from my first tour, I could still reimagine the eyes.

 14 days later, after training with the local troops in the jungle, we headed back to the city. I ate in a restaurant, and luckily for me it was broad daylight. I managed to then converse with the restaurant owner and start a conversation. I then told him about my encounter with that thing I saw. 

The restaurant owner's face then fell cold and frozen. I noticed his eyes, and asked him what was wrong. He told me that thing I saw, was an escaped mental hospital patient, who was missing for almost 7 years. I remember me falling silent.

 I asked the restaurant owner which mental institution, of which he was oblivious to. I then headed back to base and reflected on my own self. After a few years, I was honorably discharged since I served my time already. 

I was finally thankful and returned to my home. While I took a car ride to my home, we passed by a forest, and I could swear to God, I could see those red pairs of eyes.

 I then greeted my mother and my family a happy one, and sat on my bed, ever so rethinking of my experience with that escaped mental patient.

 Since then, I tried my best to avoid areas full of trees, in fear of what lies beyond that. I never told any of my fellow friends of my experience, and I only entrust my experience to that restaurant owner, to God himself, if he knows what that thing is anyway, and to strangers in Reddit.
