I sat there at the dead of night, lying on my bed, not even bothering to pick up the litter of clothes that are spread across the floor. I was wide awake while the deafening silence grew louder and louder, so much so that all I can hear is nothing. The pile of clothes seemed to multiply the more I look at them, the dirty stains of ketchup on one of the clothes makes it look like blood in the moonlight, it makes me feel uneasy but I know better that it’s just a piece of spilled condiment. There was no light in the room, the only light source I have are the moon and my computer, making the atmosphere more-gloomy than it should’ve been. I lie on my bed thinking about the choices I have decided and if they are the best or worst choices to make. The night did not seem to end no matter how long I waited, seconds turned into minutes, minutes turned into hours, all I can do now is distract myself with games, but that seems impossible in my current state.

Out of boredom I got up from my bed and went for a night stroll. The cold breeze instantly hit my skin right as I went outside. The empty streets felt so peaceful, the windy roads, the breeze on the trees, the cold atmosphere, all that and the lack of people is more comforting than I thought, I might've even fell asleep outside on the cold hard pavement, but what was I thinking, I’ll catch a cold and a fever is not worth it for a little bit of comfort. As I walk on the empty street, passing by dark alley ways, stray cats, bus stops, closed shops, and street lamps, I sometimes see something on the corner of my eyes, something dark with bright white eyes, its face oozing with black substances, and its eyes glow bright in the dark but doesn’t emit any form of light. Every time I see that “thing” I thought to myself that it’s just my paralysis demon or just my tired brain making me see things, but deep inside I knew that that “thing” isn’t just in my head. I continued walking seeing that “thing” from time to time, every time I see it makes my body shake, my throat dry, and my heart beating faster and faster.

After a long walk I finally found a café that is open 24 hours, I felt a sigh of relief exit my lungs and out my mouth while I made my way to an empty sit nearest to the window. The weird thing is, I have gotten used to that “thing” that has been following me for an hour, I’m still not sure why I got used to it that fast let alone getting used to it in general, there is just that lingering feeling that is strangely familiar whenever I see it. I ordered a small cup of cappuccino, probably not the best thing to drink in the middle of the night when you are a person that can’t sleep at all but what can I say, I loved coffee ever since I was young. The waitress gave me what I ordered in a small tray with some packets and a tiny spoon. I took a small sip on the coffee, it tasted bitter, sweet and very hot while it hit my tongue, as I swallowed, I felt the heat flow through all around my body, that is the greatest feeling after a long night of walking in the cold streets. As I looked out the window, I saw it, that “thing” looking through my soul. Now that I can see it more clearly without being scared, I just now only noticed it’s smile, that horrifying smile, it is as white as its eyes but it has no teeth only a white curve across its face.

I left the café after finishing my cup of coffee, as I was leaving it started to rain. The little droplets of the rain began to hit my not-so-protected head, I always love hearing the pitter patter of the rain while I walk drenched in water or not. As I walked on the streets, the rain began to drop more rapidly and the wind became stronger, I didn’t bring my jacket when I went outside so I’m just walking in the brewing storm without a little bit of protection. The peaceful sound from the soft rain suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was the rush of water hitting the ground like a person speaking gibberish. Lighting struck suddenly I felt the ground rumble for a bit and a flash of light before it happened, I hear thunder rumble every time lighting struck from cloud to cloud. I ran as fast as I could from the rain stopping under any bus stops I could see to take a short brake.

I finally reached my house, I went to take a bath first to avoid getting sick, after that I picked up all my dirty and wet clothes and put all of them in small hamper, waited till my hair dried up and then went to bed. Like before, I couldn’t sleep but it was different this time, that “thing” it is now inside my house and it is staring right at me with its bright soulless eyes. I couldn’t care less because I wanted to sleep, I stayed awake long enough and I needed to sleep. I faced the other side of the bed where the window is, safe to say that the “thing” is not outside the window but it is right behind me still staring. 

&#x200B;

It has been staring at me for a while now growing closer, as it grew closer, I could even smell it, it stinks like a rotting corpse it also smelled like sewer water, not like that will make me feel better. It made me anxious all over again, the thing grew closer and closer its rancid smell becoming stronger and stronger, smellier and smellier, becoming more unbearable. I didn’t even know if I was awake or not, all I knew is that I wanted this nightmare to end as soon as possible.
