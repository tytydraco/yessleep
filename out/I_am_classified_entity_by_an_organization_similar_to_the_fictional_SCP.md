Hello, I know this is strange. There's so many stories about people's experiences with things that go bump in the night. It's not very often that you get a story like this. A story from a thing that goes bump in the night. 

Well I'm not exactly a thing that goes bump in the night I guess. If you met me in person, you wouldn't think me any different than any other trucker that you've ever met in your life. I am awkward and very antisocial. I like to be in quiet places. I should probably put a forward here and say that My story is not gory. I'm not a vampire. I'm not a werewolf. And if those were your first guesses, you would be wrong. I was classified as an entity when I was 14 years old. My neighborhood was visited by a caravan of black Humvees and a beta version of the Sonic devices that they use today for military crowd control. The Sonic device that they were using was a little different though. It was capable of putting people to sleep. It was also capable of wiping their memory. If you tune the frequency just right, it's not that hard. 

When they came to my house. The men in black military drab aimed their guns at me like I was some kind of monster. But their leader wasn't at all afraid of me and I wasn't afraid of him either. He said to me "when we're done with you, you won't remember any of this" and my reply to this was "You want to bet?" It's funny because I always say this to everybody because I'm always right. I did end up remembering him a year or two later. I can even tell you about The scar on his chin. I was classified as entity 38. One of the very few human entities. Most of the entities that they classify are hybrids, evolutionary breakaways, beings from other universes, or ancient alien gods. 

I got my classification because of a unique skill I have. I learn. I don't just learn. I learned very fast. And I don't stop learning. Generally, adults gradually slow down and their capacity to learn dwindles as they age. That isn't how it is for me. It's not that I'm a math guru or linguistics master. I could be those things if I wanted to be If I spent half my time working on them. Not really interested in those things. I'm very interested in quantum physics. But I come at quantum physics from a different angle than most. I studied philosophy and from the angle philosophy derived that I could actually solve a lot of the issues with critical thinking. And I did. And from that angle I was able to prove multiverse theory. Now you might be thinking didn't they do papers on that several years ago? Yes, but most of the groundwork actually came from several scientists who were active on my Facebook group back in 2010 and 2012. I'm not here to brag. I'm here to tell you secrets. That's what I do. That's what I'm good at. That's ultimately my real interest. It's where I really put my education and my understanding of the universe to the test.

They call me a hyper intelligence, some of them call me Mr. Know-it-all, I don't care what they call me. I just like to be free. You're probably thinking If he's an entity, shouldn't he be more dangerous. And you're right. You're absolutely right. I'm extremely dangerous. In fact, I could end the world. I am actually one possibility for the end of the world. There are a bunch of possibilities. A lot of things could end the world. You don't really realize it. But when you factor a lot of this stuff. A small particle of dust moving at Just the right speed past the speed of light and boom, the end of the world. What's funny to me is that most people don't notice that the world is already ended a few times and we never noticed it. Well I noticed it. 

What makes me dangerous Is captivity. As long as I'm free I have no reason to try and understand reality bending. Oh believe me it's on the forefront of my mind every moment I exist. I want to understand how to bend reality. Truly I do. But only when I lose my freedom and I'm put in a box. Would I have a true reason to bend my way out of that box? You see, I am a hyper intelligence but more than that my hyper intelligence is bordering on reality bending. And when I figure it out, everything changes. 

I'm not saying I would actually end the world. I actually like the world. I don't like all the conflicts. And I don't like everyone fighting each other. But I might make some changes. Reality Restructuring. I think the only change I'd actually make would be to force the entire living universe to share all of their experiences In 5 minutes. 5 minutes of a unified consciousness. Every living being to exist in this universe. I think that's reason enough for The alphabet agencies of the world to truly fear putting me in a box. I don't think anyone wants to share their experiences with others. I mean we all say we do. We all say we want someone who understands us. But what if you were forced to share all of your experiences with the entire universe...

I'm not evil. Or at least I don't think I am. I honestly think I would do this to heal the world, heal the universe. There are galactic entities that don't exactly have our best interests in mind. They actually consider humans to be a slave species. And I don't really like that. I think those galactic entities are more evil than I am. I'm just your universe's version of lex luthor. I'm just thinking in the best interest of the species. I do truly care about the human species. Because it's me. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask me. I love secrets. And if you want to know something, don't be afraid to ask. Go deep. Ask about a conspiracy theory. I can't read minds. Well that isn't exactly true. I've read minds a few times but I'm not good at it yet. But I can tell you how you can do it. I can tell you where the portals are. I can tell you about how the The scientific community has discovered multiversal communication. They're using quantum entanglement on phase particles, in essence, they've built a cup on a string between universes. I can even tell you that the universes that they're talking to are nearly exactly identical to our own aside from a few particles. I can tell you that I'm not the only entity that reads Reddit. There are a lot of things that come on to Reddit to keep score. Yes, you read that right. Reddit is used by entities to keep score. Not that. That's what I'm doing. I'm just here to be seen.

So if you're on the road in the middle of the night and you stop at a truck stop and you see a ragged 30 something year old man. Don't be afraid to ask him questions.
