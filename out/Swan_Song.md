Music has and always will be my life.

From a young age I was fascinated by everything to do with it. The sounds and rhythm enthralled me, in ways I cannot even begin to explain. As soon as I laid my hands on a piano for the first time, I knew where I was headed in life. With relative ease, I quickly moved my way through to the upper grades, and I was able to surpass my teacher's ability at 16 years old.

A prodigy, they called me. They said I had a level of skill unmatched by most, but to me it was just an unmatched love. I loved something so much, I just couldn't get enough of it. Once I finished with the piano, I moved onto the guitar, and then eventually the violin.

Scholarships were extended to me, which I graciously accepted. My life seemed to be on a one-way fast track to the top. There were no obstacles for me to overcome, no hindrances or restraints. I was good at what I did, and everybody knew it. I was going to be something great.

Music has always been my life, so I suppose it is fitting that it will be my death as well.

I was messing around on the piano one evening, switching between songs and tempos, before I decided to settle on *Clair de Lune*. A personal favourite of mine, known for its melancholic yet joyful melody. A true masterpiece. It's one of those songs that I can keep coming back to and yet never get bored of it.

Lost in the music, I almost didn't hear it when someone quietly spoke up.

"It's beautiful, isn't it?"

I jerked my head up to see a lanky man cloaked in a black, billowing robe leaning on the far end of my piano. Out of shock, I began to stand, ready to defend myself if need be. But he shook his head, and held up a hand, while wagging a finger.

"Now, don't stop just for someone like me." He said, in a hollow, rasping voice.

I wouldn't just take orders from a stranger, especially one in my apartment. But the power in his voice, the *authority.* It was so alien and unnatural. This was someone who could kill me with a blink of an eye.  I sat back down. 

He smiled. "Good. Now play and don't stop.

Unsure of what to play, I simply picked up where I left off. The man in the cloak tilted his head ever so slightly, and began walking towards me.

"That's better, music is the life of the soul, you know." I could feel his gaze shift over my body, as if looking for a meal. He let out a small chuckle. "Well, of course you know that, look at you."

His voice was cold, and he seemed to be amused by what was happening. He continued his travels around the piano before coming to a stop behind me, placing a hand on each of my shoulders. Now that he was closer, I realised he had an awful smell coming from him, similar to a rotting carcass. The smell was so strong that I began to feel light-headed. Yet I still played, fearing for my life.

*Who the hell is this guy?* I thought. *What does he want?*

I heard a small, metallic rasp come from behind me, like a sword coming out of its sheath. He continued to talk. "I can sense your fear. That is unnecessary. Do what I say and all will be well with you. I am here as a guide, a helper to take you from where you are, to where you need to be."

As he said that, I felt a cold blade being pressed onto the nape of my neck. I cried out in anguish, flinging my hands to where it hurt. The pain was sharp and intense, and blood left the wound freely. With skillful ease, the man grabbed my hands and placed them back on the piano, making it dirty with my bloody fingerprints.

"Do not test me, child. Continue your playing. Or that would be but a taste of what would come next."

Trembling with fear, I continued my playing while moving onto a different song this time, *The Entertainer.* It felt fitting to me in a dark way, the jolly rhythm contrasting with my rather bleak situation.

Seeming to be happy, the man moved to a corner of the room, and kept a watch on me. Stepping forward menacingly if the song had a hint of stopping. I cycled through different songs, trying to ignore the pain in my neck, and making sure to never stop playing.

After a couple of hours of aimless playing, I mustered up the courage to speak with him.

"W-who are you?"

The cloaked man raised an eyebrow. "And why are you entitled to an answer?"

"I'll stop playing if you don't tell me." I threatened.

The man brandished his small dagger again. And with a small smile he said, "Go ahead. Be my guest."

I got the message, and so I continued playing. I worried I would quickly exhaust my library of memorised songs, so I moved to slower and more romantic pieces. Songs that could last an eternity if I wanted them too. I would beat this man at his own game and *Jeux d'eau* would me my weapon of choice.

The man cocked a head, seeming surprised at my song choice. He walked forwards, and I hesitated, afraid he might wound me again. But he stopped in the middle of the room, and held up a thin hand. Instantly, the room began to change. The lights dimmed to an orange, evening hue. The furniture moved and reshaped. Shadows swirled around before settling in the middle and solidifying into two people.

The shadow people moved around the room in a slow, deliberate waltz, oblivious to all the other going-ons. Suddenly, bright colours swarmed in through the ceiling, replacing the blackness with vibrant hues. The shadows took on clearer forms. It was a middle-aged couple, obviously in love, hands by each others hips, dancing while embraced in a passionate kiss.

And the man was me.

Well, not exactly. He was older, hunched over with age, wearing clothes you would never catch me dead in. And yet he was me. I don't know how, but it just made sense. It's like the information simply appeared in my brain. While still playing, I looked expectantly at the robed man. 

"Is...that me?" I questioned.

"It was you in one circumstance."

"...what?"

"Your path merged with this woman and remade itself. You became another. Your time was longer."

"Did you kill him...me?" 

He shifted his gaze away from me, seeming to be in a quiet contemplation. But his silence gave me the answer I needed.

"Will you kill me?"

He turned to face me again. "I would not be so rude as to remove someone from this plane while they do what they love."

I shivered at what he was implying, and moved to a new song with renewed vigour. As the song changed, the scenery changed also, transforming into the feelings the song conveyed. I would be shown new places, new people I could have been. A doctor, a semi-professional singer, a member of parliament, a father, and even a mother.

And they were all me. Or another path as the man called it.

Occasionally, he would walk up to me with a somber look on his face, and draw out his dagger again. I would tense with fear over what I knew would come next. The pain was searing and continuous, but would not deter me from my task, which was to continue playing. My body was dotted with scars of various lengths, the primal need to stop what I was doing and tend to my scars was strong, but my will to live was stronger.

But, the longer I go on, the longer that aforementioned will diminishes. I fear that I am playing myself to death. Fingers were not meant to be used like this, especially in the condition I am in. My skin was falling off, infection seemed to be creeping in, the piano was a bloody mess, and yet I still played. The constant threat of yet another cut scared me into compliance.

But even then, one still has limits. It feels as I have been playing for weeks now. Entire days of nothing but playing music. There is only so longer I can go on, the movement has made my hands bruised and weathered, the constant playing giving the scars no time to heal. Some of the skin on my fingers have been shaved off to the bone. I feel as if every note I play is another step further into my grave. The pain is immense and ceaseless, the longer I play the worse it gets. Every atom of my body screams at me to stop. Hoping for some respite, a chance to go move on.

But I know this is my end.

I have begun to play with my feet now, which are bruised and callused beyond repair, so that I may dictate my final moments to others. I am playing nothing at all, and yet still playing, which seems to be acceptable within the rules. Although, the man doesn't seem to be too happy with that. The room is now darker, shadows surrounding every corner, disjointed whispering echoing from every angle.

He is showing me of my path's lowest moments. Moments I didn't live through, and yet that I can somehow remember. I can see myself crying in the night after losing a child, lying on a basement floor with no way to call for help after overdosing on drugs, driving home drunk from the bar and never reaching my destination.

He showed me the worst of me. What I could do, given the opportunity.

And that knowledge scares me.

I can tell my time in this world has almost passed. My body has reached a breaking point. I can not go further. So with a heavy heart I write this, fearful of what is too come when I eventually choose to stop. But I am hungry for a break. I can see now that a life like this is no life at all. Death welcomes me with open arms. And I am ready to embrace it.

I am hurt. 

I am broken.

I am afraid.

After I write this, I will begin to play *Clair de Lune* once more, no matter the pain I may go through. I know that I can endure one final song. I then will stop, and see what may come next.

I don't want you to think of this message as a suicide note. No, I died inside days ago. Think of this as my final symphony.

My swan song.
