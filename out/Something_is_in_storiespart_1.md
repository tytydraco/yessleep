This mysterious girl by the name of Lily Fabula keeps appearing in stories that I read but she isn't supposed to be there. I know because I read some of these stories before and when I go to read them again she's gone.  From what I can tell she is aware of and can see everyone that reads the book she is in at the time, referring to them as “The faces.” I don't know what she is or how many people have seen her. 

I've occasionally had her crawl out of the pages or screen that I'm reading out of at the time and try to hurt or possibly even kill me. So as of right now I'm standing alone in my home with all electronics thrown out or unplugged and all books in my house burned with nothing but my phone to write this to warn people about her. I don’t think it will stop her from crawling out of a story somewhere else and coming after me or possibly even possessing this post that I'm writing. I realize the danger I'm putting myself in writing this but the message needs to get out there.

She never comes with a description when she appears in stories. However I can describe what she looks like when one is unfortunate enough to encounter her in person like I have.

 Her skin is the exact color of the pages of a book. The exact same off white color. Her hair is black like the text of a page. She looks malnourished. I can see her ribs through her skin. Her clothes are torn and gray in color. She has no eyes. There is a black inky substance coming out of her eyes, as if she's crying ink. She has no legs, instead there is a black fog in their place. Her fingers are long and thin and bumpy like twigs. I could go on about her unusual appearance. She definitely isn't human, at least not any more. I have no idea what she is  or if she was once a living human, or if she was ever human to begin with.

Perhaps we can piece together what she is or what her past is, and how to stop her. Perhaps one of you knows something I don't. That's why I'm writing this.

Oh god she's here. I hear her. I think she's in another room of my house.

If you see her, please let me know. Even if it's simply a reply in the comments it's something. The message needs to get out and something needs to be done.

 I'll update you later. If I survive this.
