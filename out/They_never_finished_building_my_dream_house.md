After weeks in hospital – weeks of harrowed and worried, pitying stares – I needed out, needed a break.

Pulling a beanie over my balding head, I grabbed my keys when no one was looking, snuck out the front door and just…*drove* *off*.

It was liberating. Even a little exhilarating. The false smell of pine. The coiling, pungent smell of traffic fumes. The autumnal light squinting my eyes.

I drove for a while, aimlessly, until the light was almost failing. Rounding a steep camber, I glided onto a 60mph road and unleashed the throttle, feeling the speed press against my bony chest.

The road on either side was flanked by tall trees which glowed gold and green in the late afternoon light. *Another half a mile and I would see them…* Through a little window in the knotted mass of woodland, situated in a manmade plateau of concrete fringed with dense woodland: two big houses.

During Covid, housebuilding near us kind of *exploded*. We lived in a rural city, a stone’s throw from the coast, brimming with woodland and history. For many locals, the pandemic brought hardship and tragedy, but it also brought *tourists* – an army of people who could now work from home, and home could be *anywhere*. Hamlets and random little “identikit” suburbs popped up all over at break-neck speed. Traffic was suddenly a thing as the city’s population, previously sub-fifty thousand, tripled.

For most locals, this “new wave” was a curse. A scourge on our quaint little city. But for me? Someone young and open-minded? Who was both simultaneously bored and content at the same time? For me, it was great. *It was fun.*

I’d lived here my whole life; never really thought about living anywhere else, not really. Even now, with all my health issues, I was fine with the little life I’d carved out. Honestly, the only thing I wanted more of was more of the same.

So when they started building these two massive houses just outside the city limits, I decided one of them was going to be *mine*. I would work night and day if needs be to afford one.

But then, almost as quick as it had started, the housebuilding boom just…*ended*.

Projects big and small stopped, well before completion.

People were told to get back to the office, myself included.

And then I got sick.

My ability to work grew less and less.

I’d felt like the dream was fading.

But it wasn’t dead.

Indicating, I left the main road on a whim and rounded the bend onto a narrow, forested lane. Vivid green light flooded through the windscreen. A hundred or so yards ahead, I pulled over next to a barrier mesh and turned off the car. Its engine clicked gently, like a parched mouth.

The air outside the car was damp. It smelt heavy with the sweet scent of rot and decay – the forever mulch of the forest.

Grabbing a scarf, I locked the car and approached the flimsy barrier. It was blocking the entrance to the building site. The sign on it read,

DANGER

CONSTRUCTION SITE

NO ENTRY.

Clearly someone had entered, mind. The chain fastening the barrier to an old stone gatepost had been cut, replaced instead by a weak coil of plastic rope that even I could unfasten.

Awkwardly, I fingered the knot loose and shunted the barrier out of the way, just enough for me to squeeze through.

Beyond was a barren, almost forecourt like flat of dust and debris. The houses, their exteriors all but finished, stood side-by-side at the end of a drive that was caked in concrete powder and strewn with shallow piles of grey stone. Walking towards them, I began to feel a clamour of excitement and nerves. *I really shouldn’t be here,* I thought. *What if something bad happens?*

I checked my phone’s battery. It was nearly full, though I had basically no signal.

*Be nice to be off grid for a bit,* I assured myself.

The houses were bigger up close than I’d imagined from the main road, where you could only see the frontages. They extended back quite far into the clearing, so far I couldn’t tell where the gardens started. Nearby, a stream trickled loudly, overfilled by all the recent bad weather.

Cautiously, I began to approach the houses. The air here felt almost preternaturally still, like the clearing itself was holding its breath. Instinctually, I veered towards the one on the left. The one on the right had a strange gravity to it. A lack of vibration. A hollowness.

Up close, I noticed the house on the left’s door was ajar.

Tentatively, I reached for its handle. Its metal was cold. Pushing the door wide, a smell hit me. Acrid. Like old bins. I pushed the door wide.

“Hello?” I called weakly. No answer.

I stepped inside. The place was a series of dark corridors. Wires without light fittings trailed from the ceiling. My heels echoed dully on the unpolished concrete floor.

I wandered around. The place was huge. It was everything I’d hoped it would be.

*But that smell.* I drifted back towards the stairs, from where the smell was emanating. Past the top step, and beyond the landing above, a light flickered.

With some effort, I pulled myself up the unvarnished banister. Above me, the light danced skittishly, casting long, reaching shadows. I followed it.

The master bedroom looked like a squat. Shoved against one corner of the room was a gnarled mass of quilts. Everywhere else the floor was strewn with cardboard. Near my feet, cigarette butts and hypodermic needles littered the chipboard like insects.

“Hello,” said a dry voice, causing me to jump. “You’re not meant to be here.”

“I’m…not?” I answered nervously.

“No,” the shadowy figure stated. “This one’s mine.”

“W-what is?”

The shadow smiled. It’s eyes were glassy. I felt the hairs on my neck stand.

“I can help you, if you’re ready,” the shadow offered.

“R-ready for what?” I stuttered.

Slowly, the shadow rotated its wrist, revealing a knife. The long blade flashed orange in the low light. Then the shadowy figure let out a shriek and rushed towards me.

Turning weakly, I ran as fast my sickly body would allow, limping towards the stairs, which I half slid, half fell down; nearly losing my balance as the ground floor raced towards me. My hands burned from gripping the banister.

Lunging, I grasped at the front door’s handle, but it was locked somehow.

Hearing no footsteps, I could sense that the thing was close behind me nonetheless, so I feinted right then left, dashing into a huge sitting room, at the end of which was a closed white door. Manically, I fumbled at the various locks and burst through it.

And then I was falling.

I felt my knees give out as the energy in my legs *evaporated*.

I hit the floor.

Everything went black.

\*

On waking, I found myself in a near identical sitting room to the one I’d been chased through.

My legs felt like jelly.

I was covered in dust from head-to-toe. The house’s dust. The stale, dry smell made me cough.

Suddenly, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end again.

*I was being watched.*

Wheezing, I rolled over onto my side somewhat painfully. The shadow was in the doorway I had just run through.

It was smiling.

“So, how do you like it?” the shadow grinned.

I found myself unable to speak.

“This house can be yours,” it continued. “It still needs one…”

As its smile stretched wider, the shadowy figure slid a thin, emaciated finger across its throat.

“Just come back when it’s time,” it nodded, approaching me slowly.

I dug my heels into the dusty floor, trying to push myself away from it, but I was still too weak.

The figure was so close. It smelt rank.

It’s breath whorled in my ear like a foul, wintry wind.

*“You can stay forever, if you like. We can be neighbours.”*

And with that, it disappeared.

\*

It took an age to summon the energy I would need to get up, so in the interim I just lay there. For hours. Sensing the house around me, like a gathering quilt of silence and darkness. It was weirdly peaceful.

After a while, I felt settled. In tune, even.

Eventually, I summoned the strength to leave. I found the front door unlocked.

Outside, the night air was crisp. Still damp, but colder than it had been earlier. Straight ahead, beyond the long expanse of dusty flatland and the distant line of trees, was the main road. Cars scudded by, their headlights setting the gold and green canopy of leaves ablaze, just like the sun had done earlier.

My car was still there, waiting.

Turning, I took a last long look at the two houses. Both were still, calm. Lightless.

Reminded of the white door, I felt stupid that I hadn’t noticed that the houses were semi-detached earlier, but on looking at them now, it was quite clear that they weren’t attached. They were *detached*.

*Just come back when it’s time,* the voice in my ear whispered. *We can be neighbours…*

Staring at the house on the right, I noticed that it didn’t feel so hollow, so devoid anymore.

I could sense it – the quiet thrum of it.

*You can stay forever, if you like.*

Smiling, I twiddled the car keys in my pocket.

I was where I was supposed to be.
