The night descended like a vast, impenetrable curtain, swallowing the city in endless shadows.

It was my first time running this particular route at night. The streetlights along the way seemed neglected, casting only faint, lonely glows that threw fragmented shadows on the ground. In the distance, the only other light came from a small motel sign, dim and unsettling.

The familiarity of the day was completely absent. The air was thick with a damp chill, carrying the earthy scent of rain-soaked grass and soil. The surrounding silence was so deep it felt as if time had stopped. Not a soul was in sight, just the road stretching out into the darkness, growing more and more eerie with every step.

As I neared the familiar corner that marked my way home, I suddenly saw something that made my heart skip a beat.

A gaunt, pregnant woman appeared under the streetlight, jumping rope. She looked over 35 weeks pregnant.  But this wasn't a gentle lift of the toes or a slight bounce; it was an intense, forceful up-and-down leap. The frequency and vigor of her jumps were nothing like what an expectant mother should—or could—do.

But no, she wasn’t jumping rope. I only thought she was because of the way her hands were clenched tightly, as if gripping an invisible rope. As I got closer, I realized her hands were empty. Apart from her belly, her limbs were emaciated, resembling brittle branches. Her fingers were splayed, the tips like decayed roots, clawing at the ground as if desperately drawing in the earth’s last breath. The sight sent a shiver down my spine, and fear washed over me like a tidal wave.

Her face was waxy, like a mask, and her hair, dry as straw, hung messily over her forehead, flailing wildly with each jump.

As I approached, every instinct screamed at me not to stop, not to make any sudden movements that might catch her attention. I held my breath, maintaining my pace, with only one thought in mind: keep running, get away from here, don’t let her see that I’m terrified. Because I knew, deep down, that if she realized I was watching her, she might say those dreadful words: "Did you see me? Did you see me?"

The sound of her jumping echoed in my ears, Each heavy, slow landing, seemed to carry an inexplicable pain. Even more unsettling was the absence of any labored breathing from such exertion—only a low, almost inaudible whimper that seemed to come from deep within her throat, faintly audible in the still night.

Eventually, I rounded the corner and ran out of that haunting area. The city remained silent, while my heart was pounding.I finally stopped outside a bustling barbecue place near my home, the lingering fear stabbing at me like a knife.

If she was really pregnant, what was she trying to do? What could possibly be inside her? If she wasn’t pregnant, then what did I see?

These questions kept circling in my mind, the cold of the night seeping into my bones, as if even the air was filled with an inexplicable dread.
