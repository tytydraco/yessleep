Everything that has happened, was when i was around - 5 years old. And as much as i try to erase these past memories, it always comes back to me. Sometimes in my sleep, sometimes in nightmares and sometimes just out of nowhere.

I tried to tell myself that i just made up everything, after all i was just a kid back then. And i desperately want to believe that. I want to say that my mind just made it up, that she was just being sick.

But i can’t…..no, the more i look at this, the more i realize that there was something more behind it. Something darker, that makes nights and my sleep extremely difficult even today .

And the worse part? Is the fact that she might be still out there, somewhere.

My name is……..well, just call me Aiden. In my very young age i lived with my mother in an old two floor house that was probably older than herself.  It Isolated from distant civilization you could say. Never really had a friends i could play with, and our closest neighbors were few miles away from us as well as nearby city where my mom used to work.

My mom…..i don’t want to use her real name so lets just call her Josephine, was taking care of me all by herself. I never exactly knew my father. My mom  always told me that when i was very very little, he took a job in another country, and he doesn’t have much time to visit us

But later i figured that he just simply left us. Leaving my mother to take care of me, the house, and our cat named Strife- maybe a weird name yeah i know, but honestly i couldn’t mind since he was the only friend i had around here. 

Especially when my mom was working when i grew slightly older. She worked as a helping chef in a kitchen, taking her bike early in the mornings and returning during the late night hours.

She trusted me enough that i will be able to take care of myself and not burn the whole damn house down, at least for a one full day. And she was right.

She always got a free meal from the work so food wasn’t problem when i was home alone, and i always listened to her when she told me that i can play outside, but not far from the house. And promised her that if anything happens, i will call her. And of course what every mother would tell they’re children,not going out after dark.

So yeah, sometimes it was just me and strife being on our own. I wouldn’t say i had perfect childhood, but its not like i had choice anyway in that matter.

Mostly i just stayed inside playing with toys, drawing or play games on my mom’s used phone, and outside always playing with my cat.

Back then i didn’t payed much attention towards it, but i remember the fields and woods around us always  being full of life, birds singing, distant sounds from nearby animals and sometimes spotting nearby deer.

But….now when i look at it, the weeks that followed- the woods started to be, far too quiet, and the atmosphere just being…wrong.

Even strife changed, being always lively and playful cat, turned into more- careful. Inside he was acting okay but when we were outside, he always sit nearby the house, watching the woods from afar- unblinking, as if he was expecting something to come out from there, and reacted to my pressence only when i called him inside.

Sometimes i didn’t even had to call him, he seen me heading towards the door, he was always the first one there.

When my mother came home i told her that Strife was acting different, but she just told me animals sometimes act like that.

Not sure if she truly believed that herself or if she was even aware of the fact that the woods went just too silent.

Whatever she Really believed, it doesn’t matter now.

………………..

After that,the first 2 days my mother stayed home with me. Cleaning the house most of the time, while i stayed to my usual activities. 

I remember that these days my mother was more- on Guard than usual tho she was pretty good at hiding it. Just like strife she used to stare outside from the window towards the fields and the woods even for minutes without saying anything.

And when i asked her what is she doing, she said- I’m just enjoying the view you know? Its peaceful out there.

And that was all she had to say about it, i decided to not dig any further for Now. But that wasn’t the only thing, i never had to lock my bedroom door when going to sleep unless my mom was gone. But that night when i was going to sleep she told me to lock them and if anything happens, then i will come to her room.

What could happen? I asked myself that time but i simply nodded. She told me goodnight, giving me light kiss on cheek and turned the lights off leaving the room.

Strife was lying next to me, he Always did And none of us mind that. I tried to sleep but…i just couldn’t, these words were playing in my head over and over again.

I tried to figure out what did she exactly mean by it, but as much as i tried i just couldn’t figure it out, but at least i was finally getting sleepy and well……. i think i fell asleep because i woke up maybe few hours later, why? I do not know.

I rubbed my eyes and weakly sit up trying to adjust to the darkness, the small shine of moonlight was the only source i had at the moment before i turned my lamp on my night table.

And that’s when i saw Strife sitting near the window, his eyes utterly fixed on the outside.

It confused me and i whispered his name but his ears only twitched slightly catching the sound, but still keeping his gaze outside.

I pulled the blanket away and stepped towards the window, Strife didn’t bothered to even turn around. I checked outside too and as far i remember i couldn’t see shit the first minute.

The outside world was as expected too quiet, wind just stopped and Sounds of crickets as if they never existed.

Me and Strife stared and stared but I’m Pretty sure that he was seeing something that i didn’t.

And soon enough i was Probably right. Because when my eyes adjust slightly to the darkness outside, i swore i saw silhouette standing outside on the field.

At First i thought its just a shadow or something, but no……..i think there was a person outside our house. Tho I’m not sure if……i can call it a person. I don’t remember how exactly tall that thing was, maybe around 6 feet tall but besides that, i Would have thought it was just a guy.

But that thought vanished when i noticed standing it unnaturally hunched, its long neck and head, being almost unnaturally titled to side that shouldn’t be possibly for normal person.

I don’t know if it was staring at me or even being aware of my presence because i couldn’t see any face details, not even the eyes.

But I’m sure as hell that it was staring at our house. I’m not gonna lie, i was deeply paralyzed in fear that i wasn’t even able to move or turn my gaze somewhere else. I was afraid that if i stop looking at it even for just a second, something might happen.

I think i Would be standing there Forever if its head didn’t started to slowly turn towards my window, its head pointed straight towards me tho i didn’t know if it could actually see me but it scared me so fucking much that i grabbed strife and quickly left the window and jumped straight back into the bed, turning my lamp off- hopping that whatever was out there didn’t seen me.

I quickly covered us with my blanket, not sure if that would help but at that time it was the only thing that i thought was safe against monsters and boogeyman. I know i should have probably go wake up my mother but the idea of leaving the safety of my room didn’t sounded appealing at all.

Whatever was out there, didn’t tried to break in the house, and surprisingly despite my fear- i fell asleep.

Later that morning i woke up and everything was just the same, no signs of intruder, no signs of anything not being normal.

Later i told my mom all about it. She didn’t said something like- it was just a bad Dream or it was just your imagination. Instead she froze for moment before going out while i stayed inside watching her from window.

She went into the fields, searching for anything that could prove Somebody or something was there.

After few minutes she returned back and inside, she leaned down slightly hugging me and whispered.

Its okay honey, it okay. It was probably just some stranger passing by or maybe it was just Animal.

As much as she tried to sound calm, in her voice i could hear- doubt, nervousness, maybe even hint of fear. After that we both returned to our usual activities but that day i didn’t went out to play.

I was just afraid…. that the thing if it was real. Could see me, or maybe take me away when my mom wouldn’t pay attention.

even strife was acting different, he didn’t even took a bite of his food or drink any water. He just stayed in the living room lying in his den.

But besides that everything else was normal, but the atmosphere inside and around the house - was not.

I don’t know if anything would change. But maybe if we had just leave that day, leave that place. Maybe things would be, different.

The following night i asked my mom if i can sleep with her tonight and she agreed, i toke Strife and his den as well, we closed the door and lock them and went to sleep.

I stayed close to mom and…..i would lie if i Haven’t said i had trouble falling asleep. Even Strife didn’t slept but that wasn’t something new since he used to be awake during the nights sometimes anyway. But i think that he stayed awake not because he wasn’t tired, but because he was afraid himself.

I rolled to other side desperately trying to fall asleep, but i just simply couldn’t. During the day i felt scared yes, but now it was just way worse and i didn’t know why.

Don’t know about my mom, but she slept peacefully, breath slow and steady, honestly i was surprised she could sleep so calmly despite the fact she was nervous the whole day.

Well later i really did managed to fall asleep, and…..my dreams weren’t really shiny.

In my dreams i walked at the vast dark fields, it Almost looked like ours, but our house wasn’t There, and the woods have been gone as well.

At First i was there alone, with nothing, no life, no wind, no purpose. And then, he stood there in afar. That thing. Standing there like a fucking scarecrow.

Its head and neck like the last night titled to unnatural side, watching me, but despite not being that dark i still couldn’t see any face details, it was just all Black.

I remember the air getting extremely cold, so cold that i felt like i was standing naked during winter.

Then i could see its head slightly twitching, at first just slightly, like it was trying to get something out of its head. But then it changed into Almost violently, twitching its head like a maniac that i honestly thought its head might fall off.

And……when i thought things couldn’t get less twisted, it charged at me. Covering distance between us in inhuman speed, its head still twitching, and its running was as if it Forget how to move right.

I didn’t had time to react and i basically froze in place, before it close the distance between us and then……then i just woke up. My breath was fast and heavy, my brow sweaty and my hands shaking in fear.

I look around but it was too dark for me to see anything, i extended my hand forward trying to touch and wake up my mom.

But when my hand reached the place where i should feel my mothers shoulder, i felt the still warm mattress.

She……she wasn’t there, that confused me and scared me as well, until my gaze fell onto the open door leading to the dark hall. I thought maybe she went to bathroom or anything but why wouldn’t she turn the lights on?

I called out mom but i got no answer, i tried again but no answer was coming back to me.

Despite my fear i pulled the blankets away from me and headed towards the lights and when turning them on- lighting the room, i saw that……Strife wasn’t in his den anymore.

To this day I’m not exactly sure what happen to Strife but i had my own theory, theory that seems the most logic but also being the hardest the accept- but that’s not important for now.

What happen after is that i slowly entered the dark hallway, turning the lights on as well but saw nothing crazy, but i could feel getting goosebumps as my skin was hit with the cold Air.

It was strange at that moment, we never usually had this much cold inside our house even during the most cruel winters.

I went down the stairs slowly searching for my mom but when stepping to the first floor, the cold air grown only stronger.

And that’s when i spotted it, wide open….door leading outside to the dark Fields and the woods.

That’s when i realized this is the reason why the house was so goddamn cold, but still where was my mom?

I had hard time seeing anything and at that time i didn’t bothered to turn the other lights on.

When i looked longer into the darkness, i could have swear that i saw something, some figure or shadow coming from the woods.

Don’t ask me how did i managed to see that because i don’t know either.

But over few seconds the figure was getting Closer and Closer coming from….no, no no it wasn’t walking. It was running.

Straight towards our house, but its movements, its….neck and head, god it fucking looked like that thing i saw in my dreams and Yesterday!!But this time it got longer hair, hair….. hair just like my mother.

I Would, maybe i Would almost charge towards her, if….she didn’t moved like that thing. And she, she was getting Closer and Closer.

I didn’t knew what to do but adrenaline kicked trough my body and in yell of terror i slam the door shut and locked them.

I didn’t looked out from windows or anything, i just quickly run up stairs tripping  over my fucking feet but every time i stood up.

I managed to run to my room, closing the door and locking them, then quickly jumping into bed and cover my self with blanket. I cried silently, shaking violently, holding onto the blanket with dear life.

Then it came, an sound of breaking a window, as if something big jumped trough it inside.

I Closed my eyes trying to hold back the tears but they snapped open instantly as i could hear it crawling up stairs, it didn’t even tried to stay quiet.

When it reached upstairs it stopped, but not for long….as a pair of fast heavy footsteps echoed trough the whole house before it violently slammed it self into my door with crack. I don’t know whatever that sound came from the door or….or maybe from her.

For moment everything stopped, before it started to slam and hit the door over and over again aggressively like a wild animal. 

I lied there still covered under blanket, trying to hold Down screams as much as possible, each slam made me jump slightly and i didn’t knew if the doors will handle the assault.

I thought the door might fell down but it didn’t as it suddenly everything stooped. No door hitting, no footsteps, everything but my heavy breathing fell into silence.

I……i lied there for moment, my hand still clutched to my blanket. Before i decided to look.

I carefully peeped from the blanket slowly, but my eyes fell on wide open door and the dark hallway. And between the door, there she stood….my mother.

But she looked wrong, that…i don’t think that was my mother.

She stood tall, her neck was extended and her head titled to side awfully just like that creature, her hair falling down and…..she wore the creepiest bloody grin i ever seen in my fucking life.

Wide, evil- full of sharp bloody teeth. And her eyes wide, too wide open.

That blood in her mouth, i think……i think she might have done something to Strife.

I quickly hid back under the blanket but i was sure my mom, or that thing pretending to be my mother seen me.

My hearth was racing so fast that i thought it might shoot out of my chest. And that time i couldn’t handle the sheer terror anymore and i started to cry silently, holding my blanket even more tightly while having my eyes closed, hoping this is only a nightmare i would soon wake up from.

Then i felt her hand, slowly brushing against my blanket before her hand made contact with my hair trough it.

but it wasn’t trying to calm me down no, then the brushing started to get harder and more Faster, even her nails were brushing against it and me that i could feel her nails raking against my skin slightly.

I cried even more, i beg for it to stop…to leave me alone!

But i don’t think she liked it as suddenly she ripped the blankets away from me leaving me vulnerable Lying on bed, but my eyes were still closed.

Even if it was really my mom, i didn’t want to look, not anymore.

It breathed heavily, like it had problem to even breath at all but it didn’t sounded like my mom, it sounded like something else.

The terror and fear was So intense that my body couldn’t handle it anymore. And i think i…..i fell into coma or something.

Later i woke up in the hospital and When nurse saw me she immediately called the doctor and went over to me.

I don’t think i was hurt seriously or anything but i remember my back itching slightly, it was from the nails.

next to me was siting our distant neighbor Albert, who was the one who saved me and got me there. And god if it wasn’t for him i don’t know what could have happen to me.

He never really visited us or care about us but i was told that he was out there hunting coyotes. But the woods were too quiet and too empty, at least not until he stumbled upon dead animals, foxes, boars…deer, birds and even a wolf all mauled into a bloodshed. And the bloody trail, leading towards our house.

He followed it With shotgun in his hands. It leaded him into our Field and when he noticed wide broken window, he didn’t hesitate and managed to break inside.

And when he went upstairs and Turned the Lights on, there he saw an humpbacked silhouette leaning down. He thought it was a a Intruder or something and pointed shotgun forward but before he could shoot, the thing Turned quickly at him, and jumped trough the window.

He quickly followed and checked from window but that thing was too fast and already close to the woods.

He swore it didn’t moved like a normal human. He realized i was there and called 911.

Later they arrived and took me to Hospital while the police were asking Albert what happen. And later they were asking me too, and from what i told them. They thought i might probably made some things.

However they declared a state search for my mother……they never found her. And as for the dead bodies, they said it might have been a rabid bear.

But i know, even if i hate to admit it, i know it was my mother. Tho i still don’t know if it was really her or if something just wore her skin.

Later after getting treated Albert took my under his wings, probably knowing that being in orphanage will make no good after everything that happen.

His house was still near the woods but closer to civilization. I sometimes, used to stare outside, searching well…..for anything. But never did seem a thing.

And many years later i moved away myself miles and miles away into a bigger city and well, despite everything being normal. The memories didn’t stooped haunting me.

And now, after years of avoiding about talking it, i decided to write it on the internet. Not sure why, maybe it will bring peace to my soul. Or it will do nothing at all.

I don’t care what people will think, i just need to share it With others no matter how crazy it sounds.

Even if it will easier my soul, there will still be one thing that will haunt me until my death.

That she was never found, and i don’t know if it was some kind of monster……or if it really was my mother.
