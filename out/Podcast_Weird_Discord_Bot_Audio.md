There's something weird with the audio of the podcast playlist that I’m listening to. When you use it on the discord server bot (like from Hydra, Music Tune, Groovy, and etc.), its audio is different from its Spotify version. I accidentally discovered this when I wanted to play some playlists for my friends in Discord because we wanted to listen to some horror stories because it was Halloween.

The podcast episode I played is ''Mr. bag’’, While the original podcast was presented as a story about a woman who made a new ‘’friend" assuming it was a ghost and just a typical horror story, the Discord version behaved strangely. This is how it played.

It started like a typical Mr. Bean intro, but like a weirdly modern one. You can hear Mr. Bean's voice with two characters in the background. Does it sound like he is talking to some male and female characters, assuming the male voice is the phone? Then he took a photo like three times, and then said, "It's amazing."  while the other voices sound, they like it 

After that, an alarm buzzed. Then a female voice says, "aw, back to work already?" You can hear in the background like he is playing with his phone because then, the phone talks like ''do you like this one,'' and when Mr. Bean agreed, the phone said ''then let's get it and this is how we get there.'' It sounded like the phone was taking Mr. Bean somewhere. After that, it seems like he goes outside because of a rain sound effect, and some running can be heard in the audio.

A new character then appears, but with an angry tone, but after the phone says, "he is looking for this!" it then appears that they were already at the location where the GPS had directed Mr. Bean to go, and it sounds like he was already browsing because of the many different sounds that can be heard. The music changed from upbeat to frightful as the new character grunted and said, "Here you go," but Mr. Bean replied, "I can afford that." After that, the character said, "Don't worry mate, we can help you."

You can hear Mr. Bean's groans and response as they appear to be walking down the stairs, as they stomp on something, which you can describe as something fleshy. Then it pauses and a new character enters, saying, "Alright, let's have a proper challenge," adding, "The first one to get these wins!" A female voice then enters, saying, "Then I'll be the judge." At this point, you can hear Mr. Bean fumbling through a stack of plastic and paper while grunting, then saying, "Oh no." searching through both plastic and paper makes some awful mushy noises after a while.’

Rain and laughter may be heard in the background, while Mr. Bean appears to be running due to panting. Mr. Bean's terrified voice may be heard, as well as the sound effect of a vehicle opening and closing. After repeatedly saying "c'mon," which sounds like he is trying to start his car, you can hear the horrifying music getting louder and louder and some disgusting audio getting closer and closer until Mr. Bean softly whispers "teddy," at which point the audio comes to an abrupt stop.

My friend and I were weirded out and creeped out by this Discord Version, and when we searched through the internet, we didn’t find anything about it.
