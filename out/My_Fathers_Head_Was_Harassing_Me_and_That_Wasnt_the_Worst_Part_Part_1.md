On the night of April 5th, I jolted awake. 

I had no idea what time it was. My room was swallowed by murky darkness. The blackout curtains were doing their job too perfectly.

Something else was sharing the space with me. I didn't move.

My fingertips clung to something slick and velvety. It glided over my skin. Back and forth. Again and again.

I was almost grateful I lived in a neighborhood with lousy security. It gave me a reason to keep a gun under my pillow.

The sensation didn't stop. 

It moved from my thumb to my pinky, cold and wet, seeping into the seams of my nails. It lingered like it was savoring something.

Like it was savoring my fear.

It didn't seem to notice my free hand. I moved slowly, like a reptile under the sheets, inching toward the gun beneath my pillow.

In one swift motion, I pulled it out and raised it.

"Stay right there. Don't move, freak. I've got a gun," I hissed, trying to keep my voice steady. "I'll shoot if you move."

I aimed into the dark. My other hand fumbled for the lamp.

A warm light spilled across the room. I should've felt safer in the glow.

But I didn't.

Because I saw the head.

A man's head lay just beyond my right hand, a few feet away on the floor. 

Middle-aged. Pale. Bloodless. His skin told the story: he'd died from massive blood loss.

The light caught his face strangely, as if it were reflecting off dull glass.

His expression was calm and serious. Lips pressed into a tight line beneath a faded mustache, aligned eerily with the jagged slice where his neck had ended.

I knew that face.

I froze.

I thought it was gone. It hadn't shown up for months.

The head lunged. Fast and sudden, like a predator snapping at prey.

It should've looked absurd—a disembodied head rolling across the floor. It wasn't.

My pinky met it first. Its teeth sank in.

Sharp. Deep. Serrated like an animal's. I felt the pressure clamp through skin and into bone.

The mouth tore wider than it should've, splitting at the corners. Thin lips peeled back, exposing rows of inhuman teeth. They were made for ripping.

Pain lit up my nerves like acid poured into the joint. The bite seared through flesh and into bone. My pinky was trying to detach from my hand.

The muscles in its brow twitched, with unsettling joy.

I raised my free arm and shot. Twice.

The head halted. Two dents remained.

I sat there, breathless, my hand was dripping blood onto the sheets.

I pried open its jaw. It was still clenching.

I had to crush the bone five times with my bare hand just to get it loose. Then, slowly, I reached into its gore mouth and pulled out what was left of my finger.

To soothe my nerves, I fumbled for my phone and called an ambulance.

Then I stood up, grabbed the head by its greasy hair, strode into the kitchen, and tossed it into the oven. Right beside my half-eaten dinner.

Blood from my still-bleeding hand soaked into its hair. These parts of me would burn away with its rotting flesh in less than two hours.

This wasn't the first time I'd seen the head.

I recognized that face. I've known it since the moment I crawled out of my mother's womb.

It was my father.

And I chopped his head off three years ago.


"There was a dog," I told the doctor. "It bit me."

I had to lie. The sweat was pouring down my face.

I left the hospital after seven days, waving goodbye with a finger that barely felt like mine.

My older sister picked me up in her white car. Hanging from the rearview mirror was a string of handmade rosary beads—pearly blue, unmistakably her signature.

"Pretty beads," I said, shutting the door and fastening my seatbelt. "New work?"

"Nah. Made them in January. I guess it's been a while since we've seen each other," she laughed, then rolled down my window for me.

From the back seat, an arm slid around my shoulders. I jumped a little—I hadn't noticed Ethan sitting there.

"Hi, babe," he said.

I turned back to Lydia, surprised. "You didn't tell me Ethan was coming. I didn't even know you two knew each other."

Ethan made a goofy face at me in the rearview mirror. I returned it, childishly. He smiled, visibly relieved that I was okay.

The scenery outside blurred as Lydia sped up, humming something familiar under her breath.

"Lydia called and told me you got hurt," Ethan said. "I booked a ticket and flew back right away. But someone slashed my tires, so I begged her to drive me here."

He looked at me, scanning my face. "Are you really okay?"

I sighed and nodded. 

Of course he'd ask. Probably twenty times a day for the next two weeks. That's exactly why I called Lydia instead of him.

A red light blinked ahead. Lydia slammed the brakes. I lurched forward, the seatbelt biting into my chest.

She's always driven like a lunatic.

I raised my eyebrows at her, but she avoided my gaze. Her brown curls fell across her face like a curtain, shielding her from silent judgment.

"I know you told me not to tell Ethan," she said quietly, "but losing a finger isn't a paper cut. He had to know."

That explained Ethan's nervous glances.

"I really appreciate you introducing us last Christmas," he added. "Otherwise, I'd have had no idea what happened."

Shit. I'd forgotten I was the one who introduced them. I was starting to regret it.

The light turned green. I lurched again, this time backward, my head smacking into the seat.

Neither Ethan nor Lydia knew I was a criminal. That I'd killed my father, even though I had my reasons.

They had no idea about the complicated history between him and me. And I wasn't ready to explain it. 

So, before they could ask the inevitable questions—how did you get hurt?—I changed the subject.

"So you bought a ticket for him too?"

We were headed to a theater. A musical, weirdly for a new discharge. But it was what I wanted after a week in the hospital.

"Of course," Lydia said. "What, leave him outside for three hours? Unless that's what you want."

"Yeah. I'm a sadist," I smirked.


After the show, we grabbed burgers. At exactly 11:23 p.m., we hit the road again.

"Come on," Ethan said, laughing beside me in the passenger seat. "Don't act like that wasn't hilarious."

He mimicked one of the performers from the show, gesturing wildly. I smiled.

It was my turn to drive. 

Trees blurred past under dim lights. The moon didn't bother to show up, so I flicked on the headlights and focused on the road.

I'd taken a different route home. There was a bad crash on our usual path. My phone said the detour would add 30 minutes, but I was too tired to care. 

The musical and greasy food were sitting heavy in my stomach. I just wanted to be home.

Lydia had fallen asleep. I turned the radio down.

A melody came through in the meantime. Sacred, almost hymn-like. Familiar.

"Hey," Lydia said. "Isn't that the song we used to sing at home?"

In the rearview mirror, Lydia's eyes snapped open. Round. Wide. Like a deer catching headlights.

"I thought you were asleep."

I hate that song.

"I was," she said. "But not anymore. Turn it up. I miss the lyrics. Remember how Dad taught us to sing it?"

I hate him.

The hymn echoed hollow in my ears. The radio buzzed—blame the bad signal—but that didn't dull Lydia's enthusiasm.

Her voice rose, matching the melody with too much cheer.

To Ethan, it must've seemed weird. I'd told him Lydia was an optimist. I don't think he expected this.

She spread her arms and swayed like she was basking in divine light.

I met Ethan's eyes. He said nothing, but I saw it. The tight-lipped look that said: your sister's kind of a freak.

In our childhood, Lydia adored that song. She adored our father, too. 

I never told her what he did. I didn't want to break her. So I swallowed it.

Our car drove alone through the dark. Headlights lit up the road ahead. Scattered leaves, broken twigs. No other cars.

Then we hit something. 

A bump. Hard enough to jolt the whole frame. 

The radio buzzed louder. 

My palms were slick on the wheel.

Lydia lurched forward and smacked her forehead on Ethan's seat.

"Ow," she said, rubbing her eye.

"You okay?" I asked.

"I guess I'm not blind."

Ethan leaned toward me. "Want me to drive?"

"I'm fine," I said. "Thanks."

The trees stretched beside us, black and bare. Like props from some low-budget horror movie.

The streetlamps vanished, along with every trace of civilization and I hadn't even noticed.

The headlights cast a pale, sickly glow, like light from a dying man.

I could only see a few feet ahead. 

Fog hung in the distance, swallowing everything ahead, turning the road into an endless, abyssal gloom.

Lydia looked back through the rear window. Then again.

Finally, she said, "What did we hit?"

"Twigs," Ethan said, pointing. "There's a ton of them."

"You sure? Because I saw something moving."

Ethan turned. Then cursed. 

"Shit. She's right. It's moving. It's... following us?"

My stomach dropped.

In the mirror, something moved.

It didn't walk. It hopped. But not like a rabbit. No shape like that could move that way.

I floored it. The tires screamed. My hair whipped back in the rush.

The thing didn't slow. If anything, it gained.

I hit a curve hard. The car screeched. Ethan grabbed the door handle to keep from sliding.

"Wait—what's going on? Shouldn't we stop and check?"

"Ethan," Lydia said, her voice tight, "it's chasing us. It might be an animal. A predator. It thinks we're prey."

He rolled his eyes. I could tell, this was only the second time he'd met my sister, and he already didn't like her.

"I really don't think some so-called predators would mean harm," he said. "Especially one that small."

He looked to me, like he expected backup.

I hit the gas instead.

"Ethan, babe," I said, trying to control my voice. "I'll explain later. Just shut up and buckle in."

Lydia kept glancing out the rear window. I checked the mirror from time to time, and it was enough to freak Ethan out. He hovered his hands in the air, ready to grab the wheel if I lost focus.

The radio buzzed like a wasp in my ear. 

Outside, the thing was only a foot away now, rolling toward us like a possessed pendulum ride, straight from hell. 

Each bump over twigs tore into it more, jagged wounds shredding open, but it only moved faster, like it could smell blood in my veins.

That was my father's fucking head.

Every time I destroyed his body, it came back. 

It had stopped for a while, after I carved the last remnants of rotting flesh off that immortal skull. But it returned again.

I'd destroy it again. And again.

But it was driving me mad.

How long would I have to fight with my victim's head?

The air turned sour. That stench—burnt flesh, rot, and something worse—slid into the car.

I could see it now, clearly.

The face. The same thin-lipped expression, like he was judging me for my sin.

Fuck him.

"Grab the handle," I said. Then I slammed the gas and swerved.

The head didn't anticipate the move. It kept charging forward. I braced. Then snap.

The wheels hit it.

I didn't look. But I heard everything. The crunch, smear and silence.

I slammed the brakes and stopped.

My lungs screamed. I focused on breathing, just to keep from blacking out. I rested my forehead on the steering wheel.

The radio static cut out. The woman's voice came back, singing the same sacred song. Her voice sounded like heaven.

The night wind slipped in through the cracked windows.

"Did we hit... the thing?" Ethan asked, barely above a whisper.

"Lizzy?" Lydia's hand touched my back. "Are you okay?"

I opened my mouth to explain. 

Thud. Something hit the roof.

Another thud. Heavier. The car trembled under the impact. Then came lighter, rapid taps.

Not branches or twigs.

My eyes rose, almost on their own.

And then, four fangs pierced through the roof. The metal around them curled like crumpled paper.

Ethan screamed. "What the hell?! It's breaking the car!"

He reached for the door.

The fangs pulled back. Through four torn holes in the roof, the night stared back.

I heard something skitter across the roof. 

Another thud. Then a scrape. The metal flexed under weight.

The air stinks. Something rotten had landed above us.

I yanked Ethan back before he could open the door.

It had never attacked me when I wasn't alone. Why now?

Confusion clouded my thoughts, but one thing was clear:
I had to end it. Again.

"Don't move," I said. "Both of you. Stay inside."

"...Lizzy?" Lydia whispered.

I looked back at her. Her eyes were wide with fear.

I tried to smile for reassurance. But I don't think it worked.

"Is there anything in the car? A weapon? Knife, crowbar—anything?"

She pointed, her hand trembling. "Door pocket. Your side."

I reached in. 

A crowbar. Painted light blue, classic Lydia.

I gripped it. Felt the weight in my hand. It felt powerful, like a miracle.

"Stay inside," I said again. "No matter what."

I took a deep breath, shoved the door open, and stepped out.

There it was. My father's head.

It slumped on the roof of the car, barely held together by its jagged neck. 

The skin had regrown in patches. Half of it looked molten. Like meat that had tried and failed to hold itself together.

It turned to me.

Thin lips stretched over rotting gums, trying to hide the fangs. One eye stared at me. The one that had survived the fire.

I knew that look.

It was the same look he gave me the second time he came into my room.

My father raised Lydia and me by himself. I used to be close with him—even after the first time when it happened.

That time, he comforted me with apologies. He said he was drunk. He said I looked like my mother—a woman I'd never met, not even in photos.

I believed him and forgave him.

And then it happened again.

That night, he covered my mouth. His expression was cold, fixed. He pushed himself into me while his eyes stayed locked on mine.

Beneath the portrait of God that hung over my bed, he moved rhythmically. He never spoke.

He was satisfied with my silence. He fed on my fear and devoured my dread.

Just like the presence.

I didn't fight back until he was done. When he tried to smother me, I screamed into the pillow. 

My hands were pinned beneath his knees, but I thrashed, kicked wildly. I hit his crotch. It's exposed and vulnerable.

He cried out and toppled sideways.

I scrambled to the closet. I had hidden an axe there after the first time he came in.

I don't remember how I felt.

I just raised it. And slashed it down.

Raised. Slashed it down.

Mechanically. Just like the presence.

I raised the crowbar. And smashed.

Once. Twice.

I set the fire myself. Burned his body, the house, everything. 

Before I ran, I woke Lydia and told her that Dad had saved me, but he got trapped inside. 

She believed me. She thought he was a hero. She never knew what really happened.

Until now.

His head was pulp now, oozing gore across the ground.

I dropped the crowbar.

Leaning back against the car, I crossed my arms over my chest, like I was trying to shield myself from the wet night air.

Ethan and Lydia stood nearby, awkward and pale. They'd gotten out of the car while I was still swinging.

We formed a loose triangle around the wreckage. 

No one mentioned the head. But we all saw it. It was the elephant in the room. Bloody and quiet.

Ethan finally spoke. "I'm sorry."

I didn't know what to say.

I felt exposed. Embarrassed. I wasn't ready to explain. But I'd been forced into this.

So I shrugged.

"That's our father," Lydia murmured. "I wish you'd told me. I wouldn't have thought he was a hero. That must've hurt."

She wrinkled her nose and looked down, her posture small, like a stray deer.

Ethan tried to help. His voice was too upbeat.

"Well... at least it's over now?"

He meant to outrun the bloody scene. He failed. His pale face betrayed him.

I wanted to scream and cry, to break free from years of silence.

But I couldn't.

Numbness gripped me. My face gave nothing.

It hadn't ended.

"No," I said. "It'll come back. This isn't the first time I've seen him."

Ethan stiffened. "What? You never told me? It could've killed you!"

Then he fell silent. He understood. Of course I wouldn't have risked him if there'd been any other choice.

Lydia looked horrified for me. But still weirdly calm about the supernatural part.

That didn't surprise me.

Growing up in a faithful town teaches us how to keep a straight face, even when hell opens up. And I'm even better with it than Lydia.

"What do we do now?" she asked.

I yawned. My heart had slowed down.

"Go home, I guess. I'm exhausted."

Ethan looked like he might throw up. He also didn't seem to understand Lydia's calmness.

"But you said it'll come back. What do we do when it attacks again?!"

I wanted to say I was getting used to it.

That I didn't mind killing it again and again. Didn't mind it showing up at random, like an eternal scar, just to remind me of that night.

But Lydia cut in firmly.

"Ethan's right. We can't just sit around, waiting for it to come back. We need to end it. I think we should go home. Ask the Fathers for help."

By "home," she meant the town I used to live in. The place I fled the day after I chopped off my father's head.

She never left.

Even as kids, she was the faithful one. She believed in church like it could fix anything. 

But I wasn't like her. And going back there, where everything happened, was the last thing I wanted.

"Lydia might have a point," Ethan said, trying to sound supportive. "I remember you saying your hometown's still very religious. Maybe the priests there could handle this."

He nodded toward the pile of rotten ooze on the road. His face was pale and queasy.

I sighed. "Fine."

After all, Ethan and I were engaged. The last thing I needed was a dead man's head crashing our wedding. The sickness in my old family had pushed me to  eagerly build something new and normal. 

When I said "fine," I didn't mean right now.

But Lydia jumped into the driver's seat, buzzing with a weird, unstoppable energy, like we were headed to a theme park.

"I'm driving. We're going now!"

Ethan and I exchanged a look.

He was still trying to like her—my only family after everything. I could tell it wasn't easy.

I squeezed his hand.

I loved Lydia. I really did. Even if sometimes, I couldn't handle how she was wired.
