It’s always there. Watching. Plotting. I never see it move, but it’s always there. I never hear it, but it’s presence is always felt. It’s been 2 years since it arrived, and I feel like it’s getting closer and closer. 

I had just turned 18. Boyfriend left me for a bitch that just got her period, my parents kicked me out, and my best friend drowned before we could put our names on the lease. Hell of a week, if you ask me. 

But other than that, pretty smooth transition into living alone. Me and my bitch, Ayanna, saved up for about 2 years to get this apartment. Between you and me, I couldn’t quite tell you why. The floors were stained with mud and the depression of the previous occupants. The walls, painted with mold and water marks from the leaks. Hell, I was lucky to even get water out of the sinks without black sludge from the years of decay. But ultimately… I-it was mine. 

I knew the landlord from my parents. Pe-Peter was his name. He was like an uncle to me. He’s owned this building since before I was a twinkle in my father’s nutsack so, it was an easy grab. 

It was the first night I stayed there. That’s when I seen it. Just standing there. There was no face, no features, but i felt it watching me. Like, studying me. 

The first night was eerie. It stayed in the left corner of my room, or what would’ve been our room… God I miss her.
and it never moved. I turned on and off the light to see if I was tweaking, but no. It was still there. Haunting me. After a shot of NyQuil thoooough, I was out.   

The next 2 months were roughly the same. IT pops up, I take my medicine, and it’s the next day, you know?
Month 3 though?? That was a different story. 
I was in the middle of my normal night routine. Eat, then scroll, then freshen up for bed. I-It’s the latter where things got, I would sayyy twisted, if you will. Nothing like spitting your toothpaste water out and arising to see a black figure behind you lmaooo. I almost shit myself. It looked like a locked character in a video game. An unrendered NPC, but like, in real life. I shuddered then shrugged it off and went to take my medicine. 

Then

The nightmares started 
For the next 6 months, yes 6, I had the same recurring nightmare. Night after night I would find myself in a forest. Dead silent. No birds. No rustling of the leaves. I would’ve taken a bear or something hungry for me. But I never got it. All I received was a torch I-I managed to rangle up and about a half a dozen of these figure all around me. Th-They never ran at me or popped up. They just watched. And something always held me in place. In place long enough for all of them to gang up on me. Close enough to see their probably distorted and muffled faces. And yet, I’ve never seen them, waking up before the climax of this torture. 

I could never hear a thing, but I could see and feel my impending doom. The steps they never took, RINGING in my ears that couldn’t hear a pin drop. 

Waking up in soaked blankets drenched in your own fear is not exactly the best way to wake up. 

But I did.
