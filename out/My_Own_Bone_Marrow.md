It was never about the marrow, not really. The marrow was only the first to go because it sang the loudest when it was taken. You’d think the screaming would stop once the hollows were emptied, but it doesn’t; it just changes pitch, like a wind that’s learned the shape of a new throat. Have you ever seen a shadow try to fold itself inside-out? It looks a lot like that, but wetter, and the smell—oh, the smell—it doesn’t leave, no matter how far you run. It clings, like a memory you didn’t ask for, whispering something you almost understand but can’t quite place. Not yet. Not until it’s already too late.

I remember the teeth. Not in the usual way, mind you—gleaming or white or orderly—but scattered, like offerings. They weren’t supposed to move, but they did, dragging themselves forward, tiny scrapes in the dirt marking where they’d been. Where they were going was the real question, though. They all seemed to know, every last one of them, clicking and chattering like they had secrets to share, but only with each other. And if you followed them far enough, if you let them guide you, the clicking would start to sound like chewing. By then, you wouldn’t want to see what was waiting. But you would. Oh, you always would.

And the hands—they weren’t supposed to grow like that. Not from there. Not in *that* shape. When they first reached through the plaster, I thought it was a trick of the light, some optical nonsense born of exhaustion, but then they started to bend. Not like fingers, no, but like roots, sinking and splitting and twisting, as though they’d been searching for something for a very, very long time. You’d swear they were blind until they weren’t, and then you’d feel it—the way they *found* you. Even if you moved. Even if you ran. The grasp was inevitable. They weren’t hands anymore by the time they reached you; they were *knowing.*

You see, the sky doesn’t open up all at once. It peels, like old paint, layer by brittle layer, until there’s nothing left but the cold ache of the void underneath. It isn’t black, not really, but a kind of color your mind won’t let you see because it knows you weren’t meant to. But it sees you, of course, because it’s always been watching. The wolves I told you about—the ones that aren’t wolves anymore—they try to warn you, but their mouths are broken now. They speak in reverse, tongues split like ribbons, and every word is a question you forgot how to answer. You’d pity them if they weren’t still moving. If their ribs didn’t hum like tuning forks when the air got too thick.

But none of this is about the marrow, is it? Or the teeth. Or the sky. It’s about the parts that were never there to begin with, the spaces we didn’t notice were empty until they weren’t. Until they weren’t. Until they *were.*
