My dog ran away last year, she's a Great Dane, about 2 years old. For a while we looked for her all over the neighborhood and all over the city. We put up wanted posters for her lost dog posters with a high price because we valued her very much. Last night she was at our front door, we were so excited to see her. 

We let her into the house to gave her treats gave her food gave her water it seems like I was the only person who noticed something off about her before her eyes were a very pretty blue like a huskies but now they're brown a dark brown, the kind of brown wear it's almost black but not quite.

 I didn't want to say anything to ruin the moment because my family thought it was our dog she responded to her name, sky, we named her that because of her eyes. It was weird, so weird that I didn't sleep that night. My dog used to sleep at the end of my bed, she'd climb up with her big self and curl up into a ball on on my bed and she would lay her head on my feet. 

She didn't do that last night. Last night she climbed up on my bed like she usually did but instead of laying down and settling in for sleep she sat there staring at me with those black brown eyes it was scary. I eventually went to bed after just riding it off as her getting used to the place again. I shouldn't have done that. 

I woke up at 4:00 in the morning to my dog standing over me growling, her slobber was all over my face. She'd never growled at me before so I was very scared but I couldn't move because I knew that you would overpower me. Her teeth showed through her jowls and I quite frankly was very scared. 

Shakingly I called her name, "Sky, down."she listened got off my bed and hurried out of the room. I was terrified I'd never seen her like that before. I didn't think that this was my dog, there was no way she would never do that to me. I shut my door and sat on my bed a few moments later I heard her growling at me through the door, scratching at it. But then I heard something that terrified me, shook me to my core if you will.

 "Let me in, Sophie" 

A low raspy voice was heard through the door. I stood up terrified and hid in my closet. The scratching at the door got louder and harder until I heard a loud thud, thud thud thud. I heard the door fall onto the floor, and footsteps over it. The footsteps got closer to my closet and then I heard the voice again, "I know you're in there, Sophie" my heart dropped I tried not to make a noise, after a few minutes I heard a growl then the footsteps faded away as if sky had left the room.

 That was the last I saw of her, I hope she doesn't come back today. I don't think we'll ever get another dog
