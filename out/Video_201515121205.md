 I don't have much time to write this really, or at least I don't think I do. I don't know when it will get me. Hopefully I can write this fast enough before it gets me too. My friend, Jacob, and I were staying the night at his house. We were bored and being the teenagers we were, decided to go on the deep web and mess around. We eventually got bored and decided to text on Snapchat for a little on our phones. Everything was going well until a random account added us both at the same time. We didn't know who they were but it freaked us out considering the persons name was 201515 and they somehow added us both at the exact same time. It made no sense that someone would name themselves that, and me being the over thinker immediately concluded that we got hacked while on the deep web and they somehow found both of our Snapchats. Keep in mind we used Jacob's computer which has no correlation in any way to me. So the fact that this random Snapchat user found me as well was strange. We both thought that is was someone trying to mess with us.

We assumed we were correct as they sent us a link and said nothing else after that. Obviously I was against clicking the link, but Jacob was the risky type. He was always overconfident and assumed nothing bad would ever happen to him no matter his actions. That would be his biggest, and last major mistake he will ever make. The link took us to a video that automatically started playing. I scolded him for being so dumb to click the link. The only thing that calmed the situation down for me a little bit is that he had a vpn on. I should mention that Jacob clicked the link on his phone not mine. Jacob has a pretty strong vpn so the chances of someone bypassing it was pretty slim. I started to pay attention to the video and immediately got sick to my stomach. It was a bunch of analog horror but insanely realistic, almost as if it was real. I knew this link was some sort of virus. God, if only I knew how badly I was wrong. When the video ended the name of the video started to glitch out a little. The name of the video was 201515.121205.

I noticed that apart of the name had the same name as the person who added us. As the title glitched some more it finally started to form into words instead of numbers. This is when all the lights went out. Me and Jacob panicked and started freaking out. As soon as we tried to turn the lights on a terrifying realization occurred to me. The lights were broken, but I didn't mean just our house lights were broken. No, every light on Jacobs street was out. It only got worse, the stars and the moon vanished when we looked outside. I knew for a fact there were stars and a moon visible out there in the night sky before we even got on Snapchat earlier. That's when we noticed my phone was off too, in fact nothing electronically worked except Jacob's phone. I was shitting bricks at this point and was at a loss of what to do. You know the fear you have when something super bad is about to happen and you can just feel the dread of knowing there is nothing you can do? That's exactly what I was feeling but worse. When I looked at Jacob's phone, there was a new title. "D o/n o t/b r e a t h/t o o/l o u d." I felt my heart drop to my stomach reading this. I would like to say I said anything at all in response to this, but I didn't. I was too scared to make a sound. The title then started glitching, this time the text read something different,
"I T/C A N/H E A R /Y O U R/ H E A R T/ B E A T." That only made my heart beat race even worse. As I was about to say something, the phone made a very loud screeching noise. The only way to describe the noise is imagine the scream of a person with a inhumane terrifying scream.

Now imagine that scream as if it was glitchy and almost sounds like an entity trying it's hardest to copy a human's scream but failing miserably. Now imagine the scream is so loud your ears are bleeding, that's what this sounded like. I wasn't joking, my ears started bleeding at the loud screeching sound. I looked at the phone and read, "C A L M/D O W N." It read that all over the phone screen. I thought to myself, "how the fuck am I supposed to calm down?" Then just like that, the screeching stopped. Immediately Jacob grabbed me and pulled me into his closet and covered my mouth with his hand and told me to be quiet. I listened and realized there was something coming. I heard it, but nothing could prepare me for when it entered the room. It was tall, but it's jaw was unhinged to an impossible amount. It had pitch black eye sockets with blood shot eyes. The eyes, God I can't even think about them without almost puking. The worst part was the endless amounts of razor sharp teeth ready to tear into my flesh if I made one wrong move. My heart was racing so fast and I could barely contain my breathing. For some reason it didn't hear me like the phone said it would. It left the room very slowly closing the door so hard it almost broke. The whole time Jacob had his hand over my mouth to cover my breathing. As I was about to remove his hand and thank him I realized something was wrong, really wrong. Remember that screeching earlier? Well the whole time I was plugging my ears and closing my eyes making it impossible to hear nor see anything. I guess when all of that was going on I didn't realize Jacob went under his bed to hide. So seeing him crawl out from under his bed was a cold realization of the situation I am in.

I realized "Jacob's hand" felt colder and way longer than usual. Jacob's hand is not that boney either. I tried to scream or run but I guess it realized I knew as it pulled me in. It started to dig it's nails into me and tear my flesh open. It stripped my skin away strip by strip. I could feel it all but I couldn't scream or make a sound. All I could do was feel the intense pain and pray it will stop. Tears started to stream down my face the pain was so intense. I heard Jacob silently calling for me while looking for me. That's when Jacob made a horrible mistake of tripping over the chair that was in his room creating a loud thud. That's when I heard heavy footsteps coming towards Jacob's room. The footsteps started slow but got faster and faster with each step until it was too late. I don't know what was worse. The fact that the creature I was stuck in the closet with was still peeling my skin and tearing my flesh all while covering my mouth so tightly that I couldn't make a single sound, or seeing the thing pick up Jacob and tear his head off and grind his head into his mouth so the teeth mince every part of his head up. 

I can still see Jacob's lifeless face as he was beheaded when I close my eyes. I watched as my friend's headless corpse got torn to bits as if he was play dough and get eaten slowly while being torn apart myself one strip of skin at a time. After 2 minutes of this I pass out. I wake up in my bed the next morning to my mom telling me school has been canceled this week due to weather issues. I didn't even hesitate and asked her where Jacob is. Her response made my blood go cold, "Jacob, who is Jacob?" I wasn't dumb, I knew Jacob didn't exist anymore. I even confirmed it by checking his house. Not even his parents knew who I was nor who Jacob was. I checked Snapchat and as expected, no Jacob. Somehow Jacob disappeared off the face of the planet.

I went through the rest of the day quiet and unresponsive towards anyone. I wanted to cry but I was too much in shock the whole day to even make a single reaction towards anything. When it was time for bed I didn't sleep. It was 2 a.m. and I still wasn't tired, just scared out of my mind. That's when I realized the horror of my closet being slightly cracked when I know for a fact I closed it. It couldn't of been my cat cracking my closet door to get out as my door is closed and my mom took her to her room to sleep for the night. I didn't move, all I could do was sit in complete silence waiting for the same fate as Jacob. But, it never came. The next night the same thing happened but now I could see the thing looking at me. Only it's eye was visible. I stared at it the whole night, by the time 6 a.m. came around it went back into the closet. When my mom came in my room this morning to hang up my shirts she gasped and started yelling at me. The number 201515 was carved all over the walls in there. The creature was no where to be found. I am grounded for 2 months because of this but I don't care. Last night was worse, this time the closet was open enough I could see it's whole body. It held Jacob's head and used it like a puppet. I could see Jacobs rotting severed head cry and yell asking me why I didn't save him. His voice was so raspy and inhumane, I knew the creature was trying to imitate his voice. This morning I did nothing but come to terms that it is over.

It's currently 3 a.m. and the creature is getting closer, but now it's moving by the minute very slowly. I wanna call for help but no one can help me. I am writing this on my school computer as an attempt for survival. Maybe someone will help me, or maybe this is it. It's almost to me, it just moved again I don't know what to do. I think it is over for me, I love you mom and dad I am sorry I couldn't help you Jacob. I think I just realized what 201515 means, the 20th letter in the alphabet is "T" and the 15th letter in the alphabet is "O". It makes sense now, 201515.121205, "Too Late."
