*Day 5:*

*It’s been days since my mother and perfect sister left for my sister’s acting audition, but they still haven’t returned. It feels like the silence has swallowed me whole, every moment dragging on for an eternity.*

*I can’t help but feel alone in this house, as if the emptiness is seeping into me and it’s slowly destroying me. What kind of family goes off on a trip leaving one behind to suffer in solitude?*

*Dad’s been distant, avoiding eye contact with me and always keeping himself busy with work. He never really had time for me in the first place, but now it seems like he’s trying to avoid me altogether.*

*Last night, I heard him talking to someone outside, his voice strained and broken. It was as if he was arguing, though I couldn’t hear the other voice. The conversation ended as abruptly as it began, leaving me to feel uneasy for the rest of the night.*

*Something feels off, like we’re all sitting on the edge of a cliff and the slightest disturbance will send us all crashing down.*

*Day 6:*

*I don’t know what to do anymore—I’m so confused.*

*Dad has been acting even more distant than before, and I can’t help but feel like something’s going on that he’s not telling me. I tried to talk to him earlier, to ask about Mom and Maggie, but he just brushed me off.*

*It wasn’t until I found the letter that I even knew anything was wrong. It was written in Mom’s handwriting, but what it said was chilling.*

*She said that they weren’t actually leaving town for Maggie’s audition—that they were afraid Dad was becoming unstable and needed to get away for their safety.*

*My heart was pounding a million miles a minute, feeling as though my chest was collapsing in on itself. What did this mean? Had he hurt them?*

*Just then, Dad walked into the room, and for a moment, I was paralyzed with fear. I tried to confront him, to ask him why he’d been lying, but he exploded and lashed out at me, hitting me and telling me to mind my own business.*

*And then he came towards me.*

*I don’t remember much after that. There was blood everywhere, and I was screaming and begging for him to stop.*

*But he didn’t stop.*

*I’m so scared, and my mind is racing with what could be happening. I don’t know if I could handle what I’m coming to find out.*

*Day 7:*

*I wish this was all just some terrible dream, but it’s not. It’s all too real.*

*I found them. Mom and Maggie. Or at least, what was left of them. I can’t even put into words what I saw. The blood, the twisted limbs. They were discarded as if they were nothing, and my whole world feels like it’s crashing down around me.*

*And then I saw it. Dad’s journal. He detailed everything*—*how he killed them, how he buried their bodies, and how he was planning to kill me too.*

*I can’t believe it. The dad I thought I knew and loved was just a monster. My whole family is gone, and I’m here, alone with this monster who has lived among us, hidden behind a normal façade.*

*Oh God, I don’t know what to do.*

*Day 8:*

*I don’t know if anyone will ever read this, but if they do, know that my dad was the monster all along. I’m writing this from the closet, hiding after he found out I found the journal.*

*But he won’t find me. I’m not going down without a fight. It’s time to face the monster that has been hiding all my life.* 

*I know now why the silence seemed so loud in this house. It was because there was a grave secret hidden within these walls, hidden behind the cloaks of lies.*

*I’ll make him pay, one way or another. The world must know what kind of creature he is. I can’t let his true identity die with me.*

*I’m coming for him. He can try to hide all he likes, but the truth will eventually be revealed, and there will be no escape for him.*
