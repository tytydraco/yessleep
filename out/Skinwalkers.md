I always thought that the legends about skinwalkers were just that - legends. Tales to scare children around campfires, to keep them from wandering too far into the wilderness. But then I came face to face with one, and I realized that they were all too real.

It happened when I was out camping in the middle of nowhere, far away from civilization. I had always loved the wilderness, the feeling of being completely cut off from the world. But that night, something felt off. The air was thick and oppressive, and I could hear strange noises coming from the darkness.

At first, I tried to ignore it. I told myself that it was just my imagination, that I was being paranoid. But as the night wore on, the noises grew louder and more persistent. It sounded like something was scratching at the walls of my tent, trying to get in.

I tried to convince myself that it was just an animal, but I knew deep down that it was something far more sinister. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the scratching stopped. The air grew still and quiet, and I felt a sense of dread settle over me.

That's when I heard the whispering. It was a low, guttural sound, like nothing I had ever heard before. It was coming from just outside my tent, and it seemed to be growing louder and more insistent by the second.

I wanted to run, to flee into the safety of my car and drive far away from this place. But something held me back, some morbid curiosity that made me want to know what was out there.

And then it happened. The tent shook violently, as if something was trying to tear it apart from the outside. I could hear the fabric tearing, and I knew that I was in mortal danger.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The air grew still and quiet once again, and I was left sitting in my tent, alone with my thoughts.

I didn't sleep at all that night. I sat there, waiting for the sun to rise, listening to the whispers that seemed to echo in my head. And when the dawn finally broke, I knew that I had to get out of there.

I packed up my things and got in my car, driving as fast as I could away from that cursed place. And as I drove, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me, something that had latched onto me like a parasite.

I don't know if I'll ever go back to that wilderness again. The memory of that night still haunts me, and I know that there are things out there that we can't explain or understand. Skinwalkers are real, and they're not just legends. They're something far more terrifying, something that can shatter our understanding of the world around us. And I fear that they're still out there, waiting in the darkness for their next victim.
