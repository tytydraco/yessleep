The drive lasted for approximately 30 minutes, during which everyone stayed silent. Eventually, Claire decided to put on some music, but I couldn’t even tell you what it was.

 

After some time, we arrived at a diner. It wasn’t exactly in the middle of nowhere, but still pretty much isolated, just a place for people to eat while on the road. The four of us sat at a table in the back of the room. I wasn’t really in the best of mood, so I just ordered a Coke, and Lucy an iced tea, but the waiter explained that the tables were only for those who eat something. Mark and Claire said that they weren’t hungry, so Lucy took the lead and ordered a plate of nachos.

 

When we were served and safe from being interrupted, Mark finally addressed the issue.

 

“So, what’s been happening to you?” He asked me.

 

I did my best to explain everything that happened to me since we last saw each other, while avoiding to elaborate on the part that was linked to the events that occurred in my foster family. Telling Lucy about it had been a difficult thing to do and I wasn’t ready to get in the details of it again. Halfway through my explanations, my hands started shaking and it was getting harder to breathe, all the stress and the fear came back to me. I was having a hard time forming my phrases. Then, I felt a hand on my leg. Not a grip or a scratch, just a soft and small touch, and it all stopped, I felt safer. I looked at it, of course it was Lucy’s. I moved my eyes to her face. She looked at me with a concerned and hesitating expression. She nodded her head, asking me without talking if what she was doing was okay. I nodded back at her and grasped her hand strongly, like a rope preventing me from falling.

 

I finished explaining the rest of it. When I was done, Mark and Claire exchanged a concerned look.

 

“Well, I can’t tell you that we understand entirely what’s happening to you, but we do know some things that you mentioned.” Said Mark.

 

“I think we have no choice but to tell you about what happened to us before helping you, because there is a few things that you need to know first.” Continued Claire.

 

“We’re all open.” I said.

 

They then proceeded to tell me their story, and I couldn’t believe what they were telling me, all of it seemed so impossible. Here’s a summary of what they told us…

 

As I mentioned in my first post, it all began when Mark was hired to babysit Claire. The first night, Claire started acting very weird, in an aggressive and playful way and she ended up stabbing and biting Mark’s hand with an unbelievable strength for a 9-year-old. He then spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom while Claire was tormenting him from the other side of the room, and she talked to him about a story that only he was supposed to know and that he never told anyone about. That story was something that had happen when he was 11 on a school field trip to a nature reserve. He and a classmate named Martin were arguing besides a river that had a very strong flow and things took a bad turn when his classmate fell in the river and was immediately taken away.

 

11-year-old Mark panicked and never revealed to anyone that he was with him when he fell, feeling that without their argument, Martin would have been okay. As time passed, Martin was never found and the consequences of Mark revealing what happened were becoming bigger and bigger, but his guilt was growing too as he watched his family hoping to see him again and spending money on private investigator and slowly getting more and more desperate. He had been carrying that guilt ever since.

 

When the evening ended, he got back to his home completely baffled by what happened, and he slowly started to feel very different. When he woke up the next morning, he found that the bite from the night before was already healing very fast. He also started to feel new things when he began to smell the scent of the people around him and that his instinct was pushing him to “taste them”.

 

Later, he went back to babysit Claire, decided to understand what happened to him. That’s when he suddenly collapsed on the floor and that Claire gave him his first sip of blood from a blood bag and that it healed him in a second.

 

After that, Claire explained him what happened to her. Two years before, she had been bitten by some sort of evil entity while wandering alone in the museum where her mom worked. From there she started to have the same urges that Mark was discovering, and she also stopped aging, making her actually 11 years old now. Basically, they both were some sort of vampire-like creatures. The problem was that they kept being haunted by the same entity that transformed Claire and that seemed to be able to possess them. That’s what happened when Claire acted aggressively the first night, that wasn’t her. Apparently, while being possessed, they were thrown in a dark empty space where they sometimes stumbled upon different doors. That entity, that they discovered was named Vessel, was apparently praying on the guilt and misery of people who had some, turning them like this so that they would be consumed by their guilt for eternity.

 

So, both of them being conscious of their situation, they decided to leave and to go to the nature reserve from Mark’s memories, as apparently Vessel had let out hints that he might have survived, or that something more than drowning had happened to him.

 

This is a long story, so I’ll make it even simpler.

 

They ended up finding Martin, still alive after 9 years, locked in a man’s small house in the middle of the reserve. He seemed to have been used as a blood stock all these years by the man that lived there and that was the same kind of creatures that they were now. While at this man’s house, they had a pretty violent encounter with Vessel who took possession of the man. But Claire apparently succeeded to enter the dark place full of doors and to get Vessel out of the man’s body, momently neutralizing him.

 

They then saved Martin from his nightmare, and he got back after all these years, forgiving Mark and promising to never tell anyone about them.

 

Their last move had been to go back to Claire’s mom’s history museum, as, through their numerous interactions with him, they had reasons to believe that the key to get rid of him must have been there. They had to put a pretty hard fight but succeeded to beat him by apparently burning a book mentioning him, that was supposedly what allowed him to still exist.

 

They then decided to spend the rest of their eternity travelling the world, searching for a way to die, as none of them wished to stay alive forever.

 

Their story was way more detailed than that, but this is a summary. Apparently, he also posted it somewhere in here…

 

Their story seemed to be tied to mine strongly, just by the dark and empty space with doors that I had myself been in.

 

After they finished, we all stayed silent for a moment, processing. Lucy is the one who broke the silence.

 

“I’m sorry for asking, but, from what I understand, that realm of doors is something that only people like you two access, so, I mean, how is it that she’s been in it too?” She asked.

 

“Well, we don’t exactly have everything about that realm figured out, so I don’t really know, but this is intriguing. , and pretty worrying, especially the sort of beast/human that seems to be hunting you when you get there.” Said Mark.

 

“I have an idea, but, it might be dangerous, I can’t promise that this will solve anything…” Said Claire.

 

“What is it?” I immediately jumped on the opportunity.

 

“Well, it requires that you go back to that realm, but this time I’ll be coming with you. I developed that ability, and if I’m coming with you, maybe I can sort things out, or just understand things better.” She said.

 

I thought about it, but really, I already knew my answer.

 

“I’m in.” I said.

 

“Do you think you can do it now?” Asked Mark.

 

Claire smiled at him.

 

“Yes Mark, I practiced a bit while you were out trying to hit on girls in bars…” She answered.

 

“You practiced? Why haven’t you tell me about this?” He said.

 

“I mean, have you seen the state you’re in when you come back? We’re not supposed to be affected by alcohol at all, so the fact that you’re even a little bit nauseous is very worrying.” Claire said.

 

“Yeah right…” Mark was surrendering.

 

“So, how does this work?” I asked.

 

“Well, I’m gonna need you to give me your hands, and I’ll be taking us there. You shouldn’t be under any possession because I’m the one dragging you in, so it should be okay, but, as Mark said, we don’t understand everything yet, so, just in case, Mark will be protecting Lucy if you snap.” Claire was speaking with a lot of confidence, which was pretty reassuring.

 

“I mean, if Mark can help you on something else, I can protect myself you know.” Said Lucy.

 

“Sorry Lucy, but I’m not so sure.” Said Mark.

 

“Well, why?” Asked Lucy, confused.

 

“The blood coming from the bite on your arm that you’re trying to hide, it smells good.” Answered Claire.

 

I didn’t get the chance to talk to her about it since I noticed that she was hiding it earlier.

 

“I saw it back at Mulberry, I’m so sorry Lucy…” I apologized.

 

“It’s okay Sarah, I know it wasn’t you. But now that we’re on the topic, two questions very fast: should I be worried about becoming like you two now, and also, should I be scared that one of you is going to snap because of it?” She was letting out what she was probably wondering for a moment now.

 

“Well, first, you don’t seem to be experiencing anything that we’ve been through, and as far as we know, even with all the weird things that she’s experiencing, Sarah is not like us either, so I think you’re good. Second, we just drank a blood bag each so we’re not thirsty right now, but still, if you could cover it with some bandages or something, it would be very appreciated.” Mark was speaking calmly, I could feel that him and Claire took the situation very seriously, and it was scary, sure, but also comforting.

 

Lucy took out some of the bandages she packed and covered her wound. Claire tied up her hair for some reason that I didn’t get and placed herself right in front of me. She gave me her hands and I grabbed them.

 

“Now, we close our eyes.” She said.

 

“Claire.” Lucy said. “Huh, be careful, you two, okay?” She looked very worried.

 

“Don’t worry.” Claire closed her eyes, and I followed her.

 

I took a deep breath. I was trying to relax, thinking to myself that I had to go in, but it felt hard. I was trying to focus harder when I heard Claire.

 

“Sarah? You can open your eyes, we got there.” She said.

 

I looked around me. We were back to my memory, at the beginning of it. The hallway of the house, the other adopted kids walking around, the basement door open. Claire looked around as I immediately grabbed my camera to watch everything through the lens.

 

“Now that’s weird… Where are we? It’s supposed to be dark and empty, what’s this?” She asked.

 

I hesitated. I willingly adapted what I told them because I didn’t wanted to tell them everything about this, but right now, I had no choice.

 

“It’s a memory, from when I was 14…” I said.

 

“Has this happened the other times you’ve been here?” She asked

 

“Yes, it’s always starting in the house…”

 

“Why didn’t you tell us about this Sarah?” She was a bit confused.

 

“Just watch what happens, you’ll understand.” I said.

 

A few seconds later, as expected, the voice resonated from the basement.

 

“*Sarah, follow me, daddy needs your help. Come on, I need you, come down here*.”

 

This time, I didn’t move, I stayed there. In two days I already had to face that memory again 2 times, I just couldn’t. And another thing came to me: whatever it was that was hunting me there had use this memory and twisted it before to bite me through the image of my foster dad and all the other kids, but if I didn’t go down in that basement, he would probably not be able to use it, and maybe it would buy us some time or something.

 

Suddenly, coming out of where I was standing, I appeared. 14-year-old me, walking towards the stairs to the basement.

 

“Is that you?” Asked Claire.

 

I nodded.

 

“Follow her if you want to understand.” I said.

 

Claire slowly followed young me and got down in the basement. I stood there the whole time, waiting. From what I was hearing, or should I say, wasn’t hearing, my theory was correct, without my current self going there, the memory was unfolding just the way it happened, meaning we still hadn’t caught the thing’s attention. After some time, Claire got back. From her eyes were flooding tears. She slowly approached me. When she was close to me, she could only mumble a few words.

 

“I’m sorry Sarah.”

 

I looked at her and suddenly remembered her young age.

 

“I’m sorry you had to see it.” I answered.

 

So much emotions in a small amount of times was a bit confusing for her I think, because she was a bit lost, but she eventually got back on her feet and I realized how strong she was.

 

“Come on follow me.” She said, walking towards the front door.

 

We went through and were in the dark space again. We wandered around for a bit.

 

“It’s weird that we didn’t see the man you told us about yet, or the thing that’s hunting you…” She said.

 

Eventually we found two doors close from each other. I knew the first one, it was the wooden door covered in scratch in which the man pushed me earlier that got me back to myself in the bus. The second one was smaller, but in better condition, it was like it had just been renovated. It looked like a door you’ll find in a rich people’s house.

 

“What are those?” I asked.

 

“That’s our doors, yours, and mine. I made sure that they were close from each other.”

 

“What do you mean our doors?”

 

“As far as I understanded for now, your door is the safest and more efficient way to get in and out of here.”

 

“So, mine is the one covered in scratch? I saw it before.” I asked.

 

“That’s right.” Claire answered.

 

“And who’s doors are these one?” I pointed two other doors that had appeared not far from us while we were talking.

 

She looked at them and smiled.

 

“The thick metallic one is Mark’s. As for the one in glass, I never saw it, but I can feel that it’s Lucy’s.” She said.

 

“Why are these here?” I asked her.

 

“Because they’re worried for us. A part of Mark’s mind instinctively latched itself to the two of us when we went here. For Lucy however…”

 

“What?”

 

“Well, Mark having a door that manifest itself here is not shocking, he’s transformed, we have a natural connection to this place, but for Lucy to manifest a door here, let’s just say that if I were you, I would be flattered.”

 

We kept on walking for a few seconds when we finally heard it. In the distance, a scream, an enraged scream. Claire instinctively pushed me behind her and started to look all around us. We couldn’t see it, but now we knew it was here and it was coming. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and he was back, the unknown man.

 

“There you are, are you okay?” He asked.

 

Claire turned and looked at him in disbelief.

 

“You? What are you doing here?” She asked him.

 

“Who is he?” I immediately asked.

 

“That’s the man from the reserve. The one that had took Martin, the boy who went missing.” She said.

 

“Look, I don’t know why, but you remember when you got in here and chased Vessel out of me?” He said to Claire. “Well, I never got back to my body, I’m stuck here since. I can’t find my door anymore.”

 

“What?” Claire was clearly confused.

 

“At first, I was alone in here. But not long after, he came back here.”

 

“Who came back? Do you know who’s that thing?” Claire was keeping her distance with the man.

 

“I wasn’t sure at first, but now I’m convinced it’s him… It’s Vessel.”

 

“What? That’s not possible, Mark and I, we, we erased him, he’s gone. Plus, I know him, that’s not his style, chasing people like an animal, screaming, he plays with his victims, I don’t know how to say it, but he’s witty.” Claire was talking to herself as much as she was answering to the man.

 

“I know, I had a lot of time to analyze him, he’s changed, you didn’t erase him but you certainly made him weak, but way more aggressive and dangerous. He’s not as smart and playful as before, it’s like he lost his somewhat human part.”

 

Claire was thinking.  
  
“What about me? Why am I involved?” I asked. I needed to know.

 

“I think he’s looking to possess someone to get out of this place through someone else, and, my door is nowhere to be seen, so he started to look for someone else and you were the most connected to this place he could find, so he kept dragging you here.” He explained me this as we heard more screams getting closer.

 

“How am I connected to this place? I’m nothing like you two, nobody bit me!” I was stressing out.

 

The man had a weird look.

 

“You’re connected to this place because you’re my daughter… You’re half like me.”

 

I had no words. That was the last answer I expected to hear. I was going to ask him more when Claire started talking again.

 

“Okay, he’s getting closer, we need to move fast. Last time Mark and I really got to him by finding a little kid in here. He was crying, said his name was Vessel. If we can find him again, we could at least disturb him enough as to make him even weaker. I think that was his “human” part, we need to find him.”

 

“Kid, I’ve been here for days, and I didn’t see anything like that.” The man said.

 

“What, but he…” She stopped. “Of course… He lost his human part, he got rid of it. That’s why he’s so beast-like. That’s a big problem.” Claire looked more worried than ever.

 

The screams were getting closer and closer. I turned my head and saw a door that wasn’t there before. It was white, with a few stickers of stars and other stuff, but the most unusual thing about it was that the lock was completely smashed and broken and that the door was slightly open.

 

“Claire what’s this one?” I said, pointing the door.

 

“I saw this door a few times, it disappears the second I get closer to it.” Said the man.

 

Claire took a few seconds to look at it.

 

“Sarah, you said that what you shot with your camera here is saved in your camera and can be watched after?” She asked.

 

“Yes”

 

“I have an idea, but I need you to give me your camera for it.” Claire looked at me. “I’ll take care of it, I promise.”

 

I gave it to her. She took a deep breath and started to walk calmly towards the door. She slowly opened it more. There was nothing but more darkness on the other side of it. Claire took a picture of the inside of the door and got back to us immediately. She gave me back my camera.

 

“He’s coming, you can’t stay here longer, you need to leave!” The man shouted.

 

In the distance he appeared. Sharp teeth, long thin arms, pointy fingers, claws, horrible smile. His terrifying figure was now moving faster and approaching us. He finally articulated some words.

 

“Little lady… There you are…” He screamed, his voice sounded like how a raven would speak.

 

Claire looked terrified and started shaking.

 

“Shouldn’t we get back to the door?! Claire!” I panicked.

 

“I… can’t..move…” She whispered, her eyes filled with tears.

 

The thing was getting way too close, he was going to get us if we didn’t move.

 

“COME ON, MOVE!” The man shouted.

 

Claire had guided us all this time and she already did so much, I knew I had to help her. I immediately grabbed her and carried her on my back. I ran to our doors. Claire found the strength to open hers and to step through it and I got through mine just after giving one last look to the man that just told me he was my father as he was himself running away.

 

When we got back to the diner, I found myself leaned in Lucy’s arms and saw that Claire was in Mark’s, in tears. We apparently both started to shake violently halfway through and Claire started to have some marks of hits all over her body. We took some time to get back to ourselves and then explained that happened to Mark and Lucy, except the revelation that the man had gave us. Both were terribly worried, but Mark especially to hear about the seeming return of this Vessel, whatever were their previous interactions with him, he did marked them pretty bad.

 

When we finished, Claire asked for my camera. She wanted to look for the picture she took of the inside of the damaged door.

 

“Yesss!” She whispered.

 

She turned the screen to show us what she had shot. We could see a little kid, not older than 12, in gray clothes that looked right at the camera, like he saw it.

 

“Is that the child you found when you and Mark fought that Vessel?” I asked.

 

“No, but I think that it’s where he’s hiding. Whoever he is, that kid had his door forced and now it’s still broken but, as the man told us, it tends to disappear, because I think that the human part of Vessel that took refuge in that kid is scared that the evil and chaotic part of himself gets back to him.” She said.

 

“Wait a second…” Lucy said. “I know that kid, it’s Nicolas.”

 

“What? Where do you know him from?” Said Mark.

 

“Well, these last few days, I had an internship in a psychiatric center for children, for my studies. And Nicolas got in during my time there, it wasn’t a long time ago. I think he was there because of a drastic change in his behavior or something but I didn’t work much with him. But, I mean, wouldn’t that explain why these changes happened?”

 

“Well, yes, surely it would.” Said Mark.

 

“Is there any way we can talk to him? I think he has the key to solving this in him, we need to be able to talk to the human part of Vessel.” Asked Claire.

 

Lucy took a moment to think about it.

 

“Not you two. I can still get a moment to talk with him, as I still am allowed to visit the patients of the center because of my studies, and I could make Sarah pass as my classmate but, you two, not only Claire isn’t believable as a student, but it’s too risky to have you come back home.”

 

We kept on talking, and we made up a plan. The four of us will drive to the center, Mark and Claire will stay in the car as me and Lucy will go find Nicolas to see if he can be of any help. Mark and Claire were ready to go now, but we had to remember them that Lucy and I needed to sleep, which apparently, they don’t have to do anymore. We decided that we’ll all spend the night in the car and leave in the morning.

 

Before going to sleep, I took a moment outside of the car, just to think. I was still processing everything that I learned today. Eventually, Mark got out too.

 

“So… You found yourself someone?” He said.

 

“What?”

 

“Lucy, she’s nice. You’re cute together.” He smiled at me.

 

I felt my whole face turn red.

 

“Well, nothing is official yet so…” I answered.

 

“Isn’t it?” He said, with a laugh.

 

“What about you?” I asked.

 

“Well, I haven’t really thought about that lately.”

 

“Claire seemed to say you were actively looking for someone.” I said.

 

“God, that’s not the same thing… But, who knows, maybe I have a soulmate somewhere… We’ll see.”

 

On that note, I got back in the car and leaned besides Lucy. She was warm, it felt good.

 

I’m writing this in the middle of the night as I’m unable to find some sleep… I’ll keep everyone updated of how it goes tomorrow.
