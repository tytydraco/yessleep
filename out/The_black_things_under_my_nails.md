Are you in for a long one? Good, because I need your help. Seriously.

This started about a week ago, my index fingernail felt a bit sore and I noticed a small splinter under it. Nothing weird about that, probably happened when I was setting up that darn Ikea bookshelf, the splinter will come out eventually and I thought no more about it. 

The next day, I woke up as usual but felt that my fingernail was even sorer. Not strange at all, the splinter is probably being pushed out of my body. I went to the fridge to start to make some breakfast and grabbed an orange juice bottle and noticed the splinter, it was black. Pure black. Okay, this is now a bit weird, nothing I have at home is black, no black painted wood, no black plastic or anything. Is it just dirt from outside then? I didn't think twice about it and the rest of the day went on as normal.

I wake up to the rain pouring outside, still a bit dark for my taste to get up. My finger still feels sore so I decided to turn on the light by my nightstand and check on it and well, it has spread, kinda? More black splinters have appeared. They look like sharp little needles, very thin and in a straight line. I shrug it off and imagine it's just some dirt. It's my typical ”luck” of getting it twice, under the same nail. I go to the bathroom to get my tweezers and see if I can pull them out, but they are just out of my reach. The day goes by slowly as all I can think about is pulling the splinters out.

It's in the middle of the night. I ”flew” up and felt sweaty, alarmed, and weak, just like how an absurdly high fever feels like. Or a nightmare. Dizzy and sleepy I drag my feet to the bathroom to take some painkillers. As I turn on the annoyingly bright lights in the bathroom I glance at my hand and I can't believe what I see.

The rest of my fingernails now also have black splinters, all on the same hand, under every single nail. ”What the f” is my first thought. Am I hallucinating from a fever? I notice that one of the first splinters I got is probably ready to be pulled out. 

With shaky hands, I grab the tweezers and start pulling and pulling and pulling. The black splinter just expands, like a thread, or more like slime? Maybe like both. I feel like throwing up, and I did, with the black string still dangling from my fingernail. I collect myself and grab a scissor to cut it off.  

It screams. It, screams. And it’s tough and rubbery, and the scissor isn't sharp enough. It still screams. In total shock I stop and just stand there and look at it, it starts to twist and turn like a worm. In utter fear and disgust, I run to the kitchen and grab the sharpest kitchen knife I have to slice it off, the scream gets louder as I lower the knife against it. And then I feel it.

Under my other fingernails the ”black splinters” starts to move and I feel an unimaginable sharp pain that nearly makes me faint and I drop the knife. The adrenaline rush makes me stand up again and I grab the knife again but right before I try to cut it I hear tiny whispers from under my fingernails from the other ”black splinters”, or is it whispers? They sound like made-up whispers you do when you pretend to whisper. 

I lower the knife again and the ”whispers” stop, I feel how they are about to move again to hurt me so I put the knife down and it's like they freeze in place. 

The black string went silent and I feel it slowly withdrawing or rather, slithering back under my fingernail. The most uncomfortable feeling I have ever known. I just stand there and look at my hand in disbelief at what just happened. They are all still there, the black splinters. They don't move now or make any type of noise.

Over the next few days, they spread to my other hand, 3 of them are under my right hand's thumbnail. I’m obviously terrified of going to any doctor and Google has been of no help.

What the hell am I supposed to do now?
