My boyfriend works late hours and when I know he's on his way to my house, I'll sit and wait for him in the kitchen to greet him. The main door is infront of me while the back porch one is behind me, he tends to come through that one so my dog dosent bark.
He called me a few minutes ago and said he just left work and he's on his way, so I did my normal and sat at the kitchen table scrolling on my phone until I got the "im outside" text.

After a few minutes of scrolling, I heard his voice. The only light outside of my house was the porch light so I look out of the kitchen window and nobody's there.

"Baby, come outside."

Normally his voice is reassuring and welcoming, but I had a terrible feeling and decided to call his cell phone. 
His phone is a track phone that he buys service for, so sometimes it simply rings twice which is what it did. Everytime I called.

Eventually I gave up and stepped into the back porch to look outside, maybe his phone died and he needed me to unlock the door for him. I could feel my heart drop when I remembered the door was unlocked. I start to text him asking him to answer his phone, but while I'm doing this the voice turns from a gentle tone to an angry one. It yelled my full name and told me to come outside.

My boyfriend never calls me by my full name, and at this point I'm starting to feel scared. I looked outside and it now knows that I'm not in the kitchen and that I looked out of the back porch window. I call him again.

After what felt like hours he answered in a concerned way, apologizing because his phone was on vibrate as well as it not working.

"Why are you telling me to come outside?"

Those were the first words I said, there was an immediate silence over the line.

"What do you mean? I'm just now on your road."

He sounded worried but I could tell he thought I was pranking him, the voice was getting angrier by the second. It cussed at me and eventually started banging on the door. It was so loud that even my boyfriend could hear it through the phone.

I heard the car speed up, then the sound of gravel from him pulling into my driveway. I finally mustered up the courage to move the curtain and see if there was really anyone there.

There was nothing there but I could see him running up the stairs to get to me. 

Once he got in the voice and the banging came to a complete stop. I stood shaken while he looked around my yard only to see a deer running away on its hind legs, just for the front two to hit the ground infront of it as it went into the nearby woods.

We didn't sleep much that night, and eventually we plan on moving somewhere that's closer to the city as my house is out of the way from any other people.
