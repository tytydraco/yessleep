Hi, I'm jack, growing up, "Super Mario Bros. 3" was always my favourite game. The joy of seeing Mario fly with the Tanuki Suit was unparalleled. I had the original NES cartridge and, later, emulated versions to play on my PC. One day, nostalgia hit me hard, and I decided to dive back into the Mushroom Kingdom. Little did I know, this decision would lead me into a nightmare I could never have imagined.

It started innocently enough. I was browsing an old gaming forum when I came across a post titled "Super Mario Bros. 3 – Rare ROM Hack." The poster claimed this version had enhanced graphics, new levels, and a surprise. Curious and a bit sceptical, I downloaded the ROM file named "Tanuki.exe" and loaded it into my emulator.

The game booted up as usual with the iconic Nintendo logo and the cheerful "Super Mario Bros. 3" title screen. Everything seemed normal until I reached the first level. The graphics were sharper, and the colours more vibrant. I was impressed. But then, I noticed something odd. The Tanuki Leaf, which usually appears in later levels, was floating right at the beginning of Level 1.

Eager to take to the skies, I grabbed the leaf. As Mario donned the Tanuki Suit, the screen flickered for a moment. I thought it was just a glitch, but then I heard it – a faint, distorted whispering. I couldn't make out the words, but it sent a chill down my spine.

Ignoring the whispers, I continued playing. Mario felt different in the Tanuki Suit – heavier, slower. The cheerful background music started to distort, becoming eerie and dissonant. The once vibrant world of Mario seemed darker, with the colours becoming muted and shadows stretching unnaturally.

As I progressed through the levels, the whispering grew louder. It was no longer a faint murmur but a cacophony of voices, all speaking at once in a language I couldn't understand. The in-game enemies began to behave strangely, moving erratically and sometimes freezing in place, their eyes following Mario's every move.

By the time I reached the first boss battle, I was on edge. The Koopaling I was supposed to fight was missing. Instead, there was a shadowy figure standing in the middle of the room. It resembled Mario but twisted and malevolent, with glowing red eyes and a sinister smile.

The whispers turned into screams as the shadowy figure lunged at Mario. I fought back, desperately trying to defeat this dark doppelganger. After what felt like an eternity, I managed to land the final blow. The screen went black, and a single line of text appeared:

"YOU CANNOT ESCAPE."

The game restarted, but this time, the title screen was different. Mario was gone, replaced by the shadowy figure. The text read "Tanuki.exe." I tried to quit the game, but my computer froze. The whispers returned, this time emanating from my speakers. I yanked the power cord from my PC, plunging my room into silence.

I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. That night, I had horrible nightmares of being chased by the shadowy Mario, the whispers never ceasing. When I woke up, my computer was on, the game loaded to the same dark title screen.

I deleted the ROM file, but the damage was done. The whispers never truly left me. I can still hear them sometimes, just at the edge of my hearing, a constant reminder of the nightmare that was Tanuki.exe. If you ever come across that file, I beg you – for your own sanity – do not play it. Some games are meant to stay buried, their secrets never to be uncovered.
