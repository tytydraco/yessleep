But then I woke up one morning to find the feeling mysteriously dissolved away. And much to my astonishment I did not feel relieved like I assumed I would. After many years of feeling the eyes of unknown terror follow me everywhere I went. Just beyond the reaches of my perception it watched, and one day I just came to accept the facts. I was either completely insane or this thing was just intent on watching me . Absolutely nothing I could do about it. 

So I honestly just went about my life, pretending the feeling wasn’t there. But always in private acknowledging the presence, it was almost like we became friends. Maybe in a one sided way, I was really the only person talking. But it was enough to feel the void that came when this presence suddenly just vanished. 

So in a quiet but sorrowful manner I prepared for my day like all other days. It wasn’t just the presence was gone though, everything felt silent. It really reflected how I felt inside, for the first time in my life I was truly alone. Somehow it was more burdensome then the feeling of always being watched. 

“Oh what ever you are entity from another world, ghost or some other supernatural being. Please won’t you come back, I can’t do this without you!” I pleaded to my otherworldly observer. 

But no, the feeling inside my stomach, the chill in my heart remained void. So I just continued with my day. Made a disgraceful breakfast of burnt toast and barely scrambled eggs. And somehow the worst coffee I ever attempted to sip on a morning like this. Put on my clothes half hazardously until I was presentable to leave my apartment. I honestly, sadly had no one but the entity; no one could possibly understand what this was. They would never understand, nor appreciate my appreciation for the one who looked upon me. Even when my parents neglected to go to my talent shows, I knew he was watching. And maybe, just maybe he was proud of me for everything I accomplished. 

I grab my keys and leave my apartment, weirdly quiet today. Even when I emerged outside, there was not a single vehicle on sight. Which was strange, this is usually a busy street. Must be some holiday that I didn’t know about, very peculiar. 

As I drove around my town, there was no businesses open at all, even for a holiday that was strange. Cars littered everywhere too, why the hell would so many people leave their cars out on the road like this. Must be a bunch of degenerates .  

But then I heard a loud crack like thunder, it wasn’t even supposed to rain today, stupid weather app. But to my surprise it was not in fact rain, no. A giant red eye with a black pupil covered the sky. It seemed to look right at me, and a sense of relief flooded me. It was him, it was my entity, he came back for me. 

“Hi my child, I have emptied the world. There is no more people. I was a watcher sent to see if humanity was fit for survival. I have deemed it not. But I could not bring myself to kill my favorite human; farewell I must depart now, here and forever.” He said tome in telepathy, in monotone. 

“Wait please don’t leave me!” But just like that he was gone.
