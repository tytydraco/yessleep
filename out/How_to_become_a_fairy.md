During early 2000's, popularity of a Italian show Winx Club was rising all around the world. The show about girls that can turn into fairies, saving the magical world was appealing to young girls. Merchandise with Winx characters were selling like hot cakes, and girls all over the globe idolized main characters of the show. But sometimes, just watching the show wasn't enough, some girls wanted to become fairies themselves. 

In Russia, the show was quite popular, maybe even more popular than in other places. And during 2013-14 years approximately, different instructions on how to become a fairy were uploaded to the internet onto different forums.  Instructions were strange step by step guides on what to do to become an actual fairy just like in Winx Club. But if you think these instructions were harmless and safe to perform, you'd be wrong in most cases. Instructions were strange, sometimes even gross. Some were innocent enough, but some were very risky and very strange. For example, one instruction told reader to write a letter about your wish to become a fairy, and consume it. Other example is rubbing wax all over your chest, liquid wax to be exact. In order to become the fairy of earth, you had to cover your body in dirt and compost. Some instructions asked the reader to hurt themselves, either by jumping off a tall structure, self harming themselves, or touching fire in order to get immunity to it.

Of course, these instructions could have been made by people who wanted to prank innocent girls into doing ridiculous things, just so they can become magical fairies. But everything changed, once one particular instruction appeared on the web. The instruction was a step by step guide to becoming a fairy of fire. What follows are steps of the instructions. What you are about to read, was real.

At night, when everyone will go to sleep, get up and walk around your room 3 times total. After that, you must say magical words "The kingdom of Alfea, dear fairies, give me your strength, i beg of you". Then, quietly sneak into the kitchen without being seen, or else the magic of words will be gone. Turn on your gas stove all the way, but do not light it, you wouldn't want to get burned. Afterwards, you have to go back to sleep, and while you sleep, magical gas coming from the stove will sloaly turn you into a fairy. And once you wake up, say these things "Thank you Alfea, i've become a fairy". And you'll become the real fairy of fire.

This particular instruction caused actual house fires and deaths. Many instructions like these were supposedly made, each more stranger and scarier than others, but some of them got lost to time and some can be considered lost media. There was an instruction of how to become a fairy of earth, where you had to go deep into the woods and spend a night there to get close with nature. Another instruction supposedly asked to jump off a 10 story building, so you can concentrate your hidden power and learn how to fly. Some of these instructions caused actual harm to naive children.

Today, you won't be able to find these instructions these days, cause show lost popularity and girls that watched it grew up. It's unknown what kind of intentions creators of these instructions had. Even if these were made as a joke.. why would they want girls to risk their own lives for the sake of making their dreams come true?
