Through the glass paned door, my captor watched me, fixing her eyes on each nervous breath I took. The tasks she assigned were developed specifically for me, designed in such a way to make me live my personal hell on a daily a basis. Each task had no real meaning, making them nothing more than a superfluous sacrifice of my body, mind, and ego. My captor, with her gaze weighing heavily on my weakened bones waited for mistakes to be made. Her meticulosity made even the easiest tasks seem impossible. I was set up to fail, and when I did, she grew stronger as she fed from the shallow bucket that used to contain my soul.  


She opened her door, her path leading to my desk. I must have made a mistake. She could see it in my face. I gripped my pen until my fingertips looked like sated mosquitos ready to pop, the pen digging deeply into the paper nearly causing it to rip.  


“Tanner,” she said to me in my final moment, the very moment before destruction, “Are you almost done filling out your strategy sheet?”  


“Yep, just wrapping up. These strat sheets were a fantastic idea, Jess. It’s definitely going to help bring in more clients.” I could taste the piss roll off my tongue as I fed her the typical bullshit to keep her happy and off my ass.  


I was at work. Jess, was my boss.  


Perhaps my opening statement was slightly overdramatic, but every day that I checked myself into prison (the office) and sat in my cell (my cubical) I felt like I was on death row suffering the slowest and most agonizing death. Those strat sheets were the bane of my meaningless existence. Every Monday morning, I had to go in early to fill out the made up strat sheet so the team could discuss how to bring in new clients. Everyone asked the same questions, gave the same answers, and ate two hours of each other’s time, leaving us no time to get real work done. And at the end of the day, when the real work wasn’t completed, our asses would get chewed. It was a vicious cycle of misery.   


Life had completely lost all meaning. I slogged through everyday feeling like a tortured farm animal, my worth being attached to a number on a spreadsheet that some jack ass at corporate, who I would never see, could judge me and crush my livelihood in the palm of his sweaty soft hands in a moment’s notice. Like a farm animal, they would keep me healthy by paying for my coveted health insurance so I could get back to work in a timely manner after I suffered an inevitable heart attack from eating the massive amounts of stress fed to me by the corporate abuse. Judging by the burning sensation growing in my chest, that heart attack is at the end of a short and narrow tunnel.  


I wasn’t like the other people in the office. The highlight of their day was waking up to the sound of an anxiety producing alarm, white-knuckling their way through traffic, working all day, then getting home and going to bed early so they could do it all over again for the next forty years. I loathed it. Repeating the same, monotonous day every time I opened my eyes made me wonder if that inevitable heart attack had already happened and I had truly gone to hell.   


I had a dream, and that dream is what made selling my brain to the toxic sinkhole of corporate America so miserable. I wanted to be a screenwriter. I had a good go at it in my early twenties, wrote some indie films that were well received, made some good connections in the industry, but when I hit the age where all dreams die, twenty-six, I needed health insurance. Trading my dreams for health insurance to work at a place that would inevitably kill me—what an oxymoron.   


Each day while I was at work, all I could think about was getting home to write my next screenplay. I would take frequent ‘bathroom breaks’ where I would sit on the toilet, pants pulled up, just to get a little alone time where I could read articles on how improve my craft. Screenwriting was my passion and every time I had to leave the comfort of the bathroom and return to my office chair, it felt like a vital organ had been torn from my body. Even more painful was getting home and being far too tired to lay down a single word on the page after ritualistically sacrificing my brain power to the corporate deities.   


 Fifteen minutes before noon, Brock tapped me on the shoulder.  


“Hey dickhead,” Brock said. “Want to get out of here and gorge?”  


“I’d eat the dead racoon that’s been rotting outside of the building if it meant getting out of here” I said.  


Brock was an ally. Together, we joked about our crippling depression, shared our hatred towards our jobs, insulted each other in good fun, and found comfort in knowing that we weren’t alone. We were each other’s verbal punching bags, destined to work side-by-side and face the trials and tribulations as a unit. Our lunches together served as impromptu therapy sessions to let out some steam, find my Zen, and ensure nobody at the office got injured during the final stretch of the day.  


Brock and I stood up and walked out the door exactly four minutes apart, careful not to get detected by the self-overworked ghouls who took great pride in working through lunch and continuing their grind after hours. When we met in the parking lot, the words began to fly.  


“I can’t stand this place anymore. I mean come one—those strat sheet? What the hell is that?” Brock said.  


“I know, man. It’s awful.”  


“I mean seriously—how much time can we possibly waste? And let’s not forget about the team dinner this weekend.”  


The team dinner. I had completely forgotten about it. Nothing infuriated me more than being required to spend my time with those people more than I needed to. That was my time. My precious time. A whole evening of clenching my teeth, pretending they were my friends when I could have been spending the few hours of free time I’m allotted to be with the ones I love. I’d rather die.  


We continued talking about the tragedy of the upcoming dinner on the way to the Chinese Buffet, cleverly called, ‘Chinese Buffet.’ The people in the office criticized us for eating there claiming it wasn’t an ‘executive’ place to eat, but for $15.99, all you could eat, and wicked heartburn, it became Brock’s and my favorite cuisine. There was no better way to spend the latter half of the workday than being cross-eyed, going in and out of consciousness from a stomach pumped full of MSG and fried carbs.  
The buffet was as majestic as ever. The red wallpaper accented with gold trim, the dusty Chinese paper lamps suspended from the ceiling, the other patrons too shameful to look at one another in the eye during their glutenous expedition of finding the quickest way to shove massive quantities of food-like-substance down their gullets. I was happy to be part of the circus.   


Brock and I spent the first ten minutes at the table in silence sans the grunts and heavy breathing from cramming as much food down as possible before our brains told us to put the forks down. He devoured his first plate, but I had only gotten through a third of mine.  


“You feeling alright?” Brock asked.  


“I don’t know, I think I’m just tired.”  


“You sleep alright?”  


“As good as I usually do, but I’m not talking about that kind of tired. I’m just tired of everything. Tired of this job. Tired of working my ass off and having no time to enjoy myself. This job is causing me physical pain.”  


“You’re talking to me as if I don’t already know.” Although Brock understood how awful the job was, he was the kind of guy, like most people, that was willing to grit his teeth and put up with it on a daily basis until he retired or died. He would spend the weekends drinking his troubles away and sober up on Sunday so he could do it all over again. I didn’t have it in me. I needed more out of life.  


“I know you know, but you have something I don’t that gets you out of bed every morning and into the office without wanting to drive off a bridge every morning.”  


“That’s pretty dark.”  


“Tell me about it. Every morning I open my eyes, my chest pains begin and I feel like I’m dying or something. Then every minute after that is filled with an insane amount of anxiety and dread just thinking that this will be the rest of my life. Work, sleep, die. That’s not a life, Brock.”  


“You forgot about shit. Gotta make time to shit.”  


“Funny…”  


“Why don’t you just quit?”  


“Because of health insurance. Student loans. Minor things like eating. I work my ass off all week and can barely afford groceries as it is. I’m stuck in this torturous doom cycle.”  


“You know, my younger brother was saying the same kind of mopey, depressing shit awhile back. We legitimately thought he was going to off himself, but he started taking this new medication and it seems like he’s thriving. It’s still in clinical trials or whatever so they’re actually paying people to be their lab rats. Maybe you should look into it. If not for yourself, do it for me so I don’t have to keep hearing you bitch.”  


The thought of turning to a circular mold of synthetic, brain altering chemicals was off putting, but I was becoming desperate. Exercise wasn’t working, the breathing routines and meditations were a complete joke. Nothing any therapist or work counselor suggested had helped. All of the suggestions were nothing more than thin branches that slowed my fall, but never stopped it, through this mangled tree of depression. If taking a pill was going to be the solution to getting my mind right, at least to start, then it was worth a shot.  


“Alright,” I said. “If you don’t mind, text your brother for me and get the info. I’m willing to look into it and at least hear what they have to say.”  


Brock took out his phone to text his brother, smearing sweet and sour sauce all over his screen. He had cream cheese from the Rangoon’s caked on the sides of his mouth. I could deal with the unpleasant sight, but when he breathed, trying to suck in oxygen around the maximum amount of food his mouth would allow, ruined what little appetite I had left.  


“Sent.” Brock said. “You know, I can see it all over your face. You shouldn’t be ashamed of taking medicine for your brain. You’re head is unwell and there is nothing wrong with that. Would you scoff at taking insulin if you were diabetic?”  


“No, I’m just worried that I won’t be myself after taking it, worried I’ll be different.”  


“Nah, you’ll be fine. My brother was a complete dick before getting on that medicine and he still is a total dick. Only difference is that he’s not bummed out all the time. Quite the opposite, actually.”  


I slumped over my food imagining what life would be like free of the disparaging thoughts sucking the color out of my days. It had gotten to the point where I was worrying about myself which made Emma worry about me. Emma and I met in college, the most carefree times of our lives, the world having yet to place its unbearable weight on our (my) weak shoulders. We were of the lucky ones whose relationship was stronger than the temptations the college life would dish out to test young couples. We made it.   


After college, Emma thrived in the corporate world. She was bred for the hustle, fiercely climbing the corporate ladder and when she’d get to the top rung without another ladder to be found, she’d build another out of the bones of lesser employees that couldn’t hack it. She was a queen. I felt like a jester compared to her, constantly getting beat down by the monotony and bureaucratic bullshit of adulthood. Each year that went by, she witnessed my decay.   


Couples are supposed to grow together, but as of late, she was the only one growing while I regressed further into the mangled tree. She constantly asked if I was alright, always checking in on me and letting me know she was becoming concerned. Last Friday when I got home from work, I was rundown and beat up from the work week. I responded to her questions about my day with annoyed grunts and groans having no power to form complete sentences. Misery’s state flag had to have been flying freely from my face waving it’s bold, gray colors at her. I cut her off in the middle of her sentence and told her I was going to go sleep it off, giving her a kiss before heading upstairs. When I closed the bedroom door behind me, I locked the door which was a habit of mine before going to bed, but unusual for me to do on a early Friday evening without her in bed with me.   


I laid in bed putting a pillow over my eyes to blind me from the light and concentrated on my breathing, trying to get the grease build up from the week out of my brain. My phone vibrated after twenty minutes of laying there with Emma’s name filling the screen. I let it ring out. She knew where I was and what I was doing. I heard her call my name from downstairs. I was becoming frustrated. Why would she bother me knowing good and well that I was trying to rest? A few minutes later I heard her footsteps on the stairs, my blood pressure increasing with each step she took. She tried opening the door, but it was locked. Without hesitation, she beat the door yelling my name. I sprung out of bed and opened the door and aggressively said, “What the hell are you doing?”   


Her face looked like she had just seen a dead body, but what broke my heart was when I realized that her face actually looked like she was about to see a dead body. She thought I ‘did it.’ I had no idea that it had gotten so bad that she would actually think I’d ‘do it.’ Emma came through the door and squeezed me with the biggest hug and told me I scared her. I knew something needed to quickly change.  


“You stroking out on me over there?” Derek said, snapping me back into the miserably moment.  


“Nah, I’m trying to save that for the afternoon so I can get out early.”  


“Well, I’m going to the bathroom and have myself a nice puke. You ready to go?”  


“Sure am.” But I wasn’t. I was never ready to go back to the hell hole the other’s called ‘the office.’  


…  


I sat at my desk staring out the window and watched the life of the city floor. The people looked like little moving dots on the ground, so insignificant from above, but I made up stories in my head about their own personal struggles to get me through my own. I wondered how many of them were like me, clenching their jaws through life, not enough time to enjoy themselves, not enough money to make their lives worth it. I saw a bird swoop down for the building and dive towards the street. It’s freedom made me want to cry. I thought about how long it would take for me to fly from the fourteenth floor to the street alongside the bird with my wings spread wide. Five seconds? Six? Would it feel like five seconds? Would I truly be able to think about and relive my whole life in such a short duration?  
My heart skipped a beat when my phone vibrated on my desk. It was Brock’s brother. I opened up the text.
