I don’t know how to start this.
I don’t even know if I’m writing this to warn anyone or just to make sense of what’s happening.
But if you ever hear a foghorn in the middle of a thunderstorm on the coast of northern Maine — turn off your radio.
Don’t answer it.

Because it’s not calling ships anymore.

It’s calling me.

When the Coast Guard assigned me to Deadwater Point Lighthouse, I thought it was a joke.
I’d worked in maritime maintenance for years, mostly buoys and harbor lights along the southern coast, but this was different.
Deadwater is the farthest north you can go in Maine without hitting Canada.
The kind of place where the pine trees stop growing straight and the gulls sound like they’re laughing at you.

The supply pilot told me it’s called Deadwater because ships used to vanish there in calm seas , “no wind, no waves, no wreckage, just gone.” He laughed when he said it, but it wasn’t the kind of joke that ends with a smile.

The station itself is old, early 1900s brick and iron, with a spiral stair that could break your neck if you slip.
There’s a two-room keeper’s house connected by a narrow corridor to the tower.
Power comes from a diesel generator that coughs like an asthmatic smoker, and there’s a radio console used for transmitting daily weather reports to the mainland.

They said I’d be here six months.
They said someone would rotate in with me after two weeks.
That second part never happened.

March 11th

I caught a glimpse of something while cleaning the catwalk lens. A ripple broke against the base of the tower, but there was no wind.
Then a head surfaced, not like a fish, but too smooth, too pale. The skin looked stretched over bone. The eyes caught the light and didn’t blink.

It stayed there, watching, until lightning flashed. Then it was gone.

When I had to report the weather over the radio, the line went dead.
And I heard… bubbles.
Someone — or something — whispering my own transmission back to me.
Every word I said came back slower, distorted, and wetter.

“Weather fair. Winds calm…”

“Weather… fair… winds… calm…”

I unplugged the radio, but it kept whispering from the speaker for five whole minutes after it lost power.

During those nights, the radio screams.
Not static but more of those bubbles popping through a throat.I made sure that i unplugged the damn thing and went to bed, but it didn’t stop. I could still hear it, like it was coming from under the floorboards.

March 15th

It’s been raining nonstop. The kind of rain that doesn’t sound like rain. It’s heavier, deliberate. Like something knocking.
The generator’s been cutting out at night. When it does, I swear I hear footsteps in the stairwell.

Not boots.
Bare feet.
Wet. Heavy.
Dragging.

Twice now I’ve gone up expecting to see someone, but there’s nothing there.
Only puddles.

And seaweed on the steps.

March 17th

The radio isn’t transmitting anymore. It’s breathing.
I can hear it at night, a deep, rhythmic inhale that syncs with the ocean below.

Last night, it said something new.
Through the static, I heard:

“The light… must… feed.”

I checked the logbooks. The last keeper here in 1954 wrote that same line on his final entry before the ink turned into water stains.


March 19th

There’s something wrong with my reflection.
When I look in the lantern glass, it lags behind me.
It moves a second too slow.
And sometimes, when I blink, I see its mouth still open.

The skin around my eyes looks darker. Wet. The whites are turning grey.

I can taste salt when I breathe.

March 21st

The storm hasn’t stopped in three days. The light keeps turning itself on, even after I cut the main breaker.
It glows with this deep blue pulse, like something alive is inside it.

When I got close, I heard a noise, like something moving behind the glass.
Scraping. Sliding.

And on the inner lens, written in condensation:

“OPEN THE DOOR.”

March 23rd

I woke up to the generator running, even though I drained its fuel the night before.
The light was spinning. The radio was hissing.

Then I heard it again, the same wet voice:

“LET. ME. IN.”

I went outside.
The sea was flat, black, and perfectly still.
And something was standing on the rocks below not swimming, standing.

Tall. Twisted.
Its body moved like water inside a sack of skin. Its mouth opened wider than it should’ve. And from that hole came a sound that vibrated every bone in my chest.

The foghorn answered.

I don’t remember coming back inside.
But when I woke up, my clothes were soaked.
And my logbook i looked at the pages and they where dripping wet, but I can still read the words written in my own handwriting:

“The storm is inside now.”

March 27th

The sea is whispering again.
I can hear it under the floorboards.
It says my name in the tide.

I don’t think the light keeps them away anymore.
I think it’s calling them here.
And I think I’m next.

If anyone reads this don’t come to Deadwater Point.
Don’t follow the beam.
And for God’s sake, if you hear a voice on your radio that sounds like your own,

turn it off.
