Does anyone have any experience with a quickly progressing pregnancy? Two nights ago, my wife and I slept in the same bed for the first time in a few months, and the next morning she woke up nearly bursting at the seams. Her words are garbled, sentences broken. Her eyes, really the last vestiges of emotion she has left, are scared, and I don’t know what else we can do.

The island's connection is weak, so I’m not sure if this will ever reach the mainland, never mind that it only processes so much at once. If this ever reaches you, I hope by then the issue has been resolved, but if it hasn’t, please god send help. 

My wife’s and my relationship has been rocky for about a year now. Three months ago, she came in all ecstatic with a flyer for a couples retreat in the Caribbean with a 100% guarantee to fix any relationship. 

“Caleb, we get our money back if it doesn’t work! Plus, look at those white sand beaches!”

 I faked a smile and nodded. I had stopped trying months ago when my wife, Sydney, had started sleeping in a different room and spending more time with her “girlfriends.” But what the hell. The $1800 for flights and room from Illinois had seemed too good to be true.

We escaped the last throes of the cold and took our trip in April. I allowed the tiniest bit of optimism to shine through, but remained largely skeptical of the whole affair. The flight was routine, and a car was waiting at the airport to pick us up and take us to the dock. 

The boat was sleek. The attendants were well-dressed, manicured, and attentive, giving us large pours of red wine and presenting us with fresh cheeses and chocolates. For the first time in months, I felt the stress unfurl itself from my shoulders, allowing myself for a second to believe in those vows we had said years ago. I was lost in the possibilities of our future, hopelessly unaware of how weird it was that we were the only ones on the boat.

When we pulled up to the island, a tall, skinny man enthusiastically introduced himself as Counselor S with a handshake for me and a second, too-long kiss on my wife’s cheek. I felt Counselor S’s eyes on me, searching for a reaction. At that moment, I won’t lie, it felt weird, but I chalked it up to a cultural thing. 

“Are we the first guests?” I choked out as a shorter, bigger man carried our bags to a pristine white Villa that Counselor S guided us towards.

“We actually are not very busy this time of year,” Counselor S responded in a thick accent I couldn’t quite place. I nodded my head, a little curious how this paradise wasn’t packed to the brim. 

The Villa was stunning. A chandelier was flanked on either side by grand staircases, with the entryway leading to an indoor sparkling pool. The kitchen was nearly the size of our entire apartment back in the US, and Counselor S introduced us to Miguel, our personal chef for the week. 

He led us to the master bedroom before leaving us. Sydney made herself comfortable in our bath, playing soothing music and lighting a candle as I collected my thoughts, setting aside the bouquet of chocolates, cheese, and wine that sat in the welcome basket on our bed.  

“Honey, come in!” She teased, as I was lost in thought, considering the seemingly impossible nature of this place. Before I could acquiesce to Sydney’s requests, a knock and note under the door informed me dinner would be occurring in one hour on the beach. Two small squares were attached to the note with an arrow that stated: “For best experience, let dissolve on tongue for truthfulness and openness.” 

My hand hovered over the request.

“Sydney, get out real quick and look at this.”

“Ugh!” I heard her snarl. “Can’t you just bring it to me?”

The half-minute of silence finally caused the water to splash around, and Sydney emerged from the bathroom in a white robe.

“What is it, Caleb?” She scoffed, our usual contentious dynamic returning to break the monotony of paradise. 

“Look at this,” I beckoned her closer before pointing to the squares. She inched closer, carefully studying the note before she snatched it from my hand and placed one of the squares on her tongue.

“What the hell, Sydney?” I screamed, hands pulling the note back and looking at her with shock and horror. 

“I want us to work, Caleb,” she muttered before taking a loud gulp. She snatched the note back from my hand and ripped the other square off the note, pushing it towards my hand.

I still had my sanity firmly in grasp, so I of course refused, still perplexed that she would do something so insane in my eyes. “Caleb, for me, for us. This place works; it will work for us. But we have to take risks, do things we wouldn’t in the outside world, trust each other.” 

I stared back at her. Her eyes glazed, transfixed on something past me. I looked deeply, trying to understand the nonsensical actions of my wife. She then gasped, my eyes swiveling aimlessly, trying to detect the source of her sudden excitement. “Caleb, it’s working! It’s….it’s beautiful!” She exclaimed. Her head bobbed up and down before her eyes met mine. 

“Wha- what is?” I pondered. She let out a deep sigh and let a smile creep across her face before she jammed her hand forward and forced the square into my mouth. I felt the fabric-like substance slowly melt across my tongue as the world around me began to shift [color](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeVBucksforXMAS/).
