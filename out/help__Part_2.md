So,

It's been a few days since I last posted here and …

I did something really fucking stupid. I opened the door. (No, I did not let them in) and right now, as a result; I am freaking the fuck out.

For the last couple of days the knocking has been intermittently stopping for a few hours and then starting back up again. I've been sleeping when I'm able, but it's becoming increasingly more difficult as I hope you can imagine. I think when a person loses enough sleep they also lose all sense judgment and self preservation, I think that that's what happened to me. Early this morning (around 2AM) I woke up to a cacophony of thuds. In my muddled frustration-clouded state I trudged down the stairs where I saw Winnie, she had planted herself in front of the door a few days after *they* arrived. She's stopped eating. She won't leave the door no matter what. I think she's more scared than me.

As soon as I stood in front of the door the knocking became louder and louder and louder like a throbbing.  Winnie let out a low growl. Many of you thought that these things could be vampires because it seems like they need to be invited in. This morning I was following what can only be described as vampire logic. Many of you recommended getting garlic cloves. I don't have garlic cloves, but I did have garlic powder. Without thinking I went to the cupboard pulled out a big bottle of garlic powder, and took off the lid, as I swung open the door. Winnie scrambled away. almost knocking me over as I proceeded to douse the little fuckers in garlic powder! And then- NOTHING HAPPENED, by that I mean literally *NOTHING.* No reaction whatsoever. I don't know what I expected to happen. *I guess I expected something.*

Then the girl spoke as if she hadn't just been dredged in seasoning  “ Can we come in?”

“ What do you want?” I stammered.

Then for the first time the little boy looked up and spoke. At that point I was sent out of whatever trance I was in, whatever fantasy that made me think getting rid of them would be easy. his eyes, no. its eyes were the darkest things I have ever seen. There was not a sliver of white. They looked like they were holes in his head. I say this because there was no glare, no reflection of any light on them. It stared as if it were pulling me apart piece by piece (As if I were some ghastly thing.) Then it spoke. As it stepped forward, I stepped back-  out of the door frame.

“Why do you not let us in? We cannot come in if you say no.” its speaking patterns were strange and unnatural as if it hadn’t spoken for a very long time.

At this point I fully came back to my senses, slammed the door, and locked it. Since this started (almost three weeks ago) I haven't left my house. Some of you said I should, but in all honesty I think I have this fear of breaching the threshold of my front door. I think it's more of a fear of the unknown. What would they do if there was nothing between us? What could I do?

I'm going to keep you updated.
