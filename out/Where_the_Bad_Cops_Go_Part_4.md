Nick and I didn’t get much time off after our run-in with the mask folks. Enough for February to make way for March, but that was pretty much it. I spent most of that time making myself comfortable in my house again, but no matter the furniture and the ‘new floor smell’, I still had that feeling that something was out there; just out of sight. The town of Tomskog was relentless that way. You could never really be sure that you were alone, or safe. I had no idea how the long-term locals did it.

Once the dust settled, we were put back on active duty. Nothing big, just surveillance. John Digman and his relative were holed up at this old ranch by the southwestern exit of town. There weren’t a lot of spots to position ourselves for a stakeout without outing ourselves, but we settled on a hill within a viewing distance. The station had plenty of binoculars.

There were three surveillance teams. Nick and I ended up on the evening shift, starting at 5pm and ending around midnight. Round-the-clock surveillance.

 

Being forced into such a proximity with another person has a couple of unintended effects. I think this is the time where Nick and I became real, actual friends. Up until that point we were still sort of work buddies, but we hadn’t really sat down and just talked.

I learned a lot about Nick during those days. I’d no idea he used to be married, for example. His wife had run off with a male stripper from Salt Lake City. Six years of marriage down the drain on a single ill-timed company retreat. Then there were his ridiculous pink sunglasses. As he described them;

“They make you brave, you know. When you look at the world through rose-tinted glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.”

 

One evening, as we bonded over shrimp and fried rice, the conversation lulled a bit. The Digman’s were keeping to themselves, so there was nothing to report. We were just sitting there, vibing to his classic hard rock collection. I decided to bring up something that’d been on my mind for a while.

“I don’t get why everyone doesn’t know about this town,” I said. “It’s unreal. It’s literally unreal.”

“You forget,” Nick explained. “You just sort of forget. All these things, they’re so unlikely that you start to fade it out from your mind over time. Like a story you forgot you read. It’s like it never really happened to you, you know?”

“Yeah, but people around here go missing too. Do y’all just forget about them and move on?”

“Sometimes,” Nick nodded. “But it’s not like… a willing thing. Sometimes things just disappear, like they were never here to begin with.”

He tapped the dashboard, as if trying to conjure a thought. Then he snapped his fingers.

“Your desk!” he exclaimed. “Remember how it had no name?”

“Yeah?”

“It most definitely did, once. But whoever used it is just sort of gone. Poof.”

 

After our shift, Nick took me on a ride to show me what he meant. There were a couple of houses that were fully furnished and clearly inhabited, but there were no names registered to them. No initials on the mailbox, nothing but empty frames on the walls.

“These show up from time to time,” Nick explained. “There’s nothing we can do about it. Even if they were our best friends at some point, how would we know? It’s like they never existed.”

“You know what’s causing this?”

“Take your pick,” Nick shrugged. “Ain’t just one thing that can cause it. It’s like… once you go too far and touch something you shouldn’t, it takes you away.”

We just stood there for a moment, looking at this ghastly house. The fancy living room rug, painstakingly selected. Empty plates from a dinner finished months ago. A shirt casually tossed over a chair, now the home to a curious spider weaving a brand-new web.

It was a life frozen in time, waiting for someone to come home. Someone that wouldn’t.

 

I tried not to think too much about it, but the thought surfaced every now and then. The next time Nick and I went down to the station, I took some time to go through the desk I’d been assigned to when I first joined. There were still a few items left. A couple of empty picture frames, that was to be expected. A pack of gum, an empty wallet, a couple of blank receipts. The strangest things were a set of smooth keys. There was no way to tell what they’d be used for. Handcuffs?

It was pointless. Whoever this person was, I’d never find out. And while the rest of Tomskog PD seemed perfectly happy with not knowing, it just gave me the creeps. If something could affect people on such a personal level, nothing was off the table. I tried not to think about it too much, but the implications were mind boggling. You could just disappear, and no one would know.

Nick didn’t seem too bothered though. He saw me rummaging through the desk and gave me what can only be described as a sympathetic shrug. I guess he figured I had to come to terms with this in my own way.

 

That night, as I went to sleep, I had the strangest feeling in my stomach. It was like a new kind of worry. We’ve all had those nights when we twist and turn, worrying about something, but this was different. This was, like… world-shattering. Like existence itself was a fragile thing. It felt like the universe itself was cruel, wishing me only harm and pointless indignance. I lay awake staring up at the ceiling, hoping a comforting thought would look back.

And when it didn’t, I cried. That kind of cry where your sinuses burn and you can’t close your mouth. Where you look like you’re just silently screaming as you stain your pillow with tears.

That night is when I started to write this all down. I figured I hadn’t been forgotten yet, and that in case of my sudden disappearance, there was at least a chance something might be left behind. A remnant. But I saw it more as an act of defiance; a challenge. That if I was taken down and removed, they would have another thing to remove. And I would keep adding to that pile, so that taking me out of the picture would at least be as inconvenient as possible.

 

I remember I was halfway into my recollection of coming to Tomskog (what would later be my first post here), when I leaned back. As I did, my head bumped into something. Something where there ought to be nothing.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. I figured that was a good indicator to stop for the night. I wasn’t coping very well, but at least I’d gotten some of that pain out on paper. That’d hold me for a bit.

 

Over the next few days, I regularly took down notes about strange things I’d seen, or stray thoughts that ran through my mind. I was scared that I might end up forgetting something. It was a safety blanket, in a way.

Nick didn’t say anything about it. He’d probably seen something like it before. Hell, maybe he’d been that way himself. It was nice not to have a judgmental stare over my shoulder, while still retaining some form of normalcy. Our stakeouts were drawn-out and frustrating, but at least we didn’t have to worry too much about what we were gonna do that day.

 

But what stuck with me was the little things. The little moments in between. Nick and I would sometimes have these long talks over dinner, for example. I remember the takeout bag from the gas station still warm on my lap.

“Digman uses no power,” Nick once said in-between bites of his second hot dog. “Nothing. He’s completely off the grid.”

“So?”

“So?! So look!”

I brought up my binoculars and had another look. There were plenty of lights on at Digman’s place; and that was only what we could see. There were also satellite dishes on the roof, a large radio antenna, and a couple of large black cables running from the main building to the guest house.

“You can’t say that’s not weird,” Nick insisted.

“Sure, yeah,” I agreed. “I see no solar panels, so it’s gotta be something else.”

“I’ve been saying that for years,” Nick sighed. “But it’s just one of those things, you know. One of those weird, weird things.”

“Digman,” I sighed, shaking my head.

“Fucking Digman.”

 

We ended up taking turns checking out the place, making notes whenever someone came or went. We’d use the binoculars for an hour each, letting the other one use the charger as we browsed on our phones. It made things bearable, but the long hours would get painfully slow at times. We couldn’t move around too much, or there was a chance we’d be spotted, but by the fourth day or so we were almost praying to get noticed. But hey, at least we didn’t get the night shift.

I remember getting out to stretch my legs. It was about 10 pm or so, and the clouds had slowly settled overhead. There was pressure building; we’d probably have bad weather within a couple hours. I took out my phone to check an article from my hometown, when a red light came on. As I tapped the screen, there was a second brief flash of bright red.

I blinked it away and looked up. Something had changed. For some reason, my heart was beating a little faster. March in Minnesota can get real dark real fast, so no matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t see anything. There could’ve been a hundred people in those woods staring at me, and I’d be none the wiser.

I got back to the car, suddenly feeling vulnerable. Uneasy.

Was this what my predecessors had felt before they went missing?

 

I’d get that feeling every now and then. I’d notice a red light going off on the radio, or by the camera on my phone. Just something small and brief. And every time, I felt that bottomless pit in my stomach – that threat of something taking me away. I couldn’t pinpoint why, but I always ended up taking a closer look. There had to be something out there.

It continued at home as well. I’d see a flash of red by my oven and microwave. A reflection in the TV. Little reminders that something wasn’t as it should be. I thought that I might be going paranoid, but it wasn’t that simple. Paranoia comes from the idea that you are perceiving threats where there are none, but in a place like Tomskog, how can you be sure? What does a threat that can erase your existence even look like? How would you know if you were looking at it right this second?

 

The next morning, as Nick and I were driving out to our overlook, I was behind the wheel. Nick was taking a nap in the back seat, having been up late last night catching up on some UFC fights he’d missed. I didn’t even know he was into that stuff. I considered teasing him about it, but the guy was exhausted. I figured there was a 50/50 chance that he was just using this as an excuse, and that he’d been up for some other reason. Maybe this was his way of coping with things.

I was a bit stuck in my own head when I took a right turn, going up a long hill.

There was something on the road.

 

I stepped on the breaks, swerving to the side. Every light on the dashboard flashed red as the car came to a screeching halt, almost throwing poor Nick out of the back seat. I could hear him fumbling with his pistol.

“It’s nothing!” I said. “Nothing. There’s… nothing there.”

“What the *fuck*, rook?!”

Nick relaxed, groaning as he turned his back to me.

“If it’s nothing, you *do* nothing. You don’t step on the brakes for goddamn nothing.”

I couldn’t argue with that, but the road was clear. The dashboard too. And yet, I had this feeling that something had been very, very wrong just now.

 

I was starting to feel it. Just moments before the flashing red, there’d be this electric charge going through my hair. A little jolt, as if to say ‘something’s coming’. It’s hard to explain. It felt like goosebumps, but a bit milder, and almost artificial in nature. The thought crossed my mind that maybe it had to do with Digman and whatever oddity he was cooking up on that ranch, but I couldn’t be sure. Whatever they were doing was hidden behind dozens of layers of secrecy. For all the hours we’d spent out there, we got nothing.

As Nick took a turn on the binoculars, I got out again. I walked a couple of steps away from the car, taking in the smell of the pine trees and the damp air. I could feel it coming on again. This time, instead of looking for a red light, I looked up.

And for a brief moment, I saw something further down the hill. The vague silhouette of a person.

And in a flash, it was gone.

 

I started to look for them. Not just then and there, but for the next few days. Maybe I would’ve been better off trying to let it go, but I wanted answers. Tomskog is a coin flip of a town. On one hand, ignoring something might be your best option. On the other hand, it might kill you. I had a hard time figuring out what was what.

One night as I set my alarm and went to bed, I noticed a subtle red light coming from the living room. Looking up, I could see it was my smoke alarm growing brighter than usual. Much brighter.

And in the living room there was, again, the vague silhouette of a person.

 

I carefully sat up, looking into the distance. I could see their shoulders move up and down, as if they were breathing heavily. Fingers squeezing, like they were trying to grab something. But looking a little closer, an icicle ran down the back of my spine.

They had no head.

With the blink of an eye, it was gone. But as I ran out to double-check, there were these wet stains left on my floor. Like someone had walked in with their shoes on, leaving melted snow on the carpet.

Something had been there. Something real, and physical.

 

I talked to Nick about it the next day. The red lights, the headless stranger. He didn’t seem to recognize it, but offered me some advice either way.

“I’m gonna assume you’re not pranking me. Or that you’re crazy. Or sleep-deprived, or any of that shit. I’m gonna assume you’re telling me the truth, right?” he said. “If so, you’re doing something you shouldn’t. Things don’t just pop out for no reason. You’re doing something wrong.”

“And what would that be?” I asked.

“I’m not livin’ your life, rookie. I got no idea.”

 

I retraced my steps. There were two possibilities. It could either be a result of us surveilling Digman, or something about the missing people. As I was the only one affected, I was banking on the latter. Something related to the empty houses, and the abandoned desk at the station. Maybe this was a hint to the answer. Someone trying to tell me something they shouldn’t.

That night, as I got home, I dragged a chair out on the porch. Using my radio, I slowly switched between frequencies, looking for something to turn red. I was inviting it in – looking to have a conversation. I was going to confront it. I wasn’t about to let myself be dragged off into obscurity for nothing.

I’d been at it for about 45 minutes. My fingers were freezing, and I had trouble feeling the dial. Then, a click. I turned the dial back a little, getting a clear red light on my radio.

 

Looking up, there it was, no more than six feet away.

A headless man.

He was wearing a familiar policeman’s shirt and pants, along with a black tie. His head had been violently ripped off; leaving a cascade of blood drenching his clothes. There were tufts of skin still reaching up over the collar; gently moving as some instinct forced the man to attempt breathing.

 

I just looked straight ahead. It wasn’t attacking me, and I wasn’t attacking it. Instead, I leaned back in my chair, hoping for an answer to reveal itself. We both needed something here, and I hoped he might understand.

He took a step forward. An awkward, blind step. Arms outstretched, like a child fumbling in the dark. I got up from my chair, reaching out to him.

The moment his hand touched mine, he grabbed me; intensely. It bruised my arm a bit. For a heartbeat, I thought I’d fucked up – that maybe this thing was about to do something awful. But no.

Instead, he turned my hand palm side up, and poked it with his fingers. He was trying to show me something.

He needed something to write with.

 

I handed him my notebook and a pen. He scribbled something down, and as he did, I heard this whining noise from my radio. The battery was collapsing. Seconds later, the whole radio popped open like a badly microwaved dinner, and the man was gone. My notebook fell to the ground, stained by melting snow.

The notebook said two wors; NITE SCOL

It was a lead.

 

I talked to Nick about it the next day. He still wasn’t buying it, but he knew better than to completely dismiss me. He explained that there were people taking adult education classes at the local high school after closing time – mostly woodshop and carpentry, but a handful of other classes too. It was the closest thing to a night school that this town had. I asked Nick if we could switch up our shifts a little and go there. He looked at me like I was an idiot.

“Why would I wanna go there?” he asked.

“To check this out,” I said. “It’s something.”

“Yeah, but that’s your business,” he continued. “Why’d I wanna go there? What’s this got to do with me?”

“Don’t you wanna know what happened to him? Guy was a cop, Nick.”

“That’s exactly why we oughta’ leave it alone. If he fucked up that bad, I can guarantee you that we will too.”

Nick didn’t like it. Not one bit. He thought it was an awful idea. And yet, he agreed. We switched to the morning shift the next day and went to check it out. You can say a lot about Nick, but the guy doesn’t back down.

 

After our next shift, Nick and I went to the local high school after hours. I’d brought along a fresh radio and some new batteries. If that’d worked once, I figured it might work again.

There were a couple of folks having some kind of Narcotics Anonymous meeting, so we stayed well away from that. Instead, we wandered the halls tuning the radio and hoping for something to stick. Nick tagged along but kept his attention firmly on his phone. He was listening to some kind of podcast, I think.

There was a brief red flicker. I elbowed Nick, who took out his air pods. I flicked the radio back and forth, and every time I did, it blinked red. I showed it to him.

“That’s it,” I said. “We’ve got something.”

“Isn’t that just the frequencies rolling back?”

“No, it’s… look.”

I zoned in on the precise point where the light was brightest. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen. I could feel my heart sink, thinking I’d dragged us out there for nothing. Then, looking around, those fears gave way to something new.

 

Further down a long hall, there he was. The headless man.

Nick looked up and recoiled, nearly bowling himself over. I could hear him firing off a barrage of ‘what the fucks’ as the headless man pointed down the hall.

“We gotta call this in,” Nick wheezed. “I’m calling this in.”

“You do that,” I said. “But I ain’t losing track of this thing.”

I followed the directions of the headless man. Nick followed suit, trying to get the sheriff on the radio. There was some kind of interference stopping him; probably from the way I’d tuned my radio.

 

The headless man would appear wherever the corridor branched, pointing me past the cafeteria, the closed pool, and the teacher’s lounge, to a small section at the back.

There wasn’t anything in particular there. It was a space between classrooms. No door, no staircase, no nothing. Just a blue sunflower haphazardly drawn with a sharpie.

The headless man approached me and, carefully, put his hand on my radio. With one hand, he slapped the blank wall, and with his other hand he made a rotating motion with his fingers. We were re-tuning my radio, and as we did, the headless man faded.

“There’s… something here,” I said. “There’s gotta be.”

“You sure about this?” Nick asked.

I was. He wasn’t.

 

I did find another frequency that made the light on my radio turn red, but no matter how hard I tuned it, it didn’t seem to do anything. I asked Nick to join in, and when we both found the sweet spot, I could feel a sort of electrical hum in the air. My eyes watered and itched, and when they’d cleared there was a door in front of us. A black door, made of foul-smelling dark metal.

Nick shook his head, giving me an apologetic look. He didn’t want to do this. I couldn’t blame him. In a way, I didn’t want to either; but I figured this wasn’t a trap. If it had been, that thing could have just ripped my head off to begin with. This was something else. Maybe answers to something I hadn’t known to question.

“Don’t make me,” begged Nick. “Please don’t make me.”

“You can go,” I said. “Call the sheriff. Just leave the radio.”

I put my hand on the door handle. There was an oily substance to it, like it’d been covered in soap. As the door swung open, I saw a long dark corridor ahead. With my flashlight in hand, I stepped in. And despite it all, Nick stayed right behind me through it all.

 

There was a powerful smell of ammonia and chlorine, like a somehow well-cleaned and simultaneously rotten hospital. Nick left a shoe in the door to make sure it wouldn’t close on us. There was a slight dampness to the floor, but despite shining a light on it, I couldn’t make heads or tails of it. It was just this solid, slightly organic-feeling, black. Nick had trouble keeping his cool. I did too, but I felt like I had to stay strong for him not to freak out.

“…I don’t know what kind of inside out bullshit this is, but we gotta go,” Nick said.

“Upside down,” I replied.

“…what?”

“Upside down is the Stranger Things place. Inside out is a Pixar movie.”

“Well, maybe I’d rather be in a Pixar movie than whateverthefuck this is.”

 

Our radio whined as the batteries struggled. It was this long electric wailing, like a distant cry. And as we came to the far end of the black corridor, it got stronger.

We stepped out into what looked like an old apartment. Like, old-old. 1920’s old. A faint red glow made its way through clogged-up windows, casting long shadows across a dusty floor. Particles danced in the air, floating slowly upward. It was strange, but the place itself wasn’t anything unusual. A small kitchen, a bedroom, a miniscule living room. I’d seen worse.

Then Nick tapped my shoulder. The radio whined louder as he pointed up.

 

There was no ceiling. Instead, we were looking up at an exact copy of this apartment, but as seen from above. Except there weren’t two nosy police officers tuning their radios there. Instead, the floor of that apartment was filled with paper bags, rustling as something inside them moved. There was a sound coming from them, like a tapping, smacking kind of noise.

I didn’t take my eyes off them, but Nick backed away. He was a heartbeat from making a break for the door. I tuned my radio a little, just to see what would happen. As I did, something shifted. The paper bags came tumbling down. The moment they hit the ground, my battery popped; leaving a black trail of smoke rising from the speaker.

Nick gasped. I looked back, only to see the corridor leading us back out slowly collapsing in on itself.

 

The next few moments rushed by.

Nick was freaking out, accidentally stepping on a bag. As he did, it split open; revealing a decapitated head. Its mouth was still moving. Pale eyes looked my way.

They were desperate. So ungodly desperate.

 

Nick just kicked it. It bounced off an empty bookshelf with a meaty squish, then smacked against a window; cracking it. As a floor of decapitated heads began to murmur, I saw that crack in the window grow. And as it did, something outside the window moved. Something headed straight for us.

A part of me wanted to stay. It wanted to see what was out there, and what was causing this. Nick, on the other hand, didn’t plan on sticking around. He took me by the arm, dragged me into the bathroom, and locking the door. As he did, I heard glass shatter in the other room.

Looking up, this room was the same as the other. There was no ceiling, but a copy of the room we were standing in above. Nick got up on top of the toilet, reached up, and pulled himself as far as he could.

Seconds later, something flipped. Gravity shifted for him, sending him reeling upwards. He was standing on the ceiling, looking down at me.

“We gotta go!” he yelled down. “Come on!”

The door handle was turning. I prayed that Nick had remembered to lock the door.

Luckily, he had. But whatever was on the other side didn’t seem too pleased about it.

 

I got up on the toilet and reached upwards. Nick grabbed my hand, pulling me upward. For a brief moment, we were both sort of suspended midway through, but Nick was heavier. He pulled me up just as the door broke.

A long ashen arm reached through, holding a paper bag like a searchlight.

“Up!” a muffled voice wheezed. “They went up!”

 

My stomach turned as we exited the bathroom; coming out in what looked like the first room we’d entered; now with the bags above us (below us?) yet again. We didn’t have time to think. We just had to go.

We ended up climbing out a window, running down another corridor. I almost slipped on a haphazardly thrown bag. We ran past what looked like a high school chemistry room; stacked floor to ceiling with headless bodies. There was an auditorium filled with unused clothes, arranged as if they were an audience looking at an empty stage.

We ran through collapsed rooms, a maintenance tunnel, some kind of computer storage space, a boiler room, and finally – a pool.

 

There was a plastic cover over it, but I could tell there was something underneath. The cover was moving. I could see shapes of five-fingered hands moving just below the plastic, trying to reach through. The far wall had collapsed, sending hundreds of tiles careening across the floor. We could go around the pool and climb the debris, but we’d lose precious time. We had to get across.

I took a tentative step onto the plastic. It was unsteady, but solid. Nick followed suit. When we made it halfway through, I could hear something coming from the corridor behind us. Whatever was out there still wasn’t done with us. And as footsteps lumbered closer still, the edge of the plastic cover broke; revealing a pale hand reaching up from below.

We ran. We were out of breath and terrified beyond belief, but we ran. And the moment I got to the other side, the plastic broke wide open, revealing what can only be described as a mass of writhing bodies. All reaching, fumbling; stirred by the sudden movement. Stirred by each other. And beyond a field of waving hands and outstretched fingers, I saw a gray-ish figure in the distance, holding up a paper bag towards us.

It was catching up.

 

Nick pulled me into a locker room, closing and barricading the door behind us. I started to open lockers, only to reveal more paper bags tumbling out on the floor.

“Keep going!” Nick screamed. “There’s gotta be something!”

Every bag screeched; giving away our position. Each one of them desperate and clueless; undying. Dozens and dozens and dozens of them, all unique, but eerily similar.

 

A thump against the door. A muffled voice. Nick pulled out his pistol.

“Come ON!”

Door after door swung open, bag after bag tumbling out. And after every locker was open, we were none the wiser. There was nothing for us. Nothing.

 

For a moment, that was it. I put my hand on my gun, not knowing what to use it on. Whatever was coming through that door would be nothing like we’d come to understand. If there was a chance we’d end up stuck in this place, I didn’t want to be around for it. To be one of these things, locked in perpetuity… that was hell. And up until that point, I hadn’t considered hell to be a real place. But it was. It really, really was.

“Come on!” Nick repeated. “Please!”

The door buckled and bent. The pressure from the outside was immense. There was a cackling noise – a hoarse laughter.

 

Looking down, I noticed something familiar. One of the bags was the same that Nick and I used to get when we got hot dogs from the gas station. A regular cop stop.

I picked it up, opening it.

There was the head of a man inside. He was probably in his early 40’s. Short blonde hair, high cheek bones. Tired, dusty eyes. He didn’t seem angry. He wasn’t screaming for us to get caught, like the others. He just looked my way, trying to see through the cloud of his iris.

“…that you?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I stuttered. “I think so.”

He smiled. An honest-to-God smile.

“…alright then.”

 

As the pounding on the door got louder, and the hinges buckled, I looked into the eyes of this dead man. He tried to tell me something, but couldn’t. He furrowed his brow.

“I don’t… I don’t remember my name,” he said. “I forgot.”

“You got me here,” I huffed. “You gotta get me out.”

“I wanted you to get… something,” he said. “It’s so distant. It’s so…”

Nick abandoned the door. He grabbed my arm, pulling me into the shower room. There were no more doors, but we could hide for a bit.

 

We ended up cowering in the corner, our voices echoing against the ceramic tiles. My voice lowered to a whisper as the barricade broke, and something rummaged through the other room.

“There’s gotta be something,” I whispered. “Please.”

“There was… something. In here,” he said. “I left something.”

“What?”

Nick slowly got up, checking the far side of the wall. I checked the other. My heart was beating out of my chest. After a couple seconds, Nick made a clicking noise at me to call me over. He handed me a tool belt; the same kind we had.

It had a radio.

 

As we slowly tuned our way back to a red light, the lumbering thing from the other room grew closer. It was mumbling something to us; muffled threats and promises. It sounded like it was limping, dragging one foot behind it. Dry limbs crackling as arms and knees bent. Ceramic tiles cracking as an immense weight pushed down.

Two red lights lit up on our radios. Feeling our way along the left side of the wall, we felt something opening up. A corridor, similar to the one we’d entered through.

We ran. We ran straight ahead with complete abandon, slamming ourselves at the door at the end. And as we did, a final message from the head I’d brought along.

“You got it,” he said. “You got me.”

 

It flung open, spitting us back out in that same corridor; only we exited upside down with our heads towards the floor. We fell on top of each other like a pile of ferrets, but got back on our feet within seconds. Like a dog struggling for grip on a slippery floor, Nick bolted towards the exit, spurring me along.

As I got up, I noticed something gray covering my clothes. The head I’d been holding had turned to ash, leaving a fine layer of dust on the floor.

Nick was still one shoe short, but he didn’t care. He burst through the front doors, diving into the driver’s seat of his car. I was right behind him. He was panicked beyond belief, but even in that state, he stopped to wait for me. He was screaming at the top of his lungs for me to hurry the fuck up, but he didn’t leave. Not until I was in.

 

My heart slowed as adrenaline subsided. My hands felt cold, and I couldn’t stop blinking, but the familiar hum of an engine calmed me like a lullaby. As we gained some distance from the school, I noticed something on the floor. Nick had brought along the tool belt. I picked it up, checking it piece by piece. An empty can of pepper spray. A pair of handcuffs. And finally, a badge.

The name was gone, but there was still a serial number. Maybe that was the piece he wanted us to bring along. While there was no name associated anymore, the number was still there. For all it was worth, this was a little piece of proof that there had been someone working at Tomskog PD, at some point. They were a man down, and even though they couldn’t remember him, he’d been there. And he’d worn that badge. In a way, that badge number was as much a name as his God-given one.

“You think that’s it?” Nick asked. “You think he got what he wanted?”

“I think so, yeah,” I said. “He knew I was looking for him.”

“And now you’re done, right? You’re done?”

“Yeah, I’m done.”

 

Nick stopped the car, taking off his pink sunglasses. He was still wheezing like he’d ran a marathon. The smell of ammonia and chlorine stuck to him like a curse.

“I told you no, but you did it anyway,” he said. “I told you I didn’t want to.”

“It’s done. I’m sorry.”

“Get out.”

It got quiet. Just the hum of a car engine, and Nicks’ fingers drumming on the dashboard.

“Nick, what are you-“

“Get the *fuck* out.”

I unbuckled my seat belt and stepped out, leaving the door open. Nick buried his face in his hands. His pink sunglasses rolled off the dashboard, landing on the passenger seat beside him.

 

“I’m getting another partner,” he said. “You’re not dragging me into this shit again.”

“Nick, I’m sorry, but I had to.“

“You didn’t have to do shit-all. You *wanted* to do it. You wanted to poke this town and see what would happen. Well, guess what?!”

He leaned over, putting his hand on the door.

“This is what fucking happens! This is what always fucking happens, and if you cared enough to listen, you wouldn’t have put me in front of something that rips people’s heads off!”

“How was I supposed to know?!”

“Because nothing good *ever* *happens!*” he yelled back. “You step too far, you get killed! You get cut, shot, or stabbed! Or, *best* case scenario, your wife runs off with some sleazy oiled-up Magic Mike looking motherfucker from Salt Lake City! And if you won’t leave well enough alone, I’m not gonna be there to bail you out! Not again!”

He slammed the door shut and sped off, leaving me by the side of the road with a badge, an empty can of pepper spray, and a pair of handcuffs. I watched the red lights of his car disappear around the bend.

 

I walked home that night, dragging my feet through the gray-stained sidewalk sleet. I got a badge in my hand, a literal gold star for my willingness to go the extra mile.

But maybe I’d gone too far, just this once.

Maybe that’s what the headless man had done too.
