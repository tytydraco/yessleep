2/27/2025

Since I went to that alternate place, it's gotten my theory brain kicked into overdrive. I mean, Warden was weird enough, but now I have a whole other world to worry about. I've been calling it the dead world because, well, I mean it is. I've been there twice now. The first time I already talked about, the second time I'll get into a little later. In both of my trips there thus far I've seen no evidence of life anywhere. No animals or plants. Even stranger is there being no sun, no clouds, and as I learned on my second trip, no wind. Thankfully, there is still air out there at least. I actually dared to step outside of that weird alternate house the second time, at first, I just sort of poked my leg out there beyond the door threshold to see if my monitor would go off, then a few steps, then I was pretty confident at that point that it wasn't going to.

I'll talk more about that second trip soon, but first, how I got back there. I was pretty freaked out that morning for obvious reasons. Warden seemed a little different that morning to, calmer almost, which definitely didn't help my unease. I got up, and he didn't say anything. I was still wearing what I was when I passed out which made me feel slightly better, Warden just stayed there, he didn't get up until I reached my door, and even then, he didn't speak to me he just sat up. I wanted to ask him about a million different questions, but I felt like it was better to just take care of myself first. After all, my throat was still on fire, and I was pretty hungry by then to. Besides I'd grown pretty accustomed to Warden's outbursts over tiny things at that point and I really didn't want to find out what sort of reaction he'd have to someone accusing him of being a rapist or something.

I didn't feel too different, other than the lingering feelings that place left on me. I still don't have an answer for why he was there that morning. He still seems to prefer the couch or wherever else he goes that I still haven't figured out as opposed to my bed, though, unfortunately, I have still woken up to him being in bed with me three more times since then. That doesn't matter, not for right now, at least.

I walked down the hall and to the kitchen and made myself a glass of water, I was so thirsty that it was already empty by the time I had even registered I was drinking from it. I poured myself a second glass and was able to drink that one at a more human pace. I still get a little uneasy in the kitchen after the sandwich thing, so I've just stuck to eating quick microwave foods to keep my time in the kitchen to a minimum. Unless, of course, Warden orders me to make something else. I ate my little tray of assorted mushy food pretty fast, even if the heat hurt my mouth. I probably looked like a hamster in that moment, but I was hungry. Maybe the dead world sucks life out of things? Maybe that's why I felt so tired and so out of, well, everything.

It was when I was tossing out that plastic tray that Warden finally stepped down the hall to the living room. He didn't look at me or say a word. I was expecting him to say something since he had made the effort to walk down to the living room past me instead of just materializing there, but he didn't. He seemed strange that morning and for a good chunk of the day later. He seemed sort of, somber? I don't know how to describe it he just seemed a little down, not disappointed or outright sad, but just, contemplative maybe? It made me wonder if he had actually meant to send me there at all. I assumed that he did, but maybe it was an accident. If it was an accident, it'd certainly be a weird one. How do you accidentally send someone to an alternate reality exactly? If he did do it by accident, why was he reacting like that? if something as egotistical as Warden made a mistake, I'd expect him to just get pissed about it, not this.

I didn't want to know about that. What I wanted to know was what the hell was that place and what did me being there mean, because based on his strange demeanor it meant something. I couldn't just demand answers out of him so I wanted to try and get him to send me back there, now if it really was an accident that may be tricky seeing as you'd think he'd try extra hard to keep it from happening again, but I had to try. Up until then, the only outlet I had for answers was Warden. Now I had the dead world, and the dead world wasn't constantly tormenting me, unlike someone. From what I could remember, I hadn't really done anything to trigger it the first time, I was just looking at Warden, Warden was just sitting there.

I did find it a little strange at the time how still Warden was being, he seemed pretty zeroed in on something, I assumed it was the tv but maybe it wasn't, maybe he was, I don't know, meditating? Some weird demon, creature, thingy meditation? Maybe staring at him too long while he was doing it sucked me into it to, but if that was the case, why wasn't he there with me? All I knew was I was staring at him, he was staring onward, and then, boom, weird bizzarro house. It was all I had to go off of, so that was my plan, basically. Keep an eye on Warden without making it too obvious and wait for him to go into another staring contest with nobody. It seemed like if I wanted my answers, I was going to have to start being a bit of a creep myself.

I set my little side quest into motion, which I affectionately referred to as my "outcreep the creep" quest and started waiting for my moment. Whenever I wasn't eating, working, or sleeping, I was waiting. It took about three days after that first night before I finally made headway, and in between that time, Warden set me up with another sadistic task. It wasn't too awful, especially since it made me feel more confident that he was getting back to his old cocky self, which might make it easier to get sent back to dead world. He ordered me to clean the bathroom, which seemed simple enough until I took one step in the bathroom and promptly busted my ass because the whole floor was covered inch by inch in something that was way too slippery to be normal soap. Technically, if he covered the floor in soap didn't that mean it was already clean? The answer to that doesn't really matter since we all know it had nothing to do with the bathroom getting clean.

I put on the little show I know Warden wanted me to and did my best to scrub at the underside of the sink and in the tub with a sponge without fully standing back up, even on all fours I still slipped at least four more times, my chin didn't feel too good by the end of it but I left that task relatively unscathed. My moment came the day after that, and honestly it couldn't of been a better time, I had the day off, and the next day, it was relatively early, so if I did manage to get into dead world I'd likely have ample time to poke around, I wasn't entirely sure how the time worked in there versus here but I knew it couldn't of been too far off based on my previous experience. Now I'm fairly certain that it's roughly the same, maybe a tiny bit faster but not too bad.

Warden was in the kitchen; he was sitting at the kitchen table enjoying a bowl of canned soup he had me heat up for him, at least he was. He was happily enjoying it one moment, then just staring off into space the next. it was honestly pretty spooky to see it happen in real time. I mean, the first time it happened, it was already going on when he showed up, and he was at least staring at something you could believe he was just spacing out on. I mean, humans even stare at the tv like zombies, but not the plain kitchen wall. It did make me question why he appeared in the living room if he was already going through one of these states. Maybe he didn't mean to do that either. I hadn't noticed these spells of his before that couch one. It made me wonder if they were something new or if I just wasn't seeing it.

I wasn't entirely sure how to trigger it to happen again, so I just stepped into the room hesitantly and watched him like that. I waited a few minutes, then stepped closed, waited a few more minutes, got even closer. It went on like that until I couldn't really get closer, so while I dreaded it, I put a hand on his shoulder, hoping that would speed it along, whatever it was. Almost immediately after I did that, I felt that sucking in feeling again. Like all of my attention was instantly shifted in on him, and before I knew it, I was zeroed in on him just like he was with the wall. Then he was gone.

Warden was gone, the table was now longer and painted white, and I was back in business. I didn't want to waste any time. By that point, the idea of testing the outside was already on my mind, but I wasn't ready to test it just yet. First, I wanted to check out the house a little more. I didn't want to spend too much time inspecting since I wasn't sure when Warden would find me. I knew I didn't want to go back to my room since that didn't end up too well the last time. I looked around the kitchen before anything else. Besides the differently colored and elongated dining table, the tiles on the floor were different. My tiles are large and dark gray. They're marbled to look like natural sheet rock. These dead world tiles were those classic, tiny, black, and white checker squares you'd associate with a kitchen. My fridge is gray and opens from the middle. This fridge was black, and the freezer door was on top of the fridge one.

The counters were pretty similar, but the wood was a much darker shade than mine, and when I got closer, they had this strange smell to them, almost like wet driftwood. I hadn't noticed that strange smell on any of the other wood-based furniture before, I was a little worried that maybe this place was changing, that maybe dead world wasn't as benevolent as I had thought, but then I realized that smell wasn't coming from the counters, it was coming from the fridge. Then I was much more worried. Finding something horrific in a fridge or freezer is a pretty classic horror trope at this point, so I really didn't want to make myself open that damn thing. At the same time, I knew I had to. I held onto a fragment of hope that whatever in there wouldn't be too bad, I mean, it smelled weird sure, but while I've never personally smelled a cadaver or anything else like that, I was fairly confident that they didn't smell like old wet wood.

I took a moment to brace myself for whatever I was about to find in there as I gripped the fridge handle first. Once I felt I was ready I slowly pulled the fridge open, it took a little bit of force to do so, when I did, I had to immediately jump back because a large pile of dark soil came tumbling out of the fridge. It was dirt, probably five large potting soil bags worth wet, dark, dirt. I just sort of stood there looking at it, almost expecting some half rotten hand to leap out of it and grab me, but nothing happened. It was just a whole lot of dirt. When I finally snapped out of it, I much less reluctantly opened the freezer. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have done that given the height of the freezer versus my own because I was promptly showered in more wet dirt.

In an instant, that wet wood smell was the only thing I could smell, and the dirt was the only thing I could see. I shook it off like a dog before grabbing the kitchen towel off of this world's oven doorhandle and wiped some leftover dirt away from my eyes. The dirt was cold, made sense, I suppose. It made a lot more sense than a fridge and freezer being filled with dirt anyway. It wasn't anywhere near as gory and horrific as what I was expecting, and I was grateful for that. Can Warden eat dirt? Does Warden...like dirt? Even more questions I have to worry about now.

I expected that to be the pinnacle of the kitchen expedition, so I went off and checked out the rest of the house. The rest of the rooms weren't nearly as interesting. They were different from their real-world counterparts, sure, but nothing really of note. Just differently built and colored furniture in different spots than they normally were. I checked everywhere apart from my room, of course. I know it's probably the most interesting room in the house, but it just gives me the creeps. By then, I was ready to try my hand at the outside, or foot, I guess. Just as I said earlier, I went to the front door. First, I just tested a leg, then a few steps, and then I was sure I'd likely be fine. What the monitor not going off despite me being outside means I don't know. The most likely answer is it just can't pick up on wherever dead world is, but who knows, maybe it's just all a hallucination and when I'm in dead world I'm really just still staring at Warden just whacked out of my mind.

I wasn't really sure where I was going to go. There wasn't exactly anything to go to out there. I just wanted to make sure I didn't head too far; I definitely didn't want to get lost out there. Luckily, even if I did head out far, I likely wouldn't have to worry about getting lost because every step I took left a very clear footprint in the dirt. The dirt was soft, almost plush, actually. It was dry and warm. It felt like freshly kicked up dirt, like a bunch of loose dirt someone just dug up. Thankfully, it wasn't so soft that I just sunk into it like quicksand or something. I felt a little calm in that moment. It was quiet, completely, and utterly quiet. That made enough sense. It didn't seem like there was anything in dead world to make sound in the first place. That was when I noticed that there wasn't even any wind to whistle in my ears.

The silence was a little innerving, but it was manageable, I started to move, deciding to just move straight ahead, I wasn't really sure how far I was going to walk for, I wanted to at least make it far enough to leave the house off in the distance, maybe even entirely out of view. I wasn't really sure what I was hoping to happen. Maybe I would find something far away enough from the house? Maybe there were things in this world, and they were just avoiding the house. Maybe Warden just creeped all the life away from his house. I walked for a good while. I was honestly enjoying it. The soft, warm soil felt pretty good, and the silence was staring to almost feel peaceful in a way. Then it happened.

I was just quietly walking in that same direction. Then I stopped dead in my tracks because I heard something. I heard something, and it sure as hell didn't come from me. It came from out there somewhere. I don't know where it came from. I didn't see anything, but I heard something, and I ran back to the house as fast as I could, I can't tell you how many times I slipped in the soft dirt on my panic back to the house because I was terrified just replaying that sound in my head over and over. I don't know what it was. It didn't sound like an animal or a voice. It wasn't a bang or a hiss. It sounded like a creak. It didn't sound like the creak of a door or the creak of something breaking. It sounded like the creak of something tightening. It sounded a lot like when rope gets stretched far too tight.

I didn't know what to think, I couldn't think. That sort of sound by itself isn't scary, but in that situation, it was downright terrifying. I just wanted to get back to where I belonged before whatever was out there came to find me. I just ran in the front door, I didn't know what to do, so I just started screaming, I certainly couldn't get myself home, I didn't know how. In that moment, I needed Warden. Warden had always been my tormentor, but in that moment, I needed him to be my savior. I needed him to show up and come get me because I was completely helpless without him, so I just screamed. I ran around that strange house, screaming and begging for Warden to help me. I was yelling and crying like a toddler looking for their mother. Looking back, it was absolutely humiliating, but I was in a state of panic I had never been in before.

I don't know if it was merely a coincidence or if Warden had heard me but as I was running out of my room, the creepiness of which was completely drowned out by my current state, to run back down the hall to the living room, I ran straight into Warden, literally. I face planted straight into him, and while normally I'd avoid any major physical contact with him, I was too far gone in that moment to care about the unease I had for him. I was actually hugging him. I was hugging him and bawling my eyes out, begging for him to take me home. He just stared at me watching me acting like a blubbering idiot and I just kept doing it until he eventually shoved me off of him onto the floor at which point I realized that the red wallpaper of the hallway was now back to its usual white color.

I was back home, how long I was standing there clinging onto Warden and crying like a baby even after I had already been returned home, I don't know. It was probably the lowest point I had been in. He didn't say anything. He just scoffed at me a little and went back into the kitchen. Looking back at it with a clearer mind, I wonder if any of that panic was artificial. I mean, if dead world is able to sap my energy, surely inducing some heightened state of fear in me isn't much of a stretch. I don't know. Maybe I'm just a bit of a pussy that's your call. But I swear that was the most afraid I've been in my adult life. It wasn't even a particularly frightening sound. I didn't hear a growl, or a yell, or someone speaking, or crying. It was just rope creaking somewhere out there.

I'm planning on getting back there at some point, may take some time given how on guard Warden has been acting since that last trip. I don't know when, but whenever I do get back out there, I probably won't go back outside unless I find a way to either get a weapon there or bring one with. I don't even know what it is out there I was afraid of. One thing is for sure, I'll find out.
