I’m a junior at UCF, psychology major, and I think I’ve got a stalker. It started a couple weeks ago, late March, when I was leaving the John C. Hitt Library after a cram session for midterms. It was past midnight, campus was dead, and I felt this itch, like someone was staring at me. I glanced at the Reflection Pond on my way to the parking lot, and there he was: this guy in a gray hoodie, just standing there, watching. He didn’t move, didn’t wave, just stared. I booked it to my car and figured it was some creep who’d wandered onto campus. 

But then I saw him again. Last Tuesday, I was grabbing coffee at the Student Union food court, and he was there, sitting across the room, same hoodie, eyes locked on me. I tried to brush it off, UCF’s huge, right? Maybe he’s just some weird student, but it’s been too many times now. Thursday, I found a note in my locker at Colbourn Hall. It said, “You’re not safe by Lake Underhill. Be careful tomorrow.” I’ve never told anyone here about that spot, I used to fish there with my dad before he passed, and I crashed my bike into the water once when I was 12. How does this guy know that? 

Friday, I was walking near Lake Underhill after class, and a massive tree branch crashed down right where I’d been standing a second before. I’m shaking just typing this. I told my roommate, Sarah, and she said I should report it to campus security, but I didn’t have proof, just the note and a bad feeling. So last night, we set a trap. I had Sarah sit at the Student Union food court while I watched from the second floor. Sure enough, he showed up, hovering near her table, staring at her like he knew she was with me.  

I couldn’t take it anymore. I followed him out, tailing him past the Pegasus Statue toward the Addition Financial Arena. He didn’t even try to hide, just walked slow, like he wanted me to catch up. When I finally cornered him by the arena doors, I yelled, “Who are you? What do you want?” He turned, and up close, he looked off: pale, twitchy, with these dark circles under his eyes. He said his name was Tyler, and then he muttered, “I’m trying to keep you safe, Emma. Nathan told me you’re in danger.”    
  
I froze. I never told him my name. And Nathan? That’s not a name I’ve mentioned to anyone at UCF. My cousin Nathan died five years ago, but there’s no way this guy could know that. I asked what he meant, and he just stared at me, then said, “You’re not alone here. There are things on this campus you can’t see. Nathan’s been watching, and he’s not the only one.”  

Before I could say anything, he bolted into the crowd near the arena. I didn’t chase him, my legs wouldn’t move. When I got back to my dorm in Towers Hall, I swear I heard something: a whisper, like “Trust him,” right as I turned off the lights. The bulb flickered, and for a second, I thought I saw a shadow move across my wall, but nothing was there when I looked again. 

I don’t know what’s happening. Campus security won’t do much without evidence, and I’m freaked out. Has anyone else at UCF seen this guy? Gray hoodie, maybe early 20s, hangs around the Union or Reflection Pond? Or heard anything about a “Nathan” tied to this place? I’m losing it here, and I don’t know if I’m dealing with a psycho or something else. Help.
