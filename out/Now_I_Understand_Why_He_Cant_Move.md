It's been eleven months since Rudy came back from Asia. Eleven months since everything fell apart. 
 
When I first heard about his trip, I thought it made perfect sense. Rudy was always the adventurous one—curious, sharp, always looking for something bigger than the small town we grew up in. But I think part of me also knew he was running. He never said it outright, but I could tell the weight of being a husband and father was catching up to him. A trip to Asia, he'd called it. A “spiritual reset” before life got too serious. 
 
He told me he wanted to see the temples in Cambodia, hike the mountains of Nepal, and explore local traditions. At first, he sent postcards and photos of golden sunsets, bustling markets, and ancient ruins. But then… the updates stopped. 
 
When he finally came back, he wasn’t Rudy anymore. 
 
 
He hasn’t been the same. A once bright, confident man now spends his days locked in a hospital room, curled up in the corner, rocking back and forth. 
 
 
It’s heartbreaking. Rudy was more than a cousin—he was my brother. We shared everything: inside jokes, secrets, dreams of escaping our dull hometown. We were inseparable growing up; he was the one who kept me steady when life got rough. After my parents passed, it was just the two of us. 
Now, standing in this empty apartment with no one to talk to, I feel that absence more than ever. 
 
Seeing him like this? It’s like staring at the ghost of someone I used to know. 
 
Today, I visited the hospital again, hoping—praying—for some kind of change. 
 
 
 
Dr. Perez met me outside Rudy’s room, his face grim as always. 
 
"Any news?" I asked. 
 
Dr. Perez sighed, adjusting his glasses. "No progress. He remains unresponsive, except for his episodes of screaming. We’ve tried everything—therapy, medication, even sensory deprivation. Nothing works." 
 
I clenched my fists. "There has to be something. I can’t just… watch him waste away like this." 
 
He hesitated. "Sometimes, familiarity can be the key. He might respond to someone he trusts. It’s worth a try." 
 
I nodded, steeling myself. 
 
 
 
Inside the room, Rudy sat in his usual spot: the corner, knees to his chest, eyes fixed on the floor. His once muscular frame was now gaunt, his skin pale as paper. 
 
"Rudy," I said, forcing a smile. "It’s me, Jim." 
 
No reaction. 
 
I stepped closer. "I miss you, man. Remember how we used to binge-watch crappy action movies? Or how you convinced me to dye my hair blonde in high school? You said it would make me look like a rockstar." 
 
Still nothing. 
 
I crouched down, keeping my voice soft. "You can talk to me. Whatever’s going on man, I can handle it." 
 
His head snapped up, his eyes locking onto mine. 
 
"Jim," he whispered. "I can’t move." 
 
"You don’t have to move," I said gently. "Just breathe. Take it one step at a time." 
 
His voice cracked. "No, you don’t understand. I can’t fucking move!" 
 
Before I could respond, he erupted into screams, thrashing against the walls. Nurses stormed in, pinning him down and injecting him with a sedative. 
 
As his body went limp, he mumbled, "Jim… take care of my family. Don’t let them suffer like me." 
 
"What are you talking about?" I asked, leaning closer. "What happened to you?" 
 
His lips quivered. "It started with the letter. The one I got in Asia. They warned me not to read it… but I didn’t listen. And now…" He broke into a sob. "They’re here. They won’t let me go." 
 
 
After leaving the hospital, I couldn’t shake the thought of that letter. I knew I had to get rid of it—for Rudy’s family. His wife and kid didn’t deserve any part of this curse. If they found it and read it, who knows what would happen? I couldn’t risk them getting involved in this nightmare the way Rudy did. So I went to Rudy’s house, hoping to destroy it once and for all. 
 
The letter was there, buried under souvenirs and maps. 
 
The envelope felt strange in my hands—too cold, like it had been left in a freezer. My instincts screamed at me to leave it alone, but I couldn’t. 
 
I took it to my apartment, planning to destroy it. I lit a match and watched as the flames consumed it. For a moment, I felt relief. 
 
But the next morning, the letter was back. 
 
It sat on my kitchen counter, untouched and unburned. 
 
 
 
Over the next few weeks, my life unraveled. 
 
The letter followed me everywhere: my bedroom, my car, even the bathroom. I burned it, shredded it, even buried it in the woods. It always came back. 
 
Then the headaches started. A constant, throbbing pain that blurred my vision and made it impossible to think. 
 
And the weight—an unbearable pressure on my legs, growing heavier every day. By the sixth month, I could barely walk. 
 
I knew what it wanted. 
 
 
I knew that if I read the letter, I would end up like Rudy—trapped in a nightmare I couldn’t escape. But what other choice did I have? I’d been to the hospital countless times, talked to the doctors, begged for help, but nothing worked. They couldn’t understand, couldn’t explain why I felt like my life was slipping away, why the pressure in my legs was getting heavier with each passing day. Every time I tried to ignore it, the letter appeared again, as if it was calling to me, growing more suffocating. My legs were already numb, my thoughts fractured. Maybe reading it was the only way to understand what had happened to Rudy—to end this torment, whatever it was. In my mind, it was the only way forward. If I could just read it, maybe the pressure would stop. Maybe, just maybe, I'd find the answer that would make the pain end. I couldn’t bear the thought of staying trapped like this forever. 
 
I couldn’t have been more wrong. 
 
Finally, I gave in and read the letter. 
 
The paper felt brittle, like it would crumble in my hands. I unfolded it slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. 
 
Inside was a single letter: O. 
 
The ink was thick and black, written so many times it bled through the paper. 
 
I tried to stand, but my legs wouldn’t move. My body froze. 

The air grew heavier, thick with a presence I couldn’t explain. My legs felt like they were being crushed under a weight I couldn’t see. 

Now I understand.

The pressure was suffocating, as if something was holding me in place, keeping me from moving, from escaping. I tried to stand, but my body refused to obey. Every muscle screamed, but I couldn’t break free. I could feel the fear swelling inside me, rising in my chest like an unstoppable tide.

Now I understand.

The suffocating weight on my legs grew unbearable. It wasn’t just pressure—it was something alive, something that didn’t belong. My legs were pinned down, as if something was anchoring them to the ground.
 
Now I understand.
 
I remembered what Rudy had said in the hospital: "They’re here. They won’t let me go." 

Now, I finally understand why Rudy can’t move his legs. With these demonic faces, nobody would be able to move.
