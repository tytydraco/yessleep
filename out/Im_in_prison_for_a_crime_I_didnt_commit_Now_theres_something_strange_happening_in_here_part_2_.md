[I woke up](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dcma26/im_in_prison_for_a_crime_i_didnt_commit_now/) this morning hoping the recent events were simply a strange dream, perhaps some medication induced imaginings. but my elusive cellmate is still gone and the few people I asked again today seemed unaware of his existence or unwilling to talk about him. I gave up asking rather quickly as it was clearly a pointless endeavour. All I wanted to do now was to get to that spot again and confirm to myself that what I saw was actually real. I couldn't stop thinking about it, every time I blinked the image of that man in that cell appeared to me as vividly as when I first saw him. It was like he had burned himself into my minds eye. But, I couldn't make out any exact details of his face, I only just realised that. He seemed blank, no discerning features stood out at the time or now in my recollection. Whether it was because I was too far away to make out any details or for some other reason, I'm not sure. 

I finally managed to get to the spot again. The chair was empty and the surrounding area was too, as if everyone was still repelled by it even though my cellmate clearly wasn't there. I walked over to the chair slowly and sat down. Strangely, it took me a while to look up, I just stared at my feet. It was like I didn't want to confront it, whether out of fear or worry that nothing would appear at all. Seeing his face again suddenly terrified me but the thought that it was all imagined didn't fill me with much joy either. Finally I got the courage to look and what I saw was the last thing I had imagined. I saw... nothing. And by nothing, I don't mean that I saw just an empty cell, I mean that the cell was not there at all. It was simply an extension of the white prison wall, as if the cell was either swallowed up by the prison itself or had never existed in the first place. It was clearly not a mistake with my spatial awareness, I hadn't got confused with where I was looking. I remembered the cell number my cellmate had mentioned and it was no longer there. The numbers ended at 11. 

After sitting in a bemused state for a while I eventually made my way up the stairs towards the cell, or the location where the cell used to be. The wall was hard, clearly not a facade. It had been there a while. It was slightly cracked in places and had the same worn look that the rest of the place had. I banged on it with my knuckle to see if it was hollow but the sound of bone against thick stone was all that could be heard. I went to cell 11 and asked the guy in there about the cell next door. He looked at me like I was insane and clearly didn't want to talk to me about it. As I turned to leave he said "your ears bleeding you know" and lo and behold it was. I hadn't noticed before. It wasn't a lot and I assumed it was from my head injury. The thought occurred to me that maybe I had entered some state of delirium caused by my skull smacking against the ground; my memories now confused with dreams and my present situation simply a living nightmare. but this whole situation was too complex and preexistent to be the work of a head injury, everything that happened and is still happening, is real. I know it is. 

As I was rubbing the blood between my fingers that I just wiped from my ear I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the man from yesterday, his contorted face between the rusted bars, was there once again. I turned slowly to face him, expecting any moment that he would vanish into thin air and that prison wall would appear again, but he stayed and so did the cell. It was there, in front of me and I could see him clearly now. I didn't recognise him and he seemed much older than I initally gauged. He was withered and gaunt, thin white hair fell down his face and blended in with his scraggly beard. His mouth was agape as if he was trying to say something. I moved closer and began to hear a faint whisper coming from his mouth. The words became clearer and clearer. "Time" I heard him say. "Your time" what was he saying? "Your time is nearly up". He croaked out those last words and said them once more. He looked at me, his eyes were black, empty, it was like staring into the darkness you see when you close your eyes. I couldn't look away. 

"what are you doing up here?" The words didn't come from his mouth. "I'm talking to you" a loud bang followed those words, like a rod hitting a metal beam and it made me jolt. I blinked for the first time in a while and within that momentary closure of my eyelids the cell had gone. The wall was back. I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned to see one of the guards. "What are you doing up here? This areas off limits" i frowned and asked him what he was talking about. It was then I noticed that the cell next door was gone too, in fact, there were no cells on this floor anymore. The oppressive white walls encompassed everything, there were no hollowed out cells that contained or were waiting to contain living souls, it was instead a floor containing nothing. "I... I don't know" I responded to him. He didn't say anything and simply walked me down to my cell. 

And here I am now, writing this. I woke up this morning hoping to solve this mystery and now I'm more confused and scared than before. I'm genuinely scared. I don't know what's happening in here, or what's happening to me. What will tomorrow bring?
