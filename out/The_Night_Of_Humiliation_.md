The Night Of Humiliation

I changed his bright yellow button which was looking odd on his blue T-shirt. I sat down waiting for Arya to come downstairs. 
Bleep-bleep. 
I darted to get my left seat in the car. Mr. Clap was looking cultured after his makeover. 

"Should we leave without you?", said my dad honking for the third time. 

"Shift from here weirdo, why can't you stay at your place?" 
I hate my sister for obvious reasons. The most obvious being she is elder and I have no power over her. 
"Also take your rubbish doll from my seat, go to the backseat and take this doll with you." 

The journey was long one passing through two city parks and one village. I adjusted his bow and tilted his cap he looked more annoyed now, which he should be after so much of insult he has to hear from my family on a daily basis. 
Our car stopped under a huge tree's shade. I got down from the car only to feel the hot sand beneath me. 
My dad left our footwear in the car saying, "If you loose this time I won't buy you new shoes Arya, so better keep it inside the car." 

I decided to make a sand castle with Sammy. I began to collect the sand in a fun-sized bucket. My skin would have tanned till now if not for the sunscreen. 
I rushed with my bucket when I saw Arya enjoying with dad who by the way was teaching her to swim in shallow water. As such the area beyond that was restricted so shallow water is all we get to try. 

Where did I leave Sammy? He was right here when I left him. 

I hurried searching for my mom who was on the nearest bench. 
"Where's my..." 

Cutting me short she said, "I can't wash your doll daily so I kept it in the car. Go ask your dad to teach you swimming look at Arya she is learning very fast." 
Fast did she learn not to swim but to be less intelligent than I am or should I say dumb. 
I wondered why she always acted as if she was better than me. She was not
She certainly cannot be. 

I sat there silently with no one to play. Sunset would have been wonderful if I had Sammy with me. 

We reached our car and what I saw was pretty obvious Sammy had cried so much that his face turned red. I saw the last tear rolling through his cheek. 
No one would believe me. No one ever did. 

That night I somehow managed to let Sammy sleep with me. He needed someone to console him for today's incident which was totally unfair. 
"Why do you think they hate us?", I asked without even looking at his face. 

My mom said I never behaved like the boys of my age. I finished my graduation and ranked first in my college. What more could you expect. They always had problem with my Sammy. Arya had. Dad and mom had too. 

I woke up in a puddle of sweat. I had a horrible nightmare. I did. 
Sammy somehow managed to sneak out of the bed at midnight. I followed him till staircase. Black out. I didn't see or feel anything. 
What I saw next was horrifying. 
Stabbing my sister Arya he had a grin over his face. 
"She won't humiliate you. Ever.", said Sammy which was quite justified after what she had done today. 
Blood was slowly trickling beneath my feet which, surprisingly felt good, I enjoyed even.

Dad was lying just beside Arya as usual they are inseparable. His head twisted to the far right and his face mutilated. His eyes were still looking at her, though his one eye was gouged out with a chisel. I wish Sammy did that to the other eye too. 
Mom was nowhere to be found. 

"Calm down ma'am, we will take on this from here", said a guy who obviously was some kind of authority figure. A police maybe but I am not sure, without my glasses I can see nothing.

Last time I saw my mom was 14 years ago. I am sure she never missed me, if she did she would have come to meet me atleast once. I hope Sammy is safe with her. 

"Patient number 20034, wherever you are stay right there and don't move." came an aggressive voice from the speaker. 
I have to reach before Sammy gets into trouble. 

"The boy who killed his father and sister mercilessly was taken into an asylum today. After yesterday's homicide the neighbours are terrified to get out of their house. Fearing that Darshan will somehow escape and come back. Escape he did and coming back we are not sure about. All live coverages with cameraman Satish Solanki only on India TV. "

I found Sammy. He smiled. Pointing his finger towards our house. I forgot that Sammy had some unfinished task. 
" He is here. He is here. He... "
Sammy was good doll with some bad habits.
