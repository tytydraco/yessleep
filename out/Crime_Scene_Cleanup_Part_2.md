Porcelain Smiles

I’ve seen blood. I’ve seen bodies in every state imaginable. But the worst thing about crime scene cleanup isn’t what you see, it’s what stays with you. 

This one, though, this one was different. It wasn’t just the blood. It was the dolls.

The call came in just after dawn. "Whole family dead," the dispatcher said. "It’s... a standard cleanup." No other details. Just a quiet pause before they hung up, like they didn’t want to say more.

The house was tucked into a quiet cul-de-sac, the kind of place where bad things aren’t supposed to happen. 

The kind of place where kids run lemonade stands, not forensic tape.

And mops are for spilled cocoa. Not the family's life blood.

The afore referenced police tape fluttered in the breeze, and the front door stood wide open. An officer waved me through, his face pale and tight. He didn’t make eye contact.

Inside, the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy. There was blood everywhere, but no sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle beyond the horror painted on the walls.

I stepped into the living room and stopped cold.

Dolls.

Hundreds of them. Porcelain, plastic, ragged cloth. Every shelf, every corner, every surface was crammed with them. See, you would think only porcelain, right? Isn't that what people usually imagine? Or maybe that Ragedy Ann doll that sits in a demonologist's museum. 

Not some blonde haired, naked fashion doll with one pink shoe. 

And they were all looking at me.

I know how this sounds. Dolls don’t look at people. But these did. Their eyes, glassy, painted, hollow, followed me as I moved through the room. And they weren’t just sitting there. They were arranged.

On the couch, a pristine porcelain doll in a frilly white dress sat upright, a rust-colored stain across her tiny hands. Beside her, a rag doll with button eyes held a butcher knife, its blade crusted with dried blood. In the corner, a plastic baby doll lay on its back, its mouth twisted into a wide, unnatural grin, its fingers clutching a pair of scissors. That fashion doll had a very long sharp needle. I actually think they might be called "doll needles". How's that for irony?

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. There were no fingerprints. No footprints. Just... dolls.

I set my kit down and tried to shake it off. Maybe it was some kind of sick joke. Maybe the killer wanted to mess with the cops, with anyone who came in here.

I started with the walls, scrubbing away the blood patterns that smeared in jagged arcs. As I worked, the house settled into an eerie silence. Too quiet.

I tried to focus, but every time I glanced up, I swore something was different. The dolls seemed closer. Their positions shifting just enough to make me second-guess myself.

Then I heard it.

A soft rustling. Like fabric brushing against fabric.

I turned sharply. Nothing moved. The room was exactly as it had been—except for one thing.

The porcelain doll on the couch. Her head was tilted now, just slightly. Her painted eyes seemed wider, more focused.

I backed away slowly, my heart hammering. I told myself it was nothing. A trick of the light. My imagination.

But then it happened again.

A faint, childlike giggle. High-pitched. Hollow.

I spun around. The room was empty except for the dolls.

“Stop it,” I muttered, my voice cracking.

The giggle came again, this time closer.

I grabbed my cleaning supplies and stepped toward the door. But before I could leave, I heard a soft clink.

I looked down.

The porcelain doll’s hand was resting on the butcher knife, the blade gleaming under the dim light. I hadn’t touched it. No one had.

The giggling swelled, overlapping whispers filling the room. The words were indistinct, but the tone was clear: mocking, taunting.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, gripping the nearest object, a mop handle, as if it could protect me.

Well, hell. The cleaning spray had saved me on that Cherry Lane job.

Silence. Then, a whisper. Clear. Close.

“Stay and play.”

I ran.

Out the front door, across the lawn, not stopping until I reached my van. My chest heaved, my hands shaking. I didn’t care about my kit. I didn’t care about protocol.

I started to drive away, but I NEED this job. So I taped up my pants legs with several layers of duct tape, hoping that would offer some protection. Just how how high could those damned dolls reach anyway? And how deep could they cut?

And then I got inspired. If regular kids like cartoons about frogs and princesses, maybe these creepy assholes could be distracted by something more their speed.

I spent the next half hour eating lunch and downloading a couple of movies with creepy dolls as the theme.

I metaphorically pulled on my big girl panties and marched back in there.

One of those creepy things had my bottle of cleaner. The good stuff.

Absolutely not. I'm not having MY pay docked because some baby doll with ink on its forehead wants to play exorcist. 

I sat up my laptop and turned on the movies. In the sternest, strongest mom voice I could muster under the circumstances, I told them "I have to clean up the mess you made. Watch your movies while I do that and no funny business."

No idea if my tone or my movies worked. Or hell, maybe I was cracking under the pressure and nothing had happened at all (yeah right, standard cleanup my ass). But I got that whole place cleaned up before those movies were done, grabbed my kit and got the hell out of there.

The dolls just sat and watched me.

Those dolls weren’t just sitting there.

And they weren’t finished.
