Ray, Russell, Xavier, Connie and I were driving down a dark and desolate road on a rainy night. The raindrops were pounding against the roof of the car, creating an eerie symphony of sounds that seemed to echo throughout the vehicle. The headlights illuminated the road ahead, but the darkness beyond the beams seemed to go on forever. As we drove deeper into the night, I felt a creeping sense of unease begin to settle in. The rain was making it difficult to see the road clearly, and the wind was howling through the trees, creating an unsettling atmosphere. Suddenly, the car sputtered and came to a stop. We all looked at each other in disbelief, wondering what had happened.Russell tried to turn the engine over, but it wouldn't start. "Looks like we're stuck here," Xavier said, an unusual note of worry in his voice.

We all got out of the car, huddling together in the rain as we tried to figure out what to do next. As we stood there, we heard a strange sound in the distance - a low, guttural growl that seemed to come from the darkness beyond the road.We all froze, looking at each other with growing unease. Ray spoke up first. "What the hell was that?" They asked. "I don't know," I replied, my heart racing in my chest. "But we need to get back in the car and lock the doors." We hurried back to the car and scrambled inside, locking the doors and rolling up the windows. But the growling continued, growing louder and more menacing with each passing moment. Suddenly, there was a loud thud on the roof of the car, and we all jumped in fear. I looked up, and through the rain, I could see a dark shape moving across the roof. "What the hell is that?" Russell shouted, his voice shaking with fear.

Before anyone could answer, the shape on the roof lunged at the windshield, cracking it with a sickening sound. We all screamed and huddled together in the back seat as the creature continued to attack the car. We were trapped, with no way to escape the horror that was unfolding around us. As the rain continued to fall and the creature continued to attack, I knew that this night would be one that would haunt me forever.

Before we started driving down that dark and desolate road on that rainy night, Ray had suggested that we take a shortcut through the woods. They had heard about it from a friend andclaimed it would cut our driving time in half. I was sceptical at first, but Russell and Xavierwere all for it, so I reluctantly agreed. We turned off the main road and onto a narrow dirtpath that wound through the trees. The rain was already starting to fall, but we pressed on,thinking we could make it through before it got too bad.

That's when we started to hear the strange noises - rustling in the bushes, footsteps crunching on the wet ground. We tried to ignore it, chalking it up to our imaginations, but the noises grew louder and more persistent. Then, suddenly, we saw it - a figure looming in the darkness ahead of us.It was too dark to make out any features, but it was definitely humanoid and seemed to be watching us. We all froze, not knowing what to do. That's when the figure started moving towards us, slowly at first, then picking up speed. We turned and ran back towards the car, but it was too late - the figure had caught up to us and attacked.

We fought back as best we could, but it was like fighting against a force of nature. The figure was too strong, too fast, and seemed to be immune to our blows. It wasn't until Ray managed to grab a large branch and strike the figure across the head that it finally retreated into the darkness. We all breathed a sigh of relief and piled back into the car, shaken but alive. We should have turned back then, but for some reason, we decided to press on. And that's how we found ourselves stranded on that dark and desolate road, with the creature still out there somewhere, waiting for us.

\*\*\*

As we drove down that dark and desolate road, we were all on edge after the encounter with the mysterious figure in the woods. But things only got worse from there. Russell, who had been quiet since the attack, suddenly turned on us. His eyes glowed with an otherworldly light, and he began muttering strange incantations under his breath. We didn't know what was happening, but we knew it wasn't good. Then, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at us. Fear coursed through my veins as I realized that we were all in danger. But just as Russell was about to pull the trigger, Connie, my partner, jumped into action. With a strength I had never seen before, they tackled Russell to the ground and disarmed him. But the figure wasn't done yet. It began to possess Russell even more fully, its otherworldly abilities taking hold of his mind and body. Connie and I fought back as best we could, but it was like trying to stop a force of nature.

Russell, or whatever was controlling him, seemed to be too powerful for us. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, the figure suddenly released its hold on Russell and retreated into the darkness. We were all shaken, but thankfully, we were alive. And it was all thanks to Connie's quick thinking and bravery. As we continued down the road, I couldn't help but think about how lucky I was to have them by my side.

As we continued down the dark and desolate road, a new feeling of unease settled in the pit of my stomach. Despite the danger we had just narrowly escaped, there was a sense that something even worse was coming. I glanced up at the rear-view mirror and my heart nearly stopped at what I saw. Connie's eyes, which had always been a warm hazel, were now glowing with an otherworldly light, just like the figure's eyes had before. "Babe, what's happening to you?" I whispered, my voice barely above a whisper. But Connie didn't answer.Instead, their body began to shake and convulse as if they were fighting against some unseen force. The car swerved on the road, and I struggled to keep it under control as I tried to help Connie. But just as it seemed like all was lost, Xavier, who had been sitting in the back seat, jumped into action.

With a strength that belied his small stature, he lunged forward and grabbed Connie by the shoulders, pulling him away from the driver's seat. "Get out of the car!" Xavier shouted, a she opened the door and shoved Connie out onto the road. "We need to get away from them!" We scrambled out of the car and ran as fast as we could down the road, the rain pouring down on us in sheets. Behind us, we could hear Connie screaming, their voice distorted by whatever was possessing them. Eventually, we came across an abandoned gas station, and we huddled inside, trying to catch our breath and figure out what to do next. I was grateful to Xavier for saving me from the possessed Connie, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something even more sinister was lurking just out of sight, waiting for its next victim. Despite the fear and uncertainty that plagued me, I couldn't leave Connie to face the unknown alone. Without a second thought, I turned around and ran back towards the possessed figure and my partner. Xavier and Ray called out for me to come back, but their voices were drowned out by the pounding of my heart and the sound of the rain. I knew they were right to be afraid, but I couldn't leave my partner behind. Not when I loved them so deeply.

As I approached Connie, I could see that their body was wracked with spasms, and their eyes were still glowing with an otherworldly light. When I reached out to touch them, something strange happened. The figure possessing them seemed to falter, as if confused by my presence. For a moment, I thought that I might be able to help them, to free them from whatever was controlling them. But before I could do anything, a deep, guttural growl filled the air, and the figure turned to face me. Its eyes burned with an intense, malevolent light, and I could feel a wave of cold dread wash over me. I tried to back away, but it was too late. The figure lunged forward, its claws extended, and I felt a searing pain as they dug into my flesh. For a moment, everything went black, and I was certain that I was going to die. But then, I heard a voice calling out my name, and suddenly, the figure was gone.

When I opened my eyes, I saw Connie kneeling beside me, their face twisted with worry.Behind them, Xavier and Ray stood, their expressions a mix of relief and concern. "Are you okay?" Connie asked, their voice shaking. "What happened?" I struggled to sit up, wincing as I touched the wound on my arm. It was deep and ugly, but already starting to heal. "I don't know," I said, my voice unable to be above a whisper. "But we need to get out of here. Now."Connie helped me to my feet, and we embraced tightly, ‘I love you’, we said to each other.

As we continued down the road, the rain began to lessen, and the clouds above us cleared. The moonlight shone down on us, casting eerie shadows across the landscape. Suddenly, we came across the source of all our troubles. It stood before us, a massive, imposing figure, with a deep, rumbling voice that seemed to shake the very earth beneath our feet. I knew then that I had to confront it, to put an end to its reign of terror. So, without a second thought, I stepped forward, my heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination.

But just as I was about to speak, the figure vanished, leaving nothing but the sound of its laughter echoing through the night. I turned back to my friends, my face a mask of confusion and frustration. "What the hell was that?" I asked, my voice trembling. But there was no answer.Only silence, broken only by the sound of the rain and the distant howl of the wind. My friends had disappeared.

In that moment, I knew that my troubles were far from over. The figure had eluded me once again, and I could only wonder what other horrors lay in store for us in the darkness ahead.With a deep breath, I stepped forward, my eyes fixed on the spot where the figure had been only moments before. I was determined to put an end to this once and for all. In the back of my mind, my friends called out to me, pleading with me to reconsider, to wait for backup, but I knew that there was no time to waste. The longer I waited, the more innocent lives could be lost. As I approached the spot where the figure had been, I could feel a chill run down my spine. I knew that this was it - the moment of truth.

With a sudden burst of courage, I shouted out into the darkness, daring the figure to show itself, to face me in combat. But there was no answer. Only the sound of my own heartbeat, pounding in my chest like a war drum. And then, out of the shadows, it emerged. A massive, twisted creature, with glowing eyes that seemed to stare right through me. Without hesitation, I launched myself forward, my fists flying as I struck at the creature with all my might, then, darkness.

I woke up in a hospital bed, my body battered and bruised, with no memory of how I got there. My friends were all there, looking at me with concern and relief. But there was something in their eyes - a hint of fear and uncertainty that I couldn't quite place. As the days passed, I struggled to piece together what had happened, but the memories remained elusive All I knew was that something terrible had happened that night, something that I could never forget.And as I lay there, recovering from my injuries, I knew that the darkness was still out there, waiting for its chance to strike once again. And I could only hope that we would be ready when it did.

\*\*\*

As I sat at the party surrounded by my friends, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. I thad been a year since that fateful night, and although we had all moved on with our lives, I could never shake the feeling that something was still not right. I was chatting with Russell, and then Ray came up to me and asked if we could chat privately. Nothing too out of the ordinary for them. As Ray and I spoke about everything we’d missed in each other’s life since we last caught up, they asked me a question, which slightly took me aback. They asked if I would be interested in going back to the forest where that fateful night had happened. I responded with a mix of anger and confusion. "Why the hell would you ever want to go back there?" They replied, "I want to be where I’m strongest." Confused, I asked, "Strongest? What does that mean?"

Ray turned to me chuckling, and, as our eyes met, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

Their eyes were glowing, just like the otherworldly creature's eyes had so many years ago.
