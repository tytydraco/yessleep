I didn’t think there were any standalone houses left in Manhattan. Yet there it was before me, a little cottage style home listed at $750,000. Hard to believe, but it was 2008 and the economic collapse had created a lot of fire sales. I could buy the place outright with the cash I had just inherited from my Grandma.

Deal! I moved in within two weeks of that fateful day. Life was kind. I was in my mid-20s living in New York and pioneering having a low effort remote job. It gave me plenty of time to set up the house, drink wine on the front porch and watch the city go by, and suffer through the earliest online dating sites. 

Everything was perfect. Until the night I heard the ghost tour go by the house. I didn’t catch it, just some passing words from a tour guide as she led people past my front yard. The phrase that stuck out to me was the guide saying in grandiose fashion, “it’s the last haunted house in Manhattan.”

I laughed it off. I wondered if there was some way I could make money off it. They couldn’t just walk by my house every night and talk about it for free, could they? I thought about harassing the tour guide. Then I thought better. I wanted to know what they were saying about my house. I figured out which tour it was and joined it.

The tour guide’s name was Oliver. A woman. She I think was like pre-steam punk with her vibe - top hat with goggles thing. 

My palms started to sweat when we got to my house. Oliver gave the intro to the “last haunted house in Manhattan.” She launched into a tale about how the house was built in the 1860s by a wealthy man named Chester who kept his concubine there - Amelia. 

Amelia loved the house money from Chester, but she did not love him, and had her own partner, Edward, who kept she secret from Chester. Chester eventually discovered Jack and gave Amelia an ultimatum. Lose Edward, or lose the house, and her allowance. 

It broke Amelia’s heart, but she chose Chester. Edward came in one night when Chester was there and killed him. He and Amelia panicked. Chester was never seen again. Amelia and Edward ran away and were never seen again. 

The story was Amelia and Edward killed Chester that night, chopped him up into little pieces, and put him into the walls of the house before they fled. Chester’s spirit weaved its way into the fabric of the structure and his anger and jealousy haunted the home. *Why do you think the little house remained in Manhattan surrounded by skyscrapers and parking garages? It had an energy which convinced everyone to never sell it or tear it down.* 

There was a specific evil in there though - Chester’s spirit and the house was known for making romantic partners of the owners die mysteriously, and horrifically. 

I cornered Oliver after the tour. She blushed and suddenly was introverted despite having just barked all over the city to a dozen people. Her shyness turned to fear when I told her I was the new owner of the “last haunted house in Manhattan.” 

“So is what you were saying actually true, or just for show?” I asked Olive as she started to slink away from me. 

“Isn’t it all for, just for show?” Oliver answered back and then excused herself. 

I would be lying if I didn’t say something didn’t tickle inside of me about what Oliver said about the house. I had struck up a relationship with a gentleman named BenFromBoston on a dating site - yes kids, we used to date on websites - and he was going to visit me from Boston for the first time soon.

I was hesitant about BenFromBoston. I had recently gone through a brutal breakup and online dating was a new, mysterious, and embarrassing frontier at the time. I had also become a recluse ever since moving into that house. It started slow but eventually I felt this incapacitating need to get back home whenever I left. 

I was worried Ben was going to be concerned and bored by me never wanting to leave home. I also worried I had become a pale freak and I was no longer socialized since I worked remote and never went anywhere. 

Too late to worry though. Ben was soon in my little house and we were getting closer. I couldn’t believe I found him online in 2008. He was too good to be online. He was too good for me. I was doing my insecure routine where I was trying to find reasons why I wasn’t good enough and needed to break up with him before I got even more attached and he left me heartbroken. 

Ben was able to stay the entire weekend. We were lying in bed on a sunny Sunday morning with everything feeling perfect with the world when Ben finally pried himself away so he could go take a shower. 

There’s something about lying in bed and listening to your partner shower. There was a magical glow inside me while Ben was in there, until 30 minutes went by and the water was still running, and steam coming out from the bottom of the door, and heat radiating out and no signs of life. 

“Ben?” I called out after a soft knock on the door. 

No answer. Panic started to set in. The smell. *What the fuck was that smell?* It was the worst thing I had ever smelled. It stung my nostrils before I was able to push the bathroom door open. 

I discovered the source of the smell as soon as I got into the bathroom. Ben had essentially been cooked inside my glass shower. Boiling hot water was steaming up the room and still rushing down onto his body, which laid limp and boiled in the bathtub full of water. 

-

It was an accident. A simple accident. That’s all it was. *Right?* 

You know the saying, fool me once? Fool me twice…
