MAKE SURE TO HAVE FUN WHILE READING RAHHHHH AND UH LEAVE YOUR THOUGHTS PLZ

**THE VOID THE VOID IS COMING-**

It started small; I was 6 when a cousin I'd never even met went missing. My family and I weren't huge into the details; we didn't even fully know him.

Next it was Fred, he was my estranged uncle, the black sheep of the family per say, he was in prison when he disappeared, the guards were doing their routine check when they found his bed empty, without a trace of existence left.

My grandparents vanished after him, their maid cam to their mansion for the day only for it to be empty, not even the dog remained.

We figured it was something,Â *inhuman*, something supernatural when I was 13.

It was an average family reunion, with children laughing, parents chatting when it happened, a scream pierced the house, coming from the nursery upstairs. What we saw terrified us, a huge gaping hall, the colour of shadows, an endless void a bottomless abyss, only my nephew could be saved, the rest of the children were never seen again.

Everyone in our family lay fearful, and that fear was reinforced when my aunty and her children were captured, my maternal side was wiped out but my mother, and my paternal side would soon be to follow.

I was 15 when everyone but me, my siblings, their kids and our parents disappeared. we'd discovered it got more reckless as the years passed resulting in the entire family gone in 9 years.

It had been a decade since the last incident had occurred and we thought maybe it had calmed down, maybe the void's hunger had been satiated, that was until my parents dissapeared.

It was a quiet stormy night when we got the news, and when my world turned upside down, i was in bed reading a book when i got the call

P:"STEVEN, STEVEN PLEASE YOU HAVE TO SAVE US"

M:"whats wrong"

P:"ITS HERE, GOD ITS HERE IT'S GONNA TAKE US, THE SCREAMS THE VOICES THEY ARE OVERWHELMING THE BUS, THE BUS"

M:"MUM JUST CALM DOWN"

P:"HEL-----"

M:"NO, NO NO NO NO"

This is when i knew my time was numbered, this is when i knew i was soon to come
