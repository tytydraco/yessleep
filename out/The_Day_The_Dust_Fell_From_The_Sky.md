I'd like to tell you a story about something  that happened in my town over 40 years ago.

The incident in question included a government cover-up and my town being virtually erased from all maps.

It all began on July 4th, 1982 during my town's annual Independence Day Parade.

Besides the sweltering heat, the day was like any other day with the whole town in attendance.

Although the parade was fun, the only thing on my 11-year-old mind was firecrackers.

Anyway, before I continue my story I'd like to tell you a little bit about my town.

Surrounded by dense forest, it is located near Lake Tahoe with a population of just over 1000.

It has one stop light, a post office, a grocery store, and several restaurants scattered throughout town.

It was a quaint little town where everybody knew everybody and where you could have safely raised a family.

It is also a pit stop for those venturing into Lake Tahoe.

Anyway, where was I?

Oh, I remember.

As the festivities were winding down and people were leaving, out of nowhere came this really loud boom which was followed by a bright flash of light from the nearby forest.

You can imagine the chaos that ensued as the state police began to descend upon my town, to investigate the mysterious boom.

Several days after the incident, I woke up to find a dust-like substance covering my whole town.

The dust-like substance had a very weird texture and a pungent odor too.

People who handled the mysterious dust began to fall ill.

So naturally, the theories began to swirl about the origin of the dust.

It was later speculated that the dust probably came from outer space. 

I forgot to mention it was around this time that some of the town's people began to change and eventually, become what we survivors called the Infected Ones.

No longer human, the Infected Ones are grotesque-looking creatures with multiple arms and eyes, covering their whole bodies much like Nemesis.

The dust was mutating them.

We also learned that the Infected Ones preferred to hunt at night and that if you are either bitten or scratched by one, you'll become one too.

Eventually, a group of scientists from around the world were brought in to study the Infected until they too were killed by the Infected Ones.

Even the military and CDC were brought in but to no avail.

Anyway, a large fence was placed around the perimeter of the town and the remaining survivors were placed under quarantine.

It was hard to see all of these people in Hazmat suits walking around town but what was even harder though, was seeing all the people you love, slowly change into some grotesque creature.

Anyway, over time we learned to adapt to our new way of life.

Since we're not allowed to leave, supplies are often flown in.

The supplies are then dropped off in a designated area that is located, in the center of town.

Sometimes, the noise of the plane stirs them up.

So, we always have to hurry.

They also somehow evolved and are much smarter...

Anyway, the reason for my story is to warn you...

Several days ago one of the Infected Ones managed to escape and now, everybody is in danger.

See, just one bite and the whole world is infected so please, please be prepared for the invasion...
