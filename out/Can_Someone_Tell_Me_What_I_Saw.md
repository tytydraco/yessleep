I was wide awake, I did not take any substances, I have no history of psychotic/hallucinogenic disorders, and I have been thinking about it ever since it's happened and I just want to know if I evoked something, if it was placebo, or there was something already there.

4 yrs ago, for context, in a relationship with a rather unpleasant and mentally tortured individual who had a fondness for alcohol, to put it simply. The apt they rented had grim history attached to it and they themself claimed to have an energy attached to them from years before we met, even had its screaming face tattooed on their forearm. Why? I don't know.

Every time I was alone in their house, strange things would happen. First, the cats kept meowing and staring up towards a far top corner in the bedroom towards the ceiling, trying to reach for something out of thin air with their paws. Then, I began to hear a voice calling my name, usually when I was in a vulnerable position like showering. It sounded just like my ex's voice, but every time I would go to check, nobody's there. Then I started to see things out of the corner of my eye, which I'm going to assume were shadow people, however I found it strange that they would come out in broad daylight. All of this happened when I was completely alone in his house, never when it was the two of us.

The Incident: Without giving too much triggering detail, the relationship was a nightmare at this point, I still ask myself why I didn't leave sooner. Mind games, stonewalling, gray-rocking, disassociation, all that good stuff. One night we're asleep and I wake up in the middle of the night fuming after our usual fights, shooting daggers at the sleeping body next to me. They, however, were experiencing sleep paralysis, which wouldn't be the first time and I felt no remorse nor did I feel a need to wake them up despite them calling my name in their sleep. As I sit there watching, I feel a very intense presence. I was anxious and intimidated but not outright afraid, I didn't feel that I was in danger.

I'm hit with a cold sweat accompanied by light-headedness, and when I look up, I see this large shadow looming over my ex, with the head in the shape of what looked like a horned owl but with the body of a man and a forked tail. It has its hands outstretched as if it were using my ex as one of those stringed puppets. I kind of just sit there watching it do it's thing and before it left, I thought I could make out some beady glowing eyes before just disappearing into the dark room.

Was it a guardian of some sort protecting me? Or was it the thing attached to him that's feeding off of him? Was it Goetic? Or have I just gone crazy?
