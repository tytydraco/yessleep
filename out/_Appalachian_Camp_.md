In the late 1990s, five deaths in the Appalachian Mountains remain unexplained. The media labeled it a "wild animal attack." But only one person knows the truth... and they lost their mind.

It all began in the winter of 1986.

A group of six young people set out early in the morning, and by the time they reached the snow-covered mountains, dusk was beginning to fall. The boys started a large campfire with dry branches they gathered, while the girls settled into a wooden cabin and began preparing dinner.

The cold was starting to show its teeth. But the night wouldn't just bring cold...

Dinner was eaten, tea was drunk, and laughter echoed. Then, as was the camp tradition, it was time for "scary story time." The first volunteer was the tall, dark-skinned young man in a blue jacket. He was the natural leader of the group. He stepped closer to the fire and began:

"Did you see something in the Appalachian Mountains? No, you didn't. Did you hear something? No, you didn't. Did someone call you? No, they didn’t. Just act like nothing's there."

As his voice echoed in the dark, no one breathed, except for the crackling of the fire.

"Years ago, on the mountain's peak, there lived a man. Alone, far from civilization. One day, the air was sharp with cold, just like tonight. The man was chopping wood in his yard when he heard a voice from the forest:

‘Daniel… Daniel…’

At first, he ignored it, but then he recognized the voice: his dead wife.

‘Daniel… help me… I’m here…’

He dropped his axe and ran toward the sound. The voice came closer with every step.

‘Mary!’ he shouted. But no reply came.

Just as he was about to turn back, he heard a rustling in the treetops. He looked up, and…

He saw it.

A tall, black-skinned creature with white eyes... half-wolf, half-something else.

Its skin looked like rough, burnt leather. Its eyes weren't human—they were deep, black pits that seemed to absorb all light.

Daniel screamed and ran, but the creature followed.

When he reached the door of his house, it grabbed him and dragged him to the ground… and right there… it tore out his intestines and decapitated him.

No one knows what that creature was."

At the end of the story, everyone fell silent. Though the young man in the blue jacket insisted it was just a legend, the blonde, innocent-looking girl – Rauna – was trembling in fear. After a couple more stories, the night grew deep, and everyone headed to the cabin to sleep.

Around midnight, Rauna was jolted awake by a sharp scream. Dazed and confused, she looked around the cabin. Then, another scream echoed, and everyone woke up. Rauna ran to the window.

What she saw… shattered her reality.

Outside, a creature with long black hair, bony protruding ribs, and bulging eyes was chasing her brother Mike.

Without thinking, Rauna rushed out of the cabin without even grabbing anything. She ran desperately to save her brother, but Mike was cornered by a rock. And then… the creature tore his throat out in one swift motion.

Rauna’s scream echoed across the land. Their eyes met. The only word that escaped Rauna's lips was:

“Shit…”

Tears streaming down her face, she began to run. The creature turned to follow her, but then it suddenly changed direction… heading back to the cabin. It tore apart each person inside, one by one.

Rauna hid in a hollow tree. She spent the entire night there, trembling and crying. By morning, she heard the distant sound of police sirens. She staggered out and ran toward the police cars.

When the officers saw her, the little girl collapsed into the snow, unconscious.

She woke up in the hospital. She was alive, but nothing would ever be the same. After that night, she received psychological support for a long time. Now, she lives alone in a small 1+1 apartment, without speaking to anyone.

The case remains unsolved. And the murders are still officially labeled "wild animal attacks."

THE END- HASAN AY
